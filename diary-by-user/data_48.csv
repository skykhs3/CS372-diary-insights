Gold Filled, Gold Vermeil, and Gold Plated are three different types of jewelry finishes that involve the application of a layer of gold onto a base metal. While they may appear similar at first glance, there are significant differences between them in terms of the thickness of the gold layer and the base metal used. Here’s a breakdown of each:
Gold Plated:
Gold plating involves depositing a very thin layer of gold onto a base metal surface, usually through electroplating. The thickness of the gold layer can vary but is typically around 0.5 microns or less. Gold plated jewelry tends to be more affordable but may wear off or tarnish over time, especially with frequent use or exposure to moisture.
Gold Filled:
Gold filled jewelry is made by bonding a thicker layer of gold to a base metal core using heat and pressure. The gold layer in gold filled jewelry is significantly thicker than that of gold plated jewelry. It must have a minimum gold content of 5% by weight, which is mechanically bonded to the base metal. The gold layer in gold filled jewelry is typically around 5% to 10% of the total weight. Gold filled jewelry is more durable and resistant to tarnish compared to gold plated jewelry, making it a higher-quality option.
 
Gold Vermeil:
Gold vermeil refers to a specific type of gold plating where a thicker layer of gold is applied to a base metal, typically sterling silver. To be classified as vermeil, the gold layer must have a minimum thickness of 2.5 microns and consist of at least 10 karats of gold. The base metal, in this case, is usually sterling silver, which adds to the durability and quality of the jewelry. Gold vermeil offers a higher gold content and durability than regular gold plating, making it a popular choice for those seeking a gold finish on silver jewelry.
In summary, the key differences lie in the thickness of the gold layer and the base metal used. Gold plated jewelry has the thinnest gold layer, followed by gold vermeil with a thicker layer on sterling silver, and gold filled with the thickest layer on a base metal core. As a result, gold filled and gold vermeil jewelry tend to be more durable and longer-lasting than gold plated jewelry.
