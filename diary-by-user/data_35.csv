Hello people. I am learning English. Honestly, it’s difficult for me, but I spend about 2-3 hours every day. This winter, I talked a lot with my friend from Canada, we played PC game together, and he spent a lot of time to teach me to speak in voice. Now I read children’s books (I can’t read more complex books) and I started the blog. Maybe it will help me with my purpose, because it’s practice to write texts.
