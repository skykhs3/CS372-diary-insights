**UPDATE 2022** Wow time has flown by. Kacey is now 17 and a senior in high school. He has had a rough time in school with his grades but thankfully hasn’t gotten himself in too much trouble. He got his first job last year at Dairy Queen but quit it not too long after getting it because there was a guy that thought he was a manager but he wasn’t. He got his driver’s license last year in November. He is thinking of going to a college in  Michigan to become a psychologist. He is gay and came out to me in middle school. We have our moments with each other but he’s a good kid.
 
My son is 4 years old. His name is Kacey. He drives me nuts a good portion of the time because he doesn’t listen and no matter what form of punishment we give him nothing seems to work. I’m at wit’s end. That is why my diary is titled “mom about to go crazy”. I think it’s a very appropriate title for my life. Don’t get me wrong I love my son very much but I really wish there was a outlet in our town where I can go to get some information on parenting items or something to help me cope. His preschool teacher thought that he might be ADHD and I’m really beginning to think she’s right.  As for the disclipine part which I spoke about earler I have done EVERYTHING to disclipine. We have tried taking toys, taking away privileges, putting him in time-out, spanking him which I hate to do and NOTHING seems to work. I feel like I have no where to turn to and sometimes I get so damn mad I wanna beat the tar out of him but I don’t.  He’s a extremly smart kid and I love him dearly.
 
I will putting a slideshow of him on here after 7 days lol.

**UPDATED 2022** We are now married. Been since November 2011. He went into the army reserves until 2018. He is now a school bus driver and owns his own martial arts school which he loves to do. He is still a pain in my butt and annoys me because he doesn’t get my health conditions but I love him dearly and don’t know what I would do without him. We are trying to get our shit together so we can get a house.

Then there is my fiancee Jesse. I love him very much. We have been together since our junior year of high school. We met as sophomores and dated for a little while. Then I made the worst decision of my life or one of the worse and cheated on him sexually with my ex bf Gene.  At the time Jesse wasn’t that great sexually and Gene was the one I lost my virginity to at 15 so I figured I would date Jesse and have sex with Gene. Boy did that one backfire. I felt so guilty that I told Jess about it and we mutually broke up. The most amazing thing was Jess remained my friend when most people would have said FUCK YOU leave me alone. So we remained friends and then on the 15th of February 1999 he took me out to eat at a place called Old Country Buffet in our town. I had gotten him something for Valentine’s Day but he didn’t get paid until the 15th so he told me he would make it up to me by taking me out to eat. Then while we were eating he said well since we spend so much time together why don’t we just start going back out and we have been together ever since.
 
He proposed to me at a festival in our town called “On the Waterfront” That was interesting. See his brother C.J. and my friend Tab went with us and so Tab and C.J. kept talking to each other and they HATE each other’s guts and they kept doing it around me so finally I was like “what are you guys saying about me” Of course they denied it and so I got mad and they finally gave in and told me that Jess was going to propose when the fireworks went off which was every night during the 3 day festival. So it’s about time for the fireworks to start and I have to pee. So I kept asking if we could run home real quick so I can go to the bathroom because I refuse to use port-a-potties. So at first he’s like no we have to wait for the fireworks and I’m like I gotta pee!!!! So the fireworks end up being late starting so we run home so I can go to the bathroom and end up coming back right before they start. So he pops the question and of course I said yes. That was in 01′ right after we got out of school. We haven’t gotten married yet because we are trying to get bills paid off and school done with before we do that.
 
He is the greatest guy I could ever ask for. He does the things that every woman doesn’t like  (doesn’t clean, doesn’t listen etc etc etc) but at least he respects me, doesn’t beat the crap out of me or call me names and supports me no matter what I want to do with my life. I’m not too keen on his choices sometimes because he wants to do all the dangerous jobs which worry me. He is a great dad too.

2,https://www.opendiary.com/m/torturedsoul_1/c-j-2-934210/,2009-07-05,C.J.,"
Now we get on to the crappy part of the family LOL. C.J. is Jess’s older brother. I refer to him as redneck because man he is the perfect example of one. He is almost 30 years old and still lives with their mom. He thinks he’s god’s gift to everything and that every woman wants him which is FAR from the truth. He doesn’t appear to bathe that often, his teeth are brown, he smokes and he’s just a jack ass. He has 2 kids. Timmy who lives up here where I live and is I believe 10 or 11 by now. Then there is Alex who is only 3 and lives way up in Wisconsin with his mom. C.J. sees neither one of them. He has excuses left and right and everyone is wrong but him. He is lazy beyond belief. Me and him have gotten into some good arguments over the years. He pays child support but that’s the extent of his ""fathering"".
"
3,https://www.opendiary.com/m/torturedsoul_1/marilyn-2-934211/,2009-07-05,Marilyn,"
Marilyn is my MIL. I can’t stand her for so many reasons. She tried to tell me how to raise my son and she has barely been around him and she did a horrible job raising her kids so she has no room to try to tell me how to raise my son. She is greedy beyond belief. I can think of 2 or 3 examples. First there is child support payments. My fiancee received $60 a week from his dad for child support. At the time Jess was living with his brother Russ and his mom was living somewhere else. She took most of his child support and used it for cigarettes and other b.s. instead of what it was supposed to be used for. Then there was a time when her friend Pam was thinking of letting Marilyn take her youngest son who had some kind of heart defect or something and she was going to pay her to take care of him. Well the money wasn’t going to be going for the son’s needs because Marilyn and C.J.’s second wife Michelle were planning on using the money to buy Michelle baby items before Alex was born. Thank god Pam decided against that one. 

Then there’s the living situation problem. C.J. still lives at home with mommy because Marilyn won’t cut the cord and let C.J. be on his own. She constantly defends him and won’ t let him speak for himself. So Jess has decided that he no longer wants anything to do with his half of the family. I say congrats to him because he used to bend over backwards to help his mom out but now I think he realizes that she’s never going to change.
"
4,https://www.opendiary.com/m/torturedsoul_1/neil-3-934212/,2009-07-05,Neil,"
Ok call me crazy but I’m going to write about Neil. Neil is one of Marilyn’s ex husbands. He is OBSESSED with her. He’s a freaky dude. I don’t really care for him and either does Jess. Marilyn and C.J. and his son Shawn all lived with Neil for a while. Every time they came up here Marilyn would talk about how she hated living with Neil and how he was abusive and would try to start fights with her over stupid stuff. So you would think that Marilyn would get smart and move into her own place. She ends up moving in with C.J. and his friend John and guess who gets invited to come stay with them? NEIL!!!! I’m thinking ok why would you let him come move in with you when you were just complaining about how horrible it was to live with him. Neil in my eyes is a coward. He treats everyone like crap and expects them to bow to him. Screw that!!! He’s a big part of the reason why his son Shawn has severe mental problems.
"
5,https://www.opendiary.com/m/torturedsoul_1/shawn-16-934213/,2009-07-05,Shawn,"
Shawn I love to death. He is another one of Jess’s older brothers. Neil is unfortunately his dad. Like I said in the previous entry Shawn has severe mental problems because of his dad. He has tried to kill him on numerous occasions. I don’t blame him for trying. Shawn is a great person but just has a problem adjusting to life. I kept trying to tell Marilyn to get rid of Neil to help Shawn but she obviously doesn’t care about the well being of her son because Neil is STILL living with them. Shawn reminds me of my brother who has mental problems.

6,https://www.opendiary.com/m/torturedsoul_1/russ-5-934214/,2009-07-05,Russ,"
Russ has some quirks that are annoying but when I think about how much he has done for Jess I can overlook the annoying quirks he has. Russ was the one that basically helped raise Jess. Russ had Jess move in with him when his mom decided to go move somewhere else with C.J. and Shawn and of course Neil. He has always tried to help us when we needed it and vice versa. He is the only brother out of that side of the family that seems to give a damn about my son. Marilyn doesn’t. It breaks my heart to know my son won’t get to spend time with his grandma but at least he has Russ who loves him to death and spoils him rotten. Russ lives in Wisconsin with his gf Jaime who is a awesome girl and loves Kacey just as much as Russ does.

7,https://www.opendiary.com/m/torturedsoul_1/joe-61-934215/,2009-07-05,Joe,"
**UPDATE 2022** As of this writing Joe is now in a state facility because he couldn’t behave himself in the Mosiac group home he was in. He hit a staff member with a chair and got himself arrested in November of last year. They had to keep him in jail because they had nowhere to put him. He just got put in a facility towards the end of February. When he was in jail he was housed in the medical ward so he wasn’t in the general population. I’m now his guardian.
 
Joe is my half brother. He is mentally handicapped and lives in a group home in our area called Mosiac. He was in a children’s home in our area called Rocvale Children’s home until he was 21. He started living there when he was 10 because my mom couldn’t handle him anymore and was worried about my safety. I was only 2 or 3 at the time. I remember the incident that got him put in the children’s home. My mom wouldn’t give him the remote control to the TV so he tried to punch her, she ducked and he ended up breaking a window so my mom had to call the police.
 
So after Rocvale when he was just about to be released he decided to injure a staff member and landed himself in a placed Singer which is a mental health institute. So he was there for a while until they were able to find him a new place which ended up being in Sycamore,IL. He was there for a while and was doing a really good job and then decided to terrorize his roommates by taking a door off the hinges and chasing them with it. So he got put in a hospital around that area for a little while and then they found a place for him in Freeport, IL. He again did well there for a while and then listened to his roommates who told him to flood the apartment. So after that he got shipped back to Rockford and had to stay in Singer for a while.
 
Then a group home called Dungarven took over and he stayed there for a number of years until they got closed by the state for lack of funding. So now he’s in a group  home called Mosiac. He has been doing pretty well there. Hopefully he continues to do well. He comes home every few weeks for visits. I remember when I was little how he used to protect me no matter what.

8,https://www.opendiary.com/m/torturedsoul_1/rob-56-934216/,2009-07-05,Rob,"
Rob is Jess and C.J.’s dad. He now is married to a lady named Karen. She’s pretty cool but is a big time neat freak. We were close with them for a while but lately we haven’t heard from them so not sure what is going on. We are tired of being the only ones to try to communicate so we aren’t going to anymore. Jess had a tough childhood with his dad. He used to drink and was quite abusive which Jess held against him for the longest time but I tried to get him to see that his dad has changed and is no longer the person he was. I told him at least your dad is there for you. For me my dad is dead to me because he has never been there for me through my life.

9,https://www.opendiary.com/m/torturedsoul_1/tab-4-934217/,2009-07-05,Tab,"
I met Tab through her brother Gene. I mentioned before that me and Gene dated for a while. Well Gene came up with the bright idea to have me spend the night at their house but of course he couldn’t ask his mom if I could spend the night with him so he introduced me to Tab and told his mom that I would be sleeping in Tab’s room. So for a while there I would spend the night in Tab’s room but go into Gene’s room  for a while and then go back to Tab’s room. After a while though me and Tab became really good friends and I started spending the weekends with her instead of Gene LOL. We used to do some crazy stuff. We all lived in the same housing project. There was a creek behind my apartment and we would go throw rocks in the creek or actually go in the creek and catch crawdads. We used to go bike riding at like 2 in the morning.
 
That was all the way back in 97 and we have been friends ever since. We have had our rough patches like any relationship but we got through them. She has always helped me and I try my best to help her too. She’s like a sister to me .  She recently moved to Springfield,IL so we don’t get to hang out as much but we still find time to talk to each other and try to get together whenever we can no matter the distance. She is definitely a true friend.

10,https://www.opendiary.com/m/torturedsoul_1/belinda-7-5149975/,2009-07-05,Belinda,"
**UPDATE 2022** Me and Belinda are no longer friends or at least not like we used to be. Her mom died of cancer a few years back and she unfortunately got her kids taken away from her for a while because their apartment was in bad condition. They were hoarders big time. Belinda tried to claim it was her mom but I think she is too. She still hasn’t gotten a job and still doesn’t drive and now is mooching off her husband’s family. It’s so sad to live your life and have nothing to show for it.
 
 
Me and Belinda met in middle school at Lincoln Middle School in 95?. We became good friends and remained all the way up until high school and even beyond that. We have had our tough times where we wanted to kill each other or got ticked off over dumb stuff but she is growing more every day. There are some things I wish she would do like getting her GED so she can get a good job some day in the future but she has to figure out her life for herself. I’ve told her before the only reason I kept trying to push her to do it is because I know she has a lot of potential and could do so much more with her life but everyone makes their own choices and as friends we just have to support their decisions and help them out when they need it. She has a beautiful lil girl named Anna who Kacey adores LOL. Me and Belinda definitely have a lot of fun when we do get a chance to get together. She is shy sometimes and stubborn too but who isn’t.

11,https://www.opendiary.com/m/torturedsoul_1/lil-michelle-pics-added-5149976/,2009-07-05,Lil Michelle *PICs ADDED*,"
**UPDATE 2022** Lil Michelle was in a very bad accident in July 30,2010. She was hit by a drunk driver going 90 . I’m sure further in the diary I have more details about that. She suffered a TBI because of the accident and had to relearn everything and quit her job. She did get rid of her shitty husband and found a great guy. Only bad thing was the great guy ended up passing away last year in December. He had a lot of health issues and they both knew he might pass away but she is lost without him and my heart truly hurts for her. We don’t talk super much but I do check in with her  here and there.
 
 
 
Me and Lil Michelle met in high school. Now we hang out quite a lot whenever we get a chance. We call her Lil Michelle because she is short and it’s much easier when we are together with our other friends LOL. We have a interesting relationship. We go for “road trips” as we call them. We get bored and just go for a drive and talk. We usually go out to a place around where we live called “Blood’s Point”. It ‘s supposed to be one of those haunted places but we haven’t had anything happen to us while we’ve been out there except for animals jumping out  in front of us. I think that’s why we are such good friends is we spend time together but not TOO much time. She has had a interesting time with her ex husband Allen. To me he’s a loser and she can do so much better. He cheated on her like every year and treated her like crap, barely kept a job etc. So hopefully she can get over him for good and move on to something better. She’s a great girl with so much spunk.

12,https://www.opendiary.com/m/torturedsoul_1/pat-update-5149977/,2009-07-05,Pat ***UPDATE****,"
I met Pat through Gene and Tab. She used to live across the street from them. Tab used to clean for her and our little group would go over there and spend the night to keep her company because her husband Randy is a truck driver and would sometimes be gone for quite a long time. We had so much fun over there. She would make the BEST cake ever. If the girls wanted to have a sleep over we would go over to Pat’s. I ended up working for her for a while as a P.A. She was involved in a motorcycle accident which according to her her ex husband set up to kill her. Her leg got badly injuried and she had a LOT of pain because of it so she tried to have reconstructive surgery done on it to help relieve some of the pain but she ended up getting gangrene in it and they had to amputate it. She was much happier after getting it amputated. Then her and her husband moved to West Virginia. I really miss her but we try to stay in touch one way or the other. She was like a mom to me in so many ways.
*****UPDATE July 14, 2011************
I just wanted to update and say that Pat passed away in August of 2009. I found out the news from my friend Tab. Pat basically died of a diabetic coma from what I understand. Tab felt really guilty because Pat had called her a few days before she passed away and Tab didn’t return her call until she found out that she passed away. I sure do miss Pat she was a awesome lady and very blunt. She didn’t hold back lol. R.I.P.

**UPDATE 2022**  Bear passed away in 2010 because of a infection in his paws which probably made him go septic. We tried our hardest to save him. My mom woke up and found him passed away. I miss him everyday!!!😥
 
Ok some people are probably gonna think I’m nuts for writing about my pets but I’m a HUGE animal lover and consider my pets a part of the family too. We got Bear from C.J. when they were living in a housing project in our city. Supposedly C.J. had gotten Bear from a friend of his that kept Bear locked in a room and never took him outside to go to the bathroom. So at first we were just keeping Bear for C.J. until we told C.J. if we were gonna be keeping Bear for him that he would have to pay us money for food and vet expenses. After that C.J. just gave him to us. Big surprise there. So we’ve had Bear ever since then which was in 98 or 99 I believe. He’s part border collie and not sure what the other part of him is. He’s a great dog.

14,https://www.opendiary.com/m/torturedsoul_1/buck-pic-added-5149979/,2009-07-05,Buck *pic added*,"
**UPDATE 2022** Buck passed away January 28th,2021. It’s been a year and man we miss him. He made it to be 15 years old. I’m tearing up just thinking about him. My husband took his death really hard. We had to put him to sleep but we were both there when he passed away. It’s so hard to lose them.
 
Buck we originally got for my mom as a guard dog because she had a incident where someone dressed as a police officer or animal control officer came to her door and wanted to look around her house to which she told the person no and called me about it so I told her to call the police department and animal control because supposedly the “officer” was looking for a white dog and wanted to search my mom’s house. So she called and both departments said they hadn’t dispatched anyone. So we got Buck from Noah’s ark but he proved to be a lil too hyper for my mom so she gave him to us. He is a dutch shepherd. According to Noah’s Ark Buck was abused and neglected.

Coco was originally Russ’s dog. Russ got Coco for his ex wife Nikki and her 3 kids. He kept her for quite a long time until he moved into a apartment that wouldn’t allow pets so we took her in for a long time until we moved out of my mom’s house and moved on our own. So then Marilyn took her for a while until they ended up moving in to a place that couldn’t have pets either so we ended up taking her back and have had her ever since. She is a great dog and very vocal when something isn’t going her way. She is shepherd, huskie and something else too.
 
**update 2022*Coco passed away I believe in 2011.

Squeaker is my cat. He is a big sweetie. He was born with a tail that was basically in the shape of a cinnamon bun instead of a regular tail. He was born in 02 . His mom named Precious we ended up having to give away when we lived in a different place because the landlords were throwing a fit because we had too many animals. He loves to snuggle with people and enjoys surprising people by jumping on their backs.
**update 2022* Squeaker passed away but I can’t remember the year. He was 15 and lived a good life.

Lily and Zorro are brother and sister. We got them from a stray cat with a limp who ended up finding us. She had 2 litters of kittens one of which produced Lily and Zorro along with 2 other kittens.

Baby and Shadow were another brother set we decided to keep. If I remember correctly they were from a cat we used to have named Cinnamon who we also had to give to animal control because of the evil landlords in our old house that we used to live in. Baby is still alive and kicking but unfortunately Shadow had to be put to sleep. One weekend we noticed that he kept getting sick but I thought it was just hairballs and he was still was eating and drinking. Then it got to the point where we noticed he wouldn’t use his back legs and just dragged himself around. At the time Russ was living wtih us so he was kind enough to give us his checkbook and take Shadow into the emergency clinic in our area. When we took him in the staff kept asking us if anyone had done anything to him which to me seemed like they were trying to say we abused him or something like that. I would NEVER abuse any of my animals so that pissed me off. In the end they basically told us we would probably have to put him to sleep because we couldn’t afford to have tests done on him. So that was how poor Shadow ended up having to be put to sleep.
**update 2022** Baby passed away but I can’t remember the year. He lived to be 15 too.

Leo came to us through the lady I work named Marjorie. Marjorie is a elderly lady that I work for as a P.A. or personal assistant. Well she had a cat named Sniff who ended up having to be put to sleep because she had a tumor under her tongue. So the same day she got Sniff put to sleep she wanted to go look for a new cat. I was a bit worried because I thought it was too soon to get one but I wasn’t about to argue with her so we ended up finding Leo and she took him home but because he was a kitten he was a tad too hyper for her so I decided to take him in.

My downstairs neighbor had 3 sister cats that she decided she didn’t want anymore so she basically threw them out of the house. So they were running wild for a little bit until my mom decided to take in one of the sisters and I put the other one in our basement because it was getting closer to winter time and I didn’t want her to freeze outside. The third sister we don’t know what happened to her. She just disappeared. I hope she was able to find a nice loving home. So anyway not too long after we put her in the basement we discovered she was pregnant. So after the kittens were born and ready to go we started finding homes for them and the mama. So a tiger striped female we found a home for. The people named her Akira. Then I was able to find a home for the 2 boys that we had who were orange tiger striped with a lady that lived in the buidling of a old boss who I worked for as a P.A. also. So then we had a calico kitten left who was going to be going to a lady my fiancee worked with but unfortunately her bf wouldn’t let her have one or something to that effect so by that time I had become attached to her anyway and Leo seemed to like her quite a lot too so we decided to keep her and named her Violet.
*update 2022* Violet passed away 2 weeks from Leo in 2019

I don’t know why but I’m getting nervous which is odd for me because I wasn’t that nervous when I started at Rasmussen. Maybe it’s because this program is going to be more hands on and they don’t have online courses. I had a few snags. My classes would be from 7:45-9:50 Mon through Thurs. and my mom is nice and takes my son on the weekends so basically if I took the 2 classes I was going to be taking my mom would be watching Kacey 7 days a week and I don’t want to do that to her. She deserves some days to herself and with her still working and having to get up REALLY early in the morning that would be tough on her. She’s going to be retiring at the end of this month. So for this quarter I’m only gonna take 1 class and then when the quarter is over in September we’ll all sit down and figure out how to do the next quarter. I also have to go get some scrubs  for school too. I found some cheap ones at family dollar but I’m gonna see if anywhere else has some cheap ones too. 
I also have to get a bookbag and some folders and supplies but other than that I think I’m ready. I have orientation next Thursday. So I’m excited and nervous at the same time.

22,https://www.opendiary.com/m/torturedsoul_1/timmy-came-to-visit-5149987/,2009-07-11,Timmy came to visit,"
So Timmy is over for the weekend. I think he actually gets annoyed by Kacey sometimes which is interesting because they act almost the same. Another scary realization is the fact that Timmy acts A LOT like his dad even though his dad barely sees him or talks to him. So he’s going home tomorrow but as far as I could tell he seemed to have a good time. 
I’m thinking of talking to Jess about having Timmy come over a weekend a month except for next month because Kacey will be seeing Timmy at his party and then that weekend his mom has plans. I miss having Timmy over. I really liked when we used to take him for the weekend which seems like SUCH a long time ago. I can’t believe he’s 9!!!!!! Where the hell did the time go. 
So that’s my excitement for this weekend. I need to find my camera and get the batteries charged and take some pics of Timmy and Kacey together so everyone can see how much he’s grown. I’m going to try and write every day.
Well I got some good news related to Kacey. When he went to the doctor last week for his kindergarten physicial they tested his lead again. I thought he had it tested last year but turns out the last time was in 07 so they tested it and I got the results back today and his lead level is at a 6. The normal range is between 0-9. When we first found out he had lead poisioning his level was at 14 then it went down to 11 after they installed the new windows and now it’s at a 6 so that’s really good news. Well gotta go straighten up the mess and try to get rid of more things.

Well Jess got a call today from his brother Russ who told us he is now engaged to his gf Jaime. She is a awesome chick and so easy to get along with. I hope things work out for her and him. I know his marriage to his ex wife Nikki didn’t go so well so hopefully things will work out in the long run. 
For me I really want to get married it’s just I guess I’m waiting for the right time to do it. Jess just thinks it’s because I don’t want to get married which isn’t the case at all. I love him very much and really do want to get married to him. It’s just I want to make sure that we can afford for us to be married. Because if we got married I would more than likely lose my LINK and without it we can’t afford groceries for a whole month. I don’t want to be on welfare my whole life but until I get a better paying job or Jess does we are kinda stuck on it because once we get married then I would have to add his income with mine and I’m pretty sure he makes way more than the limit. If I remember correctly he makes like 10 something an hour and he gets paid every week. 
So that’s my reason for not wanting to get married right now. I hope soon we will be able to get married until then I just have to deal with people asking me a zillion times when we are getting married.

24,https://www.opendiary.com/m/torturedsoul_1/need-advice-on-something-5149990/,2009-07-13,Need advice on something,"
Ok I have a situation of sorts that I need some advice on. It involves the girl named Candice. Me and her had a misunderstanding over something dumb or at least I think it was dumb so we stopped talking or I should say she stopped talking to me. Well I read her diary the other day and noticed that she had an entry about how her and her husband couldn’t afford to buy school supplies for her son so I decided to be generous and offer to buy some of the cheaper supplies for her. What does everyone think of that? I want to do it because I don’t want her son to have to go without school supplies and even though me and her aren’t getting along I want to do something nice for him even though a misunderstood comment was made about her son by me. See she had a episode with her hypoglycemia and so I told her to call 911 because no one was home with her except for her son. She’s not supposed to be home alone with him because she has problems with her knees so I sent her a text that said fuck your son but that was b.c my phone somehow cut off the message so that’s what it read to her to which the next text message after that I corrected it and said fuck the consequences of getting in trouble with your son your health is more important than worrying about getting trouble for being home alone with just your son. After that she stopped talking to me all together. So my question is should I try to buy her son school supplies or just forget it all together and let her figure it out for herself. 
"
25,https://www.opendiary.com/m/torturedsoul_1/orientation-79-5149991/,2009-07-15,Orientation,"
Well I had orientation tonight for school. It went pretty well. I’m still nervous about starting school again. I forgot to update about the situation that I needed advice on. I did buy Candice most of the school supplies and we wrote a few e-mails back and forth. I actually found out why exactly she isn’t my friend so that made it a little easier on me even though it still sucks that we aren’t friends but most of the people that commented made some good comments about drama and that kind of thing which she does bring a lot of to everyone. I’m not perfect and I know I made mistakes in the friendship too. She said I butted in to people’s problems which I’ll admit I’m horrible at it and I do do it. That I criticized people mainly my friend Belinda. I explained that the only reason I criticize Belinda so badly is because I know Belinda is such a smart girl and that I just wish she would be able to provide a better life for her and her daughter on her own but I have figured out that Belinda needs to learn for herself and no matter how much I nag her to get her life together and make something of her self ultimately it’s her choice whether to take the advice or not and I just need to stand by her side and help her when she needs it by listening and just being there for her. 
So yea I’ll admit the ending of the friendship wasn’t all her doing and I contributed to it too. So I guess I’m done with her which is kind of a relief. I won’t have to listen to her complaining about how they are so broke but they can go out and buy all the new releases for movies or because she won’t get rid of the net OR the fact that she has a cell phone when she has a home phone and shouldn’t have gotten the cell in the first place. That’s why they are so broke. But whatever (sorry had to get that out) just had to vent the final time on the all things that bugged me about her. 
Then there’s the fact her poor husband has to do EVERYTHING around their house (trailer). She claimed she helps with things but how can you really help when she can barely walk a few steps without her knees going out on her or she sits on the net all night. Then have the nerve to say your husband doesn’t spend much time with you. How can he when he has to do the housework, take care of your child, cook dinner. I would be exhausted too.  Plus the fact her poor son had to suffer from her not spending much time with him. He has speech problems and can barely talk. If she would have spent the time teaching him how to talk or reading to him I think he would be right where all the other kids are. So that’s my final bitching about her. Like I said I’m not perfect at being a mom. I do things that I’m not supposed to do like yell at him sometimes or spank him but at least he can talk well. As for the husband part of things me and my fiancee obviously aren’t married yet but we struggle with things just like everyone else. I get lazy some days and don’t feel like doing housework or I make my fiancee do most of the cleaning but we try to do equal chores or jobs around the house. The whole point of marriage is to work as a team and talk to each other. So anyway DONE on that subject. 
"
26,https://www.opendiary.com/m/torturedsoul_1/school-supplie-fiasco-5149992/,2009-07-18,school supplie fiasco,"
So I finally get the guts to go drop off the school supplies to the Candice chick. I enclosed a interesting letter on how I felt about her. When I got home I e-mailed her to let her know they were on her steps. Then I found out that she went out and bought school supplies anyway instead of e-mailing me and asking me when I was going to bring them over. So I went out of my way to buy the supplies for her having to use our change to buy it in the first place because I didn’t even have enough money at the time to buy my son school supplies and she does that shit to me. If she didn’t want my help she should have opened up her mouth and said she didn’t want it. I would have understood. So she got mad about the letter I wrote to her. I e-mailed her about getting the supplies back. Maybe I can find someone who doesn’t have supplies and give them to them or something. 
So I said my piece and she wrote an entry basically replying to the letter claiming she’s not the same person blah blah blah. Basically saying we haven’t been friends in a while which is basically the truth. We enjoyed each other’s company when we actually got together but other than that we weren’t close like me and my friend Tab are and probably never would be. Too much things from the past kept popping up and to a point too much of me to let go of. I did try not to let it get to me and I know I have a REAL bad habit of bringing things up from the past and with Candice things just never seemed to change. She was never really there for me when I needed someone. Yea when me and my fiancee had some problems her and Belinda came over to hang out with me but that was the one and only time she’s even been to my house. So now it’s time for both of us to move on and worry about our own problems, faults and lives. I do hope her life gets better and she becomes happy with herself, her kids, her husband and her life.

27,https://www.opendiary.com/m/torturedsoul_1/first-day-of-school-232-5149993/,2009-07-20,First day of school,"
Well tonight was my first night of classes. I had College career skills from 5:30 to like 6 something because we had a sub so we got out really early. Then I had quantitve skills 2 which is just a fancy name for Math from 7:15 to like almost 9 so that’s pretty cool. We just did some practice problems on fractions and we kinda got acquainted with each other. The math class is pretty cool because we have no homework, no midterm exam and no finals and for our quizzes we can work on it with a partner so that’s awesome especially since I hate Math. It’s somewhat easier to grasp now then it was in high school but I still hate it. 
So that was my first day. It wasn’t horribly bad. I was all nervous for basically no reason LOL. 
We figured out the schedule for my classes too. I only go Tuesdays and Thursdays instead of one class being Mondays and Wednesdays and the other one being Tuesdays and Thursdays so that makes me it much easier on my mom because she would only have to watch Kacey for like an hour and a half on Tuesdays because that’s when Jess has off and Thursdays she would have to watch him the whole time but it’s still much better than ALL week having to watch him.
"
28,https://www.opendiary.com/m/torturedsoul_1/school-892-5149994/,2009-07-22,school,"
Well just wanted to write that school isn’t that bad. My career skills teacher was there tonight and class didn’t seem that long. For our math class our teacher is really cool and lets us work on our quizzes that we have to take every Thursday with a partner. Me and my partner Lisa got a 80% which isn’t too bad. We only got 2 wrong. 
Other than that went to my mom’s retirement party today. It’s so weird to picture my mom being retired. She got a really nice blender that crushes ice so we can make snow cones and it has a food processor attachment to it too. She also got a few other things and some money. Next week is her birthday and I got her a collage frame and so now I have to find pics to put it in which I’m sure I’ll be able to do. Kacey got her Air Buds DVD. So hopefully she’ll like her presents and I plan to bake her a cake next Wedsnesday. Well that’s my update for now.
"
29,https://www.opendiary.com/m/torturedsoul_1/forgot-to-mention-75-5149995/,2009-07-23,Forgot to mention,"
For my regulars lol you know I wrote a interesting letter to my in-laws a few months back basically saying some things that annoyed us about them. So I check my phone today and there’s a voicemail from my MIL saying how they are going to be having a family picnic on August 17th which is a Monday. They wanted us to go with. So I made Jess call them back to basically tell them we aren’t coming and to find out what was going on for Kacey’s b-day party. 
So he calls her back and she does the same thing she does all the time claim they aren’t gonna be able to come up for Kacey’s birthday party because their van isn’t working. So my two questions are if that’s the case then how is C.J. coming up here to Rockford on the 1st of August to get Timmy to bring him down to their house. I’m tempted to call Louise and ask her to tell me what they come to pick him up in. I know John who is C.J’s “friend” has a truck. Then there is the problem of how are they going to get to the family picnic if their van is supposedly not working. 
Then his mom proceeded to say the letter we sent them was not called for. HELLO it seemed to help C.J. with his phone manners. I called him I think it was last month to let him know Timmy’s new house number so he wouldn’t have any excuses as to why he didn’t contact his son and he actually said “Thank you” and didn’t go on about stupid crap like he usually does. I swear I almost fell out of my chair after hearing him say that. So that letter must have done some good somewhere. So Jess was talking about calling Louise about getting Timmy in his martial arts school so maybe I can have him ask Louise to keep a look out for what vehicle they show up in to come get Timmy. 
If it turns out that they lied to us I’m gonna call that lying bitch up and basically tell her don’t bother to call us anymore and that she obviously doesn’t give a shit about her grandson. I’m glad some part of the family gives a rat’s ass about my son. I just want my son to be able to know his family but I’m not putting up with people who don’t see him, don’t send him cards for his b-day, don’t write him and then show up and say “hey how is Kacey” when they don’t give a care and only wanna make it look like they do. I don’t care for Michelle but I im her or e-mail her to find out how my nephew is doing. Timmy I sent him a letter not too long ago with pics and gave him our number because I’ve been around Timmy since he was born or very shortly after that and I do care what happens to him. It just sucks we can’t spend as much time with him as we would like to but we do try to see him.
"
30,https://www.opendiary.com/m/torturedsoul_1/new-bike-11-5149996/,2009-07-25,New Bike,"
YAY I finally got a new bike. It’s a purple roadmaster one. Me and Belinda went for a test drive today. Boy it definitely shows we both are WAY out of shape. She hasn’t ridden a bike in like 6 years and I can’t remember the last time I rode a bike. It was pretty cheap too. Only 79 bucks. 
So I think when I get off work on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays and Tuesdays and Thursdays I don’t work so I will probably go on those days too  for a bike ride around the block because Jess was talking about buying a new bike too. So we can do like family bike rides around the neighborhood depending on how Kacey behaves. If he doesn’t behave  one of us can go and the other can stay and watch Kacey and switch when the other person is done. 
So yea that’s my plan. Hopefully I can stick to it and actually keep doing it except for days when it rains or is too hot. So that was my day today. Not too bad and the weather was pretty decent not too hot and not too cold.
"
31,https://www.opendiary.com/m/torturedsoul_1/my-excitement-for-today-5149999/,2009-07-28,My excitement for today,"
Boy this just goes to show how boring my life is. The only really exciting thing that happened to me today was right before I was about to go to school probably like a half an hour before I heard a car accident out on the main street near my house. I was giving a bike to my downstairs neighbor’s bf Danny because he got hit by a pick-up truck and didn’t have a bike anymore so I had one in my basement that I offered to someone on Freecycle but they never contacted me about it so I gave it to him. It had a bent back tire and a few other minor problems. Well anyway we got it out of the basement and he was about to bring it around the side of the building when we heard a familiar boom. So I raced upstairs and grabbed my cell which was on the charger and ran back down the stairs and out the front door to call 911. We saw this dark red van going down the street. Turns out that van was involved in the accident and was leaving the scene. So my neighbor had remembered the license plate number so when I got a hold of the dispatcher we let them know. Luckily the lady that was in the other vehicle was not injuried. Her front end of her car was badly damaged but she was just fine. 
A bunch of neighbors had gathered and we were amazed that the lady was that calm after the accident. She wasn’t shaking or anything. So I don’t know if they ever found the driver or not. I of course had to leave to go to school so I’m assuming the lady was ok and got home safetly. So yea that was the excitement for my day. Pretty sad huh. The only other thing was my dog Coco had been limping on her back foot so we figured it was just a sprain and nothing to worry about. We had her stay at my mom’s house so she wouldn’t have to go up and down so many stairs. Well last night she kept crying at my mom’s house. So much that my mom couldn’t get to sleep so I had to bring her back upstairs and we decided to take her to the vet today. So they took a x-ray and I figured she either sprained her hip(if that is possible) or she was starting to have arthritis. Turns out she sprained something but it wasn’t her hip and as for arthritis the doctor said her joints looked pretty good so that’s good at least. They just gave her a pain injection while we there and tomorrow we have to give her a pain pill. 
I plan to ride my bike around the block tomorrow after I get off of work. So I’ll talk about that tomorrow if I do or not. School wasn’t too bad. We had a sub for our career skills class and the lady was really boring. Nobody was really listening to what she was talking about. She did make an interesting drawing on the board. It was pretty funny. I really wish I would have took a pic with my camera phone but didn’t want to get in trouble. She drew a pic of a stick man who had bling, air jordans, and a whole bunch of other stuff including a pregnant baby mama LOL. You would have been cracking up if you saw some of the stuff she was drawing.

32,https://www.opendiary.com/m/torturedsoul_1/my-day-845-5150001/,2009-07-31,My day,"
Well today after work me, my mom, Jess and Kacey all went to pay our bills and then we were gonna go out to Volcano Falls to celebrate my mom’s birthday some more. (WE ARE REAL PARTY ANIMALS LOL). So before we were about to go Jess decides that he’s not gonna go because then he wouldn’t make it to his karate school on time. That really pissed me off. We don’t get a chance to go out and do stuff as a family very often and this was a perfect opportunity and he doesn’t want to go because he wants to go to karate instead. 
I like the fact that he has a hobby or something he is very passionate about but it would also be nice if he would spend more time with his family. When he’s not at karate school he’s either at work or school and now one of his days off I have school so we don’t get to spend too much time together. Sorry had to rant about that one. 
So anyway me, my mom and Kacey went to Volcano Falls. We ate first because my mom was really hungry and then my mom and Kacey stayed inside and played the arcade games and I went out to the batting cages to hit some balls. (NOTHING SICK YOU GUYS!!!!). It really sucked (GET YOUR MINDS OUT OF THE GUTTER) because the balls were either too high, too low or too off center. I know they are supposed to throw a few that aren’t on target but MOST of the balls were off. So after that I took my bat to the car and went inside to play at the arcade myself for a little while. Then we went outside and decided to go on the go-karts or at least me and Kacey did. Then I found out that Kacey could ride the kiddie go-carts by himself so we did that. He did a really good job. He only ran into another kid like once or twice and only ran into the side once because he was looking around and not paying attention LOL. 
After that we decided to get some ice cream and turn in the tickets and go home. So overall it was a really fun day and definitely well spent. 
"
33,https://www.opendiary.com/m/torturedsoul_1/things-on-my-mind-51-5150009/,2009-08-03,things on my mind,"
Well me and Jess got in a nice heated argument last night. He got money back from school and I was hoping we could get a big chunk of our bills paid off so that way we wouldn’t have to worry so much about it around Kacey’s b-day party next Saturday. Instead he decided to put most of it in his karate school account because he had all these things that he had to pay off. I’m glad that he is doing the school idea but my problem is he is putting that ahead of our home stuff we need to get taken care. If he would have used the money for bills we would have them all caught up and maybe even be ahead for once. So sorry had to vent about that.
Other than that school is going well. The in-laws are having their family picnic again this year which is going to be next Monday so we are going because Jess has vacation that week. I think it’s going to be boring as hell but it will get me out of Rockford for a while and if I get bored enough maybe I can walk around and take some pics or something to occupy me. I wanted to go fishing but I won’t take the hook out of the fish so I might bring my gear and hope someone is going fishing. I know Russ said he isn’t so hopefully C.J. will if he even comes. 
Then Russ is going to be taking Kacey next Monday until Wednesday so we will have a well deserved break and boy do I need it. The kid is driving me crazy. So that’s my update for now.

34,https://www.opendiary.com/m/torturedsoul_1/the-family-reunion-pics-added-5150011/,2009-08-10,The family reunion *pics added*,"
Hey just thought I would stop by real quick and let everyone know how the reunion/picnic thing went. They decided to change where the picnic was going to be at at the last minute because of issues with rain which never even happened GO FIGURE!!!! So anyway the uncles all showed up, C.J., John (his secret butt buddy lol), Timmy, us, Russ and Jaime, Marilyn and of course Neil all came. So C.J, John,Timmy, Russ, Jaime, Jess and me all played some different sports for most of the time. Kacey ended up finding a few kids his age or around his age to play with. So we kept ourselves busy. Marilyn didn’t even talk to me except when Kacey was supposedly doing something or some shit. I tried not to pay attention to her anyway. Neil of course was following her around like a lost puppy dog. It’s rather pathetic if you ask me that a grown man has to follow a grown woman around for no reason. Shawn wasn’t able to make it because SURPRISE SURPRISE he’s on suicide watch. Boy we didn’t see that one coming. (being sarcastic). Then Marilyn proceeded to basically tell Russ and Jess they need to call him more. Jess said he really doesn’t want to because he doesn’t want to hear Shawn’s depressed feelings and how he wants to kill himself and the fact that we have told Shawn many times to come up here but he refuses and Jess even tried to give him tips to help him cope better. Obviously he hasn’t listened to anything. Then Russ and Jaime took Kacey home with them. HALLEJAH!!!! SOME PEACE AND QUIET!!!!!! I do have to admit that it seems really weird not having Kacey here to drive us nuts lol. 
I will try to post some pics on here from the reunion when I can. Otherwise not much else going on here. We are finishing calling the guest list for Kacey’s party to find out who is all coming so we can get the other details taken care like whether we are having food, games, decorations, gifts and all that fun stuff lol. Then Wednesday we have to drive up to Russ and Jaime’s to go get Kacey. So we probably won’t be back in Rockford until 6 or 7 because we will have to leave after I get off of work at 1 unless Marjorie lets me leave early. So I have a few ideas for presents for Kacey. There’s a diego chutes and ladder game I found on Wal-mart or Toyrsus’s website, a Cars DVD game, a Diego safari rescue game for the ps2 and a finding Nemo game for the ps2 so I’m thinking of going with one of those and maybe getting him a few books and like 1 or 2 bath towels because some of his other ones are startng to get too small for him lol. My mom already bought him a Diego digital camera that was on clearance at Wal-mart. I think it was originally 60 but it was reduced down to 35 so my mom grabbed it before they were all gone because there was only 2 there when we went. 
We are gonna go tomorrow out to Barnes and Noble to see about getting him some books and I’m gonna talk to her to see if she wants to get one other present at either Gamestop or Toys R Us if she doesn’t that’s fine but I know she LOVES to spoil her grandson. So I’ll update more about that tomorrow.

Well today was Kacey’s actual birthday so we took him to a place called Volcano Falls in our town. It has batting cages, soccer cages, go-karts, a aracade and mini-golf. So we meaning my mom, me, Jess, Lil Michelle and Kacey all went mini golfing first. It was a lot of fun but sucked because it was pretty darn hot out. Then we went inside and ate something and got a lil cooler and then went to do the go-karts. We ended up running out of time for Kacey to go on the go-karts by himself so he just went with Lil Shell. 
Then we dropped Jess off at his karate school and my mom ran a few errands and then we got a craving for ice cream so we went out to Cold Stone Creamery and got some ice cream. Then Lil Shell stayed and we hung out for quite a while and Tab and Lee stopped by to drop off Kacey’s birthday presents for his party tomorrow. So now I’m gonna try to straighten up the house a bit so I won’t have to do it tomorrow and try to remember to contact the lady for this bowling league I was going to be on because I don’t think we’ll be able to afford to do both of them because right now me and Kacey are doing our family league which should be ending pretty soon and then I would be starting the new one tomorrow. So I’m gonna try to sit down with Jess and try to figure something out or maybe go the first week and let her know I don’t know if I’ll be able to stay on the league because of not being able to afford it. 
So tomorrow will hopefully be a lot of fun. It sucks though because I will probably have to get up at 11 so we can go get the stuff from Logli’s we need and then go to the park and start setting things up. So hopefully the day goes well.

Well I got some very sad news tonight. My friend Tab called me to tell me Pat passed away. I wrote a entry about Pat towards the beginning of my diary but for those that are lazy and don’t want to go all the way back to look. I’ll tell you about her. I met Pat through Tab and her brother Gene. She lived across the street from them when they lived in a housing project in our town called Fairgrounds. She didn’t live in them she lived across the street. We would go over her house and hang out with her because her husband Randy was a truck driver and wasn’t home a lot. She had good protection. She had 3 dogs Wicked, Heidi, and Pumba. Heidi and Pumba were mom and son Dingos and I can’t remember what kind Wicked was. We would go over and hang out to keep her company. She had a Nintendo 64 and we would always play her favorite game Zelda:Ocarina of Time lol. Pat always spoke her mind and she didn’t care who she pissed off. She hurt one of her legs very badly in a motorcycle accident where her ex husband was trying to kill her. She ended up having to get her leg amputated. She tried to do reconstructive surgery but her leg ended up getting gangrene in it and they had to amputate. She actually enjoyed not having her leg because when she did have it, it caused her so much pain. I remember her always baking cakes for us. She made the most delicious cakes. She helped me learn to drive and she was like a second mom to me. Her and her husband ended up moving to West Virginia. I lost touch with her here and there but we always got in touch somehow. I will miss her very much.

I completely forgot to tell everyone how Kacey’s party went. We had a few people show up. Lil Michelle, Belinda, Anna, Jackie (Belinda’s mom), my mom, a boy named Anthony from Kacey’s preschool, Melissa, Sarah, Tammy (Melissa’s sister), Melissa’s mom and dad and a guy and his son who we played baseball with at the park before, and Timmy. I think we did pretty good. We ordered Lil Caesar’s pizza and got a fruit tray and a veggie tray from Logli’s. We played hot potato a few times and then played water balloon toss and played shapes and colors bingo. A few park district people came out and turned on the sprinkler they had at the park so by the time the kids went home they were sandy and wet (mainly Anna and Kacey lol). So I think it went pretty well. I will be putting up pics very soon.

Well me, my mom and Kacey went out to the county fair. It was fun. Kacey got to ride most of the rides. I sat out for the rides since I’ll be going with Tab to the Waterfront kickoff carnival next Thursday. So we played some of the games and rode some rides and then my mom started getting really hungry and it looked like it was going to start raining so we decided to leave and go get some food. 
So that was the exciting part of my day. Nothing else really exciting has been going on. I’m getting more and more frustrated with Kacey and Jess. Kacey because he doesn’t seem to want to listen and does what he wants to do. We have tried everything. Time-outs, spankings. I feel at wits end sometimes and it doesn’t help that Jess says not to yell at him and then he turns around and does the same exact thing. As for Jess he annoys me because he STILL doesn’t help me clean the house. I swear if he keeps it up I’m gonna boycott. I’ll only clean up my messes, do my laundry, wash my dishes etc. I hate my life. I don’t think anyone really knows how much it sucks. Yea I have a fiancee that loves me but he rarely shows it. I get tired of asking all the time for him to help me with stuff. Just life sucks!!!! At least we are getting somewhat better with our bills. We still need work but not as bad as we were before. So I guess that’s my rant for today.

Boy I really can’t believe that tomorrow is Kacey’s FIRST day of kindergarten. It’s so hard to think that he will be in school ALL day (except for the first day)lol. So besides being in amazement about that nothing much going on. I still feel sad about Pat passing away but I’m sure that will pass with time. Jess is still lazy and doesn’t help much but big surprise that’s a man for you lol. I do give him credit he helps every once and a while. My mom seems to be enjoying being retired but still is getting used to it. School is going pretty well. I have both classes with a few people and they are really nice and fun to have class with. There was a funny thing that happened last Thursday. I wrote about the whole thing with Jess parking his car behind the van and he took his keys to work with him so I couldn’t go to my first class. I made it to second one and my usual seat partner Lisa wasn’t there so this other girl named Melissa came over and sat next to me. We were doing some work and she goes “is that your feet?” I said it might be because I was wearing my sandals which I wear EVERYWHERE lol. So the guy that sits in front of me goes “it might be me too. I’m sweating like a priest at a all boy’s school.” We all started cracking up laughing. He is so funny. So everyone gets along in our classes and seems to have a good time. 
Work is going pretty well too. I still just work for Marjorie the only bad thing that seems to be happening lately is she seems to be falling a lot more. She fell when I was at her house last week. Luckily she didn’t get hurt. I yelled at her and told her she needs to start wearing her life line button all the time when she’s by herself. So recently she’s been wearing it so I’m glad she at least listened to me about it. Coco’s back paw started causing her trouble again so we got another pain pill besides the one she already takes and it seems to be helping so that’s definitely good. All the other animals are their usual selves. 
Kacey is doing pretty well except he’s been having issues with wetting the bed and not listening too well. I told him if I get a bad note from his teacher from school I’m not gonna be too happy with him. The family bowling league is basically over. We are having our banquet this coming Sunday. I’m bowling on a league by myself called “Saturday Superstars” We bowl every 2 weeks which is nice for me because I get out of the house for a bit. Then September 8th Kacey and Anna are gonna do a youth league together. I told Belinda I would help her out if there was a week she couldn’t pay because of the random child support lol. So hopefully that will help Anna get more tired out for Belinda and her mom. I know it helps with Kacey and plus give them a chance to get out of the house as well. 
So that’s my update for now. I’m getting more and more anxious for next Wednesday to hurry up and get here. Tab is gonna be coming into town then. Then Thursday is the kickoff carnival. So hopefully things will go as planned and we won’t have any surprises lol.

They told me the big black Lab’s name was Reggie as I looked at him lying in his pen.
The shelter was clean, no-kill, and the people really friendly. I’d only been in the area
for six months, but everywhere I went in the small college town, people were welcoming
and open.  Everyone waves when you  pass them on the street.
But something was still missing as I attempted to settle in to my new life here, and I
thought a dog couldn’t hurt.  Give me someone to talk to. And I had just seen Reggie’s
advertisement on the local news.  The shelter said  they had received numerous calls
right after, but they said the people who had come down to see him just didn’t look like
“Lab people,” whatever that meant.  They must’ve thought I did.
But at first, I thought the shelter had misjudged me in giving me Reggie and his things,
which consisted of a dog pad, bag of toys almost all of which were brand new tennis balls,
his dishes, and a sealed letter from his previous owner.  See, Reggie and I didn’t really
hit it off when we got home. We struggled for two weeks (which is how long the shelter
told me to give him to adjust to his new home).  Maybe it was the fact that I was trying
to adjust, too.  Maybe we were too much alike.
For some reason, his stuff (except for the tennis balls – he wouldn’t go anywhere without
two stuffed in his mouth) got tossed in with all of my other unpacked boxes.  I guess I didn’t
really think he’d need all his old stuff, that I’d get him new things once he settled  in. But it
became pretty clear pretty soon that he wasn’t going to.
I tried the normal commands the shelter told me he knew, ones like “sit” and “stay” and
“come” and “heel,” and he’d follow them – when he felt like it.  He never really seemed to
listen when I called his name – sure, he’d look in my direction  after the fourth of fifth time
I said it, but then he’d just go back to doing whatever.  When I’d ask again, you could
almost see him sigh and then grudgingly obey.
This just wasn’t going to work.  He chewed a couple shoes and some unpacked boxes.
I was a little too stern with him and he resented it, I could  tell. The friction got so bad that
I couldn’t wait for the two weeks to be up, and when it was, I was in full-on search mode
for my cellphone amid all of my unpacked stuff.  I remembered leaving it on the stack of
boxes for the guest room, but I also mumbled, rather cynically, that the “damn dog probably
hid it on me.”
Finally I found it, but before I could punch up  the shelter’s number, I also found his pad and
other toys from the shelter. I tossed the pad in Reggie’s direction and he snuffed it and
wagged, some of the most enthusiasm I’d seen since bringing him  home.  But then I called,
“Hey, Reggie, you like that? Come here and I’ll give you a treat.”  Instead, he sort of glanced
in my direction – maybe “glared” is more accurate – and then gave a discontented sigh and
flopped down.  With his back to me!
Well, that’s not going to do it either, I thought.  And I punched the shelter phone  number.
But I hung up when I saw the sealed envelope. I had completely forgotten about that, too.
“Okay, Reggie,” I said out loud, “let’s see if your previous  owner has any advice.” _______________________________________
To Whoever Gets My Dog:
Well, I can’t say that I’m happy you’re reading this, a letter I told the shelter could only be opened by
Reggie’s new owner. I’m not even happy writing it.  If you’re reading this, it means I just got back
from my last car ride with my Lab after dropping him off at the shelter.  He knew something was different.
I have packed up his pad and toys before and set them by the back door before a trip, but this time… it’s
like he knew something was wrong.  And something is wrong… which is why I have to try to make it right.
So let me tell you about my Lab in the hopes that it will help you bond with him and he with you.
First, he loves tennis balls. The more the merrier.  Sometimes I think he’s part squirrel, the way he hordes
them.  He usually always has two in his mouth, and he tries to get a third in there.  Hasn’t done it yet.
Doesn’t matter where you throw them, he’ll bound after it, so be careful – really don’t do it by any roads.
I made that mistake once, and it almost cost him dearly.
Next, commands.  Maybe the shelter staff already told you, but I’ll go over them again:  Reggie knows
the obvious ones – “sit,” “stay,” “come,” “heel.”  He knows hand signals: “back” to turn around and go back
when you put your hand straight up; and “over” if you put your hand out right or left.  “Shake” for shaking
water off, and “paw” for a high-five.  He does “down”  when he feels like lying down – I bet you could work
on that with him some more.  He knows “ball” and “food” and “bone” and “treat” like nobody’s business.
I trained Reggie with small food treats.  Nothing opens his ears like little pieces of hot dog.
Feeding schedule:  Twice a day, once about seven in the morning, and again at six in the evening.  Regular 
store-bought stuff; the shelter has the brand.
He’s up  on his shots. Call the clinic on 9th Street and update his info with yours; they’ll make sure to send
you reminders for when he’s due. Be forewarned:  Reggie hates the vet.  Good luck  getting him in the car – 
I don’t know how he knkows when it’s time to go to the vet, but he knows.
Finally, give him some time. I’ve never been married, so it’s only been Reggie and me for his whole life.  He’s
gone everywhere with me, so please include him on your daily car rides if you can.  He sits well in the backseat,
and he doesn’t bark or  complain.  He just loves to be around people, and me most especially.
Which means that this transition is going to be hard, with him going to live with someone new.
And that’s why I need to share one more bit of info with you….
His name’s not Reggie.
I don’t know what made me do it, but when I dropped him off at the shelter, I told them his name was Reggie.
He’s a smart dog, he’ll get used to it and will respond to it, of that I have no doubt.  But I just couldn’t bear
to give them his real name.  For me to do that, it seemed so final,  that handing him over to the shelter was as
good as me admitting that I’d never see him again.  And if I end up coming back, getting him, and tearing up
this letter, it means everything’s fine.
But if someone else is reading it, well… well it means that his new owner should know his real name.  It’ll help
you bond with him.  Who knows, maybe you’ll even notice a change in his demeanor if he’s been giving you problems.
His real name is Tank.
Because that is what I drive.
Again, if you’re reading this and you’re from the area, maybe my name has been on the news.  I told the shelter that
they couldn’t make “Reggie” available for adoption until they received word from my company commander.  See, my
parents are gone, I have no siblings, no one I could’ve left Tank with… and  it was my only real request of the Army
upon my deployment to Iraq, that they make one phone call the the shelter… in the “event”… to tell them that Tank
could be put up for adoption.  Luckily, my colonel is a dog guy, too, and he knew where my platoon was headed.
He said he’d do it personally.  And if you’re reading this, then he made good on his word.
Well, this letter is getting to downright depressing, even though, frankly, I’m just writing it for my dog. I couldn’t
imagine if I was writing it for a wife and kids and family. But still, Tank  has been my family for the last six years,
almost as long as the Army has.
And now I hope and pray that you make him part of your family and that he will adjust and come to love you the
same way he loved me.
That unconditional love from a dog is what I took with me to Iraq as an inspiration to do something selfless, to protect
innocent people from those who would do terrible things… and to keep those terrible people from coming over here.  If I
had to give up Tank in order to do it, I am glad to have done so.  He was my example of service and of  love.  I hope
I honored him by my service to my country and comrades.
All right, that’s enough. I deploy this evening and have to drop this letter off at the shelter.  I don’t think I’ll say
another good-bye to Tank, though. I cried too much the first time.  Maybe I’ll peek in on him and see if he finally
got that third tennis ball in his mouth.
Good luck with Tank. Give him a good home, and give him an extra kiss goodnight – every night – from me.
Thank you,
Paul Mallory
_____________________________________
I folded the letter and slipped it back in the envelope.  Sure I had heard of Paul Mallory, everyone
in town knew him, even new people like me.  Local kid, killed in Iraq a few months ago and posthumously
earning the Silver Star when he gave his life to save three buddies. Flags had been at half-mast all summer.
I leaned forward in my chair and rested my elbows on my knees, staring at the dog.
“Hey, Tank,” I said quietly.
The dog’s head whipped up, his ears cocked and his eyes bright.
“C’mere boy.”
He was instantly on his feet, his nails clicking on the hardwood floor. He sat in front of me, his head tilted,
searching for the name he hadn’t heard in months.
“Tank,” I whispered.
His tail swished.
I kept whispering his name, over and over, and each time, his ears lowered, his eyes softened, and his
posture relaxed as a wave of contentment  just seemed to flood him.  I stroked his ears, rubbed his
shoulders, buried my face into his scruff and hugged him.
“It’s me now, Tank, just you and me. Your old pal gave you to me.”
Tank reached up and licked my cheek.  “So whatdaya say we play some ball?
His ears perked again. “Yeah?  Ball?  You like that? Ball?”
Tank tore from my hands and disappeared in the next room.
And when he came back, he had three tennis balls in his  mouth.

This poem I would like to dedicate to all my friends who have stuck by me no matter what. 

Always
You were there for me
When I needed you to be.
When I felt like I had nothing left,
At least nothing I could see.
You were there for me
When he called me on the phone.
The night he made me cry
You wouldnt let me be alone.
You were there for me
Through days, and weeks, and months.
When sadness would befall me
To my side youd always rush.
You were there for me
When I finally could smile.
I got past all the heartache,
Though its taken me awhile.
You were there for me always.
When I called for you, you came.
And if ever you should need someone,
You know Ill do the same.

Forever Friends
As we travel lifes long road
We meet and make new friends.
And even though the friends may go
The friendship never ends.
That is how it is with you,
You gave me a fresh start .
You gave me vision, you gave me hope
You touched and healed my heart.
You gave me strength to do the things
You knew that I could do.
You inspired me in so many ways.
I cant begin to repay you.
Youre always there when I need you most.
Somehow you seem to know.
And that is why I hope and pray
Our friendship continues to grow.

Friendship Lives On
	I remember the first time I saw her. My future best friend. She came into the room looking nervous and unsure. She was wearing a read hat with a few strands of blonde hair hanging on her shoulders. I could tell she was as new to this world as I was. We sat across the room glancing scared looks at each other. Then my name was called, and it was my turn to see the doctor. I hoped it wasnt the last time we would meet.
	The next week I went into the hospital for my first round of chemotherapy. She was my roommate. Her hair was completely gone, and she was hiding her hairless head under her red hat. We introduced ourselves. Her name was Lyssa. She was seventeen and was diagnosed with leukemia. She was in for her second round of treatment. We spent the next three weeks getting to know each other and being sick to our stomachs. She was there when I started to lose my hair. We cried together and struggled to be normal teenagers. The treatment was hard, but Lyssa made it much easier. After my three weeks were up, I went home. We exchanged addresses and decided we would write. We never did. Two weeks later I was back in for more chemo. Lyssa had never left. We passed the time by doing our nails (she always had nice nails) and watching TV.
	Mornings were the worst in the cancer ward. The vacuum guy came every morning at 8 A.M. Way too early for us. We hated it. Lyssa devised a brilliant plan for us to hide our heads under the pillows, pretend we were sleeping, turn off the lights and hope he would not come into our room with that thing. It worked for a week-our room was disgustingly dirty. We had popcorn fights, gummy bear fights, and jelly bean fights. There were medical wrappers on the floor, spilt drinks and food all over. Lyssa and I were very proud that we had been able to make our hospital room look more like home. 
	For the next six months, we were roommates off and on. Lyssa never left the hospital. Finally the day for Lyssas last treatment arrived. She had a huge party to celebrate. After being in and out of intenstive care and emergency surgery, and experiencing tons of medical scares, she was finally going home. That was the last time I ever saw her truly happy.
	It seemed that no time had passed, when suddenly she was back in the hospital again. Her cancer had returned, and she couldnt do any more chemotherapy. There was nothing more that could be done. We cried together over the phone, and I drove up to the hospital. They decided to let her go home.
	The following week I was in the hospital for more chemotherapy. The nurses were watching me closely. I guess they thought I might not be myself. It was the first time I had been at the hospital without Lyssa, and I missed her. I missed that glow of hers that seemed to attract people to her. I missed being able to tell her all my hopes, fears, dreams and problems. She made me want to live.
	A few weeks later, the good news came. The doctors decided that they would do a new experimental bone marrow transplant on Lyssa. Unfortunately, no one in her family matched Lyssas bone marrow type, so they went to the marrow bank. Luckily, they found a match. We were very hopeful. She had to be confined to her hospital room for a month following the transplant. I would go and visit her when I could, and each time she seemed to be more and more depressed. Her glow started to fade. I knew she was dying, and I didnt know what to do. I felt helpless. If I knew that rainy Saturday night would be the last time I got to talk to her, I would have said so much more. I would have told her how much she meant to me, how much easier she had made my life and how much I loved her.
	My mom had told me that she would be driving past the hospital and would be stopping to visit her. Since I couldnt go, I decided to make a picture for her to hang on the wall and brighten up her room. It was a picture of Winnie the Pooh walking through the forest with all his friends. I colored it and attached to it things that were important to us. I taped chopsticks in memory of Chinese food, hair clips in hopes of our growing lots of hair and pictures of all the friends we had made in the hospital. My mom took it to Lyssa and visited with her for awhile. That night she died. She went peacefully in her sleep while her mom and sister were beside her. 
	Her funeral was the most difficult thing I have ever gone through. Lyssas mom told me that just before she died she had read my letter over and over again until she fell asleep. It made me feel good to know that Lyssa had been able to read, at least, how much I loved her and how very important she was to me.
	I sometimes feel alone in the world, like I have no one to talk to these days. Every time I get discouraged I remember my best friend, Lyssa, and how she fought until the end. I remember the fun and good times we had together, and it makes me happier. She made me want to be a better person. I know I am not alone even though I cant see her or talk  to her face-to-face. I can feel her, and I know she is watching over me. She is my guardian angel. She taught me that friendship is forever, and the little things do count.
In memory of Lyssa

Gold Friends
When you have a good friend you want to keep her.
You see her every day.
You have special nicknames,
And funny things you like to say.
Then something happens as you grow older.
Interests change
Your lives do, too.
You dont see that friend as much as you used to.
You slowly drift apart,
Day by day,
Night by night.
You dont realize it,
But when you do 
You start to write.
The first letter is long,
The one you get back is, too.
But neither remembers to write again
To the friend who wrote to you.
Time elapses,
Your mind forgets.
You start to drift.
Until you come across that letter,
The precious letter you saved.
And you think,
I wonder what she is doing today.
What has happened since I last wrote?
I wonder if shes made new friends,
And what friendships she has broke?
You remember the saying:
Make new friends, but keep the old.
One is silver, and the other is gold.
You know shes a good friend,
You dont want to lose
So you take out some paper
And think of the right words to use.
You make an effort
To express to your friend
That friends of the heart,
You will be til the end.

Goofy Pictures will Never Fade
	Its amazing how fast a year flies by and how much things can change. Something so normal and obvious one year can seem so awkward and different the next. Take a regular, lazy Saturday afternoon. Its almost summer and youre flipping through the endless channels with your best friend. Munching on the last of the greasy chips, the two of you talk about the boring details of your day. Those terrible, corny KOST 103.5 songs that you actually like are playing in the background as you scrounge for whatever types of junk food can be found in the depths of your kitchen cabinet. The thought of leaving the house is exhausting. That would require changing out of yoru comfortable pajama bottoms and old tennis T-shirt. More importantly, the brush would never make it through your uncontrollable mess of hair. You gossip with your friend about the exciting things happening in other peoples lives and discuss your weekend plans-hoping they will bring something exciting in your life.
	As the level of boredom grows, you decide to snap some photos of your friend kissing the pictures of Will Smith hanging on your wall. Once you decide that Will has had enough, you both fall asleep  while watching a low-budget, no-talent, never-gonna-get-an-Oscar movie, your face in the popcorn. And all of this is fun.
	Your friend has left but that doesnt mean you wont talk to her for the rest of the day. Oh no, your mom cant get any of her calls because you are upstairs on the phone with a tightly closed door gossiping about the same pointless yet important things you were just talking about five minutes before she left your house. You manage to drown out your moms yelling for you to get off the phone because youre busy analyzing the smile and hello she got today from the hottie in third period. Before you have a chance to reach a conclusion on the potential possibility of passing the next chemistry test, your mom and dad have disconnected the phone.
	I knew my best friend as well as I knew myself. We could sense when something was wrong with the other and were always finishing each others sentences. I never would have thought that our friendship could change. How could we ever pass each other in the hallway without jumping straight into a lengthy discussion about our last class? But I guess things do change.
	Another year starts and zooms by before you know it. One minute, Im screaming with my best friend in the hallways about the new guy in school, and the next were barely making small talk. No one ever really knows why things happen. Now, when I look at old pictures of us goofing around, it all seems so strange, as if we were different people. Now, the shallow small talk of Hi, how are you? always makes me think of the time when that was a pointless question. We either already knew or wed dive right into it before the question was even asked. Nothing stays the same forever, and I guess I have to accept that. Friends will come and go just like a school year, but the goofy pictures will never fade.

46,https://www.opendiary.com/m/torturedsoul_1/my-sunday-49-5150026/,2009-08-31,My Sunday,"
Well my Sunday went pretty well. First we went to our bowling banquet for our family league that me and Kacey were on. We ended up getting 5 trophies and we got first place again this year. I thought we got second. Also Kacey got one for a high score and I got one for a high score and I think Kacey got another one for a high score. So we did pretty well. Then we went to a surprise birthday party for my friend Melissa but we kinda accidentally ruined the surprise lol. It was  fun party either way and I actually saw a bald eagle which I never would have thought would be in Rockford of all places but it was. 
As for school man I’m kinda scared of the people in my career skills class. They are a preverted bunch. Our teacher made everyone get into groups and make a story basically going around the group and giving one word. So here are the stories or highlights from the stories.
One group was talking about a cow, weed, mowing grass. Our teacher concluded that that group was a bunch of pot heads who liked cows lol.
The next group was about a monkey jumping on a car that was in the McDonald’s drive through because the person was hungry for a mcFlurry. Our teacher concluded that the memmbers of that group had some issues with food lol.
Then there was one about a chick that went to drink and got drunk, woke up with no clothes on that were stolen by a dragqueen named Bubbles at a dragqueen club in our town called “The Office.” I can’t remember what the teacher said about that one.
Then there was the one about a girl named Suzy who was doin it with someone in Slumberland. It had a gay guy in it and a chick with big boobs. My teacher thought that the people in that group had some sexual issues. 
Finally there was one about a dog who shit a lot and raped people.
After all that our teacher was kinda speechless lol. I don’t blame her. Luckily I wasn’t there that day when they did these interesting stories lol. Then this past Thursday our teacher wanted us to make a skit about something that gives us anxiety. I don’t think our skit is gonna be that great. We picked giving a speech but not sure how we are gonna do that except to have everyone go around and say what they get anxious about. 
Ok here are some pics that I decided to put on here. Hope everyone enjoys them.

Well tonight me and Tab went to the kickoff carnival for waterfront. It was pretty fun but sucked majorly that they took out the Pharaoh’s Fury which is a boat that goes way up in the air but basically goes back and forth. They had to fit all the rides in one area so I kinda see why they did but it still sucks. We had fun anyway. Gene (Tab’s older brother) got a $100 worth of tickets which equalled 200 tickets which he was using just for games because he doesn’t ride the rides so he was nice enough to let us use some of the tickets to play some of the games. I ended up getting a blue hat. Then I used my money and got another hat that had dollar bills over it, a long snake for Kacey and Scooby Doo for Kacey too. We ended up hanging out with Tab’s younger brother Sterling most of the time and my friend Amy came with her oldest son Michael. 
The only bad part about today was that Kacey’s school called and said that he bit one of his classmates in the chest because supposedly the boy put his hand in Kacey’s face. So both boys got their play time taken away and I told Kacey if he keeps it up he won’t be going to grandma’s house this weekend so hopefully tomorrow is a much better day. 
I got 2 thousand and something dollars back from school so I used some of it to get some new bras because I desperately needed them, a new pair of shorts that I might have to take back because they are too small and a pair of blue butterfly pj pants. We also paid a few of the bills that we needed to get out of the way and I’m gonna have Jess pay some more bills tomorrow and he’s gonna take Coco back to the vet to get a few cysts that she has drained and get Buck his shots. So hopefully when this is all over with we will still have a lil bit of extra money left and be caught up or ahead on some of our bills.

Ok I’m sure everyone has heard me bitch about my fiancee and how lazy he is when it comes to housework. Today has been a prime example. I worked today even though it was only 3 hours. Then I came home and vaccumed and cleaned both cars. Then told my fiancee he at least owed me lunch at Taco Bell for doing his nasty ass car. My van gets pretty messy but his was just downright disgusting. It had containers with moldy stuff, drink containers and tons of other stuff. So I did the cars and then went out with my friend Melissa, her sister Tammy and their mom to go feed the ducks. I brought Kacey with BIG MISTAKE!!!! He wouldn’t listen for anything. So after that I came home and did some major house cleaning. Here’s my list
1. put away all the stuff from the cars
2. straightened up Kacey’s bookshelf and mine
3. cleaned out the cat boxes
4. vaccumed my room and the living room
5. picked up the recycling to go outside
6. bagged up the garbage
7. straightened up the living room
8. washed the dishes
So when he came home I asked him to check the laundry, take out the recycling and the trash and straighten up the kitchen and he started throwing a fit about having to get up at 7 to get Kacey up for school when he has school tomorrow anyway and has to get up that early. 3 DAMN THINGS I ASKED HIM TO DO when I spent the evening cleaning the WHOLE DAMN HOUSE. The funny thing is the table in the kitchen is covered with crap he left out like miracle whip and his cookies so I shouldn’t have to clean that shit anyway.

Well I haven’t written on here in quite a while. Mainly because I was trying to get together a slideshow of my trip to WI. My friend Melissa and her family wanted to go to WI to visit friends that they hadn’t seen in quite a while. Their truck wouldn’t make it up there so I volunteered to take them up there. Their friends lived up near WI Dells so we actually got our hotel in WI dells. The only bad part was Melissa’s sister Tammy didn’t know about the pet fee that the hotel had because she paid for the rooms online and they never said anything about a fee so luckily Jess had let me take the card with so I was able to pay the pet fee for them. Then they went out to visit their friends and we stayed there forever which was really weird for me because I had no clue who any of these people were so eventually we left and went back to the hotel and went swimming for a while.
I got to go in a hot tub for the first time. So overall I think we had a good time. Tammy got bummed out a few times because she wanted to be able to cover everything expense wise and she wasn’t able to. I paid for my lunch the day we left to help them be able to afford lunch for themselves and she got really sad about it but I told her I was going to pay for my own lunch anyway so they would have enough for them to eat. So enclosed below is the slideshow of some of the stuff we saw in the Dells. Hope everyone enjoys.

Well on Saturday we went to WI for a tae kwon do tournament that Jess was in. I will enclose the videos from the tournament along with pics from it as well. He did pretty well. He got 4th place in forms and 2nd in breaking and sparring. The only bad part was we got really lost there so we ended up coming late to the tournament and then we were totally lost on the way back home too but luckily found our way back.

52,https://www.opendiary.com/m/torturedsoul_1/now-finally-my-update-5150035/,2009-09-29,Now finally my update,"
Now that I got all that other stuff out of the way I will finally update on other stuff going on right now. Well I called a place in our town called the Mildred Berry Center that works with kids with mental and behavioral problems about the fact that Kacey might be ADHD. So I called them and they had someone get back to me recently and they told me that they have a counselor that comes to Kacey’s school and that the lady would get in touch with me to set up a assessment for Kacey. Hopefully if Kacey is ADHD we can find some kind of solution to help him calm down and focus in school. He has been in trouble quite a while since school has started. He didn’t have recess for a week because he wouldn’t listen to the teacher. He also got in trouble for biting another boy in his class on his chest. They supposedly were arguing who was whose best friend and the boy put his hand in Kacey’s face or something similar and Kacey bit his chest. So we have started to set up a system. If Kacey misbehaves at school he can’t watch cartoons, play with his toys, visit with grandma, or play on the computer. If he is good he gets to do all the things listed and gets a toy. So far things have been somewhat improving and I hope it keeps up.
Other news I’m on break for 2 weeks starting this week. I did pretty well in my classes. I got a C in my math class and not sure what I got in my Career Skills class yet. I also gained a few friends in my classes. Then Tab came down yesterday to visit with her friend that was moving to California so I got to see her for a while. It felt really good to see her again. I hope she’s able to come down for Halloween. I plan on having a halloween party the day before Halloween so hopefully that goes well.
Jess is still working on his school which sucks because he’s barely here at home with us. I’m going to sit down and talk to him about making more time to spend with us. I feel bad that we do all kinds of family events without him because he’s at karate all the time.

* This is a amazing story to me. I’m amazed the lil fellow survived and why someone would stick the poor thing in a duffle bag is even more amazing. 
If one cats will to live could outmatch the strength of a heavy canvas bag, then surely one little kitten in Spokane County, WA, has the courage of a lion. Last week, two maintenance workers were testing garage doors at an apartment complex when they heard the muffled sounds of a distressed kitten coming from a large, heavy canvas duffel bag. The workers unzipped the bag only to find a second zipped duffel bag inside. When they opened the second bag, they discovered a frightened orange kitten, whom they promptly named Duff.
After giving him a much-needed bath, the rescuers called the Spokane County Regional Animal Protection Service (SCRAPS)an ASPCA Mission: Orange partner agencyto pick up and care for the tiny, suffering kitten.
Duff was very lucky to be found, says Animal Protection Officer Nicole Montano. He probably would have died that day.
Spokane Valley resident Donivan Crews later confessed to SCRAPS that he placed the kitten in the duffel bags six days prior to discovery. Crews was charged with confinement in an unsafe manner.
But this story of cruel abandonment has a very happy ending. One of Duffs knights in shining armor adopted the lucky feline, whos now recovering in a truly loving home.
We are so grateful for the heroes who not only rescued this kitten but also took him into their hearts and home, says Jackie E. Bell, SCRAPS Development Coordinator. Duff will always have his name as a reminder of how he overcame such a tough start in life.

Ok I have a paper I have to do for my college english class. We have to write a memoir of a event in our life. So I have two possible ones I’m thinking of doing but not sure which one I should do so I’m going to post them on here and let you guys read them to help me with my decision.  
My New Place
	I will never forget the day my landlord decided to sell the apartment we were living in. I had grown up in this apartment and lived there my whole life. Most of the kids I hung out with I had known since we were little and I played football or whatever sport we decided on in the middle of the road. 
	My apartment had many memories. There was the creaky heater vent that I imagined monsters crawling through to come and get me or my closet that had no door but was still dark enough for monsters to come out of. There was the super small bathroom that had a huge claw-footed tub. The kitchen where I used to play with marbles at because it had a slanted floor that made the marbles run downhill or where my albino girl bunny Honey Bunny used to scratch on the floor like she was digging a hole.  Then there was the bedroom where I used to have sleepovers with my girlfriends and we stayed up all night gossiping, being silly or flinging ice cream on the ceiling until it fell in someones hair. I remember the porch steps where I fell down 2 or 3 stairs when I was 2 trying to help my mom carry down laundry. Luckily all I got was a bruised and scraped nose. My least favorite place would probably be my basement. It was creepy and I always felt like I was being watched when I went down there besides the creepy bugs and spiders that lived there. 
	So my mom only had so much time to find a new place and save up money so we ended up in the housing projects. For our city all are bad and you wont find any that are good no matter what side of town it is on. So we ended up in one called Fairgrounds. Once our friends heard we were moving there they gave us words of wisdom by saying dont get shot and stay inside. So my first week there I stayed inside and played Super NES afraid to step outside in fear I would be shot or harmed. The building I lived in was right near the railroad bridge and tracks so I would look outside at that. I happened to notice a little boy about 2 or 3 peeing through the fence so I yell out and say, HEY what are you doing? He ran down the path without even zipping up.
	So after a few weeks my mom got tired of me sitting around the house and made me go to a day camp at the Salvation Army down the street. So I show up and there are no white people just black. So I just kind of sit back and keep quiet. At the end of the day I start to walk home and notice there is another girl from the day camp walking the same way I am. She eventually catches up with me and actually starts talking to me. She says her name is Tantasia and I tell her my name and we just start talking like we have been friends forever. I was amazed by this because on this particular side of town most black people didnt seem to care too much for the whites. 
	Then I meet one of my best friends to this day. I dated her older brother Gene and when we would go up to his house he would never let me come in because he was embarrassed by his mom. Well one day she invites me and I get to meet his sister Tabitha. At first she seems not to care for me too much but that might have been because Gene talked his mom into letting me spend the night in Tabs room. So I go in her room to get ready for bed and we start to talk about different stuff. Turns out shes only a year older than I am which surprises me but we become fast friends too. The relationship with her brother fell apart and we broke up. 
	I start to notice that Gene and Tab go across the street to a ladys house that lives across the street from Fairgrounds so I ask Gene if I can go over there with him. He allows me to and says the ladys name is Pat. So I go over there and Pat tells me to watch my moves because she has 3 dogs, 2 that are African Dingoes so I tread carefully the first few times I go over there. I come to find out that Pat is married to a man named Randy and that he is a truck driver who is gone for long periods of time sometimes so we start to go over there to keep her company while he is away. Tab works for her doing housework since Pat has a bad leg due to her ex-husband trying to kill her. She gets in a really bad motorcycle accident and one of her legs she describes as grounded up hamburger when the accident happened. After a while Tab ends up getting a job at a local buffet called Ryans so she is unable to do the personal aid job anymore so Pat asks me if I would like to do it even though she already has a lady named Jaime who does it. Jaime had a few problems with coming to work drunk or high so I was basically the back-up. About the time I start to work for Pat she tries to have reconstructive surgery done on her bad leg. It doesnt turn out too well and she ends up getting gangrene and having to have it amputated. People always ask her if she is in pain because of the leg and with her attitude she says hell no it feels 10x better. I remember one time Pat invites the girls over meaning me, Tab, Tantasia and a girl named Special who is Jaimes daughter. Me and Tab thought it would be cool to bring over her Ouija board so we hide it under my coat and bring it over. Tab asks Pat what she thinks of Ouija board and Pat starts saying, Those things are portals to the devil. I would be very unhappy if someone brought one of those into my house. Needless to say me and Tab snuck the board back over to her house. 
	After about a year or two of living in Fairgrounds our landlord found a place for us to live to which I was happy but also sad too. I told everyone I would be coming back to visit but no one believed me because my new place was on the other side of town but I did come back. I was punched in the mouth by a boy who thought I threw a ball at him when I had never seen him before in my mouth and I had 2 or 3 year olds tell me to f*ck off or motherf*cker . Then there was the people who blared their stereos outside our apartment until the windows vibrated or the door-to-door salesmen who sold socks at 3 in the morning or the older men who said rude inappropriate things to me when I was 15 but even though those were negative things that I had to deal with while living in Fairgrounds there was Tab, Tantasia, Pat to help me through them. 
	To this day Im still friends with Tab. She has moved to Springfield to live with her bf and its weird not to have her here in the same town but we always find time to get together one way or another. I just saw Tantasia yesterday at a grocery store so hopefully we can keep in contact with each other. Unfortunately Pat passed away this August and I will always remember her and her unique personality. Also Jaime passed away this past year too. Her daughter Special who I mentioned ended up going on a date and never coming back. Shes been missing for a few years now.  I will always remember Fairgrounds as the time in my life that was the darkest but also one of the best of my life. 
———————————————————————–
Kacey
	So the day is February 14,2004 and this is the day that ultimately changed my life. This is the day I found out I was pregnant. I made my fiancee go out and buy two Clearblue Digital pregnancy tests and invited my best friend Amy who Ive known since 5th grade to come over for moral support. I go in the bathroom, pee in the cup and wait. I go back in 5 minutes later and read what it says. PREGNANT. So I go out and tell my fiancee, it says pregnant! He said to me, Go take the other one. I told him  its gonna say the same thing. So to satisfy him I go in and take the other test. Surprise, surprise it still says Im pregnant. 
	So the next day I go to a place called the Rockford Area Pregnancy Care Center and took another pregnancy test which says the same thing. So I get scheduled to come once a week to speak with a counselor who shows me a boring video each week about different things. To me it seemed like the lady had the impression that my fiancee Jesse wouldnt stick around even though at that time we had been together for 5 years. We had discussed the whole pregnancy idea and said basically whatever happened we were ok with and didnt use protection since who knows when. It took us 5 years to get pregnant. So I also had to go to the health department, WIC, and LINK to do all their paperwork. 
	So then it came time to tell the families. I was thinking my mom would freak out because shes religious and believes in the whole idea of getting married before having kids. Jesss mom and brothers seemed excited and so did my co-workers and boss at Goodwill.  So Jesss dad and stepmom live in Wisconsin so we invite them down for lunch to break the news. My best friend Tab comes with as well. So we tell them and they didnt take it so well. They started asking all these questions like,  Are you gonna be on welfare your whole life and are you gonna have good health insurance for the baby? etc. So I started going to my doctors appointments which was a ton of fun (NOT!). Between the probing around and the having to pee in the cups every time. The only good ones were when they did ultrasounds and let you listen to the heartbeat. The only other problem was my fiancee never seemed to want to go to the appointments with me. This annoyed me and made me sad at the same time. Maybe partly because of hormones but it made me feel like he didnt want the kid. 
	So as the pregnancy progressed I had a few changes in my life. My best friend Amy had become the manager of a Subway inside a Road Ranger in Rochelle and got me a job working with her. It was fun but also kind of made me angry because I had to close all by myself. I did get all the free broken cookies I could eat though. Also we had moved into a wonderful house but the landlords were jerks so we just ended up moving to an apartment. So the big day comes.
	Its August 14th,2004. Today Im supposed to work my last day before I go on maternity leave.  Well my son decided its time to join the world instead. I wake up at 5:30 in the morning with my shorts soaked. I very carefully get out of bed and head for the bathroom. I say very carefully because Jesse had worked overtime at his job and had just gotten home and to sleep a few hours ago. I sit in the bathroom for a little while thinking of what to do because I didnt want to cause a panic because Jesss brother Russ also lived with us at the time and he gets a little overly emotional about stuff. I decide to put fresh clothes on even though it wont help much because now its kind of like a faucet on low but I do it anyway. I go back to bed and wake up Jess and tell him whats going on. He tells me, call the doctor. And rolls over and goes back to sleep. So I call my doctors office who tells me to go to the hospital to get checked out. So we get ready and head over to the hospital which is luckily right across the street . So they take me into a triage room and have me disrobe. They check me and find out Im dilated to 3 cms so the next trip is up to the labor/delivery floor. I get a free ride up there in a wheelchair which was nice. This is all about 7:30 in the morning. The interesting thing is today is my nephew Timmys birthday and so by luck the in-laws are in town to celebrate his birthday to which unfortunately they spend most of the time at the hospital. Eventually they take him out to go mini-golfing. Everyone starts showing up. My mom, my brother Joe, and my friend Tab. So we are just waiting around and every once in a while a nurse comes in to check me to see how far I dilated since the last time. If I remember correctly by noon Im about 6 or 7 cm dilated. At this time the contractions are coming closer together and becoming more painful as well. A few of my friends that had kids said it feels like menstral cramps but 10 times worse. Boy were they right! So I ask for pain medication only to find out its too late for a epidural. So instead they give me a different kind called a spinal. After that I dont feel much which was nice. 
	So about 2 they say Im ready to start pushing. So everyone leaves except for my mom who at the beginning of the pregnancy didnt want to be in the room but she decides at the last minute that she wants to, Jess, and Tab. A few seconds before they have me start pushing Amy shows up. The nurse asks if we want her to stay or go. I say she can stay and Jess says she can go so I just tell the nurse let her stay. I realize something as Im pushing boy its hard to push til the count of 10 but I manage to do it. My friend Tab is in the very back trying to peek to see whats going on so I tell her if she wants to move up to see better she can. At this point everyone has seen a certain spot and Im just ready to get it over with so I could care less. So finally his head comes out and even with pain meds DAMN IT HURT!!!!! The rest of him coming out wasnt so bad. They dry him off and hand him to me. I get to FINALLY see this person that has been inside me for 9 months who me and Jess created. Now Im responsible for more than just cats and dogs. This person I have to make into a responsible man who can go out into the world on his own. He was officially born at 2:10 pm and weighed 6lbs, 14 oz and was 19 in long. We named him Kacey James.
	Now hes 5 and I dont know where the time went. Hes learning new things every day. I feel very lucky that my labor went well. Most of my friends had some complications. From the baby not wanting to budge to hemhrogaing to having a emergency c-section. I have days where I cant deal with him and his tantrums to days where Im very proud of him and his accomplishments or days where he does something to make me crack up laughing when my day sucked before. I get a lot of people that ask me when Im gonna have another one. Im not so sure I want to do this whole ride over again. To me he makes up 2 kids because he has so much energy.

Well tonight in my Human Relations class at school we were discussing a interesting topic. We were talking about weed vs alcohol. We also watched 2 funny as hell videos on youtube. The first one is about spiders on drugs. 
Then there was a funny video about a drunk guy at a convenice store.

We couldn’t stop cracking up laughing.

56,https://www.opendiary.com/m/torturedsoul_1/havent-written-figured-i-would-5150044/,2009-10-20,haven’t written figured I would,"
Hey everyone. My life hasn’t been that eventful so that’s basically the reason I haven’t written in here in a while. Still not that much excitement but figured I would write. Yesterday Kacey woke up with a fever of 102 so called him in to school and let him lay around. He was supposed to go for a flu shot but the dr said since he was running a fever they wouldn’t be able to give it to him. So I scheduled a separate appointment for his cough because it was getting to the point the poor kid couldn’t sleep because he was coughing so much. So at this appointment the dr. tries to swap for strep because when she was doing the physical exam she noticed his lymph nodes were big near his tonsils. GOOD LUCK ON THAT ONE!!! Kacey wouldn’t let her near him with the swaps to do it so the dr couldn’t give him any meds and the even more retarded thing was they ended up giving him the flu shot because his temp had dropped to like 99. So we sat and waited for like a hour and a half just to get the shot. By the time we left there was no one at the office and they were closing. 
So today he was feeling much better and wasn’t running a fever so we sent him to school. When I went to pick up the teacher made the comment to me “He does much better in smaller sized classes.” She then said only 13 students were in the class when I believe there is usually 25-30. Also when I came to school tonight there were a lot of people gone. So far both classes aren’t too bad for school. I got English and Human Relations. 
My day is going to be somewhat busy tomorrow. I have to go to Kacey’s school to talk to a lady about getting Kacey assessed for ADHD which she said I could come in any time as long as it was before noon. Then I have to turn in money for a hoodie I’m gettin through school before noon or see if Jess can maybe turn it in for me. Actually once I think of it I will probably go do it because I also have to talk to a financial aid person. Then after that I have to go shopping for my halloween party which I’m having next Friday. So far 10 people are POSSIBLY coming. me, Jess, Tab, Belinda, Lil Shell, Amy, Melissa, and then possibly Sterling and Logan and Tammy. So it’s a wait and see thing. Hopefully everyone is able to come. I think it makes it much more funner if there are more people. Kacey decided he is going to be a Ninja for Halloween and I was thinking of bein a skeleton. or partly a skeleton lol. It sucks b.c I’m so big I can’t fit a actual costume so I would have to make my own or just go to Wal-mart and buy a shirt that has the skeleton bones and wear black sweatpants. I have a mask I can wear. Actually I think I will just dress up in pjs and a robe and slippers and wear the mask lol and do crazy stuff with my hair. Then all I would have to buy is slippers which I need anyway lol. That works for me. 
So that’s my update for now.

Well I threw a Halloween party that seemed to go well. Everyone showed except for Tab’s two younger brothers and that was only because of a communication error on my part. We had a lot of fun just playing different games. We were gonna watch some movies but got so into the games we never got a chance to watch the movies.
Then on Halloween me and my friend Tab who was in town for the weekend or I should say was only supposed to be in town for the weekend lol went to see “Paranormal Activity” That movie gave me the chills. I know it’s not real but it was still pretty good. I can’t wait for it to come out on video. Then I took Kacey trick or treating. He got a half a pillow case full of candy and really enjoyed it. He went up to one door and was looking in the man’s mailbox before he opened the door so when the man did open the door Kacey told him he had a lot of mail in his mailbox and then proceeded to pull out every piece of mail and give it to the man so the man gave him a extra full sized Snickers bar. I couldn’t help but sit there and crack up laughing.
Back to the Tab situation the poor girl ended up having to stay until yesterday because her car decided to give her some problems. I hope we didn’t drive her too crazy lol. It was definitely nice to be able to see her more than a few days but I wish it would have been under better circumstances for her. I bet she is really glad to be home.
Other than that not much excitement happening around our house lately. This Saturday I get to go to a place in WI that has actual tigers and other animals so I will be taking a shitload of pics while I’m there. It’s a volunteer thing through my school for the vet tech program. I also found out about a program in Boone county called DART that I’m interested in getting involved in. They help with disaster situations and animals so that will help my vet tech degree too. I didn’t win the pumpkin decorating contest. THAT SUCKED!!!!

Sorry it took me so long to write about this place. I actually went on November 7th but didn’t have time to make a slideshow until now. The place was a great place with many different animals. It’s located in Sharon, WI. Me and my friend Melisa from school carpooled. I ended up hanging out with a girl named Ginny who is in both my classes this quarter. Our job was to put sand in a wheel barrow and take it over to the wolves dens so they could put fresh sand down in their enclosure. We got to take a tour of the place and see all the different animals they had which included tigers, lions, ducks, sheep, goats, peacocks, siberian tiger, a horse with no eyes, a llama, a camel that tried to bite my friend Melisa’s boob. It was so funny because she turned around and her sweatshirt had camel drool on it. The funny part was I got to rub being around the wolves in Jess’s face because he loves wolves and he decided not to go. I have video which will be towards the bottom of this entry that has the lions and tigers roaring. They did this every time a motorcycle or something with a loud engine went by and the people at the sanctuary said people with motorcycles would go by just to make the lions and tigers roar. There was one duck that reminded me of Donald Trump lol.

Well nothing super exciting happened for Thanksgiving. Another joyous year of the in-laws not showing up YES!!!! I invited my friend Melisa and her family over. They almost didn’t come over a dumb misunderstanding. I think I suck at my communication skills lol because somehow something gets screwed up. I had said some items we were going to be needing and basically asked them what they could bring and they took that as we we’re trying to get them to buy the whole dinner which wasn’t what i was trying to do at all. They don’t have a lot of money and I completely understand that I was just trying to find out what they could bring so it wasn’t like with the in-laws and us providing everything. So we got that taken care of. I got a good portion of my holiday shopping already done. I got Kacey 2 books to help him learn how to read, a Chuck and Friends toy , a ambulance, a smaller ambulance and a small fire truck, and a few Cars cars he didn’t have. My mom got him 2 reading workbooks too and wants to get him a racecar that will just flip over and go the other way if it hits the wall. Then for Jess I got him 3 dvds related to martial arts and will probably have my mom get him a few clothes and a DVD he wanted. For my friend Melisa I’m gonna get a photo book made of Sara and probably a toy or something for Sara and for her sister Tammy I’m gonna get a really nice pic of her and Sara printed and put it in a frame. As for Belinda I got to find out what she needs or wants for her and Anna and Amy I don’t think I’ll get her anything. Lil Michelle I’m gonna try to find something frog related. Actually for Amy I’ll probably make a photo book of the kids for her too and maybe for someone else too.For my mom I’m not sure what I’m gonna get her. She still hasn’t given me her list lol and my brother we’ll probably get him a gift card. So that covers everyone. Tab doesn’t like to get gifts because she’s trying to declutter lol. The in-laws haven’t called or written so I gues they are SOL. 
Also got my school check and did a lot of productive things with it lol. That’s how I was able to get started on x-mas shopping. Also got a new stove because the oven decided to die on Thanksgiving. We got new coats, new boots, and paid some bills and then hopefully tomorrow I’m gonna be getting my new phone. So that’s my interesting update. Hope everyone else had a wonderful thanksgiving and there wasn’t too much drama lol.

Well school is officially over for the quarter as of yesterday. Brought in some cupcakes for my classes and my English class we ate a whole cake pan of cupcakes real quick lol and there was only 8 including the teacher. So glad to know they enjoyed my cupcakes. Then in my Human Relations class our final was real easy and when my teacher finaled up my grade I had a C so she was like what could you say that would help convince me to bump up your grade a few points so I said can I have extra credit for bringing in the cupcakes and another girl named Lauren started saying “yea she should get extra credit for the cupcakes, they were really good.” lol. Needless to say I left with a B. So then last night when I got home I noticed one of Kacey’s eye had the eye boogers in it so I cleaned them out. Well this morning when he woke up it was looking worse so I called him in to school and made a dr appointment. I suspected it was pink eye and wanted to make sure so I didn’t send him to school and then he spread it to other kids. The dr confirmed that it was indeed pink eye and the even worse thing is it now appears he has it in BOTH eyes. Then seeing as it was his first time getting drops in his eyes he was freaking out so bad he was shivering. I eventually got the drops in his eyes so hopefully tomorrow will be a little better especially since he has to have them put in 4x a day. The bad thing is he has to miss his last day of school before break. I also was talking to the dr about the ADHD issue and she had me do a test of sorts and Jess has to fill one out and the teacher does too so I’m gonna see if Jess will drop off the test to the teacher since his appointment is the 28th of December and they don’t have school during that time. So hopefully the teacher won’t get pissy and actually fill it out for him so we can hopefully get something done and get started on something. Unfortunately it’s sounding more bleek on not having him on meds because everything is pointing to having to put him on them. So we’ll see what happens.

Ok so I told everyone about my son having pink eye. Well Friday me and my mom had some x-mas shopping to do and we took Kacey wtih us. Well he was in the children’s area at Barnes and Nobles bookstore playing with a train set with a few other kids. My mom was looking for books for him and I wasn’t far looking at ADHD books for him.  So I overhear a employee talking to my mom. This employee was talking rather loud for one and she started talking about his pink eye and how could my mom bring him in the store knowing he had it. I was surprised that my mom didn’t cuss the dumb ho out but she kept her cool. For one I know I’m not the sharpest crayon in the box but why would I be dumb enough to bring my son out in public knowing that he was contagious. So no one bothers to ask us if we got it treated because if they had they would have known that the doctor told us that if he was on the antibotics for 24 hours we could take him in public but did anyone bother to ask OF COURSE NOT!!!! So then I hear one of the kid’s mom’s that was playing with Kacey talking with another few people about how my son was supposedly being pushy with her son and how I just dropped him off over there and left. The chick looked like a richy bitch anyway and she was lucky I didn’t tell her ass off right then and there but I kept my cool. 
It was funny because when I walked over there to see what Kacey was doing  before the whole situation happeneed her little boy was trying to say something to me about Kacey but the mom kept telling him to SSSHHHHH. Well in the end my mom paid for her few items and we left and I think I’m not gonna back again. That is the 2nd incident I’ve had where the employees were rude to us.

X-mas went pretty well. I only got one present but it was definitely worth it lol. I GOT A WII!!!!! So that was pretty awesome even though it was the only gift I got on x-mas. My mom did buy me a pair of red and black tinkerbell pj pants and 2 pairs of jeans and a nice top. So I’m not complaining one bit besides like 3 or 4 wii games. She spoiled me big time lol. Russ and Jaime came down a day before x-mas. Kacey got a train set and lincoln logs from them. He had a ton of fun playing in the snow with Russ before they had to left. We had a ice storm close to christmas eve and our power almost went out and there was actually families in our area that had no power for x-mas. I have pics but I don’t feel like uploading them tonight. I’ll try to do it soon though. Other than that not much else of excitement going on. I got a break from school until January 11th. I found out today that I have bronchitis and my b-day is on Wednesday. I’m gonna have a party for my poor friends lol and then a party on Friday too which we’re going bowling for. So hopefully everything works out for both lol. I had a appointment today for Kacey about his ADHD but the doc doesn’t want to put him on meds just yet. They checked his sight and they are gonna have a family psychologist contact us. At this point I’m for whatever as long as something gets figured out so Kacey can do better in school. So I guess that’s my lame update for now. Hope everyone had a good x-mas.

Well my New Years didn’t involve a hospital or dr of any kind YAY!!!! lol. Me and Jess just sat around watching tv and Kacey almost made it to midnight. He started falling asleep like a few minutes before midnight. Then tonight I had my b-day party at Don Carter’s which is a bowling alley in my town. My friends April, Ginny, Melissa from school and their hubbies came except April who is single and Jess came too. I got a sweatshirt that Ginny made, a wii steering wheel and a gift card to Road Ranger. We had a lot of fun. Our second game we played crazy bowling which was every frame you did something different. Then we were talking about getting together once a month for a game night. I’m gonna see if Belinda wants to go to those. It would give her a chance to get out of the house lol. Other than that still no luck in the ADHD situation. I took Kacey to the dr appointment and all the dr said was that he didn’t want to prescribe pills and that he would contact a psychologist for us. So hopefully they contact us soon about that. Other than that not much else going on. I start school again on January 11th. I have Speech which I’m not looking forward to and Life science which has a lot of math and chemistry. Neither I’m good at.

A burglary was foiled this week when the thief apparently became engrossed in a Nintendo DS game, reports the Herald-News. 
After breaking into a Joliet, Illinois apartment, the man appears to have been so taken with a game on the homeowner’s Nintendo DS that he decided to stop ransacking her bedroom and play it. When the 22-year-old apartment owner returned, the thief fled, taking only a pink iPod Touch — and leaving the DS.
“The victim’s Nintendo DS was on, and it appears the suspect had been playing it,” Deputy Chief Mike Trafton told the Herald-News.
Police are still seeking the game-addled thief. So if you notice an increased police presence at the DS racks in game stores around Illinois, now you know why: they’re hoping he goes looking for another fix.

Well let’s see. I’ve been doing the wii more active that Jess got me for X-mas. The only thing is I don’t have the balance board so I can’t see whether I’m losing any weight or not. I start back to school next week and I’m actualy looking forward to it lol. I have a lot of friends in one class so that should be interesting. The only sucky part is I have SPEECH. I hate doing speeches with a passion. Other than that still haven’t heard anything from the family psychologist that is supposed to be getting in touch with me. If she or he doesn’t contact me by the end of the week I’m gonna give them a call. I’ve been trying to eliminate things I just don’t need anymore so I can get rid of some clutter in my house. Other than that not much else going on around here. FREEZING COLD!!!!!

CHICAGO (AP) — Trouble is, they aren’t really presents. They’re his own belongings meticulously wrapped by friends as a prank while he was out of town.
Louie Saunders’ packages contain everything from couch cushions to the beer in his refrigerator.
His friend Adal Rifai masterminded the scheme after Saunders gave him a spare key. It took 16 people, 35 rolls of wrapping paper and eight hours to finish the job.
Saunders tells the Chicago Sun-Times he’s only been able to unwrap about 10 percent of the packages.
He jokes that the upside is that, with each package he unwraps, he finds something inside that’s just what he needs.

SPRING HILL, Fla. (AP) — Tracie Steger lost hope after search parties and fliers failed to turn up her beloved Giggle-Blizzard. She winced after hearing a car had hit a kitty, and raced to scare off a vulture with a suspicious whisker in its teeth.
Neither was him.
But on Thanksgiving night, a yelp from the porch was.
A car had smashed his back legs a week ago, but Giggle-Blizzard somehow got back. He knew the area from walking unleashed with Steger’s seven other cats and two dogs.
After two operations he’s back in Steger’s menagerie, sporting Christmas-colored splints.
It cost $3,000, but Steger can’t contain her joy.

My mom Tara and my dad John was just the sperm donor because everyone knows he definitely ain’t a dad. 

Now for the fun stuff! Fashion and clothing and shopping and girly things!

1. The stereotyped image of a girl LOVES to shop. Does this hold true to you?
It depends on what I’m shopping for. 
2. Even if shopping isn’t your favorite.. every girl has a favorite store. What’s yours? Borders
3. When you shop: Do you go for when you need something specific, or do you just go to “shop?”
Like I said, something specific.

4. Which are you more likely to purchase: A $15 tube of mascara, or a $35 top?
Neither. I don’t wear makeup and I’m not wasting 35 on one top when I could go to a thrift shop and get a lot more.

slip on shoes, sandals, and slippers lol
6. Describe your favorite pair of shoes?

I used to do it all the time now I never do.

12. Who is your favorite person/people to shop with?
I would say my mom and my friends

13. If I bumped into you at school, what are you likely to be wearing?

Comfortable.

Closet.

No.  Because I have had sex. lol 

4. How often do you have sex? Is it always with the same guy, or are you more casual with it?
Not as much as I would like. I’ve been with my fiancee for 11 years and in that time we went from doing it whenever we could to now whenever we aren’t dead tired or have to get up early the next morning lol. I only do it with my fiancee. 

5. Are you on birth control? Do you use condoms?
I’m on one called Implanion. It’s a small rod that they stick in your arm. It doesn’t hurt at all to get put in and u don’t even feel it. I don’t use condoms. They suck.

Both lol. When I was in h.s. my senior year I thought I might have been pregnant and I have a 5 year old son who was born in 04

7. When did you start your period? How did you react? Who did you tell first?
I think I was about 12 or 13 and I was afraid to tell my mom so I snuck in her pads and was using them because she didn’t need them any more. I finally told her. 

8. Tampons or pads? Why?
I did pads because I was always afraid that my flow was too heavy and that it would leak or I would get that TSS thing.

Nope none of those 

11. Have you ever had sex while on your period? If so, would you ever do it again?
I think I have a few times

12. Have you ever (eek!) leaked through your pants in public?
In middle school.  It was awful! I did it in my Math class but was afraid to get up to go to the bathroom so I waited til class was over and told one of my friends about it. She was nice enough to lend me a pad. 

13. When did you have your first kiss? Who was it with?
I think I was about 11 or 12. It was with the boy who lived across the street from me Donnie McLaughlin. 

14. Was it magical and romantic, or awkward and embarassing? Do you cringe just thinking about it?
It wasn’t too bad. 

Boys, boys, boys! Or girls, if that’s your preference.

69,https://www.opendiary.com/m/torturedsoul_1/how-do-i-attract-drama-5150069/,2010-01-12,How do I attract Drama?,"
I’m seriously wondering how I attract drama. It seems to follow me. This time I wasn’t meddling in anyone’s business I was just asking a simple question. My BIL Russ and his fiancee Jaime are getting married this coming August.(If I already said this sorry for repeating) so Jaime sends me a e-mail saying this: “Hello All! 
I just wanted to send a quick message about what will be happening in the next couple of months…
Around the March/April time, Russ and my bother (for help) will be going to be picking out the tuxes and all that jazz for you boys.  Now, if we are correct, we saw that everyone has a Mens Warehouse around them????  Close by???  If I’m correct in that- the way it will work is that we will give you all the item/style number of the tux (Michelle, the style # for Kaceys as well) so you can go in to the one near you and get measured and put your order in for it.  Like I said- we haven’t even started- not really a need to yet- but we will give you plenty of time to get your tux ordered and I do believe the way it works is you make an appointemtn to get measured and get the order in:)  August 14th is just around the corner!!!  YEA!  Of course when the time comes and  if you have any questions- just ask.  This email was just to get the info out there to let you know what we are thinking:)  *If* you are absolutly sure there is n t a Mens Warehouse in your area or close by, let me know.  
Hey Brent- can we get your new address to make sure we have it correct??  Thanks a ton!  We were not sure about one being around you guys.  If not we have to figure out something else, hey??  Take care!!!
Jaime & Russ.” 
Ok so Jess has only been in one wedding and that was his brother Russ when he married his first wife Nikki so I wasn’t sure how the tuxs went as in who paid for them so I wrote her back and said: “
was just wonderin r we payin for the tuxs?”
Her reply was ” Since when do the bride and groom pay for tuxes and dresses?  Yes- you have to pay for Jesse and Kaceys tuxes to rent- there is plenty of time to save up for it. We have the line up all set- you aren’t backing out are you?  That wouldn’t be cool.”
My question is how do you get we are backing out of the wedding just because we asked who paid for the tuxs. Also is it just me or did the way she wrote that sound kind of snotty. I have never been in a wedding so I don’t know who pays for what. I have been at a wedding as a guest but not in the wedding party. 
So then I wrote back to her “do u know about how much to rent? if it costs too much we might have to check at the thrift shops to get one. i have never been a part of a wedding so had no clue who pays for what lol.”
And she wrote back “1st off- no, not sure what the cost is- do not want to estimate but not more then $100 for jesse’s tux and shoes rental (groomsmen usually have paten leather shoes that they rent as well)  Kaceys outfit- not sure.  #2- NO THRIFT SHOP OR ANYTHING ELSE OF THE KIND.  These tuxes need to match one anothers….this is how it is done and will be done.  I already ahve heard from Brent saying he is not sure on the $ issue as well- you ALL have had time and still have 3-4 months for saving.  If they cannot do this for their brother- who is his family- then i guess thats it.  We NEED a definite answer now–YES or NO.  There is too much planning involved to make this perfect for us- for heavens sake- the program for church is pretty much figured out the line up is set (much less other things)  so if there is or will be a problem for Jesse and Kacey to be in the wedding for Russ then tell us now.  This is a lot of pressure on our mind- not only for the weddings sake- but its shitty that there is even a question in yours and Brents mind to be there for Russ.  Again- there should be no money issues- you knew more then a year in advance.  Remeber the letter I sent to you guys and his parents etc….????  It was August 3rd 2009 and it stated “start saving now” to celebrate and be there for us— not for me so much but for RUSS!  Let me know Michelle.  Russ has already called Jesse to find out what is going on!”
I understand that wedding planning puts a LOT of pressure on the bride and groom but the way she worded it seems a little snotty. I understand about the saving part but it’s hard to save money when you barely make enough to pay your bills. We live paycheck to paycheck so when it is all said and done we have enough for my bowling and going out to eat or some kind of date. So to me it made it seem like if we can’t afford the tuxs we can’t go. How is that fair? I’m sorry we aren’t millionaires who can afford a bunch of expensive stuff. They make good money. Russ works for Pepsi. I work part time as a personal assistant and Jess works at a grocery store full time and is trying to get his martial arts school going. Then she tried to say oh you knew about this like last August. Yea we did but we are trying to get our bills paid off so we can get better credit and move forward with our plans to get married. They have always known we don’t have that much money and to basically say if you don’t have money you don’t give a rat’s ass about Russ is just nonsense. 
So here’s my reply ” I’m not trying to start a war or anything dumb but i think it’s mean to try to say that Jess doesn’t want to be there for Russ’s wedding because of our money problems. Russ I got your message and I’ll let Jess know when he gets home that you called.  We honestly don’t have any extra money to save for the tuxs. Our paychecks barely cover the bills and with Jess’s school not exactly off the ground yet we are basically living paycheck to paycheck. We are not trying to make excuses but that is what our money situation is right now.  Hopefully my school money or our tax return will come in and we will be able to. It has nothing to do with we don’t want to be there it’s just our money situation is REALLY tight right now. I’m sure Jess will try to save money for them. As for Kacey’s I’m not sure if it would even be worth renting one because he can’t keep anything clean and I’m pretty sure u guys don’t want him walking around with plastic over it lol.”
and then her reply was”  Listen- i am not fighting or starting anything i am stating the facts.  This is what we need to do to keep the plans rolling.  We cannot have people going back and forth “are we or  aren’t we”….Brent is already out.  He could not give us a straight answer and Russ pretty much said forget it and told him he had to go.  Phone call over.   Russ is agreeing and i am reading EVERYTHING that you write and I write back.  He agrees…. We need to know by March 1st that is the latest.  We cant wait longer then that.  Russ said he feels miss lead- again- he says you had over a year to plan…what are you going to do about a hotel stay for the weekend if you plan on coming??  Thats why we told everyone to plan ahead.  Russ says he understands there are money issues- but its been over a year.  We cannot reitterate that enough.
I just want to say again- your wedding day comes once in a lifetime.  You said yourself- you dont know what goes into planning a real wedding but i am here to tell you- theere is A LOT of small details you are not aware of.  
Most importantly- Russ says he is disappointed.  We can’t wait til the last minute and HE feels there is always something.  this is Russ…you know I haveabout 30-35 people on my side that are on our list??  The other 210 are Jaimes family and friends…that sucks for me and it makes me feel sick to my stomach.  Her side is helping with the wedding- being supportive. How long was it going to take for you guys to let me know there was a ever an issue???  No more emails- i will jsut talk to Jesse about it….”
Ok Russ has known about our money problems for how long? Again everyone that knows us knows we have money problems. Yes we are trying to improve our situation and compared to where we were a few years ago we are making huge progress but don’t try to act like you didn’t know about it. The whole situation just frustrates me to no end. I’m really thinking of not going because the way it seems they don’t really like me. When I did the x-mas lists I got bitched at for that and now this I just feel like whatever I do I get yelled at for it usually by Russ. I don’t want to cause Jess to lose the only brother that cares about him because of me.

Well I got a call today while I was at work from the principal at Kacey’s school saying he had gotten pulled out of class for misbehaving AGAIN. So after I was done with work I went to the school and talked with the principal in the hopes that maybe we could figure out something to do for him. We really didn’t come to any GREAT ideas lol but he did say I could go and sit in  Kacey’s class and kinda watch him. So I was there basically until he left to go home. I noticed something very interesting. I really regret what I said about Mrs. Wilson because I finally understood what she has to go through with the kids. There was one girl Katie who was off playing with toys when they were all supposed to be on the rug listening to the teacher. Then there was a boy named Alex who was calling Kacey a baby while I was sitting right next to Kacey. At that time I was there to help Kacey and wasn’t about to tell off Alex lol but I sure did feel like it. Then there was another boy named Christian I know his mom and dad and he was sayin something mean to Kacey. So after everyone left I talked to his teacher to see if I could volunteer and help her so I’m gonna start doing that Tuesdays and Thursdays and maybe Mondays, Wedsnesdays and Fridays when I get off work at 1 or see if Jess will come in Mondays and Fridays at least. So I’m excited and interested to see how that is gonna go. Hopefully we will see more improvement in Kacey’s behavior if he knows I’m around.

Well my first night was Tuesday. I have Life Science and Speech this quarter. Life science doesn’t seem too horrible and speech I’m just dreading. It’s hard for me to get up in front of people and talk. Our first night the teacher had us do a self-introduction and tonight we did this two truths and one lie. I sucked at it though because I put my favorite color is pink, i have 6 cats and 2 dogs, and my fiancee is a 2nd degree black belt and owns his own school. Well we got to ask each other questions to try to help figure out which one was a lie and someone asked what are some of your favorite pink things and I totally blanked out. Shows how good a liar I am lol. Then after I went I started thinking I could have said instead I have 3 boys and named kacey, timmy and alex. I’m  really not looking forward to the bigger speeches we are going to be doing. So today was my first day volunteering in Kacey’s class. He was pretty good during the day but towards the end had some issues. I finally got to see Liz the lady from the Mildred Berry Center and so she was talking to me about the medication thing and tried to get a hold of a different doctor about prescribing meds for Kacey. So hopefully she’ll give me a call back tomorrow. If not I will be calling her. So that is some progress in the ADHD area.

Best Friend
You told me I was good enough
That I deserved a chance
That I should have the courage
To sing, to laugh, to dance
You told me not to care
What other people thought
Cause you are my best friend
A gift that cant be brought
And now I want to give you
What you always gave to me
Love, friendship, caring
And most important, dignity
But how can I do this
In ways that equal yours
Cause what I want to give you
Cant be bought in stores
What I want to give you
Is only a simple phrase
It may not seem like very much
But it is in many ways
What I want to give you
Will never pay my due
What i want to give you
Is a simple, kind Thank You.

Even Though I Lost a Friend
We were always together,
We swore wed never part.
Where I was, there you were.
Best of friends from the start.
We both looked alike,
With hair and eyes of brown.
When you were happy, I smiled,
When I was upset, youd frown.
There was only you in my world,
And no one but me in yours.
We shared everything friends could share,
Our music, our clothes, our chores.
Then suddenly this friendship we knew,
Began to change too fast.
The magic of us had disappeared,
It was clear this wouldnt last.
We struggled and struggled to save it all, 
We were put to the ultimate test.
Then before we knew it, we had both changed,
In the long run, for the best.
We had become two different people,
As our friendship reached great dangers.
The two little girls who were once best friends,
Are now young ladies and strangers.
And for the first time in a while,
I finally feel free.
And even though I lost a friend,
I somehow gained a me.

Have You Ever

Have you ever lived my life?
Spent one minute in my shoes?
If you havent then tell me why
You judge me as you do.
Have you ever woken up in the morning
Wondering if this was your last day on Earth?
Have you ever left your house
Unsure if youd return?
Have you ever seen your friend get shot
Outside of his favorite store?
Have you ever seen a friend die
From drugs hed never used before?
Have you ever seen your mom get beat up
By your stepdad messed up on booze?
Have you ever had an unwanted pregnancy
Forcing you to choose?
Have you ever sat beneath the stars
Hoping God will hear?
Have you ever seen your friend drive away
After way too many beers?
Have you ever had a friend
Experiment with weed?
Have you ever covered up guilt
By doing a good deed?
Have you ever considered suicide
As the only way?
Have you ever tried to hide yourself
Behind the things you say?
Have you ever wanted to protect
Your friends and everyone in sight?
Have you ever felt such pain
That you cried yourself to sleep at night?
Have you ever lived my life,
Spent one minute in my shoes?
If you havent, then tell me why
You judge me as you do.

I Am Loni
	Why do I even try? If theres one thing I should have learned, its, try or not, Ill probably screw up. Mom says, Loni, a lady shouldnt say things like screw up.  That just proves my point. I even screw up how to tell you that I screwed up.
	I know, I have so much going for me. Dont even go there. Dad brags about my grades, and Moms proud of the person I am and all my activities. Grandma goes on and on  about my pretty face. Yeah, too bad about the rest of me, I think to myself.
	Im not, like, big enough to be featured as The Amazing Amazon Teen in The Guiness Book of World Records, but I am big enough not to like shopping with my friends. How cu-u-u-u-ute! they squeal over every rack of clothes. They know theyll fit into anything. I cant commit until I scan the plastic circle dividers to see how high the sizes go. 
	I pretend that clothes dont matter to me. That explains my semi-grunge look everyone takes for my chosen style. No outfit is complete without a sweater, flannel shirt or sweatshirt tied around my waist to cover up……oh…… everything.
	So, when we go to the mall, Im the designated shopper. You know, like the designated driver who goes to a party but doesnt partake. I stand outside the changing rooms to ooh and aah when they emerge for the three-way mirror check. Only after a careful  inspection do I reassure them that their thighs, legs, waist or bottom do not look too big in that outfit; otherwise, it would be taken as insincere. 
	It takes all I have not to roll my eyes when they hand me a piece of clothing and plead, Can you see if this comes in a smaller size? Give me a break. Where should I look? The childrens department?
	I really  did screw up, though. Being a self-appointed good sport, I tried out for the volleyball team with my friends. Heres the abd part: I made it.
	It seems I have a killer serve. I use it for self-defense . The harder I ram the ball, the less likely it will be returned and force me to clod around the court keeping it in play. 
	To make matters worse, we keep winning. This is the first winning season of any girls sport in our schools history. Volleyball fever took over, and attendeance soared. Just my luck. And those pep rallies. Theres a thrill. Jumping around high-fiving while my name echoes over the PA system.
	In our small town, making it to State Finals is newsworthy. Our team was pictured sitting in the bleachers in a V for Victory formation. I was the connecting bottom of the V, front and center in all my glory.
	Loni leads the Charge to State! read the headline. Not bad. I didnt even pretend to protest when Mom bought copies for the relatives. I was pleased when the team framed the picture and hung it in the tunnel between our locker room and the arena. It soon became our team gesture to blow kisses at our picture every time we passed it. 
	It was the night of the final game, and we had homecourt advantage. The series was tied two games to two. I led the teams run for our triumphant entrance. Cheers stormed down the tunnel to meet us. We glanced at the banners posted along the walls, taking energy from the words.
	YOU GO, GIRLS! YES YOU CAN! WERE #1!
	We were ready to blow kisses at our picture when shock froze me. Two words were written in red on the glass. Two words that totally changed the headline.
	Loni THE BULL leads the charge to State!
	The horns drawn on my head completed the insult. 
	I felt myself emptying until I wasnt me anymore. I was nobody. The team bunched behind me.
	Who did this?
	Who would be so mean?
	Their questions had no answers. They thought they were as upset as I was, but they were wrong. I wasnt upset at all. I was in shock. 	
	So this is the truth, I thought. This is who I am. 
	And all the words around me didnt heal the hurt because nobody said the three words I needed to hear most: Thats not true.
	The team moved me down the tunnel. There was no time to sort myself. What was real seemed like a dream, and I couldnt shake myself awake. The chants of Loni! Loni! sounded hollow. I let the cheers of the many be muted by the jeers of the few.
	We won the coin toss and took to the court for my first serve. Around me the team was pumped and ready to go. I rolled the volleyball in my palms to get its feel and mechanically went into my serving stance. All I could see were the words…..THE BULL, THE BULL, THE BULL.
	I tossed the ball up, but before my fist made contact the shout OLE! hit me. I stutter-stepped and missed the ball. I told myself not to look, but my eyes were drawn anyway. I couldnt pick out who it was. The team tried to buck me up with back slaps and thats okays.  But it didnt help.
	I went through the rotations until I was at the net. My concentration scurried between the game and the bleachers. When the ball skimmed the air above my head, a loud snorting sound came from the front row.
	Thats taking the bully by the horns! someone yelled. The player behind me made the save and set up the ball for me to spike. But I wasnt looking at the ball. I was staring into the faces of the five high-school guys who were mocking me. My humiliation only fueled their taunts.
	Give me a B, give me a U, give me a double L, too. Whats that smell? LONI! LONI! LONI!
	Why didnt someone shut them up?
	The coach called a time-out. Loni, can you get your head in the game?
	I shrugged.
	Why are you letting a few people who dont even know you decide for you who you are?
	I shrugged again.
	Loni, youre valuable as a person and to your team. Unkind words dont change who you are unless you decide they change you, she said.
	Sounds good in theory, I thought, but this is the real world.
 	Im keeping you in, but if you cant work through this Ill pull you.
	I nodded.
	I walked past the boys to take my place in the game.
	With each step I took, they stomped their feet to shake the floor. I got the point. Very funny.
	I also had to walk past my teammates, and spite of my weak showing, they were still rooting for me. You can do it.  Youre the best.
	Something in me gave way. The quote on a magnet on my grandmas refrigerator popped into my thoughts: God dont make no junk.
	I knew what I knew, and I knew myself-I wasnt junk. I felt my value to the very depths of my soul. Who was I anyway? What did some immature boys know about me? There were so many people who loved and supported me, and it was time to do my best for them and for myself.
	And just like that, I was free of them. Oh, they continued to stomp their feet  with each of my steps. I didnt like it, but it didnt matter. They were powerless over my life. 
	The game was close, and we played hard. The winning serve fell on me. It was my moment, and I took it. The ball went up, my fist came forward and hit it right on. It was a perfect power serve unreturnable by the other team. The crowd went wild. The pep band started beating out our school song. The team huddled around me.
	Shouts of Loni! Loni! vibrated the arena. The funny thing is, the cheers didnt feed me like they used to. THey were great, but the joy I felt, the freedom I felt, the sense of myself I had filled me more than any cheers.
	There was more than one victory that day, and the game was not the most important one.

Losing Friends
You do not need to tell me, 
That friends can grow apart;
That even the near and dear
May someday break your heart. 
The ones that you love now,
Cant guarantee tomorrow;
And the ones that bring you joy,
May also bring you sorrow.
For although things may seem
Just perfect at the time,
People sometimes change,
And leave your heart behind.
You do not need to tell me,
Ive been through it all enough,
I know just what it feels like
To lose someone you love. 
Whether its a buddy or a pal,
A confidante or best friend,
Its the pain of losing them
That hurts too much to mend.
And now Im really scared,
Its happening once again.
I know that I am losing
One more of my best friends.
Once, we were inseparable,
We loved to be together,
And I thought I knew for sure
That friends wed be forever.
I believed it in my heart,
But it looks like I was wrong,
I guess that our relationship
Just wasnt quite that strong.
For it didnt take an argument,
A disagreement or a fight.
At some point we just started
To lead two separate lives.
I know that neither of us wanted
For it to end some day,
But now were different people,
Were heading different ways.
It hurts so much to go through this
For yet another time,
And it hurts to see that you are fine,
While Im the one whos crying.
For Im always thinking back
To the good times that we shared,
Yet you just walk away from them
Like you dont even care.
Ive lost so many people
That Ive cared about a lot;
So this last scar will rest
With all the others on my heart.
And carefully Ill trust again,
And one day in the end,
My heart will be much stronger
From the pain of losing friends.

Mogadon
	Mogadon, an eighteen-month-old black-and-white cat, was probably just enjoying a pleasant spring day in April 1993 when she was apparently startled by the voice of her owners girlfriend telling her to get back into the apartment. The problem was, Mogadon was enjoying the fresh air and sunshine from a spot on a ledge that was twenty-one stories above the streets near Leeds, Alabama.
	Claire Quickmire had only the kittys best interests at heart when she attempted to call Mogadon inside, but the cat seemed to become confused. Perhaps she was using to taking such orders from her owner, Mike Hawksworth.
	In the next few seconds, the cat had fallen from her precarious perch and was plummeting toward the sidewalk below. 
	Claire recalled that the ride to the sidewalk in the high-rises elevator was the longest elevator ride of her life. She fully expected to find Mikes kitty to be nothing more than a mangled mess of blood and fur. 
	She was astonished to find the dazed and frightened cat being comforted in the arms of a neighbor.
	According to eyewitnesses, Mogadon had streaked toward the cement, struck a bush at the side of the high-rise, then bounced onto the sidewalk. The befuddled cat picked itself up, then walked off, slightly dazed, but apparently not a great deal worse off than she was before the twenty-one story plunge to earth.
	Claire gathered Mogadon into her arms and rushed her to the veterinarian, who found no broken bones, but who located numerous cuts and bruises to testify to the miracle survival. The supercat required twenty-four stitches, which seemed a very small price to pay for having endured an impossible fall.

No Time
I wrote this poem from personal experience. I would like to tell people not to blow off their friends for anything. When you need them, they might already be gone. I was lucky and my friends forgave me, but some others might not be so fortunate.
My love filled my life,
No time for a single friend.
Every minute devoted to him,
On whom my happiness did depend.
Theyd call to talk, 
All those friends of mine.
And Id say Sorry,
But I have no time.
I did not care when
My friends slipped away, 
cuz my love made me feel good.
He made everything okay.
He and I lived
In a world we made together.
So happy and carefree,
Wed be in love forever.
Then one day I woke up,
The sun on my face,
And a hint of his shadow.
He was gone without a trace.
I cried and I cried
Alone, all by myself.
I could not feel better,
I needed some help.
So I picked up the phone,
Called those friends I once had.
Theyd help me through this
And be sorry I was sad.
I said, I need to talk,
When they got on the line.
But they replied, Im sorry, 
We just dont have the time.
All I heard was their silence,
As I hung up the phone. 
And thats when I realized
That I was all alone.

Lucky
	When Suciles son Joe was around 12 years old, he brought home a beautiful little white kitty all covered with grease and told her that the kitten was her birthday gift. Suciles response was intended to very firm: Honey, we just cant have a cat.
	But, Mom- Joe frowned- Its your birthday gift. 
	So they cleaned the little kitty up. Sucile wrapped in a towel and put it on her lap. She just curled up and seemed at home, she said. By that time, I just couldnt give her up, so we kept the cat. Joe is 23 now, so you can figure out how long we had the cat.
	Sucile and her children were living in South Dakota when the cat she christened Lucky came into their lives. As the years went by, she began to notice that Lucky seemed to be very psychic or was a very good weather predictor. If it was a couple of hours before a storm or tornado was coming, she would run up my wall,Sucile said. I finally realized that she was warning me in advance of every storm.
	Lucky liked to lie on Suciles stomach while she read or watched television. But when I came home after having had some surgery on my stomach, Lucky seemed to know and would not lie on my stomach, but only on my neck, Sucile said. Sometimes I would say to her , If you love me, blink your eyes. She would blink them twice, then look up at me and purr, touching me lightly with her paw.
	After a few years, Sucile got another kitten as a playmate for Lucky, and she felt that both of the cats considered themselves her loyal guardians.
	The day that they gave their lives for me started out as a very quiet and peaceful summers day,  Sucile said. I was sitting in my home in South Dakota, writing a letter, and Lucky and her playmate were sitting on the window ledge, watching me. Suddenly a big storm came up, and I heard a loud crack as lightning struck a nearby tree. I looked up to see a big red ball outside my kitchen window. Somehow the lightning bolt had created the dangerous phenomenon of ball lightning. That deadly charge of electricity appeared about to pass through the window and to come directly for me.
	Sucile will always remember how her beloved cats positioned themselves so that their bodies intercepted the ball lightning. The cats just lit up. Their entire bodies glowed, and there was a bluish white aura around them as the lightning touched them. Afterward, when the firemen came, they said they could not believe that the charge had not continued through the cats and hit me.
	Sucile knows in her very core of being that her cats saved her life by intercepting the lightnings deadly charge. Miraculously, Lucky and her kitty friend had survived the terrible shock, but they had lost their hair and were badly burned.
	My veterinarian told me that he knew that I loved my kitties, but if I really loved them, I would put them to sleep, Sucile concluded her story. I allowed him to do so to prevent my darling cats from enduring any more suffering on my behalf.

One Final Lesson
	One rainy day I was at home playing on my computer when the phone rang. It showed up on my caller ID as one of my really good friends from across the state.  I anxiously grabbed for the receiver and answered. But instead of the lively reply that I had come to expect from my friend, I heard nothing but sobbing. She was crying so hard she couldnt even talk. Finally she got it all out. Two of her best friends had just died. Slowly over the next hour and a half I got the story piece by piece.
	After I hung up I couldnt clear my mind of what I had just heard. It was a scenario I had heard too many times in my life. So I pulled the facts together and wrote a story of what happened. The following is what I came up with.
	The last day of school is today. It couldnt be more perfect since today is also yoru seventeenth birthday. All that you and two of your buddies have planned is a night out on the lake. 
	For a couple of hours you and your friends sit in a little aluminum boat in the middle of the lake under the colorful skies painted by a setting sun. As you guys empty can after can from a case of beer, you talk about the usual: girls and your plans for the summer, and what its going to be like when school begins and all three of you are finally seniors.
	You dont notice the wind beginning to pick up, churning the calm, smooth lake into something dangerous. By the time you realize its time to come in, the waves have already begun to thrash your little boat. Your friend gets the engine going and handles the steering while you work the throttle, maybe just a little more than you should. With a jolt, the little boat is sent speeding across the waves. Halfway to the landing you helplessly watch in horror as you notice a huge wave coming at you from the side. Your friend turns the boat into the wind and toward the wave as you throttle down the engine for all youre worth, but not soon enough. The wave hits the boat at an angle, sending her off the crest and smashing down into its trough. All three of you are knocked against the side, as the force of the wave capsizes the boat and sends you all into the lake. 
	You kick for the surface but your legs feel heavy and sluggish. It feels as if something is pulling you down into the depths. Your boots, now weighted by the water, are pulling you deeper and deeper into the darkness. As much as you try, the light of the surface becomes more and more distant. As your last few seconds of consciousness pass, desperately try to pull your boots off. You tear at the laces but they wont come undone. You panic, thrashing wildly, doing anything just for a breath of precious air. Before blackness consumes you, images of your friends and family swim through your mind. No, you think to yourself. This isnt happening to me. Im only a teenager. I cant die!
	And then, almost as an answer to your thoughts, you miraclou7sly find yourself on the sandy shore-dry, warm and sober. You see on e of your friends swimming toward the beach. You call out to him, but he doesnt respond. He pulls himself out of the lake, and he stands there shivering as water drips from his T-shirt, looking at the overturned boat. He calls out for you and your friend. Hey! you yell as you walk over to him. Im right here. But he doesnt seem to notice. He calls out again, and again you give him your same response: Hey! Im right here! You step in front of him but his frantic eyes look past you, around you and even through you.
	Oh, God, he says to himself. What have I done? He takes a few steps backwards, then turns and runs up the road.
	Hey! you yell. Hey, where are you going?! But its almost as if you had said nothing at all. You watch helplessly as he continues to run until he disappears form sight. 
	For a time, all is silent. Ten minutes pass, then twenty. After thirty, mabye thirty-five minutes a siren pierces the silence. At first you dont notice. But within minutes ignoring it is impossible. Down the road come a multitude of emergency vehicles, followed in short succession by cars and trucks, some of which you recognize as belonging to friends. As people jump out of the cars you notice that your parents are there also. Your father walks somberly while your mother sobs endlessly in his arms. You run over to your parents, yelling out to them, but they dont seem to hear. They pull an officer aside to talk, to find out what is going on. As you get closer you hear the officer say, Maam, Im sorry , but your sons body is missing. We have called in helicopters to search the beaches with searchlights. Men on horseback have gone up to scan the cliffs…… divers will come in tomorrow.
	But you dont need all of them! you yell. Im right here! Im not dead! Its not supposed to happen to me!
	As the night draws to a close, the lake fills with more and more boats. People from all over your little town are out on the water with flashlights, calling out  for you and your missing friend. And no matter how hard you yell, no one seems to hear you. You walk by groups of some of your best friends, and even some of those people with whom you never really got along. Some of them are trying not to cry, yet holding those who are.
	You watch your girlfriend crying and calling out for you as her friends try to comfort her. Dont cry, your soundless voice says to her. Im not dead. I cant be. Im only seventeen. This cant happen to me.
	Night gives way to morning and no one has left; instead, more have come. Your mother is out on the dock. She has been there for nearly five hours. You watch as your father and an officer walk out to her and you hear your father whisper, Cmon honey, its time to go now. She breaks into tears while you try desperately to hold back yours. She wont go. Not until the body of her son is found. The flood of emotions hits you like a brick wall when the police have to sedate her in order to move her from the end of the dock. This shouldnt be happening , you tell yourself. Im only a teenager. I cant be dead.
	The names of you and your friend, which have been called out by rescuers all night long, are drowned out by the high-pitched roar of two army helicopters. Immediately, their searchlights pierce the fading darkness and begin sweeping over the lake and the beaches that surround it.
	One of the searchlights passes overhead and you put your arms in front of your face as the blinding light engulfs you. And then light is gone…..
	You lower your arms and look around. The helicopters are gone, as are the police, medics and the firemen. They are all gone. The boats that once carried searchers and their flashlights bob gently in their moorings at the dock. Your friends no longer sit on the shore, crying at the realization that two of their companions are forever lost. 
	Instead, the sun rises over the clear and pristine lake. The sky is blue, with not a cloud in sight. Your clothes ripple as a cool west wind slips behind you.
	In a clearing you can see a small congregation of people. As you walk closer, each and every one of them becomes familiar-each of them a friend or family member. There are two sections of folding chairs, all of which are occupied. Before them, beside a little makeshift podium, propped above a pile of flower bouquets are two pictures; one of your friend whom you never saw after the boat capsized andthrew all three of you into the lake. You hesitate to look at the other picture because you already know-its you.
	As one friend leaves the little podium, another stands and takes his place. She speaks about what the two of you meant to her and how much she will miss you. One by one, friends and relatives come up to speak, each emphasizing how much you will be missed. And you sit there and watch. All the time not believing that it did happen to you. That you died, even though you were still a teenager.

In March 1990, four-year-old Aurelie Assemat nearly died when she fell from a relatives fourth-floor apartment in Grugny, France. Although she lay in a coma for a month and her parents feared that they would lose her, Aurelie finally awoke. Sadly, though, she could no longer speak, she was nearly blind, and she was paralyzed down her left side.
	Desperate to find some way to enliven their little girls tragic condition, Georgette and Jean-Louis Assemat hit upon the idea of giving her a cat. They were delighted to see that the green-eyed tabby seemed to lift their daughters spirits at once. Aurelie named her new friend Scrooge, and they became inseparable companions.
	Georgette and Jean-Louis were greatly relieved to see that they had found an antidote to Aurelies loneliness. She would hug the cat and cuddle it all day long. 
	In August 1991, the Assemat family left their home in Grugny for a vacation in the country. Scrooge seemed to like the countryside as much as his human family members did, but when it was time to go home, it suddenly appeared as though the cat had decided he liked the new environment a bit too much. The Assemats were packed and ready to return home, but Scrooge was nowhere to be seen. He had wandered off at the last minute and had apparently gotten lost. 
	Finally, the hour arrived when they had no choice other than to begin the trip home without their feline friend-their daughters dearest companion. Although Aurelie had lost her voice due to her fall, she cried for her lost Scrooge throughout  the entire 600-mile journey. 
	The effects on Aurelie of losing her cat proved to be devastating. She did not eat; she did not sleep; she lay sobbing in her bed, staring at Scrooges empty basket. Her parents were afraid that their daughter had lost all interest in life.
	As the months went by, Aurelie grew ever more listless and despondent. When they had first returned from the country, Georgette and Jean-Louis knew that their daughter had kept alive a hope that somehow Scrooge would return to her. Although they felt that such a dream of reunion was an impossibility, they said nothing to dash Aurelies faith.
	Then, on July 9, Aurelie and Georgette heard a feeble scratching at their front door. Aurelie began to move her wheelchair toward the door with an excitement that she had not experienced for nearly a year. 
	When Georgette opened the door, they were astonished to behold a woefully bedraggled cat. Then, for the first time since her accident, little Aurelie spoke: 
Scrooge! Its my Scrooge! Hes come home! 
	The cat walked to the girls side and rubbed itself against her legs. Scrooge had found his way across the 600 miles that separated him from the Assemats home in Grugny. It had taken him nearly eleven months to do so, but he had accomplished what had seemed to Georgette and Jean-Louis to be the impossible.
	Georgette remembered that she was hugging and kissing Aurelie as her daughter was hugging and kissing Scrooge.
	But the determined cat had paid a terrible physical price to complete his odyssey. It was immediately apparent to the Assemats that, fighter though he was, Scrooge was on his last legs. They resolved to take him directly to a veterinarian just as soon as they had given him something to eat.
	The veterinarian was advised to spare no cost to repair the rugged Scrooge, for the Assemats had received a firm realization during his absence that he was the best cure they could provide for Aurelie. The fact that she had regained her ability to speak at the very sight of her feline friend was additional proof  that  Scrooge was Aurelies most effective prescription for a more complete recovery.
	Scrooges proud tail had to be amputated. The veterinarian expressed an educated guess that Scrooge had caught his tail in a trap and had yanked it free so that he might continue his journey home to Aurelie. Scrooge had gained his freedom with such a desperate act, but he had also wounded himself to the extent that his tail was riddled with gangrene. He also required an emergency hernia operation.
	A few months later-after extended Scrooge therapy-Aurelie was speaking in an almost normal manner, and she had begun to walk with the aid of crutches. Without Scrooge , the Assemats dread to consider what might have become of their little girl. 
	Some days after he had returned to their household, Aurelie told her mother: My love guided Scrooge home. He knew that I was crying for him, and he just followed my tears home.

In the summer of 1993, drivers for Mollerups Van and Storage Company in Roy, Utah, were puzzled by strange noises coming from some furniture pieces they were storing for a military family that was in the process of relocating. Once they had pinpointed the peculiar sounds as issuing from a dresser, they opened a drawer to discover a female striped cat that resembled a bag of bones.
	Terri Anglen, of Mollerups, declared the cat survival an absolute miracle. Her owners had been transferred to Hill Air Force Base in Utah from their present home in Michigan, and it was apparent that the cat had been trapped in that dresser drawer for two weeks without any food or water.
	When the astonished owners of the cat were contacted, they said that they had searched high and low for their feline friend before their vanload of furniture had left Michigan for Utah. What had happened to their cat had been a complete mystery to them. Terri Anglen said that the owners asked the cats rescuers to be certain that she was fed and watered and loved until someone arrived to take her home.

The Last Song for Christy
	Matt never did drugs. He spent his afternoons and nights riding his skateboard through backstreets of the small town that raised him. His friends would experiment with the usual substances, but not Matt.
	Christy was his sister; six years older. She and Matt were close. They both liked tattoos and metal guitar riffs. Christy would paint incredible portraits and abstract images, and Matt would jam on his guitar. They shared stories, and they always said I love you before bed.
	When Matt and I started dating, the first family member I was introduced to was his sister, Christy.
	See this tattoo on my wrist. Christy has it, too. We got them together. He lit up whenever he talked about her. 
	Matt was at the peak of his skateboarding career, and Christy was still painting. She was beautiful. They looked a lot alike-black hair, blue eyes. Christy was petite- her makeup dark and interesting-her lips, red and passionate. She looked the part she played-the artist, the once-rebel who survived hell and was now back, living life while revisiting the shadows of her past with each stroke of her paintbrush.
	When Matt was in junior high, the police took Christy away. His parents wouldnt tell him why, but he found out on his own. Heroin. She had been doing heroin, and they caught her. She was only eighteen. She spent the next several months in rehab while Matt waited, guitar riffs, skate tricks-waited.
	When she finally did come home, things were different. Christy seemed distant and Matt didnt know what to say. A few months later, they came again-the police. Matt was sleeping, and they knocked down the door. His sister was screaming as they dragged her away, this time to prison.
	I asked Matt what it was like, how that affected him. I tried to imagine hearing her scream. I wondered how it was possible for Matt to sleep when he knew his sister was cold and alone in her cell somewhere. I couldnt, he said, I couldnt sleep.
Did you visit her? I asked.
Matt was silent.
Did you ever talk to her about it, tell her how much it hurt you, tell her that you couldnt sleep, tell her that you were afraid?
	There was a long silence. Shes okay now. Shes been clean for eight years. Shes great. Its over. The drugs, its all over. Matt spoke to the wind when he spoke of Christys past. His voice would fade out into oblivion and then hed change the subject.
	When Christy was finally released from jail and then rehab, Matts family decided to move. They moved south, away from Christys reputation and the backstreets where Matt had conquered curbsides and half-pipes in the small town by the sea. Christy was clean and never again did Matt wake up to his sisters arrests or a cold sweat after the nightmares that plagued him while she was away. She had been clean for six months, and then two years, and then four. Matt went to high school and Christy moved back up north to go to school.
	Were you afraid? I asked.
	Nope. She was going back to school. I was glad. She was going to pursue her art. She was so talented, you know, Matt whispered.
	I knew. I had seen her artwork. It hung in Matts room, in his kitchen and bathroom. She had even painted straight on the walls. Matt let her paint all over them.
	Matt and I dated during my senior year. He was my first serious relationship. Christy came down to visit Matt and the family pretty often, and whenever she came down, Matt would rush to be with her. She was the woman in his life, more than I ever was. Christy and Matt were best friends. They were like nothing I had ever seen. Matt would light up when Christy entered a room. He was so proud of her. She was his angel, his big sister, and everything she said was amusing, brilliant or just cool. 
	I got the call a few months ago.  Even though Matt and I had broken up over a year before, we were still close friends. The call wasnt from him, though. It was from another friend.
	Becca, look…… I thought I should tell you. Christy died. She overdosed. Heroin. Im sorry.
	The air went numb, and the murmur of the TV in the other room muted. I dropped the phone and stared at the wall for what seemed like hours.
	But she was clean. Ten years now! She was clean….. I mumbled softly, my voice tainting the wind that blew on that rainy afternoon. I called Matt. He was with his family up north, where it happened.
	Matt told me, She wasnt supposed to die. She was going to be married in a couple of months. They had the date and everything. We found this picture of her. She was wearing wings. You should see it; she looks like an angel. 
	He wasnt crying. I searched the blues of his eyes for a tear, but he was hypnotized. The shock. The impossibility of his earth angel lost somewhere in the universe. It was too much.
	The last time I saw her, she was so happy. I had my guitar and I was playing for her, and she was laughing. She was so beautiful and so happy. She was going to be a makeup artist. She would have been the best. Matt was smiling, and I took his hand.
	She didnt have to die. She was clean for ten years, and then one day she started up again. Her body couldnt take it. She passed out, and they couldnt revive her. They couldnt make her come back.
	Matt spoke during the funeral. His words were soft and eloquent, and he looked out at Christys friends and family and told them how much he loved her, how much he will always love her. He showed his tattoo, the one that he and his sister got together. Some laughed. Some cried. 
	The picture that Matt had mentioned to me was perched behind the podium, between lilies and roses. Matt was right. She did look like an angel-red lips and blue eyes, wearing white and angel wings.
	That night, after the funeral, Matt and I went down to the cove where he and Christy used to laugh. How could she do this? Why? Why did she have to do this? he asked. 
	He cried. I cried, too.
	I talked to Matt the other day. I asked him how he was doing. Im okay, he said. Most of the time. Sometimes I cant sleep. Im waiting for Christy to come home or for her to call. Sometimes I have these nightmares. I play the guitar a lot, even more than I used to. I have to practice. Im in a band now, and we play gigs and stuff. The last song of the set is always the best. Thats the song I practice over and over again till its perfect. It has to be just perfect because I play it for Christy. The last song is always for Christy.

These Days
These days I think of Taylor.
Flying high with people she thinks are friends.
Im living my life to the fullest,
We only live once, right? she says.
She wants to try anything, 
And do everything.
She is unaware of the bags under her eyes,
Or the slight tremble of her hands
When she thinks shes sitting still.
Taylor lives in a world of highs and lows.
As the lows get worse, 
She craves the highs even more.
She makes sacrifices to feed her addiction.
Sometimes she wishes there were a way to escape, 
To free herself. 
But the steps to take are too high
And the ropes holding her are too strong.
I reach out to her,
But only our fingertips touch.
If only she would take one more step.
Surely drugs can be demolished for Taylor.
These days I think of Emma.
Burying her face in a pillow,
Curled up on her bed, lying next to the wall. 
She is afraid to breathe or move,
So she lays still and gasps for air only when she must.
Stop it, Dad, she whimpers,
But Emma knows no one hears her.
She tightly closes her eyes and prays for it be over.
She hears the cries of her mother and the rage of her father.
Somehow she blames herself.
If only she had the strength to stop it.
Some days she stands up and fights,
But it only makes it worse for her mother.
Where will she find a solution?
Theres got to be a solution.
Her dad says that he loves her and that its not his fault.
She thinks dads never lie.
Surely domestic violence can be stopped for Emma.
These days I think of Megan.
Standing in front of the mirror, 
Looking at herself.
Ribs pressing out against her skin,
Her hip bones seemingly awkward and huge
Compared to her tiny waist.
The dark circles under her eyes,
And the slightly yellow tint of her teeth. 
But Megan doesnt see the person in the mirror,
Staring back at her.
She sees someone who is ugly,
Who will look okay once she loses a few pounds.
She craves compliments.
When people say, You are so skinny
The hunger inside of her dies down, 
At least for a little while.
Megan tells them, Im not hungry or I already ate.
When she must eat, her stomach cant hold in her food
And she ducks into the bathroom.
Jogging, running, exercising in the rain and snow, 
She must keep going.
Counting the calories, 
And stepping on the scale each night.
Surely eating disorders can be cured for Megan.
These days I think of Alyssa.
Huddled in a corner.
Her eyes red and puffy,
Her sleeves and collar soaked with tears.
The lights are dim
And her head rests against the cool wall.
Her long legs and bare feet are stretched out in front of her
And Sammy the teddy bear is tucked under her arm.
A half-filled glass of warm water sits on the floor next to her, 
And has been there for the last two hours.
Her fingers are tightly curled around the little pills
That are resting in her sweaty palm.
Her ears strain for the sound of the telephone.
The voice of someone from school ,
A person jsut wanting to talk.
But she knows that isnt going to happen.
Alyssa doesnt have many friends.
She reaches down and grasps the glass.
I love you, Mom and Dad, she whispers.
Inside she feels empty
And the pulsating heart in her chest aches.
Her throat is dry and hoarse.
The raspy sound of her own breathing
Makes her feel even more alone.
She doesnt want to be alone.
Surely suicide can be prevented for Alyssa.
These days I think of Hope.
I see her hurrying down the hall,
Trying to dodge all the hateful glances.
People say things and frustrations run through her mind,
Begging to burst out.
What makes me so different from you? she thinks,
But doesnt dare ask. 
Hope already knows the answer.
Its the color of her skin,
The shell that is merely a cover to whats on the inside.
But no one wants to know her inner person,
They only see a face.
She clings to her family,
And depends on her own kind.
She loses herself in music.
The voices have no color,
But the words speak out.
Hope wishes there were no black vs. white,
Race vs. race.
She wishes people were seen only for who they are, 
Just people.
Surely racism can be ended for Hope.
These days I think of Ashley.
Fumbling through her purse,
Pretending to search for chapstick,
But really trying to dig up the courage to face
What she is about to hear.
Her hands tremble and her lips quiver
As she blinks ever so softly.
The tears are welling up in her eyes
And could at any moment break through
And stream down her face.
Ashley realizes the consequences of her choices, 
But doesnt fully understand what her punishment will be.
The long painful days and nights to come,
Having to slowly watch the light inside her die.
She hears her heartbeat and wonders when
The day will come that it, too, stops.
She feels like she has just read the last page of a book
And now must go back and finish the few chapters before.
She wishes she didnt know and that somehow the book will be rewritten.
But, Ashley knows how the story ends,
And she says, Never take life for granted.
Surely AIDS can be cured for Ashley.
These days I think of teenagers.
Struggling to overcome all of the obstacles life throws at them.
They are in a hurry to grow up, to become adults.
Adults who wish they hadnt grown up quite so fast.
Surely adolescence can be survived by all of us.

Through It All
I know that this world
Isnt always the safest place
I wanted to write this down
Because we could die tomorrow
And you d never know
Just how much you mean to me
You have always been there
Ready to offer an ear, a hand
Or a shoulder to cry on
The happy times were great
The shared secrets and giggling
The sleepovers and bike rides
The hours spent practicing basketball
And just hanging out
But you pulled me out of the bad times , too
No matter how angry I was
How stupid I acted
How depressed I felt
You and often only you
Stuck by me through everything
(And I do mean everything)
You always seem to know
When to give advice
And when to just listen
Sometimes you are my alter ego
My better half
And sometimes Im yours
I have envied you
And been angry at you
I have stolen your spotlight 
And hidden in your shadow
We have bickered
And shared hugs
We have screamed and yelled
And on occasion, cried
But through it all
I have and forever will
Love you as my best friend

What you do Today
Break away from all that is real.
Forget how you think, forget how you feel.
Live life today, forget things gone by.
Live your own truth and not the worlds lies.
Create a life of living, be spontaneous and brave.
Go off the beaten path, find your own road to pave.
For if you live life for you and you alone,
Youll be your own master and create your own throne.
The world around may tell you what to do or say,
But tomorrow is too worrisome; concentrate on today.
Things may have gone wrong in the days of the past,
But he who looks at yesterday always finishes last.
Learn from your mistakes and move on twice as wise.
Help those less fortunate, smile at those you despise.
And once your life is over, once your journeys done, 
You will know you ran the race, and you will know youve won.
For yesterday is hopeless and tomorrows far away,
But in the end it will matter what you do today.

(SORRY DON’T HAVE THE PIC)
The K9 pictured here is Brutus, a military K9 at McChord.
He’s huge – part Boxer and part British Bull Mastiff and tops the scales at 200 lbs. His handler took the picture. Brutus is running toward me because he knows I have some Milk Bone treats, so he’s slobbering away! I had to duck around a tree just before he got to me in case he couldn’t stop, but he did. Brutus won the  Congressional Medal of Honor last year from his tour in  Iraq .
 His handler and four other soldiers were taken hostage by insurgents. Brutus and his handler communicate by sign language and he gave Brutus the signal that meant ‘go away but come back and find me’. The Iraqis paid no attention to Brutus. He came back later and quietly tore the throat out of one guard at one door and another guard at another door. He then jumped against one of the doors repeatedly (the guys were being held in an old warehouse) until it opened.
 He went in and untied his handler and they all escaped. He’s the first K9 to receive this honor. If he knows you’re OK, he’s a big old lug and wants to sit in your lap. Enjoys the company of cats.

Thought you’d find this interesting.
Talk about animal intelligence and bonding with humans!
Remember that they can’t do a lot of things for themselves and that they depend on you to make their life a quality life!

A PET’S TEN COMMANDMENTS
1. My life is likely to last 10-15 years.. Any separation from you is likely to be painful.
2. Give me time to understand what you want of me.
3. Place your trust in me. It is crucial for my well-being.
4. Don’t be angry with me for long and don’t lock me up as punishment. You have your work, your friends, your entertainment, but I have only you.
5. Talk to me.. Even if I don’t understand your words, I do understand your voice when speaking to me.
6. Be aware that however you treat me, I will never forget it.
7. Before you hit me, before you strike me, remember that I could hurt you, and yet, I choose not to bite you.
8. Before you scold me for being lazy or uncooperative, ask yourself if something might be bothering me. Perhaps I’m not getting the right food, I have been in the sun too long, or my heart might be getting old or weak..
9. Please take care of me when I grow old. You too, will grow old.
10. On the ultimate difficult journey, go with me please. Never say you can’t bear to watch.. Don’t make me face this alone. Everything is easier for me if you are there, because I love you so.
Take a moment today to thank God for your pets. Enjoy and take good care of them.
Life would be a much duller, less joyful experience without God’s critters.

Well tonight was my first counseling appointment with a family psychologist through the doctor’s office. She wanted to talk to me to get some background info. The next appointment is just gonna be her and Kacey so it should be interesting. Hopefully now I can get some real help with the issues he has and we can learn how to do something about it for school and home. Other than that not much excitement going on. Tonight for speech class had to do a speech about a superhero. I picked the Charmed ones. I kinda screwed up towards the end of the speech though but overall think I did pretty well. I have a informative speech due Feb.4 (go figure Tab lol). I’m gonna do it on self-defense and bring Jess in to help with doing a few self-defense techniques and then offer some safety tips. So I will let everyone know how that one goes. Hopefully good lol.

SAYING GOODBYE TO MOTHER…….
        You don’t have to own a cat to appreciate this one! You don’t even have to like ’em!
        We were dressed and ready to go out for the New Years Eve Party. We turned on a night light, turned the answering machine on, covered our
        pet parakeet and put the cat in the backyard. We phoned the local cab
        company and requested a taxi. The taxi arrived and we opened the front
        door to leave the house.
    The cat we put out in the back yard, scoots
    back into the front door. We didn’t want the cat shut in the house because she always tries to eat the bird. My wife goes out to the taxi, while I went inside to get the cat.
The cat runs upstairs, with me in hot pursuit.. Waiting in the cab, my wife doesn’t want the driver to know that the house will be empty for the night. so, she explains to the taxi driver that I will be out soon, ‘He’s just going upstairs to say goodbye to my mother.’
A few minutes later, I get into the cab. ‘Sorry I took so long,’ I
said, as we drove away. ‘That stupid bitch was hiding under the bed. I had to poke her with a coat hanger to get her to come out! She tried to take off, so I grabbed her by the neck. Then, I had to wrap her in a blanket to keep her from scratching me. But it worked! I hauled her fat ass downstairs and threw her out into the back yard!
The cab driver hit a parked car.

The doctor said, ” Carl, the good news is I can cure your headaches”.
The bad news is that it will require castration.
You have a very rare condition which causes your testicles to press on your
spine, and the pressure creates one hell of a headache.
The only way to relieve the pressure is to remove the testicles.”
Carl was shocked and depressed. He wondered if he had anything to live for.
He had no choice but to go under the knife..
When he left the hospital, he was without a headache for the first time in
20 years, but he felt like he was missing an important part of himself. As
he walked down the street, he realized that he felt like a different
person. He could make a new beginning and live a new life.
He saw a men’s clothing store and thought, “That’s what I need… a new
suit.” He entered the shop and told the salesman, “I’d like a new suit.”
The elderly tailor eyed him briefly and said, “Let’s see…size 44 long.”
Carl laughed, “That’s right, how did you know?”
“Been in the business 60 years!” the tailor said.
Carl tried on the suit; it fit perfectly.
As Carl admired himself in the mirror, the salesman asked, “How about a new
shirt?”
Car l thought for a moment and then said, “Sure.”
The salesman eyed Carl and said, “Let’s see, 34 sleeves and 16-1/2 neck.”
Carl was surprised, “That’s right, how did you know?”
” Been in the business 60 years.”
Carl tried on the shirt, and it fit perfectly.
Carl walked comfortably around the shop, and the salesman asked, “How about
some new underwear?”
Carl thought for a moment and said, “Sure.”
The salesman said, “Let’s see…size 36.”
Carl laughed, “Ah ha! I got you, I’ve worn a size 34 since I was 18 years
old.”
The salesman shook his head, “You can’t wear a size 34. A size 34 would
press your testicles up against the base of your spine and give you one
hell of a headache.”
New suit – $400
New shirt – $36
New underwear – $6
Second opinion – PRICELESS

** This story really touched me because my brother is mentally handicapped and there can be some very cruel people in this world but there are also some wonderful people who love everyone no matter what color, age, or handicap. **

I try not to be biased, but I had my doubts about hiring Stevie. His placement counselor assured me that he would be a good, reliable busboy.  But I had never had a mentally handicapped employee and wasn’t sure I wanted one.  I wasn’t sure how my customers would react to Stevie. 
He was short, a little dumpy with the smooth facial features and thick-tongued speech of Downs Syndrome.  I wasn’t worried about most of my trucker customers because truckers don’t generally care who buses tables as long as the meatloaf platter is good and the pies are homemade. 
The four-wheeler drivers were the ones who concerned me; the mouthy college kids traveling to school; the yuppie snobs who secretly polish their silverware with their napkins for fear of catching some dreaded “truck stop germ” the pairs of white-shirted business men on expense accounts who think every truck stop waitress wants to be flirted with.  I knew those people would be uncomfortable around Stevie so I closely watched him for the first few weeks. 
I shouldn’t have worried.  After the first week, Stevie had my staff wrapped around his stubby little finger, and within a month my truck regulars had adopted him as their official truck stop mascot. 
After that, I really didn’t care what the rest of the customers thought of him.  He was like a 21-year-old in blue jeans and Nikes, eager to laugh and eager to please, but fierce in his attention to his duties.  Every salt and pepper shaker was exactly in its place, not a bread crumb or coffee spill was visible when Stevie got done with the table.  Our only problem was persuading him to wait to clean a table until after the customers were finished.  He would hover in the background, shifting his weight from one foot to the other, scanning the dining room until a table was empty.. Then he would scurry to the empty table and carefully bus dishes and glasses onto his cart and meticulously wipe the table up with a practiced flourish of his rag. 
If he thought a customer was watching, his brow would pucker with added concentration..  He took pride in doing his job exactly right, and you had to love how hard he tried to please each and every person he met.   
Over time, we learned that he lived with his mother, a widow who was disabled after repeated surgeries for cancer.  They lived on their Social Security benefits in public housing two miles from the truck stop. Their social worker, who stopped to check on him every so often, admitted they had fallen between the cracks.  Money was tight, and what I paid him was probably the difference between them being able to live together and Stevie being sent to a group home.  That’s why the restaurant was a gloomy place that morning last August, the first morning in three years that Stevie missed work. 
He was at the Mayo Clinic in  Rochester getting a new valve or something put in his heart.  His social worker said that people with DownsSyndrome often have heart problems at an early age so this wasn’t unexpected, and there was a good chance he would come through the surgery in good shape and be back at work in a few months. 
A ripple of excitement ran through the staff later that morning when word came that he was out of surgery, in recovery, and doing fine. 
Frannie, the head waitress, let out a war hoop and did a little dance in the aisle when she heard the good news. 
Belle Ringer, one of our regular trucker customers, stared at the sight of this 50-year-old grandmother of four doing a victory shimmy beside his table. 
Frannie blushed, smoothed her apron and shot Belle Ringer a withering look. 
He grinned.  “OK, Frannie, what was that all about?” he asked. 
“We just got word that Stevie is out of surgery and going to be okay.” 
“I was wondering where he was.  I had a new joke to tell him.  What was the surgery about?” 
Frannie quickly told Belle Ringer and the other two drivers sitting at his booth about Stevie’s sur gery, then sighed:  “Yeah, I’m glad he is going to be OK,” she said.  “But I don’t know how he and his Mom are going to handle all the bills.  From what I hear, they’re barely getting by as it is.”  Belle Ringer nodded thoughtfully, and Frannie hurried off to wait on the rest of her tables.  Since I hadn’t had time to round up a busboy to replace Stevie and really didn’t want to replace him, the girls were busing their own tables that day until we decided what to do. 
After the morning rush, Frannie walked into my office.  She had a couple of paper napkins in her hand and a funny look on her face. 
“What’s up?” I asked.
“I didn’t get that table where Belle Ringer and his friends were sitting cleared off after they left, and Pony Pete and Tony Tipper were sitting there when I got back to clean it off,” she said. “This was folded and tucked under a coffee cup.” 
She handed the napkin to me, and three $20 bills fell onto my desk when I opened it.  On the outside, in big, bold letters, was printed “Something for Stevie”. 
“Pony Pete asked me what that was all about,” she said, “so I told him about Stevie and his Mom and everything, and Pete looked at Tony and Tony looked at Pete, and they ended up giving me this.” She handed me another paper napkin that had “Something For Stevie” scrawled on its outside. Two  $50 bills were tucked within its folds. Frannie looked at me with wet, shiny eyes, shook her head and said simply: “truckers.” 
That was three months ago.  Today is Thanksgiving, the first day Stevie is supposed to be back to work. 
His placement worker said he’s been counting the days until the doctor said he could work, and it didn’t matter at all that it was a holiday.  He called 10 times in the past week, making sure we knew he was coming, fearful that we had forgotten him or that his job was in jeopardy.  I arranged to have his mother bring him to work.  I then met them in the parking lot and invited them both to celebrate his day back. 
Stevie was thinner and paler, but couldn’t stop grinning as he pushed through the doors and headed for the back room where his apron and busing cart were waiting. 
“Hold up there, Stevie, not so fast,” I said.  I took him and his mother by their arms.  “Work can wait for a minute. To celebrate you coming back, breakfast for you and your mother is on me!” I led them toward a large corner booth at the rear of the room. 
I could feel and hear the rest of the staff following behind as we marched through the dining room.  Glancing over my shoulder, I saw booth after booth of grinning truckers empty and join the procession. We stopped in front of the big table…  Its surface was covered with coffee cups, saucers and dinner plates, all sitting slightly crooked on dozens of folded paper napkins.  “First thing you have to do, Stevie, is clean up this mess,” I said.  I tried to sound stern. 
Stevie looked at me, and then at his mother, then pulled out one of the napkins…  It had “Something for Stevie” printed on the outside.  As he picked it up, two $10 bills fell onto the table. 
Stevie stared atthe money, then at all the napkins peeking from beneath the tableware, each with his name printed or scrawled on it.  I turned to his mother.  “There’s more than $10,000 in cash and checks on that table, all from truckers and trucking companies that heard about your problems.  “Happy Thanksgiving,” 
Well, it got real noisy about that time, with everybody hollering and shouting, and there were a few tears, as well. 
But you know what’s funny?  While everybody else was busy shaking hands and hugging each other, Stevie, with a big, big smile on his face, was busy clearing all the cups and dishes from the table. 
Best worker I ever hired. 
Plant a seed and watch it grow. 
At this point, you can bury this inspirational message or forward it fulfilling the need! 
If you shed a tear, hug yourself, because you are a compassionate person. 
Well…  Don’t just sit there!  Send this story on!

casionally in life, it’s handy to be able to get out of awkward
social situations. In such events, it behooves you to know
these…
        MORE THAN FIFTY WAYS TO GET RID OF BLIND DATES
                (and other social catastrophes)
1. At dinner, guard your plate with fork and steak knife, so as
   to give the impression that you’ll stab anyone, including the
   waiter, who reaches for it.
2. Collect the salt shakers from all of the tables in the
   restaurant, and balance them in a tower on your table.
3. Wipe your nose on your date’s sleeve. Twice.
4. Make funny faces at other patrons, then sneer at their
   reactions.
5. Repeat every third third word you say say.
6. Give your claim to fame as being voted “Most Festerous” for
   your high school yearbook.
7. Read a newspaper or book during the meal. Ignore your date.
8. Stare at your date’s neck, and grind your teeth audibly.
9. Twitch spastically. If asked about it, pretend you don’t know
   what they are talking about.
10. Stand up every five minutes, circle your table with your arms
    outstretched, and make airplane sounds.
11. Order a bucket of lard.
12. Ask for crayons to color the placemat. This works very well
    in fancier venues that use linen tablecloths.
13. Howl and whistle at womens’ legs, especially if you are
    female.
14. Recite your dating history. Improvise. Include pets.
15. Pull out a harmonica and play blues songs when your date
    begins talking about themselves.
16. Sacrifice french fries to the great deity, Pomme.
17. When ordering, inquire whether the restaurant has any live
    food.
18. Without asking, eat off your date’s plate. Eat more from
    their plate than they do.
19. Drool.
20. Chew with your mouth open, talk with your mouth full and
    spray crumbs.
21. Eat everything on your plate within 30 seconds of it being placed
    in front of you.
22. Excuse yourself to use the restroom. Go back to the head
    waiter/hostess and ask for another table in a different
    part of the restaurant. Order another meal. When your date
    finally finds you, ask him/her “What in the hell took you so
    long in the restroom?!?”
23. Recite graphic limericks to the people at the table next to
    you.
24. Ask the people at the neighboring table for food from their
    plates.
25. Beg your date to tattoo your name on their derriere. Keep
    bringing the subject up.
26. Ask your date how much money they have with them.
27. Order for your date. Order something nasty.
28. Communicate in mime the entire evening.
29. Upon entering the restaurant, ask for a seat away from the
    windows, where you have a you have a good view of all exits,
    and where you can keep your back to the wall. Act nervous.
30. Lick your plate. Offer to lick theirs.
31. Hum. Loudly. In monotone.
32. Fill your pockets with sugar packets, as well as salt and
    pepper shakers, silverware, floral arrangements… i.e
    anything on the table that isn’t bolted down.
33. Hold a debate. Take both sides.
34. Undress your date verbally. Use a bullhorn.
35. Auction your date off for silverware.
36. Slide under the table. Take your plate with you.
37. Order a baked potato for a side dish. When the waiter brings
    your food, hide the potato, wait a few minutes, and ask the
    waiter for the potato you “never got”. When the waiter
    returns with another potato for you, have the first one back
    up on the plate. Repeat later in the meal.
38. Order beef tongue. Make lewd comparisons or comments.
39. Get your date drunk. Talk about their philosophy. Get it on
    tape, and use good judgement in editing to twist their words
    around.
40. Discuss boils and lesions, as if from personal experience.
41. Speak in pig latin throughout the meal (Or ubber-dubber
    language, or just nonsense).
42. Take a break, and go into the restroom. When you return to
    the table, throw a spare pair of underwear on the back of one
    of the chairs. Insist that they just need airing out.
43. If they are paying, order the most expensive thing on the
    menu. Take one bite.
44. Bring 20 or so candles you, and during the meal get up
    and arrange them around the table in a circle. Chant.
45. Save the bones from your meal, and explain that you’re taking
    them home to your invalid, senile old mother, because it’s a
    lot cheaper than actually feeding her.
46. Order your food by colors and textures. Sculpt.
47. Take a thermos along, and hide it under the table. Order
    coffee, and fill the thermos one cup at a time, taking advantage
    of the free refills.
48. Insist that the waiter cuts your food into little pieces. In
    a simliar vein, insist that he take a bite of everything on
    the plate, to make sure no one poisoned it.
49. Accuse your date of espionage.
50. Make odd allusions to dangerous religious cults.
51. Don’t use any verbs during the entire meal.
52. Pass the hat in the restaurant. Use the proceeds (if any) to
    pay the bill.
53. Break wind loudly. Add color commentary. Bow.
54. Feed imaginary friends, or toy dolls you’ve brought along.
55. Bring a bucket along. Explain that you frequently get ill.
And, finally….
56. Tell them you moderate rec.humor.funny on the nets.

If Men Got Pregnant
by Chachi

Maternity leave would last two years… with full pay.
There would be a cure for stretch marks.
Natural childbirth would become obsolete.
Morning sickness would rank as the nation’s #1 health problem.
All methods of birth control would be 100% effective.
Children would be kept in the hospital until toilet trained.
Men would be eager to talk about commitment.
They wouldn’t think twins were so cute.
Sons would have to be home from dates by 10:00 PM.
Briefcases would be used as diaper bags.
Paternity suits would be a fashion line of clothes.
They’d stay in bed during the entire pregnancy.
Restaurants would include ice cream and pickles as main entrees.
Women would rule the world.

Grant me the serenity to accept the things

the courage to change the things I cannot accept,
and the wisdom
to hide the bodies of those people I had to kill
today because they pissed me off.
Also, help me to be careful of the toes I step on today,

Help me always to give 100% at work:
12% on Monday, 23% on Tuesday, 40% on Wednesday,
20% on Thursday, and 5% on Friday.
Also, help me to remember:
when I’m having a really bad day, and it seems that people
are TRYING to piss me off,
that it takes 42 muscles to frown
and only 4 to extend my middle finger
and tell them to bite me.

Well nothing super exciting going on lately. Kacey is going for his first counseling appointment this coming Thursday. This should be interesting to say the least lol. My schooling is going good. Just had to do my informative speech which I did on self-defense and had Jess come help with. It seemed to go pretty good. One girl actually started crying during her speech which was on Lyme Disease. She’s a sweet girl. It took them 6 years I think she said to diagnose her correctly. Then no one around our area believed her or would help her so she has to go to New York to get treatment. There was one girl who is REALLY religious and did a speech on who god was. YIKES!!! I’ve been doing a pretty good job with doing my Wii EA active workouts and trying very hard not too eat the wrong foods. Hopefully it’s paying off. Don’t have a scale so can’t really tell yet lol. The 15th of this month is mine and Jess’s anniversary. We have been together since ’99 or ’98 so that’s quite a long time. Then this Friday gonna have a scary movie night at my house. Hopefully everyone comes and we have a good time. Not sure what movies yet except Paranormal activity is definitely gonna be one of them lol. I love that movie. Then Saturday I have bowling. Friday is kinda gonna suck though b.c I have to get up early at 8:30 until 4pm for a inservice meeting I missed but the good thing is I get paid for it lol.  I might bring a book so I don’t fall asleep. So hopefully I won’t fall asleep during movie night. 
So other than that all the pets are doing good except I think Coco has more tumors or growths so I’m really starting to think it’s cancer. She is still in good spirits and going to the restroom and eating and drinking so until she stops doing those things we’ll keep her around. I still don’t believe my MIL had the nerve to say just put her to sleep. Jess told her “well that would be like us putting you to sleep because you’re old and have medical problems.” I couldn’t help but chuckle at that one. As for Russ and Jaime haven’t heard a thing from them except a e-mail from Jaime asking me to not e-mail her claiming that her computer wasn’t working but she’s on yahoo messenger a lot and Facebook. Maybe she just didn’t have the guts to tell me she doesn’t want to talk to me anymore. Doesn’t matter to me because if they say Kacey can’t be in the wedding then me and Kacey will be staying home and they won’t have to deal with me at all. 
Well I think that sums up my update.

108,https://www.opendiary.com/m/torturedsoul_1/movie-night-94-5150134/,2010-02-13,Movie Night,"
Well scary movie night went quite well. Everyone showed up and we watched Paranormal activity. Then a few people had to go and the remaining ones watched Carrie 2 The Rage. Our next event is going to be a girl’s night out. I suggested a male strip club in WI but not sure if we are gonna go there or just to a bar. It’s not so bad now that they banned smoking in the bars so hopefully it isn’t that bad. Other than that not much going on. Can’t wait for the nice weather to get here. We filed our taxes and Jess is supposed to be getting 4,000 back and I’m getting like 650 the only bad thing is we have to find out if Rasmussen is gonna take their money out of Jess’s refund. I hope not but I wouldn’t doubt it. As long as they don’t take a huge chunk out of it. We were thinking of getting Kacey a twin bed, a few more wii games, a wii balance board, another nunchuck, another controller, clothes, maybe a few videos, some new BIG towels lol,car repairs, and try to pay off some bills. So we will see if we will be able to do all that. I’m really hoping we can
    
"
109,https://www.opendiary.com/m/torturedsoul_1/finally-2136-5150135/,2010-02-19,FINALLY,"
Well yesterday I took Kacey to a dr that works through the health department in our area. She assessed him and said YES to the medication. HALLEUJAH!!!! The only bad thing is he can’t start taking it until Monday because the dr has to send something to the state because of his age. So we might have a breakthrough. I’ll definitely keep everyone updated on his progress. We are trying to figure out some type of sport to get him into that he would like to do that doesn’t involve a lot of equipment to buy just in case he doesn’t like it. We tried tae kwon do but he just doesn’t listen and distracts the other students but maybe once we put him on the meds we will try it again. That is if the meds actually help him. 
Jess of course doesn’t want him on meds but I told him we tried other options and nothing else seemed to be helping so it’s worth a try and he started talking about all these questions he had but he didn’t go to the appointment with us. I told him if he had questions he should have went with and asked them. MEN. So my persuasive speech is due this coming Thursday. I’m really nervous about it. I’m doing it on Animal Cruelty and making the laws stricter. I’m doing a powerpoint presentation as my visual aid so hopefully I can figure out how to do it with the projector. Tuesday the teacher is letting us use the time to put the finishing touches on our speeches so I’m gonna save the powerpoint presentation to my flash drive and bring it in to make sure it works and maybe my teacher can help me figure out how to work the presentation on the projector lol. 
Other than that not much else going on. I got a 256 last Saturday at bowling. It was my 114 handicap and my score of 170. They had a potluck for Valentine’s day so they had these garden pizza things. It was some kind of like crossiant bread with cream cheese and broccoi florets and shredded cheese. They were REALLY good. So my teammates kept telling me go up and get more lol and the other team was threatening to take them away. My team is pretty funny. It’s a older married couple and a guy who is mentally handicapped . We are third from the bottom lol but we still have fun. 
Tuesday night at school I got called an “overachiever” in my speech class because we do weekly speeches and this one was about our hobby or past time so I did mine on bowling and brought in a few of my trophies, medals and my plaque from lousy bowler’s league lol and this one girl named Lauren who is a sweet funny girl who has Lyme Disease and has to have a PIC line in her arm was like “what you got in the bag?” So I told her it was my trophies for my speech and she was like” UH OH we got an overachiever in the house.” Who brings visual aids for a weekly?” Then for most of the class we were talking about belching and farting lol. Our speech teacher bought a huge pizza in for us. It was good I took some home for Jess.

110,https://www.opendiary.com/m/torturedsoul_1/meds-41-5150136/,2010-02-24,MEDS,"
Well after some interesting issues  with the prescription for the meds we were FINALLY able to get Kacey on medication. It’s called Focalin and actually seems to be helping him. His teacher noticed a great difference in his behavior at school and I have noticed it too. There has been no side effects. The only bad thing is the med usually wears off about lunch time so when the Dr calls back in about a month to refill it I’m gonna see about the 2nd dose she was talking about. Other than that things are starting off good. I got a call today from our tax lady that Jess’s tax money came in. I’M GOING SHOPPING LOL. He is supposed to be getting 4,000 and some change back so hopefully that is the case. Here was my thoughts on what I was gonna do with some of the money.
scrubs need about 5 pairs of tops at least pants I might get a few but not too many
clothes mainly for me and jess
wii charger station
2 more wii controllers and a nunchunk
probably about 4 games 
some movies (not too many)
get the cars fixed (might be able to have a friend from school’s husband do the work for cheap YAY!!!)
towels
the balance board for wii
the car registrations
catch up on rent
pay off some bills
get kacey a new bed
and I think that is about it. 
So yea definitely happy about things. School is going pretty good too. For life science we have to make a model of a cell. Our group is doing it out of jello and mostly food items lol and for speech tonight I did my persusive on stricter laws regarding animal cruelty.  I think I did pretty well. So yep that’s all my excitement for now. 
    
"
111,https://www.opendiary.com/m/torturedsoul_1/new-stuff-96-5150137/,2010-03-10,New stuff,"
Can’t remember which stuff I talked about getting so sorry if I repeat some things. Well so far we have gotten some new clothes, a new “Big boy” bed for Kacey with a new Spiderman sheet set minus the spread, some other blankets since his were still from when he had the crib mattress,a scale, a new Dell Laptop, a new dryer that isn’t gonna be here until the 26th. some wii games, a few movies, a new cell phone for me, and I think that’s about it. We also FINALLY got the old lawsuit from our old landlords completely paid off. I’m supposed to be getting 2,000b back from school this Friday hopefully and we will be using that for some more bills. Kacey is still doing very good on his Focalin. The only thing is I think we might have to put him on another dose for the afternoon. I’m doing good in school. I got a B in my life science class and I believe a A in my speech class. The last speech is driving me crazy though because I can’t decide what to do for it. So I’m waiting to get feedback from my teacher about it. Next quarter for school I have to take 3 classes but one is online so that makes it a little bit easier. Today I got wireless internet on my laptop which is where I’m writing this entry from and got it on my wii too so if any of my friends wanna play games with me on the wii let me know. 
Jess has a tournament in Springfield next week. I’m so happy I finally get to see my friend Tab who it feels like I haven’t seen in forever. Then the following week the girls from school are gonna have a “girls night out” at a bar. I’m the designated driver lol. I told them we should go to a guys strip club but nobody wanted to go. PARTY POOPERS lol. So other than that not much else going on. The lady I work for named Marjorie has been driving me crazy. I get yelled at for not  being on time which is ok because I do deserve it but my problem is when she has a appointment and I show up early and we end up being late because she isn’t ready or we could have made an appointment but because of her we don’t. I call her before I even leave my house and it takes less than like 3 minutes to get to her house and she could be downstairs waiting  but it takes her like 10 minutes to even get downstairs. Yesterday she didn’t say anything about having an appointment the only way I knew was because she called and said where was I and that she had a appointment at like 10:15 and it was like 10:10 when I checked my messages. So I don’t know. She’s a great lady but that has just been driving me nuts lately. I will take responsibility and say that I suck at getting to her house when I’m supposed to but when I do show up early or on time and she has some place to go she’s never ready and makes us late anyway. Then lately she has been trying to get me to work days I’m not supposed to be working. Believe me I would love the extra hours but the problem comes down to she is only allowed 10 hours a week. For my 3 days I work for her it comes up to 9 so I can’t work extra days because of that unless she gets approved for more hours and it’s not constant enough to warrant more hours. 
Then she will get mad at me because I can’t drop everything and take her somewhere on a day I’m not even supposed to be working. Sorry for the rant but it was just driving me crazy. So that is my update for now.

Kenai
Owners: Todd Smarr and Michelle Sewald
Erie, CO
It was 4 a.m. when Kenai, a 14-year-old Bernese mountain dog mix, started to whine and bark. One of her owners, Todd Smarr, heard Kenai and immediately felt there must be something wrong. Todd, along Kenais other owner Michelle Sewald, and their friend Karen Hull, were staying in the basement of a vacation house during a weekend getaway with family and friends. When he got up to comfort Kenai, Karen stood up and said she didnt feel well. Todd woke his wife, Michelle, so she could help Karen, and right away they all realized that none of them felt well. Thats when Michelle collapsed into Todds arms, unconscious. They rushed upstairs, woke their friends, and after a quick discussion, realized there must be a carbon monoxide leak. The seven adults, two children, and four dogs, escaped to fresh air. Authorities determined the leak was coming from the stove and the highest threat had been in the basement. Todd was treated at a local hospital and Michelle and Karen were flown to a hospital in Denver and treated in a hyperbaric chamber.
Calamity Jane
Owners: Homer and Shar Pauley
Aledo, TX
Calamity Jane was still recovering from having her leg amputated following an old gunshot wound and giving birth to a litter of seven puppies when her foster mom, Shar Pauley, took her and the familys other two dogs outside for a break on a cold January night. Suddenly, Calamity Jane bolted to the neighbors yard, hackles raised, and began barking and growling with ferocious intensity. Shar then heard a car door slam and watched a car speed out of her neighbors driveway. She grabbed the dogs and hurried back inside. Minutes later, the neighbor came to their door and asked them to call 911. His family and guests, including two children, had been held at gunpoint for close to an hour during a violent home invasion. But when the intruders heard Calamity Jane, they yelled to one another that there were people outside and quickly fled the terror stricken home. 
Benson
Owners: Linda Hamilton and Jaimie Szenher
Binghamton, NY
Around 2:30 a.m. on a cold February night, Jamie Szenher, Linda Hamilton, and her two sons were startled awake by Benson, their 5-year-old rescued Golden Retriever. His bark was unusually intense. While he usually slept in a back room with their other three dogs, that night he was positioned on a couch in the front of the house, barking at flames that were shooting out of their neighbors house across the street. When Hamilton and her family woke and saw the glow of the flames, they immediately rushed to their neighbors house and began pounding on the door, yelling for them to get out. They finally woke the family, who had just enough time to grab their children, 2 and 4, and escape. The fire, caused by a malfunctioning space heater, destroyed the house as well as the familys two cars.

Jackson
Owner: Jeffrey Pattie
Rahway, NJ
Jeffrey Pattie was enjoying the smooth sound of classic rock when his 8-month-old Doberman pinscher, Jackson, began crying and running through the house with his hackles raised. For nearly an hour and a half, Jeffrey tried to figure out what was wrong. He ruled out a bee sting and tried to distract the dog with food. Instead of eating, Jackson tore through the screen door, trying to get outside.
More confused, Jeffrey called a friend who suggested he let Jackson outside because he would likely show Jeffrey what the problem was. Jeffrey opened the door, and a frenzied Jackson bolted outside and began jumping up on the back fence. When Jeffrey went to investigate, he heard a faint cry for help. He then saw his 90-year-old neighbor lying on the ground underneath a door than had fallen on her as she had stepped outside to do a few chores. Jeffrey called out for a neighbor to check on the woman as he dialed 911.
Jackson sat by the fence and calmly watched the EMTs as they treated the fragile woman, who they estimated had been lying outside for several hours. They said that without Jackson, she may not have survived.
Jobe
Owners: The Wiederin’s
Omaha, NE
Two years ago, Dominic Wiederin discovered that he was violently allergic to a host of foods and other things he loved. Since then, he has been rushed to the hospital more than 100 times for severe allergic reactions.
In November, the 19-year-old fell asleep in a recliner after returning home from the hospital. As usual, Jobe, the 8-year-old Hungarian Vizsla who Dominic had rescued from the side of the road a few years before was close by his side.
Around 3 a.m., Jobe began to howl and bark as he charged down the hallway. Dominics mom, Teresa, got up and met Jobe at her bedroom door to see what was wrong. Jobe turned around and ran back down the hallway. Teresa followed and saw Dominic struggling for air. He gasped, saying he couldnt breathe. They rushed him to the hospital and discovered that Dominic had inadvertently visited a home that had cats, to which he is highly allergic.
This marked the third time that Jobe has alerted the Wiederin’s to Dominic’s allergic reactions in the middle of the night- with the first two incidents being so severe that Dominic was unable to speak. 
Max
Owners: Dr. Michael and Christine Szap
Little Neck, NY
Although he typically barks to alert if someone is around, Maxs incessant barking one August day seemed to indicate something different. 
The Labrador retrievers owner, Dr. Michael Szap, stepped outside to investigate. When he didnt see anything unusual, he knocked on his neighbors door to see if she had noticed anything amiss. At that point, Max, who was in the Szaps backyard, continued to bark and began jumping on the fence.
It was then that they noticed his neighbors 89-year-old mother, Tina DiLuca, lying face down in her garden. It was a sweltering 91 degrees, and Tina was only able to speak softly. Blocked from view by a fence, it is unknown how long Tinas fall would have gone unnoticed without Max. 
Tina was admitted to the hospital and treated for four fractured ribs and a few abrasions. Tina has since recovered and invited Max to her 90th birthday party
Milky Way
Owner: Priscilla Elit
Rushford, MN
Like most other nights, Priscilla Elit made her way into the bathroom to take her medication before going to bed. Meanwhile, Julie, her sister and housemate, had already gone to her room for the night.
Without warning, Priscilla suffered a stroke and collapsed. Thats when Milky Way, the 5-year-old terrier/corgi mix who had been by her side, bolted across the hall and began wildly scratching at Julies bedroom door. When Julie opened the door she heard her sisters faint cries for help. She rushed to the bathroom to find Priscilla lying in the middle of the floor and immediately called 911.
Thankfully, because of Milky Ways swift actions, help arrived quickly and Priscillas life was saved.
Porkchop
Owner: June Argenti
Saratoga Springs, NY
While his wife was at church, 71-year-old Nick Argenti had decided to relax in his backyard and enjoy the warm July morning when he suddenly collapsed. As he fell to the ground, the tube became disconnected from the oxygen tank he depended on full time due to a serious respiratory condition, and he lost consciousness.
Fortunately, Porkchop, his 9-year-old beagle-dachshund mix, was there and began barking and baying at his side. Argentis neighbor heard and immediately realized there was something different about Porkchops tone. Thats when she looked out her window and saw Nick lying face down on the ground.
She called 911 while her husband and another neighbor ran to check on Nick. When help arrived, Nick was taken to the hospital where he spent two nights recovering.
Sadly, Nick passed away in December 2009. The HSUS wishes to extend our deepest sympathy to his wife, June, and the rest of the Argenti family.
Prozac
Owners: Fred and Barbara Berman
Sanford, NC
Prozacs first heroic intervention occurred while visiting Fred Bermans extended family. One day, the family heard the 3-year-old Bichon Frise-poodle mix barking from their Aunt Dorothys bedroom. A family member rushed in and found the 94-year-old woman gasping for air.
About two months later, Prozac intervened again. This time, Carol Spade was dog-sitting Prozac when around 2 a.m. one morning, she and her granddaughter were awakened by Prozacs incessant barking. She was used to Prozacs bark, but this time it sounded different.
Carol then heard snapping and popping sounds coming from the attic and at first assumed it was a wild animal, but quickly realized that it was a fire. She and her granddaughter were able to escape with Prozac, just before the home was fully engulfed in flames. 
RaeLee
Owner: Yolanda Segovia
Tampa, FL
When Yolanda Segovias neighbor asked her to watch a stray dog she found, both assumed it would just be for the day. But Yolandas sons, 10-year-old Azaiah and 21-year-old Christian, quickly bonded with the terrier mix and named him RaeLee (pronounced Riley). Over the next four days, they continued to search for the dogs owner. 
One Saturday, Azaiah went to his dads house while RaeLee and Christianwho has Down syndrome, a history of seizures and other health issuessat down to watch T.V. Yolanda was outside watering her plants when RaeLees barking caught her attention. Yolanda went to check on him, assuming he just wanted to play or join her outside. Instead, RaeLee ran to her, then turned and ran toward Christians room. Yolanda followed and found Christian slumped over, skin purple and blood streaming from his nose and mouth.
Yolanda called 911 and performed CPR until he began breathing again. The neurologist said that had she not intervened when she did, Christian would have choked on his own blood.

I just want to thank all of you for your educational e-mails over the past year. I am totally screwed up now and have little chance of recovery.
I no longer open a public bathroom door  without using a paper towel or have them put lemon slices in my ice water without worrying about the bacteria on the lemon peel.
I can’t use the remote in a hotel room because I don’t know what the last person was doing while flipping through the adult movie channels..
I can’t sit down on the hotel bedspread because I can only imagine what has happened on it since it was last washed.
I have trouble shaking hands  with someone who has been driving because the number one pastime while driving alone is picking ones nose (although cell phone usage may be taking the number one spot).
Eating a little snack sends me on a guilt trip because I can only imagine how many gallons of Trans fats I have consumed over the years..

I can’t touch any woman’s purse for fear she has placed it on the floor of a public bathroom.

I MUST SEND MY SPECIAL THANKS to whoever sent me the one about poop in the glue on envelopes because I now have to use a wet sponge with every envelope that needs sealing.
ALSO, now I have to scrub the top of every can I open for the same reason..

I no longer have any savings  because I gave it to a sick girl (Penny Brown) who is about to die in the hospital for the 1,387,258th time..
I no longer have any money at all, but that will change once I receive the $15,000 that Bill Gates/Microsoftand  AOL are sending me for participating in their special e-mail program.
I no longer worry about my soul because I have 363,214 angels looking out for me, and St. Theresa’s  Novenahas granted my every wish.
Image removed by sender.
I no longer eat KFC  because their chickens are actually horrible mutant freaks with no eyes or feathers..
Image removed by sender.
I no longer use cancer-causing deodorants even though I smell like a water buffalo on a hot day.
THANKS TO YOU I have learned that my prayers only get answered if I forward an e-mail to seven of my friends and make a wish within five minutes.
BECAUSE OF YOUR CONCERN, I no longer drink Coca Cola because it can remove toilet stains..

I no longer can buy gasoline without taking someone along to watch the car so a serial killer won’t crawl in my back seat when I’m pumping gas.
I no longer drink Pepsi or Dr. Pepper since the people who make these products are atheists who refuse to put’Under God’ on their cans.
I no longer use Saran Wrap in the microwave because it causes cancer.
AND THANKS FOR LETTING ME KNOW I can’t boil a cup of water in the microwave anymore because it will blow up in my face.. Disfiguring me for life.
I no longer check the coin return on pay phones  because I could be pricked with a needle infected withAIDS..
I no longer go to shopping malls because someone will drug me with a perfume sample and rob me.
I no longer receive packages from UPS or Fed Ex  since they are actually Al Qaeda in disguise.
I no longer shop at Target since they are French and don’t support our American troops or the Salvation Army.
I no longer answer the phone because someone will ask me to dial a number for which I will get a phone bill with calls to  Jamaica , Uganda , Singapore , and Uzbekistan …
I no longer buy expensive cookies from Neiman Marcus since I now have their recipe.
THANKS TO YOU I can’t use anyone’s toilet but mine because a big brown African spider is lurking under the seat to cause me instant death when it bites my butt.

AND THANKS TO YOUR GREAT ADVICE I can’t ever pick up $5.00 dropped in the parking lot because it probably was placed there by a sex molester waiting underneath my car to grab my leg.
I can no longer drive my car because I can’t buy gas from certain gas companies!
I can’t do any gardening  because I’m afraid I’ll get bitten by the brown recluse and my hand will fall off.

And I now keep my toothbrush in the living room, because water splashes over 6 ft. out of the commode..   
 If you don’t send this e-mail to at least 144,000 people in the next 70 minutes, a large dove will land on your head at 5:00 p.m. Tomorrow afternoon and the fleas from 12 camels will infest your back, causing you to grow a hairy hump. I know this will occur because it actually happened to a friend of my next door neighbors’ ex-mother-in-law’s second husband’s cousin’s beautician . .. .

Oh, by the way…..
A German scientist from Argentina , after a lengthy study, has discovered that people with insufficient brain activity read their e-mail with their hand on the mouse..
Don’t bother taking it off now, it’s too late.

Well Friday we left for Springfield,IL where my friend Tab lives. We got on the road and had no trouble getting there. We went and hung out with Tab until Lee got home and then we went out to eat at Baker’s Square. The food was good. By the time we got back to their place it was time for Tab to go to bed so that kinda sucked. During the day when we were waiting for Lee to get home we decided to walk to Cold Stone Creamery. When we finally got there the walk was well worth it lol. I needed the walk anyway. So the Saturday we went to the tae kwon do tournament and Jess did pretty good on the grappling which was his first time and for forms he got 3rd place and we just decided to leave early because we weren’t gonna wait 3 hours for him to spar. So on our way home it started to rain and the wind was terrible but luckily we made it back.
On the way home my mom called and said that Bear her dog was sick and wouldn’t eat or drink and his poop was bloody so I was trying to call around to my friends and see if anyone could take her to our regular vet before they closed which no one was able to take her and bring her back. They said they would be able to take her but not bring her back so after trying very hard to find a vet that was open or open on Sunday which there wasn’t so we had to go to the emergency vet clinic. 
My last experience with the Emergency vet in our area was having to put Jess’s cat Shadow to sleep because we couldn’t afford for them to run tests on him to find out what was going on. So that is why I was trying my hardest to avoid the place like the plague. So we ended up taking him there and it was a totally different experience. The nurse was very nice and the dr who was hearing impaired was great and when we said the plan that she had drawn up saying that Bear would have to stay there and get IV fluids it came to from 700-1000 so we told the dr we couldn’t afford that so she came back and we drew up a different plan which worked and we didn’t have to keep Bear at the animal hospital. So he’s doing much better today and will hopefully be his old self soon. So that was my interesting weekend.

KIRKLAND, Wash. – A car-jacking suspect messed with the wrong vehicle Friday night in a Kirkland parking lot.
A pit bull rescued earlier from an illegal dog-fighting ring was sitting inside in the car – and that dog wasn’t taking any more passengers.
The dog’s foster mom, Amber Melena, explains what happened.
She says Victor the pit bull was due to be put down a few months ago after he and more than 20 other dogs were found living in horrific conditions – beaten, forced to fight and chained inside filthy kennels.
But a dedicated rescue group believed this dog could be saved and – after months of rehabilitation – placed him with Amber and her family.
On Friday night, Victor had a chance to return the favor in a grocery parking lot.
Amber says she stopped by the store on a routine shopping trip and brought 3-year-old Victor along for the ride.
“I opened the door like this and put the groceries in,” she says.
“I was just reaching for my seatbelt, and right as I was turning to click it in, this door flew open. And he was just standing right there.”
Amber found herself face-to-face with a possible car-jacker. The man spooked Victor, too – but the dog was quick to act.
“He turns around and lets out just this gigantic woof,” says Amber. “And this man throws himself backwards, trips on himself and falls down.”
Police later arrested the man. And thanks to Victor, Amber wasn’t hurt.
She says Victor still bears the battle scars from being routinely beaten and forced to fight before he was saved last October from a dog-fighting ring in Graham.
“He’s got tears inside his ears; his biggest one is the lip. This lip is supposed to be attached, not kind of poking out,” Amber says.
Bullseye Dog Rescue and other shelter workers put the dogs through months of rehabilitation. Ultimately, most had to be put down.
“They didn’t make it. They had some various behavioral problems … because of the victims that they were, the cruelty they endured,” says Lorrie Kalmbach of Bullseye Dog Rescue.
Victor was the exception – and Amber says he proved himself exceptional against the car-jacker.
She’d keep him if she could, but for now has agreed to be his foster mom until he can be placed.
“Bullseye has given him a second chance. I think he might have given me a second chance. He’s definitely my hero,” she says.
Victor and two other pit bulls named Hope and Phoenix have gone through months of rehabilitation and are ready and willing to be adopted into a good home.

Anyone interested in adoption can contact Bullseye Dog Rescue for more information.

A girl asks her boyfriend to come over Friday night to meet, and have a dinner with her parents.

Since this is such a big event, the girl announces to her boyfriend that after dinner, she would like to go out and make love for the first time.  
The boy is ecstatic, but he has never had sex before, so he takes a trip to the pharmacist to get some condoms. He tells the  pharmacist it’s his first time and the pharmacist helps the boy for about an hour. He tells the boy everything there is to know about condoms and sex.

At the register, the pharmacist asks the boy how many condoms he’d like to buy, a 3-pack, 10-pack, or family pack.
The boy insists on the family pack because he thinks he will be rather busy, it being his first time and all.
That night, the boy shows up at the girl’s parents house and meets his girlfriend at the door.
“Oh, I’m so excited for you to meet my parents, come on in!”
The boy goes inside and is taken to the dinner table where the girl’s parents are seated.
The boy quickly offers to say grace and bows his head. A minute passes, and the boy is still deep in prayer, with his head down.

Kim first met Dagnabit in 2004, when he was found wandering behind one of her businesses. She said he looked as if he had scars. He had aggression toward other dogs, and his ears had been cut off.
Dagnabit had a collar with a phone number for a veterinarian in Florida, but his owner could not be found. One of Kim’s employees decided to take care of Dagnabit.

Slowly, Dagnabit got used to other dogs, and his aggression eased. His owner found him sitting cross-legged on the floor one day, and called Kim for help. A trip to the veterinarian’s office resulted in bad newsDagnabit needed life-saving surgery for three ruptured discs in his back.
Three months after the surgery, Dagnabit had lost 30 pounds and could not walk. Kim says he acted as if he had lost his spirit, but she would visit him every day at the boarding clinic where he was being kept. Kim later became Dagnabit’s official owner.

Having worked as a rehabilitation counselor for children, Kim decided to try similar rehabilitation principles on Dagnabit. The two worked with a canine massage practitioner, a veterinarian acupuncturist, and a veterinarian specializing in chiropractic and homeopathic medicine. Soon after, Dagnabit was finally able to stand again.
Kim began taking classes at the University of Tennessee and became a Certified Canine Rehabilitation Practitioner. She began working with Doggone Wheels to produce a wheelchair for Dagnabit. It wasn’t long before he was wheeling around the French Quarter, and he even began to swim.
Kim continues to work with Doggone Wheels to help disabled dogs all over the country get fitted for wheelchairs. She started Dag’s House, a dog rehabilitation facility with a fitness center, canine hydrotherapy pool, agility course, and outdoor space dedicated to relaxation, play, endurance training, and conditioning.
The wheelchair was just the start for Dagnabit. He is now out of the wheelchair and is learning to walk again. He can even go up stairs. His aggression toward other dogs is completely gone.
“He is so strong-willed about doing it [walking up stairs],” said Kim. “He trusts me. He’s amazing. He’s like the poster child for disabled dogshe’s beat all odds.
“He has changed my life,” said Kim. “He’s an amazing dog.”
About the fundraising winner
The photo that won the grand prize for the Fundraisers Category raised more than $32,000 for Romania Animal Rescue. The photo was submitted by Dr. Aurelian Stefan, a veterinarian at the Romania Animal Rescue.
Ciao, the dog in the photo, was named after the gas station where he was found (and means both “hello” and “goodbye” in Italian). Dr. Stefan brought him to the clinic, but Ciao died shortly thereafter.
“Hello and goodbye are the words that all the gas station dogs hear many times a day,” said Dr. Stefan. “They have a cruel life because they live along the busy roads with all the dangers that a busy road brings. I wanted Ciao to speak out on behalf of the homeless dogs living along the highways. They need a home, or at least to be spayed and neutered.”
Dr. Stefan emailed and messaged friends on Facebook to drum up votes for Ciao.
Romania Animal Rescue Inc. is a 501(c)3 charity with headquarters in California. It is also a registered charity in Romania. Romania Animal Rescue does not have a shelter in Romania, but funds free spay/neuter for shelters, as well as doing “spayathons” in villages and cities. The clinic has a regular set of clients that bring in street dogs to Dr. Stefan and his brother, Petrisor Stefan, who do spay/neuter and emergency treatments in Romania.

As more and more Americans turn to the Web to find the pet of their dreams, scams have skyrocketed as criminals seek to take advantage of unsuspecting pet parents. According to the Internet Crime Complaint Center, hundreds of complaints are filed each year by victims who were conned when attempting to buy a dog online.
One potential pet parent, Diane, was hoping to add a Yorkshire Terrier puppy to her family when she spotted a classified ad in her local paper. It was over my morning coffee that I saw the perfect ad for a Yorkie named Nancy, says Diane, who lives near Cleveland, OH. She sent an email to the address listed, and immediately received a responseDiane could have the puppy if she promised her a loving home and sent $500 to cover the shipping fees.
I corresponded for an entire week with this man who claimed to be a missionary, Diane explains. Diane sent the requested payment via Western Union, but once she sent the code for the money transfer, she never heard from the pastor again.
Like many trusting animal lovers, Diane fell victim to one of many free to good home scams currently circulating the Internet and classified sections of newspapers. So how do you avoid persuasive cons and still get the dog of your dreams? The ASPCA recommends never buying a dog you havent met in person and always check references. Also, keep in mind that adoption is still the best option, even if you have your heart set on a purebred dog. There are thousands of dogs waiting for good homes at local animal shelters, including purebreds! Please help others avoid being cheated by emailing your puppy scam story to dogstory@aspca.org.

Well last night was our Ladie’s Night at Shooters bar inside a bowling alley. We went up to this one part that had pool tables and darts and a jukebox and hung out up there. My friend Ginny and April from school came and Belinda and Ginny’s friend Lauren. Ginny and April and Lauren were a little tipsy lol but it was still fun. I just wish the other girls we invited could actually come. Next month’s event is gonna be either chick flick movie night or a picnic potluck if the weather is nice enough by that time. 
Bear was doing better but is still having issues. He eats but still barely drinks and doesn’t seem to have energy like he did before. So we took him to the vet today and the vet drew blood. So hopefully we find out what is going on so we can make him better and it’s nothing serious or life-threatening.
Kacey is doing better since we put him on a 2nd dose of his medication for the afternoon. He still gets a little too excited and gets in trouble but only at home. The weather is actually getting nice out with a few chilly days here and there. Tuesday is my first day of class. I have 3 classes. Psychology which is online and then Culture and Diversity and principles of vet profession. One is tues and thurs and the other is weds and thurs. For last quarter I got perfect attendance and a 4.0 grade point average but I’m confused because I also got perfect attendance for the quarter before this one but they told me because I was only half time that I was basically not eligible and I was half time this quarter but got a certificate. WHO KNOWS LOL. 
Me and some people in my classes were discussing the whole deal with some of the classes we have to take. Some of them don’t make sense for the vet tech program. We have to take career skills, human relations, speech, culture and diversity. Can someone please tell me what those have to do with animals lol. I get the whole deal with having to deal with the owners of the animals but what do they have to do with the animals. So anyway that is my update of sorts for now. Marjorie is still driving me crazy lol. I have a review coming up in April just not sure exactly when so it should be interesting to see what she has to say about me. Being late will probably be a big one and not helping her put her walker in my car will probably be another one. The only reaosn I don’t help her with her walker is because she goes to her side of the car. What is the point of me getting out of the car walking all the way around just to put it in when she could just do it herself. The walker is not that heavy to lift. If it was something that was heavy I would definitely help.

Ok I try very hard not to talk about my friends and what they do with their lives because it’s their lives and their choices but there is one that REALLY bothers me right now. My friend Melisa D is pregnant. Her first baby who was a girl was a month premature. She was put in the hospital with contractions not long ago and told to be on bedrest so what is doing? Well let’s see walking around the mall and planning on going to Kansas City, KS. Is she mental or really wants to have another premature baby. It just makes me mad to know that someone would be that careless about their unborn baby to endanger it by going against her doctor’s orders. Of course I’m not gonna tell her this because she would get pissed off at me and tell me to mind my business so I figure if I vent on here and get it out then maybe it won’t bother me that much.
She got ticked off at me before because I basically told her I don’t care for her bf but her family doesn’t like him or didn’t like him. Now all of a sudden they jumped on his bandwagon. Confused. We invited them over for Thanksgiving dinner. Well her daughter was screaming and crying and he was just sitting there playing on his phone. We were passing her around trying to get her to stop crying while he sat there and did nothing. I explained why I didn’t care for him and she made the excuse “oh he’s impatient.” HELLO he has kids he is gonna have to learn how to be patient or he’s gonna be screwed. Then she kept saying how he keeps accusing her of cheating on him because he works in Chicago as a cab driver while she’s at home raising their kids by herself which she claims she likes so more power to her with that one. But why would you date someone who keeps accusing you of cheating? Some people baffle me. 
Sorry for the bitching and moaning I just needed to get that out so I didn’t accidentally blow up at her. Again I know I shouldn’t be butting into people’s business and this time I didn’t say a word to her about this situation. It’s her life and she can do what she wants but it doesn’t mean it doesn’t bug the hell out of me lol.

Do you just have one of those sucky days where you wish you could just stay in bed all day. That was my day today or at least the beginning of my day was like that. I had to work today and I actually got to Marjorie’s house before she had to be at her appointment lol. So I dropped her off at her appointment and went back home for a while because her appointment was gonna take a hour. So I went home and started doing some chores and stuff but forgot my phone in my van and I was about to leave to go get her but I had to take a crap (sorry I know TMI) So when I got in the car I called her to let her know I was on my way so she was ticked because I made her wait 20 minutes. So I get to the place to pick her up and she asks me if I got her meds to which I said no because she didn’t say anything to me about getting them to which she got mad about and told me YES she did tell me that so I just let it be and went over to get her meds. You would tell she would have realized that she obviously didn’t tell me because she never gave me the money to go get them DUH. So anyway we start going and I ask where we are going and she says I told you before Wal-mart so I just said OK because she didn’t say a thing about going to wal-mart or else I wouldn’t have asked her where we were going. So I was so glad to drop her off. 

So then me and my mom were out running her errands. I was turning into a parking lot from the main road and there was a teenager who wasn’t paying attention so I was waiting for him to figure out whether he was gonna keep walking across the street or stop and I heard squeeching brakes behind me. Luckily the person didn’t hit our van but did scare the shit out of all of us. Nice weather = maniacs on the roads.
So that was my interesting day. It wasn’t totally horrible because the weather was awesome out and school wasn’t that bad. I’m so glad to be getting a 4 day vacation of sorts from work. I NEED IT. She’s about to drive me crazy.

DES MOINES, Iowa – Police say two teenagers who wandered away from their younger siblings at an Easter egg hunt have found a body at a Des Moines park. 
Police Sgt. Chris Scott says the teens came across the man’s body in a wooded area at Beaverdale Park on Saturday morning. 
He says the teens had accompanied their siblings to the park’s egg hunt but wandered away. The body was found at least 300 yards from where the egg hunt took place. He didn’t know how old the teens were. 
About 100 children participated in the annual event. 
Police say they don’t suspect any foul play, and an autopsy is planned. 
The man’s name hasn’t been released pending notification of his family.

LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) – Drunk in a bar and can’t get out, who you gonna call? Police. That’s what Todd Fitzwater did in Lexington. WLEX-TV reported Fitzwater called 911 Thursday and said he’d gotten drunk and passed out at Todd’s Karaoke Bar the night before, awakened and had a few more – then couldn’t get out of the bar, which was closed.
Officers tapped on the door Thursday afternoon to guide the 45-year-old Fitzwater to it so he could let them in to help him.
The bar owner said Fitzwater is a “regular” who lives nearby. The barkeep stayed with him until 7:30 a.m. Thursday, then left figuring Fitzwater would eventually let himself out and go home.

NEW YORK  A 12-year-old girl who was hauled out of her New York City school in handcuffs for doodling on her desk has started legal action against the city over her arrest.
A lawyer for Alexa Gonzalez filed legal papers seeking $1 million in damages, saying the Queens girl was subjected to overly harsh treatment.
Alexa was arrested at her junior high school in February after scribbling “I love my friends Abby and Faith” on her desk with an erasable marker.
Her family’s lawyer says school officials overreacted by calling the police.
The Department of Education acknowledges the arrest was a mistake. The city’s legal department has declined to comment on the lawsuit.

Well my dog Bear was appearing to get better from his infection issue he has but the bad thing is it now looks as if he is getting a bad infection in his feet. So far two of them are very bad and the other two are starting to have problems. So we took him to the vet to find this out and the doc said he might lose his toes because the infection he has is a serious one that is hard to fight off so we have to soak each paw in a diluted betadine solution for 5 minutes and he has to have another “sateline dish” or “lamp shade” collar on so he doesn’t basically chew off his feet. He goes back tomorrow for a recheck . hopefully they have improved. 
Other than that Easter went well. The weather at least stayed decent for most of the day. It started raining towards sunset and even had a few thunderstorms. Friday we had a Easter Egg hunt with Anna and Kacey. They had a ball collecting close to 500 eggs. So I guess that is my update for now.

This event is being held in memory of 11-year-old Carl Joseph Walker-Hoover, one of many beautiful lives cut tragically short because of bullying. Carl took his own life on April 6, 2009 after enduring constant bullying, including being called “gay” and “faggot” despite not even identifying as gay.
Please spend 5 minutes in Carl’s memory and CALL YOUR Representative and ask him/her to support (or thank them if they already do) the Safe Schools Improvement Act, a comprehensive federal anti-bullying bill.
If you don’t feel comfortable calling your Rep, consider spending 5 minutes in some other way to remember Carl and raise awareness about bullying.
You can also sign a petition in support of the Safe Schools Improvement Act in memory of Carl at http://bit.ly/Sign4Carl

I find this scenario becoming more and more daily. It’s sad to know that these kids are actually killing themselves because they feel it’s the only way out. Why aren’t the schools doing more to stop these kids that do the bullying? Suspend them, make them volunteer somewhere something. I was bullied all through my school years and it sucked then but now it seems like the bullies have more tools to do it. Now they have text messages, the net, facebook, myspace and so much more stuff to humiliate their victims. It’s sad. I really hope we can find an end to this very stupid thing and learn that everyone is different but that they shouldn’t be made fun of for it. I’m not perfect but I try my best to be friends with people who are different than me whether they are biracial, heavyset, single moms, married, divorced, lesbians, bi. To me it doesn’t make a difference on the outside it’s their personalities that draw me to them. I just wish more people thought like that and didn’t judge people because they don’t have designer clothes or heavyset or lesbian or gay or black or biracial. Why should it matter?

     1. She was in the bathroom, putting on her makeup, under the watchful eyes of her young granddaughter, as she’d done many times before. After she applied her lipstick and started to leave, the little one said, “But Gramma, you forgot to kiss the toilet paper good-bye!” I will probably never put lipstick on again without thinking about kissing the toilet paper good-bye…

    2. My young grandson called the other day to wish me Happy Birthday. He asked me how old I was, and I told him, 62.  My grandson was quiet for a moment, and then he asked,  “Did you start at 1?”

    3. After putting her grandchildren to bed, a grandmother changed into old slacks and a droopy blouse and proceeded to wash her hair.. As she heard the children getting more and more rambunctious, her patience grew thin. Finally, she threw a towel around her head and stormed into their room,  putting them back to bed with stern warnings. As she left the room, she heard the three-year-old say with a trembling voice,
    “Who was THAT?”

    4. A grandmother was telling her little granddaughter what her own childhood was like: “We used to skate outside on a pond I had a swing made from a tire; it hung from a tree in our front yard.. We rode our pony. We picked wild raspberries in the woods.” The little girl was wide-eyed,  taking this all in. At last she said, “I sure wish I’d gotten to know you sooner!”

    5. My grandson was visiting one day when he asked,
    “Grandma, do you know how you and God are alike?” I mentally polished my halo and I said, “No, how are we alike?” “You’re both old,” he replied.

    6. A little girl was diligently pounding away on her
    grandfather’s word processor. She told him she was
    writing a story. “What’ s it about?” he asked.
    “I don’t know,” she replied. “I can’t read.”

    7. I didn’t know if my granddaughter had learned her
    colors yet, so I decided to test her. I would point out
    something and ask what color it was. She would tell me and was always correct. It was fun for me, so I continued. At last, she headed for the door, saying, “Grandma, I think you should try to figure out some of these, yourself!”

    8. When my grandson Billy and I entered our vacation cabin,  we kept the lights off until we were inside to keep from attracting pesky insects. Still, a few fireflies followed us in. Noticing them before I did, Billy whispered, “It’s no use Grandpa.  Now the mosquitoes are coming after us with flashlights.”

    9. When my grandson asked me how old I was, I teasingly replied, “I’m not sure.”  “Look in your underwear, Grandpa,” he advised, “Mine says
    I’m 4 to 6.”

    10. A second grader came home from school and said to her grandmother, “Grandma, guess what? We learned how to make babies today.” The grandmother, more than a little surprised, tried to keep her cool. “That’s interesting,” she said,  “how do you make babies?”  “It’s simple,” replied the girl. “You just change ‘y’ to ‘i’ and add ‘es’.”

    11. Children’s Logic: “Give me a sentence about a
    public servant,” said a teacher. The small boy wrote:
    “The fireman came down the ladder pregnant.” The
    teacher took the lad aside to correct him. “Don’t
     you know what pregnant means?” she asked.
     “Sure,” said the young boy confidently. “It means
     carrying a child.”

    12. A grandfather was delivering his grandchildren to
    their home one day when a fire truck zoomed past.
    Sitting in the front seat of the fire truck was a Dalmatian dog.  The children started discussing the dog’s duties.
    “They use him to keep crowds back,” said one child.
    “No,” said another. “He’s just for good luck.”
     A third child brought the argument to a close.”They use the dogs,” she said firmly, “to find the fire hydrants.”

    13. A 6-year-old was asked where his grandma lived.
    “Oh,” he said, “She lives at the airport, and when we want her, we just go get her. Then, when we’re done having her visit, we take her back to the airport.”

    14. Grandpa is the smartest man on earth! He teaches me good, good things, but I don’t get to see him enough to get as smart as him!

    15. My Grandparents are funny, when they bend over; you  hear gas leaks, and they blame their dog.

Well Thursday was a pretty crappy day for me. First off I was sick so of course that didn’t help me. Then my mom came upstairs in tears at like 5:30 in the morning saying there was something wrong with Bear and that she thought he was dead. So Jess went downstairs to see and unfortunately he was gone. So then we had to wrap him up and take him to the emergency clinic where they cremated him. We got a paw print that you bake which me and my mom did today. I’m also gonna make a collage photo and give it to my mom. My throat was hurting so bad I couldn’t really cry. It’s hard to have a dog since they were a puppy and then they pass away. I was hoping that he was gonna pull through it but I think the infection was just too strong for him. I remember one of his last days before he passed. He couldn’t figure out how to eat with his “lampshade” on so I was sitting on the floor right next to him hand feeding him. Now that he’s gone it’s so hard to look at his toys still sitting in the box and know that my buddy isn’t around for me to play ball with or to go for car rides.

It’s so hard to think of Bear being gone forever. I really really miss him. He was such a great dog and so darn smart. When I compare him to my other dogs they are so different. Coco is wonderful but very stubborn and lazy. She doesn’t like to play with toys but does love walks. Buck is hyper but doesn’t get the point of playing with toys either. That’s probably the biggest thing I miss about Bear. He always loved to play no matter what. Even right before he passed away he loved to play with his ball. Nothing would stop him lol. I remember a day or two before he passed he was upstairs and I was actually hand feeding him because I don’t think he could figure out how to get his lampshade over the food dish. My mom made the comment “Bear I hope you don’t expect me to do this for you too.” lol 
School is going good but of course getting harder. The good thing is I have at least one class with my friends. We are planning a potluck picnic for Friday afternoon. Hopefully the weather cooperates and we don’t get the storms they claim we might. I just wish Tab could come sooner so she could meet my friends but I understand. Hopefully some time soon she will be able to meet them. 
Kacey is still doing well in school. He has his moments. Maybe it’s just me but his medication seems to make him more angry sometimes and prone to throwing tantrums so when the dr calls to refill his meds I’m gonna talk to her about that. 
Bowling is almost over lol. Work isn’t too bad lately. The lady I work admitted she was a lil depressed so maybe that was why she snapped at me.

CHICAGO (AP) – No one knows how a tabby cat named Charles traveled the 1,300 miles from his New Mexico home to Chicago, but he’s set for a complimentary flight home on American Airlines in a carrier donated by an Albuquerque business.
Charles disappeared about eight months ago while his owner was out of town and a friend was caring for him.
“Oh, I was crushed, and I found out while I was away volunteering with Habitat for Humanity, and I was so upset because I was in New Orleans so there was nothing I could do,” said Robin Alex, of Albuquerque.
Then earlier this week, Alex received a call telling her Chicago Animal Care and Control had picked up her wandering cat as a stray. Staffers reached out to Alex after finding that Charles had a tracking microchip embedded between his shoulder blades, said the agency’s executive director, Cherie Travis.
But Alex said she could not afford the round-trip ticket to Chicago to bring Charles home, so she was afraid he might be euthanized.
Enter fellow Albuquerque resident Lucien Sims. Sims said he has a tabby cat who strongly resembles Charles, and was moved when his mother sent him an online story about Alex and her pet.
Most importantly, Sims was on his way to Chicago on Thursday for a wedding, so he said he would go to the shelter, pick up Charles and bring him back to New Mexico.
Sims has made all the arrangements for Charles’ return, including getting a company to donate a cat carrier and American Airlines to waive the cat’s travel fee.
Travis said Charles is definitely ready for his next adventure.
“He’s in good condition,” she said. “He needs a good brushing. He’s got a little bit of a cold – a little bit of an upper respiratory infection – but otherwise he’s in great condition.”

Well today we put Coco our huskie Shepherd mix outside on a chain because she constantly wants to go outside but she HATES to be left outside by herself. She was out there for not even an hour. I left to go get Kacey from school. I come back and Jess let out Buck to go to the bathroom and this dude appears out near the sidewalk near our driveway. He then says “when are you gonna fu*king shut your dog up I’m trying to sleep.” So Jess says there is no noise ordinance for during the day and it wasn’t like Coco was out there all day constantly barking and Coco isn’t the only dog in the neighborhood who barks. So the dude then says “well you better shut it up or I’m gonna call the cops on you guys.” So Jess said “go ahead.” Then the dude says ” or I’ll kill your dog.” That pissed Jess off and he called the dude a b*tch  so then the guy starts doing the macho thing saying don’t be calling me a b*tch and if you’re so manly come over here and do something about it. So Jess goes over near where the guy lives and gets in his face, didn’t touch him but got in his face so the other guy pushes Jess so he pushes back and they end up on the ground wrestling around. Jess puts the guy in a chokehold basically and they finally stop and go their separate ways. While they were wrestling I called the cops. The cops eventually showed up like an hour later and by that time everything was calm. All this crap could have been avoided if the guy would have just come over and knocked on our door and asked us if we could keep it down because he slept during the day. HOW FUCKING HARD IS THAT? If he didn’t want to deal with  us he could have called the police and made a complaint or called animal control and had them come over. At least the guy didn’t have a weapon and neither one of them got hurt. I really laid into Jess about it because he did this shit while Kacey was standing there watching. 
On to other news our picnic went quite well. Everyone showed up. The only bad thing was my friend Mandy came and brought her stuff but then they left and never came back lol. Now we got to think of what to do for the month of May. We’ll figure something out. We had to watch a Oprah show about Puppy Mills today in my animal office principles class. It was very sad and made me so angry at the same time. They also talked about having to euthansize animals which I could NEVER do unless they were sick. Our teacher for that class is a actual vet tech and she used to work at the county animal services and she was talking about how she had to put kittens who were very sick to sleep and how they would be purring and rubbing against her. I could never do that job. I would come home in tears every day. Well that’s my update of sorts.

136,https://www.opendiary.com/m/torturedsoul_1/not-much-going-on-85-5150170/,2010-05-06,not much going on,"
Well not much going on in my neck of the woods but figured I would write an entry since it’s been a while. Work is chugging along. School is doing well. I got a C on my culture and diversity mid-term and an 93 or A in my animal office principles class. Psychology I’m not sure what my grade is. For school I had to volunteer 8 hours total for my animal office principles class. I chose a animal hospital in town called Hillcrest where I take my animals. It was an interesting experience to say the least. I split my time up into 2 4 hour shifts. The first time I went I was shadowing a vet tech named Tabitha who was mixed reminded me so much of my friend Tab who is also mixed. So me and Tabitha did the wards as they were called. We cleaned them out and put fresh water and litter. I also helped the lady who was doing grooming. She had a female collie that was freaking out because the lady was attempting to use electric clippers on the poor thing. She was freaking out so bad that she ended up drawing blood because the lady had her leashed to a cage so she wouldn’t get away and she was literally banging her head on the cage. So I sat in front of the collie and was stroking her head which calmed her down so the lady could get done grooming her. Well while I was helping the head doctor that was my supervisor walked in and I’m sure she thought I was just sitting there being lazy when I was actually helping because she made the comment “there is plenty to be done here.” 
I also folded up laundry, swept and mopped floors, washed dishes and cat boxes and changed the garbage bags. Tabitha kept commenting on how quick I was getting stuff done. I used to volunteer at a no-kill shelter in our town so I pretty much knew what to do but I’m sure to them it seemed like I was maybe lazy when the truth was I wasn’t sure how they did things compared to the no-kill shelter and I didn’t want to jump ahead and then get yelled at for doing it wrong. The second time was definitely more interesting. When I first came in the parking lot had one or two spaces left to park. 
So there was like 4 vet techs including Tabitha again so I followed her around but she kept getting called away to help with stuff so I kinda wandered around and just did stuff I remembered from the last time I was there. There was a pitbull who had to have a blood transfusion and the owner came to visit it. It’s name was “Sexy” not sure if it was a male or female though. Well I was all the way across the room and I could hear its tail hitting the metal cage it was in which I thought was so cute. After a while it stopped doing that and when I walked by the owner was petting its head and it was falling asleep from it. There was also a cat that had AIDS and a puppy with Parvo. It was definitely a interesting experience and I’m assuming I didn’t do a horrible job because Tabitha asked if I was gonna come back and visit her lol. They were all very nice to me and I even saw the vet tech that helped show me and my mom how to soak Bear’s paws when he was alive. 
So other than that not much else going on. We are gonna be having mixed drink and chick flick movie night on the 21st of May. So hopefully that goes well. I think Buck is realizing that Bear is gone. He just seems so different lately. He has his hyper spunk but seems to have settled down a bit. I still miss him so much and it made it worse because in our animal office principles class we were talking about bereavement, grief and euthansia. So of course it got me thinking of Bear.

Well last night was our last night of bowling. It was interesting to say the least. We played one game to figure out if we were gonna move up to the top 8. The older lady on my team named Linda was like oh we won’t make it. Well boy was she wrong. We ended up making it to the top 8 so then she made the comment again oh that team is too good we’re gonna lose. We won that game which I scored a 186 and with handicap it was 270. I had a girl from the opposing team call me a “sandbagger.” I had no clue what that meant so I wasn’t too worried about it. I asked one of my team members Linda’s husband Wayne what sandbagger meant. He told me it was someone that was basically faking that they sucked to get a high handicap which wasn’t me at all. I definitely don’t go around calling myself that good because I’m honestly not. Not as good as a LOT of the other teams. So anyway we went on to the next team to play and while I was playing that game one of the teammates of the girl that had called me a sandbagger came over and said that they wanted to talk to me. So I told my teammate Linda that maybe they wanted to beat me up. I was joking of course. So anyway I went over there and the lady said that she was just joking around and she didn’t appreciate Linda coming over and getting in her face and that she wasn’t gonna come back next season because of Linda. So I told Linda what the chick said and Linda was like that chick likes to start stuff and that she had told Linda it was none of her business which if you sit there and say a rude comment that everyone can hear then obviously it was her business lol. So anyway we ended up going against the first place team that the president was actually on. His son had some anger issues and his daughter was a loud mouth. YIKES. In the end we ended up winning. It was very interesting and freaky all at once. We went from 3rd from the bottom to first place all in one night lol. We are supposed to be getting some money back too so that will definitely be interesting to see how much money we get.

Well I went to go pick Kacey up from school today and the principal and another lady came out with him holding a ice pack on his chin. The principal said that he had a issue in gym class and smacked his chin really good on the floor and that he would possibly need stitches. So me and my mom took him to the ER. The ER was actually pretty busy so it took a little while to be seen. When we finally got back in the room I got to see the wound for the first time it looked pretty bad. So of course they said they would have to do stitches. Everything was fine until Kacey saw the needle they were going to use to numb the area and he started freaking out. They wrapped him up like a taco and there was 2 nurses and the physician assistant who were helping to hold him down. After they stuck the needle in about 4 or 5 different places he was fine. Thank god I wasn’t squeamish because it looked quite painful especially the fact that they had to use a needle to go through his skin to put the thread through. EEEEWWWW. He gets the stitches out in 5 days so we’ll see how it goes. So yea that was my interesting day. Nothing else of excitement going on. This Friday we are gonna have chick flick movie night/mixed drinks. Then Saturday I got my bowling league. I bowled this past Saturday by myself so hopefully they can find a team for me. My highest game was 157 without handicap lol. I’m still waiting to hear about the volunteering at Petco thing. Other than that not much else going on except school and work.

Well today was just one of those sucky days where I wish I would have stayed in bed. I had to get up at the buttcrack of dawn OR at least to me it was to get Kacey off to school because Jess had to go into work super early. So then I went to work. Marjorie had to go to a doctor’s appointment and usually her appointments take about an hour or some times more so I did what I usually do and drove around so I didn’t have to sit in a boring waiting room. Well while driving around I noticed my phone was to the point that the battery meter was flashing but there was no bars and my car charger didn’t work so I had to go all the way home to put it on the charger. So I drove back out to the place to go see if she was ready to go. When I first pulled up I didn’t see her but then as I was going to come around again I saw her out there. 
So she gets in the car and is really mad saying that she has been ready since close to noon and that she has been trying to call me but for whatever reason it wasn’t going through. So then she said that she even called the office but they didn’t pick up and that she would be surprised if I didn’t get fired. Ok I admit it was my fault for the phone because I should have made sure it was charged before I left the house but it’s not my fault she couldn’t get my f*cking number right because I bet that’s what the issue was and I’m not a mind reader as to when she is ready to go and I’m not gonna sit in a germ infested waiting room for an hour. I would much rather go driving around and take pictures or something more productive. So I’m really considering quitting this job. I have held it for 3 years now and I’m just getting tired of this crap. I understand she is having issues with her memory and that is probably part of her anger but it seems like everything is my fault. Her being late for appointments is partly my fault but also it takes her like 10-15 minutes to even leave her house. 
So I’m really considering it but first would have to find another one. I’m gonna try to find one in the vet area if possible but keep this one until that happens. So sorry for the bit*hing just needed to get it out. Kacey’s stitches are doing well. I took pics and I’m gonna take a few more tomorrow so everyone can see how it has progressed.

Well I have to rant about something that has been bugging me. I have a friend that has no job, lives with her mom, doesn’t drive. I try to include this friend in events that I’m doing like yesterday we had our mixed drink night at my house. I had asked this friend like a few weeks ago if she was interested in going. She told me I have no idea. So I thought ok maybe it was a lil too far out to figure out what she was doing. So I waited until Wednesday of this past week to ask if she happened to know whether she was coming or not she again told me I have no idea. This friend has done this to me quite a few times in the past. I understand that some people might have plans so that is why I ask a few weeks before we do a event or something so everyone knows and can make plans to attend. So this has got me thinking that either this person doesn’t want to come to the events or maybe that she doesn’t like me anymore and doesn’t have the guts to tell me this. I would honestly rather have someone tell me that they don’t want to hang out with me then every time I ask say i have no idea. This person did this same thing with a guy she was dating and he got tired of it and just started hanging out with his friends and not asking her because he figured that she would just say she didn’t know what she was doing or had no idea.
This friend has been there for me many times and I’m so grateful for that but I’m getting tired of asking her and getting the same answer of I have no idea. She also writes all the time I’m bored and needs to get out of the house but I have asked her if she wants to come over and she says no. So I’m guessing it’s not me she wants to keep her company which is fine everyone is allowed their opinion but I just hate feeling like this person doesn’t like me anymore and I don’t want to keep asking her and feel like I’m annoying her instead of being nice and offering because she’s my friend and I enjoy hanging out with her. 
So sorry about that. It has been bugging me and I just needed to get it out. So on to our mixed drink night. It went pretty good. My friends Ginny and Mandy from school came over. Ginny had her daughters Holly and Tara come over too. So we got pizza and the girls made their drinks and we played some games. It was really fun. I just hope they didn’t think we were too boring. 
As for Kacey he got his stitches out today. He did a very good job. I’m so happy they are out. He had a picnic at his school yesterday and he kept bugging me to let him go in this bouncy house thing but I was afraid to let him go because of his stitches. So he told me he was going to the bathroom which was inside near the bouncy house thing. So after a while I went to go check on him and found him in the line for the bouncy house so when I pulled him out of the line he threw a HUGE tantrum about it. Towards the end of the picnic I let him go in the bouncy house because there wasn’t that many kids in it. So that’s my entry for now.

I spoke with my nephew’s mom the other day. She called me to give me their new home number and she told me that C.J was going around telling everyone he was going to be in his brother Russ’s wedding and also my nephew’s mom was wondering why Russ didn’t like him so I sent this message to Russ’s finacee:
“Hey I just had a few questions for you. Is C.J. still invited to the wedding? Was wondering b.c he told Timmy’s mom that he was couldn’t get timmy for his b-day because he was going to be in Russ’s wedding . Also was curious why Timmy wasn’t invited to the wedding. From what his mom told me he talks about Russ all the time and actually talks about him, Jess and Shawn more than C.J. especially when Russ took him to the Y quite a while back when Russ still lived here. Well anyway I was just wonderin about those things.”
This is what his fiancee wrote back: ”   May 23 at 1:50pm
CJ is invited to the wedding but not IN the wedding. And Really, honestly, it is not really anybody’s business if we invite Timmy or not. Russ does not feel he is close to him…not from what he’s told me atleast and we make decisions together. Cj is getting an invite and like all wedding invites people send out, it will say CJ and Guest….that will be up to him if and who he would bring as that guest. I dont like how that was questioned really–like we are being TOLD who should be invited or not. 
I was just curious as to why Timmy wasn’t invited I don’t think I made it sound like I was telling them anything. Then she later sent this message to me:
”    May 23 at 7:42pm
You know, I was thinking more about these “questions”. Kinda rude. No more questions! This is an $11,000 wedding and we are inviting who WE want. I dont give a flying rats ass what anyones mom has said or how anyone feels about how “close” Russ is or isn’t with anyone. Russ isn’t too happy either with the tone of these questions Its just really no ones business except for when we go to someone ourselves and ask for advice or what have you. So, let this be the end please. All you guys really need to know is that Russ wants you three there the most, Jess knows what needs to be done for his role, and you and Kacey are included in everything. That is all you need to worry about. “
and I wrote this back “I was just wondering about Timmy because he is a part of the family and I understand that Russ isn’t close with Timmy and I was just curious why he doesn’t like Timmy that much. I wasn’t trying to sound rude or anything. If it’s because Russ doesn’t like Louise or C.J. he shouldn’t take it out on Timmy. Plus if TImmy was able to come I think he could keep Kacey calm during the ceremony but I understand it’s your guy’s choice and I wasn’t trying to make it sound like I was ordering anyone to invite anyone. As for C.J I was curious because he was going around telling people he was IN the wedding and I wasn’t sure if he was still invited since you guys said that Marilyn and Neil weren’t. If C.J. wasn’t invited then I would let him know so that way he didn’t bother to make the 4 hour drive up there. So I’m sorry if you took it that I was being RUDE because I wasn’t trying to and I wasn’t trying to start anything either. 
Does my first message I wrote sound like I’m being bossy or rude? I don’t think it does and I was just curious why Russ didn’t like his nephew. He only pays attention to Kacey and I’m not ungrateful for that but I do wish he liked Timmy more. I honestly think it’s because of Timmy’s parents that Russ doesn’t like him and if that is the reason it’s a dumb one. With the way Kacey has been I’m not sure if we will be able to go to the ceremony because I’m not taking him so he can run around and not sit still and be loud. 
Well anyway I’ll get off that subject before I get angry. I honestly don’t want to go but seeing as Russ’s side of family is already gonna be quite small compared to Jaime’s it makes me obligated to go plus it would be a opportunity for Kacey to see them and I know he loves Russ and Jaime. So I’m very torn on what to do besides the fact that they are having the wedding on Kacey’s BIRTHDAY. So we have to figure out when to have Kacey’s birthday. 
Ok well anyway not much else going on.It’s HOT here today. It’s 90 out. Crazy weather. 
**********************************EDIT**********************************
So I just checked my facebook and the fiancee wrote back to my previous message saying this: ”    May 23 at 8:52pm
When did either of us say Russ didnt like Timmy????????????? NEVER! And dont spread that!!! What the heck!?! Again- dont worry about anything its not your business really and we take it as you being pushy and nosey. And as for Kacey being calm during the ceremony, YOU need to keep him quiet!! Jessie will be up at the alter with us and it would be you who needs to keep him quiet. And we are having a videographer so he should not be talking, saying hi etc during church ceremony because we are having an audio video throughout, that does not come cheap. He is old enought to know the rule of when its time to be quiet! Or you will have to walk him out is all. Russ needs to call you and talk to you cuz I can not handle this, really. THis is gossipy stuff I dont get into. Again, you have NO IDEA what goes on to plan a wedding. And Russ asked and i quote, “why in the world is it your duty to let CJ know not to drive here again, not your business or place.” Russ
spoke to CJ personally!”
Can we say B*TCH? As for Russ no he did not SAY he didn’t like Timmy but he doesn’t have to. It’s his actions that prove that he doesn’t like Timmy. When has he spent time with Timmy or brought him gifts? NEVER. He doesn’t ask about Timmy or really seem to want anything to do with him. The comment about me having to keep Kacey quiet during the ceremony that was RUDE. Yea he’s old enough to know to be quiet but ADHD kids have a tough time doing it. It would have nothing to do with me keeping him quiet. What does what I’m talking about have to do with the cost of a wedding? I was just asking why Timmy wasn’t invited and making C.J. was actually invited and that he wasn’t thinking he was invited when he wasn’t. C.J. is a bit slow sometimes lol. As for the comment about letting C.J. know about not driving up there if he wasn’t invited we both know that if they tried to call Russ he would probably not answer the phone because he would assume it’s his mom trying to call. This just makes me not want to go to the wedding even more. Maybe we’ll just stay at the hotel and go swimming instead of going to the ceremony. Pools sound better than a wedding anyway unless it’s my own wedding.
This makes me think of our wedding and the fact that I will never be a b*tch to anyone. I understand that planning a wedding is hard and stressful not to mention expensive but there is ways to get around spending a sh*tload of money on a wedding. It’s all in who yout know if you ask me. For me I don’t need a huge overpriced wedding but I also don’t want a courthouse wedding either. I just want a nice one that is reasonably priced and not too cheap but not too expensive either. That’s why I have been waiting to get married not because I’m afraid of commitment like all the foreigners think lol but because I want a nice wedding and to be free of debt and start fresh. I also understand that my friends and family aren’t made of money and as long as whatever they picked was a certain color and not stained then they can pick whatever they would like. Jess has a lot of connections through Logli’s probably the only good thing he got out of that place lol so I’m sure we can find a good deal on flowers and location. I could maybe have my friend Tab do the pictures if she would like if not I could try to find someone else that enjoyed photography and took good pictures.

142,https://www.opendiary.com/m/torturedsoul_1/had-time-to-think-2-5150176/,2010-05-23,Had time to think,"
I started thinking about the whole convo with Jaime yesterday. She had written that it was none of my business regarding Timmy or C.J. so why didn’t she just say that to me and had that be the end of it. Why did she rub the fact that their wedding cost 11,000 or had the nerve to comment on Kacey. They have had Kacey spend almost a week with them so they both know how Kacey acts and this was even before he was put on meds. Besides the fact he is ADHD it doesn’t matter how old he is he is still not gonna be able to sit still and be quiet. That’s part of his disorder I guess you can call it. That pissed me off though. When Jess came home I was telling him about it and he didn’t even seem to care. 
Typical man when it comes to women bickering they could care less. Russ never did call me so I guess he wasn’t that worried about it. Hopefully we have no more drama until the wedding. Now I know better than to ask any questions and I’ll just assume shit and then when they bitch at me and say why didn’t you ask then I can say well I didn’t want to be called “rude” for asking a simple fucking question. To me it just seems like they think we are fucking stupid more me than Jesse obviously. It drives me crazy. I’m not a moron and don’t appreciate being treated like one. I’m so tempted to take Kacey to the ceremony just to ruin their videotaping. Give him shitloads of candy and just let him fucking run wild for the fun of it. To me I don’t know if I want my son to be near these fucking people anymore. The only thing Russ was good for was giving him expensive presents. He barely ever sees him or does anything with him anyway and Jaime was a cool chick but now I think I see her true colors coming out and that she is basically like all the pretty people and so damn concerned about rubbing the fact that they make good money and that nobody is good enough for them. I don’t need that crap in my life. If Jess wants to be associated with them he can be by himself. 
2 out of the 3 people that commented said she was wrong for how she said things. I’ll admit I can be nosy but pushy I don’t think I am and for this part I don’t think asking a simple question about why someone wasn’t invited was that nosy. But whatever I’ll think of some evil thing. If there is one thing I can’t stand is someone trying to tell me what to do with my son. That is one thing I don’t tolerate especially from someone who doesn’t even know my son that well. Yea she may have been with Russ for a year or two or however long but they barely see Kacey and probably think that I don’t know how to disclipine him and let him run wild. All my friends that have actually SPENT time with me and him know I get on his ass about stuff left and right and to some people they probably think I’m too strict with him. I make him use manners and I get on him when he’s bugging people. Most of the people are like “oh he’s fine” but I still get on him.

143,https://www.opendiary.com/m/torturedsoul_1/the-phone-call-55-5150177/,2010-05-25,The phone call,"
Well today after I got off of work Russ called me.I was thinking oh sh*t here we go. He was complaining about stuff and I started talking about the whole Kacey thing and actually started partially crying about it. He handed the phone to Jaime and we were talking about the different issues. She said she kept talking instead of saying it was none of my business because she had to explain herself which is what I did and got basically told i was rude for it. Then we were discussing the Kacey deal and I said that it made me feel like she was saying I was a bad mom to which she apologized. In the end I think we got things worked out. 
So hopefully there will be no more drama. The whole thing about Timmy came down to the fact that if Louise wants Russ to spend more time with Timmy she needs to contact him and talk to him about it according to Jaime. It does make sense because Louise seems to expect Russ to contact her all the time but when has she ever contacted them and tried to set something up. 
So glad that is over and hopefully everything goes ok and no one has drama.

146,https://www.opendiary.com/m/torturedsoul_1/exciting-weekend-11-5150180/,2010-06-04,Exciting Weekend,"
This weekend has been quite busy but in a fun way. This was our last week of classes and then we have our week break and start again. This quarter I had culture and diversity which I got a B in. It was pretty fun I just didn’t like sharing in class. Then for pyschology I also got a B. That class was online so it was definitely hard for me to keep up just because I kept forgetting about it lol. Then I had one called Animal Office Principles. Don’t know what I got in that class yet. I think after I get done writing this entry I’m gonna e-mail the teacher and ask about the grade. 
Yesterday I went to Petco and volunteered for a place called PAWS. It was fun getting to play with all these cute kittens and cats. Most were friendly except one who was white and tiger striped named Luke. Luke had just arrived a few days before so I think he was still stressed about that so I just let him be. 5 cats/kittens were adopted which was awesome. So I go back Sunday night to volunteer again. I also volunteered at a dog wash. That was a lot of fun. I got to see all kinds of different dogs I wish I would have brought my camera but I had no where to put it anyway. There was a great dane that was the size of a pony, a brindle colored pit bull, a brindle colored bulldog, a white husky with beautiful blue eyes and so many pretty other ones. 
Tonight I got bowling and then tomorrow we have to go out to Milwaukee to go pick up Jess’s co-worker and friend Ryan. He went to visit a friend in Baltimore and had no one to take him and pick him up so Jess was nice and told him we would do it. I love road trips so it was fine with me. Hopefully I won’t sleep too late because we have to get up at 5 or 6 in the morning to go get him. I want to go over to a place called Sinnissippi Gardens and take pictures of the beautiful flowers that are over there. I’m still wanting to quit my job. I just put in a application at Petco. I’m going to call on Monday after I get off work to see if they were able to review my application. Other than that not sure where else to apply. I’m just gonna keep checking the job sites and see what I can come up with. I’m trying to find something related to vet tech  but so far no luck. 
I had an interesting time trying to figure out what size bra I wear. I actually thought I was only a B turns out I’m a 42D. I can’t believe my boobs are actually that big. It’s weird.

Baby the cat was never known for her outgoing personality, but when her family’s suburban Chicago house caught fire late Sunday night the 13-year-old tabby made herself the center of attention when it counted most. She is credited with saving the lives of owners Josh Ornberg and girlfriend Letitia Kovalovsky, who is seven months pregnant with twins.
“Shes a hero,” Ornberg tells PEOPLEPets.com. “Its kind of embarrassing that I needed my cat to wake me up, but she was my fire detector.”
Ornberg says he and his girlfriend had fallen asleep on the living room couch inside their Wonder Lake, Ill., home Sunday night, when he awoke, startled by Baby.
“She’s usually not a very social cat, but she jumped on my lap and was jumping around I assume to wake me up,” recalls Ornberg. “And when I did wake up I noticed the house was filling with smoke.”
He discovered the source of the blaze in the back bedroom, and although he tried to extinguish the flames, the fire was already too big for him to handle alone. Instead, Kovalovsky called 911 and they fled the house until help arrived.
Wonder Lake Fire Protection Assistant Chief Mike Weber was first on the scene to see “flames at the back window going about 10 feet up in the air.” Firefighters put out the blaze, but the house was declared temporarily uninhabitable, and nearly all their possessions  including the twin cribs they had just assembled  were destroyed. Weber says the fire is “not suspicious, but under investigation.”
Weber points out that if not for Baby’s swift action, the circumstances could have become much worse. “She was definitely the hero in this situation. We dont know what the outcome would have been if not for the cat,” he says.
Despite her hero status, Baby was MIA after the blaze, and her family worried about her safety. “She was the first one out the door. I saw her run away,” says Ornberg.
For a day and a half there was no sign of Baby, but she re-emerged Tuesday afternoon, lured by one of her favorite foods: tuna fish. Ornberg had set a live trap near the house with some tuna inside; a friend called Tuesday afternoon to say Baby was safe and sound inside.
Now, Baby is resting comfortably with her family  including fellow pet Blackjack, a Bernese mountain dog  in a local hotel as they figure out where they will stay as their home undergoes extensive repairs.
Ornberg says they bought Baby several kitty treats to thank her for her good deed, and he’s noticed a bit of spring in her step since the fire.
“She was in the hotel jumping on the bed and playing last night,” says Ornberg. “She has a different attitude now.”

Well let’s see not much going on in my neck of the woods. I had the girls from school come over for a game night since Jess was supposed to go out with some guys from work which he doesn’t have many friends so definitely wanted him to go but it didn’t work out anyway the one guy didn’t call and the other ended up not going. The whole reason they were gonna go out was because the one guy Ryan’s gf broke up with him. They had been dating for 4 years. She decided that drugs and partying were more important than him so Jess and this other guy were gonna take him out to cheer him up. They think they were gonna go to a strip club. So anyway I came to find out last night the reason Ryan didn’t go out with Jess was because he was with his ex. I tell you people just don’t learn but whatever their problem. 
So the girls came over and we played Boxers and Briefs. My friend Melissa and her sister Tammy were supposed to come over but surprise surprise they were a no show. It’s sad that the girls from school are more willing to hang out with me then my long time friends. Two had good excuses Lil Shell and Amy had to work and Belinda doesn’t know what she’s doing so I’m not shocked by her not coming. 
Then most of the weekend I just sat around and was lazy except for tonight when I went to a place called Petco and volunteered for PAWS which is a no kill organization that is trying to find homes for cats. The first night I was there they adopted out 5 cats. So it’s definitely a cool thing to do and might help me with my vet tech classes which I will be starting tomorrow night. I heard that one of the classes I’m gonna be taking is very hard so I’m a lil nervous about that but hopefully it goes well. 
I found out that I’m getting more money taxes wise which is awesome. I had gotten a notice not too long after I got my tax refund saying that I could get like 800 for some educational credit thing but I threw the letter because I thought it was just letting me know about it and that I would get the money in 8-12 weeks. Well I never got the money so I went down to the IRS office and they told me that the lady that did my taxes screwed them up. She did some tuition reinbursement when she should have done a american something credit. So the lady I spoke with at the office told me I should go back to the lady and have her redo it I told the lady she moved to Las Vegas so they were nice enough to amend my taxes and now I’m getting over 700 back some time soon. So that was nice to hear lol.

One of my classes is just plain crazy. I have to take one called Large animal a and p. We have lab work we have to do at a offsite lab in Janesville. So we have to drive to Wisconsin for our lab. The good thing is since I have a minivan people can carpool with me and I will get gas money lol. Next week is our first lab week. We have to draw blood on a cow which is just plain scary because we have NEVER done anything like that before.  There is also a big checklist of other stuff we have to do. I’m seriously scared shitless. 
Other than that my other class which is animal hospital principles is basically terminology which I think I will do pretty good with. It’s not that bad. So I’ll definitely write about how it goes next week. The good thing is if we go to the lab then we don’t have to come to school for the other day we have class so that is awesome. My mom will be very happy about that one since she has to watch my son for me. Not much else to write about.

Pass this on to ALL in your address book. You never know whose life you may save by doing so. For those of you at work, PLEASE remember to check your cupboards when you get home tonight!!!
This is confirmed on Snopes   http://www.snopes.com/medical/toxins/pancake.asp
A student at HBHS (a high school) had pancakes this week and it almost became fatal. His Mom (registered nurse) made him pancakes, dropped him off at school and headed to play tennis. She never takes her cell phone on the court but did this time and her son called to say he was having trouble breathing. She told him to go to the nurse immediately and proceeded to call school and alert the nurse. The nurse called the paramedics and they were there in 3 minutes and worked on the boy all the way to the hospital. He came so close to dying.
Evidently this is more common then I ever knew. Check the expiration dates on packages like pancakes and cake mixes that have yeast which over time develop spores. Apparently, the mold that forms in old mixes can be toxic! Throw away ALL OUTDATED pancake mix, brownie mixes, Bisquick, cake & cookie mixes, etc., you have in your home.
P.S.  Tell this to your children, grandchildren, nephews, nieces and anyone else who keeps these types of mixes in the cupboard.

Well tonight for 2 of my classes large animal anatomy and physiology and disease and husbandry of large animals we had to go to Janesville, WI which is a hour away from where we live. We got to work on real live cows. I was so nervous. It wasn’t horrible but wasn’t the greatest either. We had to get a cow out of the stall it was in and put it into a chute.(will try to find a pic of it and post it at the bottom of the entry)Then we had to basically lock down the chute so the cow or calf in our case couldn’t escape. Then we had to do a physical exam on the cow. We checked the gums to see what color they were, checked the eyes and nose to make sure there was  no discharge, took the pulse and listened to the heart and lungs, did a jujuglar vein blood draw, did a sub Q or short for sub cutaneous which means skin shot, did a bolus which is basically a long metal thing that has a spot where you put a pill and shove it in the calf or cow or bull’s throat and push on the end and it shoots the pill down their throat. So it was pretty interesting. When we were trying to get the calf to go in the chute there was 3 other ones in the stall with him so they kept moving around and of course just pooping and peeing wherever. I was trying to watch out but I felt something hit my back turned around to find one of them pooping and got some on the back of my shirt. Luckily not a ton thank goodness lol. We had to clean out the stalls and hose it down. By the end of the night I smelled horrible, was bitten by mosquitoes, sweating, and wet. We had a page that had different things we had to get initaled by one of the instructors that were there I got most of them except a few so now I’m scared what my grade might be. It didn’t help that my teacher screwed up and told us we only had to go once a week and then we would get extra credit if we went the 2nd day. Turns out we were supposed to go both days so me and a few others were behind  in what needed to be done. So that sucks. We were only out there for 4 hours but DAMN my feet are killing me. I think I’m gonna take a 800 mg of Ibropfen before I go to bed. 

here is the cow chute.

here is the balling gun which you use for the bolus

I think one of the main reasons its so hard to quit smoking is because all the benefits of quitting and all the dangers of continuing seem very far away. Well, heres a little timeline about some of the more immediate effects of quitting smoking and how that will affect your body RIGHT NOW.
* In 20 minutes your blood pressure will drop back down to normal.
* In 8 hours the carbon monoxide (a toxic gas) levels in your blood stream will drop by half, and oxygen levels will return to normal.
* In 48 hours your chance of having a heart attack will have decreased. All nicotine will have left your body. Your sense of taste and smell will return to a normal level.
* In 72 hours your bronchial tubes will relax, and your energy levels will increase.
* In 2 weeks your circulation will increase, and it will continue to improve for the next 10 weeks.
* In three to nine months coughs, wheezing and breathing problems will dissipate as your lung capacity improves by 10%.
* In 1 year your risk of having a heart attack will have dropped by half.
* In 5 years your risk of having a stroke returns to that of a non-smoker.
* In 10 years your risk of lung cancer will have returned to that of a non-smoker.
* In 15 years your risk of heart attack will have returned to that of a non-smoker.
So, you have more immediate things to look forward to if you quit now besides just freaking out about not being able to smoke. Quit now!

154,https://www.opendiary.com/m/torturedsoul_1/school-893-5150188/,2010-07-01,School,"
Well I had to rant about this because it pisses me off badly. I have 3 classes this quarter for school. Animal hospital principles with the teacher I had for a class last quarter. The teacher is a certified vet tech and just recently graduated. She works at two animal clinics. The emergency clinic on the weekends and another clinic during the week and of course teaching a few nights and helping in Janesville. 
Then for my other two classes which are Large animal anatomy and physiology and Disease and husbandry of large animals. This chick has been a vet tech for quite a while longer than my other teacher. She is much different. My other teacher does a lot to help us understand the material and helps us review for quizzes and things like that. The teacher for my large animal classes doesn’t do shit to help. I asked her if she could give us the correct answers for our homework so we know what the correct answers are if it happens to be on a test. She said she couldn’t because that would mean we didn’t read what we were supposed to. I said she could at least give us page numbers so we could find the info easier. We have 4 books for those two classes and it’s a pain in the ass to look through 4 different books to find the answers. If she could at least let us know what book the answers are in then maybe we would have time to read what we are supposed to read. This is only going on our 4th week of class and for the large animal a and p I got a D and for husbandry and disease a B. 
Well that’s my ranting about that. My 4th of July is looking like it’s gonna be ok. My friends from school are coming over for a BBQ. Then we are gonna go to the parade and fireworks. We will probably chit chat and play games to kill time in between so hopefully everything goes ok and everyone is able to come and has a good time. Other than that not much else going on in my neck of the woods. I’m still volunteering for PAWS which is a non profit cat rescue. I go to their place inside Petco and clean the cages and play with the cats and kittens. It’s so much fun.

Well today was interesting to say the least. My friends Ginny and April from school came over to hang out. We had a BBQ and went and watched the parade even though it was pretty disappointing and it started raining real good. The fireworks were pretty good though so that was good at least. It just made me mad and sad that more people couldn’t come but I’m used to that. 
Tomorrow night we have go to Janesville and work on goats. It should be interesting. We have to put catheters in their jugular vein. I’m so paranoid and scared. I’m just happy to get out of Rockford for a few hours whether it’s working on goats or not. Hopefully at the end of this month we will be going to Great America but it depends on if we get our money when we are supposed for school. My LINK has become a huge nightmare for this month. I turned in my paperwork and things I had to gather and I took it to the office and turned it in. Well the first came and went and still no LINK so I called a few times and left messages for my caseworker to let me know what’s going on. I get another letter that I know I filled out and signed in the mail yesterday. So I filled it out again and I wrote on it I hope I don’t have to find everything and turn them in. If I do I want to make a appointment with her to hand them to her in person so I don’t have another issue like that again. As for in the mean time I have no clue how we are gonna be able to afford to get groceries. This sucks so bad.

Tonight for school we had to work on goats. It wasn’t too horrible. We had to give them 2 shots. One of which burned their vein as we put it in. Most of the goats were pretty good except a few that were freaking out. We had to do partners and the chick I was with I seriously felt like she thought I was a moron. She’s kind of a know-it-all anyway and man does that piss me off. I don’t like know-it-alls. It wasn’t horrible or anything. Wednesday we go out there again and are doing catheters. It should be REAL exciting. 
Other than that still haven’t heard from my caseworker but I think that’s because today was their holiday so I’m gonna keep calling until she actually calls me back because I need to know if for some reason she didn’t get that specific sheet or if I have to go do the run around and round up the rest of the stuff too so I can my card activated. 
Kacey was started on another med. This one is to hopefully help with bedewetting problems. The nurse lady said that a lot of kids with ADHD and ADD have problems with bedwetting. The pills have been working so far so hopefully it keeps up that way.

157,https://www.opendiary.com/m/torturedsoul_1/more-goats-lol-5150191/,2010-07-07,More Goats lol,"
Tonight was another night dealing with goats in Janesville. It was pouring down rain on the way there. Tons of fun trying to drive in rain. So we got into groups of 3. Guess who I get stuck with again lol. Lauren the know-it-all. Thank god my friend Ginny was also in my group which helped out. We were both getting pissed because Lauren thought that just because she had come earlier in the day for extra credit that she didn’t have to do much when our class was there. She just basically stood there trying to tell us what to do. We were trying to restraint the goat and she just stood there as well until Ginny asked if she could come help us. 
The catheter part wasn’t too bad. Mine was a lil bit difficult because the vein moved on me after I put the needle in so I had to kinda readjust to get it right. Ginny had some issues when she was trying to do hers which sucked. Then we were just about to put the goat back and Lauren decided she wanted to FINALLY do something besides act like Mrs. Perfect so me and Ginny had to stand there and restraint the goat. 
The mosquitoes started getting bad towards the end of the evening. We didn’t get out until 10. Me and Jessica stopped at McDonald’s to get something to eat before coming back to my house. My LINK issue is hopefully resolved even though my caseworker said that it would probably take a week before I got my LINK activated. Also turns out they didn’t lose my paperwork it just took forever to be processed. So hopefully VERY soon I will be getting my LINK turned on so we can FINALLY get some actual groceries in our house.

158,https://www.opendiary.com/m/torturedsoul_1/cook-out-update-5150192/,2010-07-25,cook-out/update,"
Oh boy where do I begin? Well about a week ago I was invited over to my friend Melissa’s house for a cook-out they were doing. It would have been ok except for the fact that Melissa’s sister Tammy had just gotten over Whooping cough. Yea she said she wasn’t contagious but I was just getting over a cold and my mom is diabetic I didn’t want to risk the chance of either of us getting it or her getting my cold and making her problem worse so I told her we weren’t coming over for that reason. So she was talking about doing it this weekend but yesterday was my fiancee’s fitness picnic to try to promote business for his school and today we originally planned to go to Great America but my school money didn’t come in so me and Jess were gonna go out to a lake and do the pedal boats or canoe but then the rain happened which resulted in high water levels so i figured that idea was out too. So I told them that I wasn’t sure because of the weather. So they threw a holy fit about it. Here is the status that started it all: wishing friends would be more like friends and stop making up excuses why they cant come to something i plan and just give me the truth. thats all i ask. we get invited to things, sure okay, good friends. but when i asked them to come to something im having, somethings always going on….mood=pissed off at the moment” to which I replied with: ” love being told I’m a horrible friend because I would like to spend a day with my fiancee who I don’t get to see much and can’t plan anything because of the dumb weather GEEZ. Even though these friends have not come to every single thing I’ve planned and I didn’t say a word about it because I understand things come up. DRAMA DRAMA DRAMA.” This is what she wrote regarding my comment: u didnt bother to tell me u wanted to be with jess. u told me we might go out somewhere, than u said well depends on the weather. we have tried to make it to every thing u have planned, but unforunatly with two babys, it makes things difficult. other times we cant make it or dont feel like going anywhere. im not worried about the reason, im more worried about getting several reasons and not knowing which one to believe.i left a status saying friends should be more like friends or something like that. because i felt like i was being lied to or just that she didnt want to come. i got several reasons and didnt know which one was true. than when she said about jess, if she would have just told me that, i wouldve understood. im not trying to pick a fight or loose a friend. just want the truth from everyone. even if its i just feel like staying home.”Then her sister chimed in with “ok, well i agree never once did u say anything about spending time with jess, only the weather and u might go out to eat. and like tammy said your mom acted like she didn’t know anything about it, plus it doesn’t take all day to go out to eat. so to me also it sounds like u were just coming up with excuses why u couldn’t go. and weather wise it’d be at my house and i do have an a/c. so if it got bad we could always come inside. just doesn’t make any sense to me.
spending time with jess makes alot more sense then other the other reasons u gave. and by giving so many diff reasons why each weekend does sound like your lying.
and it pisses me off when u mention about jess now, but never mentioned about it in the beginning. and your posting this status, like its our fault. Then their mom chimes in with her opinion, “#
well friends dont call friends name of which I wont mention, because I try not to swear! And we do come to almost everything you have,WHICH I cannot say the same for you. And I agree with Melissa.
And funny you never mentioned it before and… made every “other excuse” why you couldnt come
opps meant to say names.
 michelle its like this if you dont want to come just say so, quit making excuses up and then act like its someone’s fault on facebook so everyone will feel sorry for you.”
I try to plan events with my friends on a monthly basis to hang out. When we do movie or game night we all try to chip in for pizza but I told Melissa did I ever say since you can’t chip in that you couldn’t have some of the pizza? Then there was the big commotion about thanksgiving. I invited them over and had asked them to bring over a few items and they basically acted like I wanted them to bring over most of the dinner. Then for my b-day party I asked people to pay for themselves because I couldn’t afford to pay for everyone or something like that and they tried to say that I had to pay for everyone or find something else to do. Can someone please tell me what the hell is there to do in the dead of winter besides going to my house or going out somewhere like bowling. Besides the fact how many get togethers have they not attended. Did I get pissed off about it and ask them why? NO because I understand that not everyone can come for one reason or another. As for the comment about trying to be a better friend what do I have to do to be a better friend? I took these people up to Wisconsin Dells so they could visit with friends that they hadn’t seen in a long time and OFFERED to do it. When we got there I ended up  having to help with the hotel because they did the reservations online and didn’t know about the pet fee. I have given the sister Melissa items for her two kids and went to almost everyone in their families birthday party. So am I seriously that bad of a friend? No one really commented about it or tried to defend me I just tell myself that they didn’t want to get involved or didn’t know what to say. It just makes me feel like crap. I attract drama I swear. 
Well other than that whole mess not much has been going on here. We worked on horses up in Janesville last Wedsnesday. That was awesome. My group worked on a pony that had sore feet. The pony was very well behaved. I did better than I thought in my two large animal mid-terms. I brought up  my grade to a C in one of them. Tomorrow I have to get up at the butt crack of dawn to go to a slaughterhouse. YAY so thrilled NOT. The only good thing is I won’t have to go to school tomorrow night. So I guess that’s all that has happened recently. I have to get my butt to bed so I can wake up at 6:30 to go pick up my friend from school before we head out there.

Well today I went on Facebook and did my usual looking at everyone’s status messages. I noticed a girl named Amanda that works with my friend Lil Michelle at Wal-mart had her status message as “Thank you everyone for your support I greatly appreciate it. Please keep praying for Michelle for she has not woken up out of the coma yet.” So I know that Amanda and Lil Shell hang out with each other outside of work too so I left Amanda a comment asking if it was Lil Shell she was talking about but figured it would be a while before she commented me back. So I decided to text Lil Shell. Well she usually texts right back which she didn’t. A guy that she was kinda seeing texted me back and told me she was in the hospital. Come to find the message Amanda left was true. Here is the news story from one of our local TV stations in my town.
WINNEBAGO COUNTY (WREX) – Three people were hurt in a two car accident on Bypass 20 Friday morning.
Investigators say the driver of a 2002 Dodge Neon missed the stop sign on Keith Road near the Bypass and hit a 1995 Jeep Cherokee around 4:20 a.m. Friday.
Both vehicles ended up in a field and both drivers were airlifted to area hospitals with serious injuries. A passenger in the jeep was also taken to an area hospital.
The victims’ names and conditions have not been released.
Traffic was re-routed off of the Bypass for a short time.

From what I was told by the guy whose name is Dustin my friend Lil Shell and Amanda were going to the McDonald’s not far from Amanda’s house when the Neon’s passenger side basically ran into the driver’s door of Michelle’s car causing them to go off the road and flip. From what I heard the driver of the Neon was drunk not sure if that is true or not. I’m hoping to go visit her tomorrow even though a part of me is terrified to go see her. I just hope she wakes up and there is no permanent brain damage. 
*********************************UPDATE*********************************
I forgot to say what really happened with the accident. I spoke with Michelle’s friend Amanda who was the passenger in the accident. It turns out that the accident DID not happen at 4 in the morning. According to Amanda her and Michelle were on their way to a McDonald’s not far from Amanda’s house. They were traveling on highway 20 and were turning onto  Keith Road when they were struck by the Neon and ended up flipping and ending up in a field. Amanda was unconscious for a while before she woke up and called her husband who had to go looking for the accident in order to call 911. One of our local news stations had the story posted on their website some moron had the nerve to make a comment saying basically Amanda and her husband were a moron for her calling him instead of 911. The problem was Amanda was disoriented from the crash and didn’t know exactly where they were so she called her husband who came and found them and called 911. What would have been the point of Amanda trying to call 911 if she didn’t know where she was? People are such morons. As far as I can remember not one person made a comment about the idiot who decided to drive drunk and hit them. What is this world coming to? That made me so mad.

Well after a hectic day I finally got to go see my friend Michelle in the hospital. It wasn’t as bad as I was thinking it was going to be. Her mom was there so I was talking to her. We went in to see her. While I was standing talking to her mom her heartrate would occasionally go up not too much but just a little so I think she is able comprehend that people are there. Also she moved her fingers and her arm on one side so that’s good. I found out that her coma is NOT medicine induced. She is in a natural coma and was actually brought into the hospital as a Jane Doe but her purse was brought in with her so they were able to find ID of some kind to figure out who she was. She has been in the coma since the accident. So now we are just waiting for her to come out of the coma so please pray or keep her in your thoughts. It was definitely hard seeing her like that. She is on a ventilator but according to her mom can breathe on her own but they did the ventilator because sometimes she forgets to breathe. Her mom said she has a cut on one of her arms near her elbow and a cut on the side of her head which I didn’t see. She has a device in her head that isn’t super big or anything to measure her brain pressure because her head is swollen but she still has all her hair. Her mom told me they don’t have her on pain meds because they are hoping that the pain will  bring her out of the coma. I plan to go visit her again Thursday night after class. 
It just breaks my heart to see one of my closest friends like that but I’m hoping she gets better and she won’t have brain damage but they basically won’t be able to figure out the extent of that until she comes out of the coma. Her mom said they are suing the driver of the other car but the proceedings can’t start until she’s out of the hospital so it might still be a while before that happens. So I will keep everyone updated as much as I can. 
Other than that got a lab test tomorrow night in Janesville so hopefully that goes well. I went to tutoring today and the lady was nice and gave us what was on the test so I just have to bring my notebook with and look over the stuff on the way there.

I hope no one is getting annoyed that I keep updating about my friend. I came to visit tonight after school. There was a few changes. She didn’t have the neck brace on like the other night I went. There was no hard boot looking things on her feet. They had soft, inflatable ones on her. She didn’t have hard brace type things on her arms. So that was interesting. She was moving her hand,arm, and fingers on her right side much more than the other day. She was even moving her leg a few times as well. She grabbed her gown instead of the pillow and started pulling up her gown I’m sure by accident so the other girl that was there that I don’t really care for because she’s a user BIG time not drug or alcohol but the type that expect everyone to do things for them pulled her gown back down and I told Lil One no flashing anyone. She is still in the coma or as I started calling it a world of her own. The nurse came to do some stuff and she got close to Michelle and was saying”Michelle wake up!” or “Michelle give me a thumbs up or grab my hand.” She had taken off the restraint on her right hand and so Michelle reached up and tried to take the ventilator out. The nurse later told us that was a purposeful movement so that’s a good sign. 

The one thing I’m worried about is the fact that she hasn’t moved her left side. I feel so bad for her mom because I know it hurts her to see her daughter like that. I couldn’t imagine having something like that happen to Kacey. I started doing this thing. Every time I go to visit I bring a card with and give it to her mom. I’m sure her mom is probably thinking what the heck. Each card I give her I have a update of her progress and I offer words of encouragement. Does that sound weird? I sure hope not. 
Her mom called me earlier today to tell me they were taking her off the ventilator but when I went to visit she told me that they were hoping to lower the number on the ventilator. She won’t find out until tomorrow morning. I just keep thinking maybe if we keep talking to her she will just open her eyes but I know it’s a day to day thing even though we would love for that to happen. 
In other news we had our lab test for my large animal classes. We had to put a halter on a horse, do a polo wrap, properly pick up the horse’s hoof and pick out their shoe. and I wanna say something else but I can’t remember what now. We also had a written exam as well. It was tons of fun NOT. I just hope I did a good job on all of it.

162,https://www.opendiary.com/m/torturedsoul_1/jess-went-with-to-visit-5150196/,2010-08-06,Jess went with to visit,"
Last night when me and Lil Michelle’s mom were leaving the hospital she asked me why Jess hadn’t come to visit. I told her I wasn’t sure if it was because he was uncomfortable with hospitals or what the deal was. So I asked Jess and he said it wasn’t that he was afraid of hospitals he just didn’t want to see her like that. I don’t blame him it’s hard for me to see her like that. So he was a trooper and went with me today to visit. We had to take Kacey with because my mom wasn’t off work yet. Lil Michelle’s mom was nice enough to keep an eye on him while we went back to visit. Lil Michelle when we went to visit had a small stuffed teddy bear that she was touching so that was cool to see. She is still in the coma of course but she seems to be moving more things more often. Today she moved her other leg and hand just a lil bit but that’s better than nothing. She also held Jess’s hand and wouldn’t let go of it lol. 
Well my school money came in and my tax refund came in too so we got some money lol. My LINK came in the other day. That was 7 hundred and something dollars for food because of not getting any for July. We FINALLY got some food in our house. YAY. As for school money and the income tax we paid off our bills for the month, caught up on rent, took the dogs and one cat to the vet for shots. I have to go get a few more scrub pants, Kacey’s b-day present, some crocs and a few other things at Wal-Mart and we are saving like 500 for the wedding trip next week. So I think it’s money well spent.

Well me and my mom went to visit Lil Shell today. My mom did pretty well. She didn’t start crying until she was about to leave lol. Lil one was still moving her arm and leg but this time her left eye was open a tiny slit and her right eyelid twitched so maybe we are getting closer to her waking up. God I hope so. I plan on going to see her tomorrow too. She is making progress so that is a good thing. 
Did my shopping after that. I went out to the mall and got 3 scrub pants, 1 top, a watch with a second hand, a pair of shoes, and a few other things, went to gamestop and got a few wii games. Then we went to Toys R Us so I could get Kacey’s b-day present. I got him a train set and a few trains and a lego semi. Then I went to Wal-mart and bought a blender for our snow cones lol, a new DVD player, a new mp3 player, a few dvds for jess and some new containers to organize stuff. So money well spent if you ask me. We also got all of our bills for August paid and rent caught up so maybe we can start paying off some other bills and get ahead for once lol.

164,https://www.opendiary.com/m/torturedsoul_1/this-hurts-me-so-much-5150198/,2010-08-08,This hurts me so much,"
Me and the girl who was in the accident with my friend Michelle whose name is Amanda were chatting on Facebook. I feel the exact same way she does which is helpless. It’s so hard to sit by and watch a close friend go through what Michelle is going through. You just want to help her in some way but there’s not really anything you can do. Just keep visiting her and letting her know you are there. She is making progress which is awesome and exciting but you want her to open her eyes. I’m not a impatient person but this is one thing that I am impatient about. 
Another thing that pisses me off is one of our local news stations have the story about the accident on their website and people can leave comments some idiot left a note basically blaming Amanda’s husband Terry for not getting help quick enough for Michelle. If I already talked about this I’m sorry for repeating. The person did not know all the details about the accident and therefore should have kept their mouth shut. We think it was this girl named Amber that was “friends” with Michelle. I put friend in quotes because this chick in my opinion and Amanda’s is a user. Michelle told me about how this chick always wanted Michelle to drive her places and watch her son. Then Michelle was dating this chick’s brother and he was a loser too. Why she was still friends with the girl I don’t know. 
Back to my rant lol. So whoever this person was blaming Amanda’s husband for not getting help to her quick enough. For one Amanda was unconscious for 3 hours after the jeep flipped over so when she did wake up she contacted her husband because she had no clue where she was. He came and FOUND them and then called 911. What would be the point of him calling 911 if he didn’t know where the accident was? I actually went to the accident site and it wasn’t at a intersection like the news report said. It was about a block from the intersection and was just a regular stop sign. If it wasn’t for Amanda waking up and contacting her husband who knows how long it would have been before someone realized there was a accident because obviously people were that retarded or something to not see the wreck. I can understand if they were afraid to go near it for fear that the people were dead but they could have at least called the police about it. 
Then there is the moron who decided to drive drunk to begin with. This guy must have had some crappy friends. Who would let their friend drive drunk? It just makes me so angry because if this person’s friends were real friends or even a bartender at a bar noticed he had a few too many and called a cab for him this accident wouldn’t have had happened. I wish the guy was the one in the coma and not my friend.She didn’t deserve this crap to happen to her. 
The other day when I went to go see her she did have her left eye open just a tiny slit but hey I was thrilled. Today when I came to visit her she wasn’t moving around that much but she did raise her knee and give a thumbs up a few times. So she is getting there. I’m just so scared of how much damage there is to her brain. Just have to be a friend and be there for her as much as I can even though it hurts to see her the way she is.

Well tonight after class I went to see my friend Lil Michelle again. She was not really moving or anything like before but part of it might have been because they put the hard braces back on her hands because she kept them in fists and they don’t want that because it could become permanent. Me and her mom were in her room just sitting by her bed chatting about stuff and her mom noticed that she needed her vent tube suctioned out because she started coughing a lot. I had noticed when she started coughing that she had opened her eyes just a bit but didn’t think much of it. When the nurse came in and started suctioning out her vent she OPENED HER EYES ALL THE WAY. Me and her mom were just in shock. She kept them open for a good 10 seconds or so and then closed them again. When she had them open though she didn’t move her eyes from side to side or anything so that worried me a bit. 
Then when I was writing about that on Facebook I spoke to her friend Amanda that was in the accident with her and she said that she had visited her earlier in the day and she opened her eyes earlier too and that she had looked around then so I don’t know. Amanda also said that the nurse told her that Michelle was trying to come out of the coma so we are on the right road. Hopefully things keep improving. Her feeding tube was removed from her nose and put in her stomach and the tube she has that measured the pressure in her brain was clamped off but she was still having issues with her pressure when I was there. Her mom said they are gonna do a catscan tomorrow so hopefully that will be coming out soon. So she is making progress and I’m so happy for that. I’m keeping my fingers crossed that when she does come completely out of the coma that there is no brain damage or if there is unfortunately that it is not a huge amount of brain damage.

166,https://www.opendiary.com/m/torturedsoul_1/yet-another-update-on-my-friend-5150200/,2010-08-11,yet another update on my friend,"
I went to see Lil Michelle today. When I walked in the room her eyes were open for a bit but then she closed them most of the time I was there. For me any progress is good enough for me. Her mom said they are talking about taking out the ventilator and putting in a trach tube which means they would have to cut a hole in her neck and put the tube in there. Her mom said that they are taking out the ventilator because if they continue to leave it in that she could lose her voice and we don’t want that so they are going to do that. 
I tried to give her her bear today and she grabbed my finger instead lol and wouldn’t let go. She has a good grip that’s for sure. So hopefully things keep improving and she can get out I know it won’t be that soon because of therapy and all that kind of stuff. I would say she is officially out of the coma but not sure if that’s correct or not since she does open her eyes but she has problems following commands so that is a downfall. 
So it’s a wait and see situation still. Hopefully with therapy and repetitiveness she will be able to follow the commands. So happy she is doing much better than she was though. The 2nd tube in her head was out when I came in today too. 
The only other thing going on is the bridezilla’s wedding this weekend. I’m looking forward to getting out of my town for a few days but not looking forward to the whole wedding crap. I know I’m going swimming when we get there lol. 
    
"
167,https://www.opendiary.com/m/torturedsoul_1/wedding-school-lil-michelle-5150201/,2010-08-19,wedding/school/lil michelle,"

Boy do I got a lot to update about. Well I’ll start with bridezilla’s wedding lol. We left Friday to go there because Jess was in the wedding party and they were doing their rehersal. So on our way up there the sky made it look like night out and we had taken my van which still has a broken driver side window. Jess definitely didn’t need a shower after that. We ended up having to pull over for a bit because the rain was coming down so heavy that we couldn’t see in front of us. So after a bit of delay we made it to our hotel, got checked in and got ready for the rehersal. The initial plan was to drop Jess off at the church so he could do his rehersal thing and then me and Kacey were going to go to the zoo/park/amusement rides place not too far from the church and just go out to eat with C.J. but NO Russ wanted us to go to the rehersal. Why I do not fucking know because all we did was sit there doing nothing. Me and Kacey were both ticked off. So after the rehersal they went to a nice restaurant and had a nice dinner. I felt a bit left out because everyone else was in the wedding party and got gifts me and Kacey got nothing. Oh well the gifts looked really cheap anyway so no big loss. 
So the wedding went pretty well. Kacey was misbehaving a lil bit not too bad. I thought it was funny that C.J. was supposedly “helping” me with Kacey but he doesn’t even see his own kid. Whatever it didn’t bug me that bad. C.J. was very polite and even dressed nice for the wedding. No blue jeans and cowboy boots. I felt bad for him though because since Jess was in the wedding party we got to go on the school bus and take pictures at different places while poor C.J. had no one to hang out with. The uncles were there but C.J. doesn’t get along with most of them. So after the picture taking was of course the reception.
We thought we were at the front table that said RESERVED on it since we were family but no we got shoved at a table in the corner while the uncles got to sit at the reserved table. What a crock of shit if you ask me. Jess got me to dance for a few slow songs and Kacey made some friends. There was a few funny parts. One was Russ got these drinks called lethal weapons and one of the bridesmaids was trying to drink it and she had to get something to chase it. Jaime just took the glass and downed it with no prob. Then a bit later the photographer chick grabbed one and drank it and she looked like she was about to barf. So that was the wedding. We left at like 10:30 at night so that sucked but the ride home wasn’t too bad. 
As for school tonight was my official last day for the quarter. For my large animal classes it looked like I passed husbandry and disease but anatomy and physiology is a different story but when I added up my grades it didn’t seem right so I left my teacher a note about it and hopefully the grade was miscalculated because if not I failed that class and from what I have been hearing financial aid won’t pay for it and there is no way I can afford to take it on my own. So hopefully if I did fail it everyone was wrong and financial aid will cover it. My other class that I took my final for tonight I think I did a good job in it. My grade was already a A so I’m not too worried about it. 
As for Lil Michelle things are looking up. She has been opening her eyes more and more. The only bad thing is she doesn’t seem to focus them too well so hopefully that is a temporary thing and not permanent. Her mom said she has been following the doctor and nurses commands that they give her and she was sitting in a special chair today. She got the ventilator out and now has a trach in her neck and today they now have the restraints off of her as long as she doesn’t try to pull out the trach or anything. The other night I was there which was Tuesday she smiled at the nurse and me and her mom were talking about farting and she smiled about it so that is a definite good thing. 
They are talking about sending her to rehab in the next week the only bad part is she will have to go to Chicago which is a hour away from us so I would only be able to see her on the weekends and her mom would only be able to visit with her during the week. So that is bad in a way but good also because they will be teaching her how to dress herself and feed herself again. They even have where the people will teach you how to care for her but it’s in the mornings during the week and I wouldn’t be able to do that with school and work so hopefully they will do it on the weekends too. I told her mom if she can get approved for home health aid I would come and be her aide but that will be a ways in the future and I just want Lil one to get better. The accident report was finally finished and now hopefully the state attorney will file charges and get the drunk loser who did this behind bars even though I’m sure it won’t be for long. I hope that he had a hell of a time drinking and realizes what he has done but a lot don’t. It’s a wait and see thing but I’m just happy that she’s improving. 
Tomorrow after work going to the fair in our county. I got megapasses so I’m ready to ride some rides. I got one for Kacey too and Jess said he’s gonna stay home and take a nap which sucks but whatever. I’m used to him not wanting to do much with us. My friend April from school and her mom and her daughter are gonna come too and my mom is going too so at least someone else will be there to hang out with. Sucks that the rest of my friends didn’t want to go but what can you do. 
Then Saturday is our dog wash for school and Sunday is Kacey’s b-day party even though his b-day was last Saturday but the bridezilla decided to have their wedding on it. 
So that is my weekend and update. Hope everyone else’s life isn’t as complicated as mine is lol.

WRONG!!!!  
So I had posted my thoughts about the wedding or I should say just my situation at the wedding. Here is what I wrote: “back from the wedding. Not too bad got to see some pretty sites and had fun at the reception.”
So then the new SIL wrote this “what do you mean not too bad…it was beautiful and perfect! 
I wrote back “for you guys it was beautiful and perfect lol for me not so good”
to which she replied: “russ says go f urself…lol guess he dint like that comment…he said if it was that bad then maybe he wont invite you anywhere else….hes not happy thinks it sounded ungreatful….sry we wasted ur time i guess”
to which I replied: ” I ‘m thankful that you guys invited us to the wedding. I have a friend who at the time was in a coma so I was worried about her as well and had her on my mind. Everything I say seems to sound wrong. Don’t know what I can do to change that …besides not speak but I’m a big mouth so that won’t work lol. I get the vibe that Russ doesn’t really like me anyway. I hope Russ understands I was not trying to be ungrateful or sound ungrateful just had my friend on my mind. You guys didn’t waste our time it was nice to get out of crappy Rockford for a few days actually wish we could have stayed longer. I’m sure Kacey would have loved that.”
Seriously I thought when the wedding ended this fucking bullshit would end too. I’ve known since like the first time me and Jess started dating that Russ didn’t care for me and I still believe it no matter what he tries to say. To me it’s just not words it’s actions. I always felt like he thought I was a idiot and even during the whole wedding drama with the comments about talking only to Jess and all this other bull. It was like he was trying to shut me out of stuff and it wasn’t my business not like it matters because Jess tells me everything he says anyway. People fucking act like it’s a goddamn crime that I wrote my opinion about something. Maybe I was having a shitty day that day and that’s what came of it. Geez it’s called grow the fuck up. 
Today has just been a shitty day for me anyway. I think I need to go to bed early before I blow up at someone. We went to the fair and I bought a 20 dollar megapass, rode on two rides before it started storming and pouring down rain. Then it took about another 1 or 2 hours for the rain to stop so they would turn back on the rides. Just left the fair at close to 7. Then tomorrow have to get up at like 10 to go get my friend April who lives all the way across town because they don’t have a vehicle right now. She has a 2 year daughter or I would tell her to just spend the night so I wouldn’t have to drive all the way over there to get her. Man why can’t people live closer. Well I’m gonna go out to eat with Jess and probably watch a little bit of TV and GO TO BED.

Ok I’m sure everyone remembers the drama issue in the last entry involving my new sister in law well first let me post what was said and then comment about it. 
T:
I know this doesn’t involve me, but I gotta something to say about it
Russ is a fucking ass hole. Why do YOU have to be grateful? b/c he had his wedding on YOUR SON’S BIRTHDAY?!?!, b/c you had to fork over a but load of money to attend HIS W…EDDING, that was ON YOUR SON’S FUCKING BIRTHDAY! and then he wouldn’t even let you take your son out to enjoy it so you could sit around at a fucking rehearsal when you are not even if the wedding, and Kacey wasn’t either correct? why did you need to be there? and he doesn’t like you, but he needs to be a fucking man and just tell you that. he’s still upset over shit that happened a long fucking time ago when you cheated on Jess. Obviously you and Jess are over it if you had a fucking son together and plan to get married, so Russ needs to get the fuck over it. He’s a fucking dick, and you should tell him to go fuck himself, you don’t need to be grateful for anything, he should be grateful, you and Jess and you son were even at his wedding ON YOU SON’S FUCKING BIRTHDAY!
J:
Ur right about one thing Tabitha- its none of ur business!! First off, You go to a family memebers wedding bcuz you love and support them. We invited Michelle as well bcuz SHE is Jess’s “wife” and part of the family of course!!!! Second- K…acey WAS in the wedding until Jess and Shell (understandably) decided to take him out cuz they couldnt afford it. Russ wanted nothing more then Kacey be a part of his big day!! As for this wedding being on Kaceys bday- Russ announced it at the reception AND had 150 + ppl sing to him!!! And u want him to go fuck himself?!?! Where do you come off calling my husband a dick!?!?! STAY OUT OF IT!! Cuz all you did was open a BIG can of worms about personal info about ur best friends past that NOONE needed to know!!–That has nvr come out of Russ’ mouth to me in 4 years and Russ says he doesnt remeber that even happening! Great friend you are! And one last thing even tho its none of ur business- it takes a lot of time and effort (over a year) to plan a wedding- dates you want are not always available- so to tell us we were wrong to pick that date- u can go fuck YOURself!!! Michelle- its not that Russ doesnt like you- we just thought the way you say things are way out of line and sound disrespectful! All of you have NO idea what 1 plate alone costs, much less the entire wedding! it wasnt done just for us it was done as well for family and friends bcuz they mean so much and its not the same w/o them! If you only knew the time and money OTHERS put forth…………..
Stay out of things that do not pertain to you. ·
T: fuck you i don’t have to stay 
out of it, she’s my best friend and i will defend her any time I damn well please.
·
M:
Jaime all I did was ask simple questions about the tux issue and I got a smart sounding reply from you about it. You told us to ask questions so I did and every time I asked something I was told a smart and rude answer by you. Then there wa…s the comment about me keeping Kacey in line at the ceremony. That comment was not even called for. The asking about Timmy I agree after I read it did sound like I was trying to tell you to invite him which I did apologize to you about. I just don’t think it’s fair you were saying I was rude when some of the comments you made were too. I apologize for any of my comments that sounded rude when they weren’t meant to. The comment about how much your wedding costed didn’t really need to be said. What does the cost of your wedding have to do why Russ didn’t like Timmy? I get that a wedding takes a lot of planning that part I won’t deny but why get smart with simple questions? As for Russ and his not liking me it doesn’t bother me but don’t treat me like crap and tell me to fuck off because of my opinion. Instead maybe he should have asked why I said it wasn’t too bad. The only other thing I have to say on the subject is we were told at the beginning that Kacey WAS going to be in the wedding and then after I made a joke about the tux you said he wasn’t in it. That’s all I’m gonna say about it. I never had a problem with you Jaime until the wedding came up. You are a sweet girl and I’m glad Russ found you and I understand wedding planning brings stress but it’s how you approached me that made me angry. It’s done and over with now and I’m willing to move on. I hope you guys are too. Again I will apologize for anything I said that was smart ass sounding or rude because it was NEVER meant to be either. 
 ·
M: T thank you for defending me. I appreciate it very much but I think the issue needs to be dropped. We are all adults and need to act like it. Yes everyone is entitled to their opinion which you made your position VERY clear. The wedding is over with so let’s all move on.
·
T: I’m fine with dropping it, but I won’t apologize to anyone, and I think you are way to nice to these people but they are your family so I understand you don’t want to fight with them. but if she comes on YOUR facebook page leaving bitchy comments again I will defend you cuz as far as I am concerned you are my family also.
 ·
M:
agreed upon. I can’t stop you from saying your opinion or anyone else for that matter but sometimes it’s better to drop something that is just gonna keep going on and on and on. I can live with the fact that Russ doesn’t like me and probabl…y doesn’t want to be around me but I don’t want my stupidity or comments to cause issues between him and Jess. That is the only brother who is has given a damn about him when his OWN mom didn’t and the only uncle who seems to give a crap about Kacey. If Russ doesn’t like me because of the cheating on Jess what can I say. Me and Jess have worked through it I have not cheated on Jess since then and never will. I learned my lesson and know it hurt Jess very much and wouldn’t dream of doing it again. If it’s for other reasons I don’t know if no one tells me.  ·
T: I just wanna say one more thing, I didn’t open any can of worms, about anything. EVERYONE knows about Michelle and Jesse’s past, and they are totally over it and moved on. I clearly remember Russ saying he didn’t like Michelle for that very reason a one point.
 ·
J: assuming is not good…..read thru ur comments u assumed alot!! …wow. and im dropping it cuz tab u are not worth the time and shell….no need to apoligize…im not. its all about respect….u showed very little by the comments….email eachother next time…. you all make me laugh.
T: whatever its already dropped, you are the one who is not worth it.
9 hours ago 
M: THE END
So after the comment about the end I see I have a message so I check it and this is what it says:  J:
ur friends are creepy and if you have anything ever to say about me- say it to me and dont sit on it. And for the record- Russ and I wanted Kacy in that wedding, we did not decide he wouldnt be in it- you guys did due to money reasons– so please never lie about me again– Im serious!!!! Now its the end!! 
M:
for one you don’t call my friends creepy. That particular friend has been my friend for many years and was the only one that defended me and has been there for me, second I didn’t lie about you and Kacey being inthe wedding. I made the joke about leaving plastic on his suit so he wouldn’t get it dirty and that is when you said he’s not in it then it had nothing to do with money. My friend and I were leaving the issue alone until you said she wasn’t worth it and all this other crap. As for respect how was I disrespectful when you treated me like i was a moron in every question I asked and then sat there and called me rude. You were very disrespectful to me as well so don’t act you’re all high and mighty and I was the only one wrong in it. I apologized for my part in it and you still continue to call me disrespectful and rude and all this other crap. What more do I need to do? As for my friend she is her own person and i can’t control what she writes and she did have a good point if you didn’t like what I said you could have messaged me instead of writing about it on my page. So the same goes for you about keeping things private. Again I don’t want stupid crap between us it’s childish. I don’t have a problem with you expressing how you feel but please take responsibility for your actions as well and don’t try to put off everything on me like I’m lower than you because that’s honestly how I feel like I’m not good enough to talk to you and you think you’re better than me.

When ppl bark at things that are none of there business IS creepy to me and that is what was childish!!! Calling Russ all those names and BOTh of you making up reasons with out FACTS! We were sick of all your rude comments and rude questions and you never learned!! Til this day you havent learned!! And i told you about keeping Kacy in line because this was our wedding and it only happens once in a lifetime!!! Do you understand that!? I didnt need any kids yelling or talking and being loud and it was nobodys job but urs to keep him at his best behavior that is all siad!! You thru around that “lol” and you still do that-and all i wanted you to know is that i was serious!!! You treated it as a joke!!! I have every right to treat our wedding high and mighty!! And i have every right to want to take pride in my life how i live it how i feel look and everything in between! You tried to tell me you were going to get a tux from a thrift shop for Jess!?!?!?!?!!? wtf!!!!!!!!!!! And that is when YOU and Jess decided not to have Kacey in the wedding!! i had bought the ring bearer pillow all ready so do not tell me i took him out!! Do think we wanted to waste money on that if we were going to “kick him out”??? i would not do that to Russ and Russ would never agree to that!!!!!!! Michelle, you need to grow up and quick saying comments about ppl….talk about childish! Its not our fault you were bored at the wedding or had issues that it was on kaceys bday!! Get over it- he’ll have many more. And dont assume reasonings on why we do ANYTHING!!!!!!! I cannot stress enough how many dates were thrown out and could not work for us! How dare you try and tell us when we should have our wedding!!! We buy Kacey great presents, Russ pays the best attention to him and you treat us like shit!!!! YOU ARE unappreciative!!! Russs visits and you guys NEVER DO!!! So dont tell me or have ur friends say ANYTHING ABOUT RUSS!!!!!!!! And sorry you are insecure about how i feel about you- again it is all ASSUMPTIONS! Thats ur problem if you think that! I will be honest- we live different lives and believe differently on things–but i just want you to know-dont ever lie about me or talk behind my back. Ur insecurities are not my fault and you have no right to bash our wedding day and act like you gave so much time or dished out soooooo much money and then ur friends make comments about the date and money and shit like that! You all need to grow up! You knew over a year and could have put $5 a week away to save! You couldn’t even stay a weekend for Russ when he is constantly visiting! WHY in the hell did Tab say Russ MADE you be anywhere! He was the one to suggest the park and zoo!!! LIES! Do not call him names or spread any lies about us again! Jess and Russ will always love eachother but i am not putting up with yours or your friends ignorant words! we’ve said our peace- i dont want to talk about it again! 
Russ didn’t suggest shit about the fucking zoo. I came up with that all by myself and Russ was the one that wanted us to sit at a rehersal that we didn’t need to be at and when Kacey said something about going to the zoo all Russ said was oh next time. I didn’t assume shit your actions say it all. As for the wedding date I didn’t have a problem with it that was my friend that made the comment about it so there you go assuming shit. As for the money situation I’m sorry we aren’t as well off as you and Russ are. We struggle with our bills and making the trip whether we put money aside a year or 5 wouldn’t have made a difference. Yea I suggested that Jess get his tux from a thrift store because they are cheaper and having worked at one I know they don’t sell suits or any clothes for that matter that are nasty. So what’s wrong with getting one from a thrift store? I didn’t say shit about your wedding day so don’t go around putting words in my mouth that I didn’t say. I didn’t talk behind your back I said the shit to you. I didn’t say anything about dishing out So much money for your wedding or anything like that. As for Russ wanting us to stay the extra day was he going to pay for it? YEA RIGHT!!!!! When does he come to visit so often? He visits maybe 2 or 3 times a year and we never said anything about how often he visited. We understand that you guys are busy and don’t have time to come visit us and we would love to come visit more but we don’t have the time just like you guys don’t and we don’t have all this extra money to be throwing around to get to do that kind of stuff. Shit we have NEVER even got to go on vacation anywhere. As for the rude ass comment about me watching Kacey I know how to take care of my son and don’t appreciate someone who doesn’t even have kids to comment about it. Just because he spent like 3 or 4 days at your house doesn’t mean you know how he behaves on a regular basis. Me and Jess NEVER said a thing about Kacey not being in the wedding so don’t try to make that sound like it was our fault. You can be ignorant and rude to me and think I’m just gonna be cool with it. I DON’T THINK SO. Don’t act like you are innocent because you’re not. So I think we both have a LOT of growing up to do and should just leave it at that. 
****** ADDED PART******J:Are you kidding me?!?!? Russ should have paid for your room??? REALLY?? Wow, I guess they were right when your friends ranted on last month– you DO look for “handouts” and expect a lot! As for rehearsal– DID YOU NOT SEE ALL THE PPL THAT WERE THERE WHO WERE NOT IN THE WEDDING AS WELL? THATS what you do!! Sigfnifacant others and their kids are invited to rehersal and dinner as well! YOU GOT A FREE MEAL YOU UNGRATEFUL LITTLE BRAT! You need to do some self reflection with the whole “expecting” things thing! And saving $5 a week times 52 weeks is $260 – that would have paid for hotel for 2 nights and part of the tux! Math- its a good concept! So dont tell me it wouldnt have helped! Even every 2 weeks would have given you that much more extra money for whatever! As for me and Russ being well off or better off- noooo not at all- we jsut budget and save, thats a good concept as well- try it. We dont have bowling and pizza parties!! As for raising children– You do not have to be a parent to know what a child needs or how to raise children. I have neices, nephews and I was a lead child care teacher for 8 yrs for 3 yr olds–i think i know a weeeeee little bit about what a child needs. That was the most ignorant comment you GOON!!!. Many people b4 they have children decided how they want to rear them and dicipline etc…or what kind of parent they will be. I cant believe those dumb statements. Your comment: “When does he come to visit so often? He visits maybe 2 or 3 times a year and we never said anything about how often he visited.” IF, and thats a big IF- Russ only came 2-3 times ayear- you act like that is not good enough!! You sound belittling when you say that!! He tries to be there for him being this far away and you shit on it!?!?! Kacey loves his uncle and Russ loves him and that time they spend with one another means a lot to both! And you seem like its not important for both of them! Thats flat out wrong wehn you say “only 2-3 times”. I cant believe you! Everything you said in this last message sounded so damn ungrateful like its not enough! On the eve of his wedding day- Russ went to get presents for Kacey to make him feel special but you disregard that! Do you know how stressed we both were but he still cared enough! You just shit on everythin it seems and that is NOT a quality I hold in high regard! So- i am removing you from FB so we dont run into these problems again. Russ and Jess will always have a relationship, bond and love and we will always want to be a part of Kaceys life. I will be cordial with you of course but lets face it- FB friends is not for us. 
M:ok you talked before about ASSUMING things what do you think you’re doing right now. I’m not a brat I’m grateful for every thing I get because I know people don’t owe me shit or have to get me anything. The comment about the rehersal dinner and me getting a free meal I was more than fine with going out to eat with C.J. and PAYING for my meal so don’t you dare try to say I was looking for a free meal. Jess agreed about Russ only coming 2-3 times a year and I didn’t say anything bad about it considering the rest of the family doesn’t even bother to come when they live closer than Russ does. I appreciate Russ coming to see Kacey especially having to drive 3 hours to do it. So don’t go saying I’m not grateful about that. As for the saving we do try to save and budget but it’s kinda hard when you barely have enough to pay the bills. You guys are fortunate that Russ works for Pepsi making some very good money but not all of us are that fortunate and have to do with what we can get.As I said before we live paycheck to paycheck and try our hardest to stay caught up on our bills by the time we pay them our checks are gone. Since you guys are such experts in the budgeting department why don’t you come help us since you seem to think we are so stupid we don’t know how to do it. Did I say anything bad about Russ getting Kacey a present? NO I DID NOT. As for that friends issue they thought that everyone had to bring money and if they couldn’t then they couldn’t have any pizza. All my friends chipped in to get the pizza and it wasn’t just them and we already worked that out. I don’t expect hand outs from anyone. So you can think what you want of me you’re entitled to your opinion and I hope we get over this whole stupid deal and move on. I apologize again for any wrong doing I did and take responsibilty for my words and my assumptions and I’m sorry. That’s all I can say. Hopefully one day we can become friends but if not that is ok too. 
***********************************************************************That crap pissed me off you don’t call my friends creepy. She’s lucky I didn’t cuss her ass out. Do you know how badly I want to? I swear if her response is something rude I will do it and at this point I don’t give a shit if I piss her or Russ off. I’m done trying to be civil and nice and my friend T for Tab was trying to be nice to the bitch too until she had to say Tab wasn’t worth it. She’s just pissed off that someone called out her pussy husband who can’t even stand up for himself. She’s sitting there calling me rude when I was trying to be the adult and not keep it going. Who’s rude now? I’m so about to just say fuck it and let my thoughts really come out. As for my friend Tab I appreciate every single thing you said about me and know you always have my back especially against dumb bitches who think they are better than everyone else. 
****ADDED PART**********
Ok does anyone else think I’m ungrateful? It boils down to two people who think that they are better than everyone else and when someone doesn’t agree with them they throw tantrums like little kids. I tried to stop the whole thing but I’m not the type of person who lets someone say shit about me that is nowhere near true. I do find the first sentence about Russ paying for the hotel room hilarious because obviously she isn’t as smart as she thinks she is or she would know I was being sarcastic about it DUH lol. Even if you have been a teacher doesn’t mean you are a expert in kids (NO OFFENSE TO ANYONE THAT HAS BEEN A TEACHER)and just because you have nephews and nieces doesn’t mean shit either. I had a nephew before I had Kacey too and I wouldn’t say I’m a expert. So at this point I want nothing to do with cunt girl and her pussy husband. I hope they live a great stuck up life together and everything crashes down and they can maybe see what it’s like to live like everyone else does. I’m actually shocked that Russ has been able to keep his job with Pepsi this long. He had a great job working for Nestle and he didn’t keep that one that long. Like I said it’s not worth arguing back and forth but I’m also not gonna let some cunt preppy bitch talk down to me.

So the day was going good and bridezilla had left me alone for most of the day until she messaged me about a picture that Tab commented on. 
J:So what did that pic say? . 
 M: nothing to worry about . I deleted it. . 
 J:Grow up- and tell tab to as well. take the pics of us down! All of them. . 
 J:i know what the damn thing said- im not stupid. Take them off please. No need to have them up. . 
 M: i did and that is why I said nothing to worry about so I don’t need to do any growing up if u supposedly “unfriended” me then why do you care what i put on my page. What did it say? . 
 J:
cuz you are a childish and have no backbone and have to say things behind my back. U are so fake and pathetic. Obviously you and ur friends have no life but to try and make urselves feel better by putting us down….not working! I just like to be heard and i have proven many points and you confirmed everyone of them–you creepers!!!:) By the way- i blocked you- not sure how you slipped thru the cracks. When you make a comment on a pic that i am in it does come back to me- you were caught!! I laugh in ur face Michelle with ur ridulous comments. So sad, so very very sad:) . 
 M: hmm goes to show what a stuck up bitch you really are then doesn’t it. I’m not childish and I definitely have a backbone and nothing was said behind your back because everything that was said was said to you and how am I fake? I never acted like I was your friend and therefore can’t be fake if we were never really friends. Hmm what points have you proven? hmm that you can’t let shit go and started all this shit just because of me saying one little thing about your wedding. OMG WHO THE FUCK IS THE CHILDISH ONE. Then you’re going around LYING trying to say that you didn’t kick my son out of your wedding and how the zoo was Russ’s idea. Trying to call me ungrateful. COME THE FUCK ON AT LEAST I WAS HONEST ENOUGH TO ADMIT WHAT I SAID AND THE WRONG I DID BUT MRS HIGH AND MIGHTY CAN’T ADMIT HER WRONG DOING. GET YOUR FUCKING HEAD OUT OF YOUR ASS AND GROW UP YOURSELF. MY FRIEND IS NOT A CREEP AT LEAST SHE HAD THE GUTS TO TELL YOU WHAT SHE THINKS OF YOU AND YOUR PUSSY ASS HUSBAND. She didn’t assume anything about either of you and she doesn’t even know you that well. As for laughin in my face please get a tic tac at least first before you do. I’m done with you bye and leave me alone. 
This dumb bitch doesn’t know me and doesn’t know my friends so she has no business calling them names. The biggest parts that bug me about the whole thing is the part where she calls me ungrateful. Every one that knows me knows I’m not ungrateful. I’m thankful for every single thing that is done for me, said to me, or given to me and I try very hard to return the favor to others. Since the first moment I met her I was ok with her but always felt like she thought she was better than everyone. She’s supposed to be a christian too(no offense to any christians or other religion)but I thought christians were supposed to be kind to you and not treat you like you were a bug under their shoe. As for her comment about being childish I may be a bit but come on who is the childish one? If you’re gonna throw a tantrum about one little comment someone left you. She didn’t even bother to ask why I thought that and just started jumping down my throat about it. The whole tux thing was stupid all by itself. Who tells you please ask questions if you have any and when you do they start giving you smart ass answers and then say you’re rude just for asking. WTF are you serious? 
I think she has a few screws loose. As for Russ everyone knows he’s gonna turn gay soon. He hides behind his wife because he doesn’t have the guts to say it to the person’s face. I’m so angry and have to vent. I’m sorry if I’m repeating myself it just drives me nuts when people say things that aren’t true about me. Like I said in the one message I was just fine with going out with my BIL C.J. to eat and PAY for my meal I didn’t even really want to go to the rehersal dinner because I didn’t feel like they wanted me there anyway to be perfectly honest. Yea me and Jess aren’t great with our money but if you would have known us like 5 years ago compared to now we have made HUGE improvements. We honestly didn’t have the money to even go to the wedding but Jess knew how much it meant to Russ so he was nice and we went. I should have went with my original plan and not gone at all or declined going on the bus and all that and hung out with C.J. Then I would  have been not too close to them and not have to put up with that crap. 
So when Russ does decide to visit I’ll make sure to find something to go do with someone or go to school early or something. Don’t want to deal with him or his stuck up bitch. They both think they are better than everyone else and it drives me nuts. So what your ass got lucky and got a good job and you and your bridezilla can afford to go on vacations and to bears/packers game because your daddy gives you extra money. Not all of us are that fortunate most of us have to struggle to get by. Shit me and Jess have NEVER got to go on vacation anywhere in our lives. It just makes me mad. I think I have gotten it out of my system.

171,https://www.opendiary.com/m/torturedsoul_1/lil-michelle-5150205/,2010-08-25,Lil Michelle,"
Well haven’t heard from bridezilla YAY. Thank god that dumb shit is done and over with. I can’t stand people who act like they are better than everyone and who won’t admit when they are wrong. Nobody is perfect and shouldn’t be belittling other people. On to other BETTER news Lil Michelle was supposed to leave today to go to Chicago to start her physical rehab but a guy that was supposed to be discharged didn’t so she might not be going until Friday. That girl does something to amaze us every day. The other day me and Jess went to visit her and they had her in a special recliner type chair where they could strap her in so she wouldn’t fall out. So Jess was asking her questions and then saying blink once for yes and twice for no. So Jess asked her do you want us to wait til you get out of her to do our wedding or should we elope and I shit you not she blinked twice. 
She has been doing a awesome job of moving her eyes. Today when me and my mom came to visit she kept licking her lips like they were dry so her mom put on some chocolate flavored lip balm she moved her lips to coat them which was awesome because there is no way that was a reflex like the nurse was trying to say. She kept licking her lips to taste the lip gloss lol. So she has been doing some major progress. They ended up finding out that the arm that she wouldn’t move that much was broken so now it’s in a somewhat cast. Can’t wait to see her once she is in rehab for a while. 
Other than that today was Kacey’s first day of school and he did really well with it. I’m definitely enjoying my week off of school. The only thing that sucked was we were supposed to all get together to go to my friend Melissa’s house in South Beloit for a movie night but it ended up just being me and another girl going so Melissa cancelled it. Oh well hopefully we will all be able to get together soon. The only other exciting thing going on is Tab is coming up next week for Waterfront. I can’t wait for that and I plan to go see Lil one either on Saturday or Sunday haven’t decided when yet.

172,https://www.opendiary.com/m/torturedsoul_1/the-guy-that-hit-lil-michelle-5150206/,2010-08-25,the guy that hit lil Michelle,"
Well the guy that hit my friend Lil Michelle has quite a lot of charges against him. Here they are:
seat belt required/driver
failure to obey stop sign
driving under the influence of alcohol his BAC was .238 3X the legal limit
2 counts of aggravated DUI/accident/bodily harm
His bond was at 500,000 with 10% now the loser was able to get it down to 20,000 I believe it was with 20%. I was reading his other charges if they are all the same person and it looks like he got in trouble with the law related to traffic offenses before too.
I hope he actually gets jail time this time and not get off so damn easy. There were some dumb offense too like driving on the sidewalk, squealing tires, neglient driving.

173,https://www.opendiary.com/m/torturedsoul_1/chicago-omg-5150207/,2010-08-29,Chicago OMG,"
Well I went to Chicago today to go see my friend Lil Michelle. The facility she is in is nice but the parking sucks. We had to drive around 5 times to just find a spot and then went to the meter to pay and it had to be change so I had to go into the building to find someone to give me change and then had to go back outside and do the meter thing. So then we only got to stay for an hour because of the meter so that sucked. She did open her eyes while we were there. Then I think I lost my camera there. Talk about a bad trip. So if I do go back I’m gonna have someone else drive and won’t be able to take any pictures if I do go :(. I’ll have to wait until November when I get my school money to buy another one so I pray it’s somewhere in my car and I didn’t leave it in Chicago. 
So I’m not sure if I want to go back to Chicago again. I feel bad because I want to see Lil Michelle but it’s too much of a hassel to do unless like I said someone else drives then I don’t think it will be that stressful for me but I definitely don’t want to be the one driving.
So nothing else really exciting going on. Jess is trying to get his hours switched at work and is trying to work 5a-1p. That’s not too bad and he would be able to hang out with us except he would have to go to bed really early and I would have to be the one to take Kacey to school in the mornings. So waiting to see about that one and not looking forward to getting up super early to take Kacey to school especially on days where I have to go to work. 
Also tomorrow night start school again so that should be interesting. Well I guess that’s it for now.

174,https://www.opendiary.com/m/torturedsoul_1/kickoff-carnval-yay-5150208/,2010-09-01,kickoff carnval YAY,"
Well let’s see Tab is in town for the kick off carnival which is technically later on today. I actually found my camera THANK GOD. Lil Michelle’s mom called me with a update. She brushed her own hair, is getting better at swallowing, she can turn channels with a remote and it appears as if she can read something called communication flashcards so that is awesome to hear. 
The only thing I’m worried about is her mom was talking about putting her in a nursing home which I don’t think is the correct thing to do. I could see maybe for the first few weeks but I think she would benefit from having a place that works with her in her home so for one she would be more comfortable being at home. She has 2 dogs and 2 cats and I think they would help her in her recovery. I told her mom I would help take care of her and her mom could do it and then find someone else that is trustworthy to help her out because she is supposed to have 24 hour care. So hopefully I can talk her mom into that choice because I honestly think it’s a hell of a lot better than a nursing home. Too many people taking advantage of others in different ways. 
    
"
175,https://www.opendiary.com/m/torturedsoul_1/my-weekend-959-5150209/,2010-09-05,My weekend,"
Well let’s see Thursday was the kick off carnival went pretty well except poor Tab puked on one of the rides. I don’t think the guy that was running the ride was too thrilled but at least Tab was able to somewhat contain hers unlike the girl that had gotten sick on the previous run and ended up with puke pretty much everywhere. All over her and the car they were in. We got a lot of rides in before it decided to start pouring down rain. 
Then we went to Tom and Jerry’s for dinner. Saturday was my lazy day. Sunday me and Tab journeyed to Chicago to go see Lil Michelle. We got there ok it was the return trip that got a little bit interesting. Lil Michelle is getting better. She actually spoke a few words when she did her speech therapy earlier in the day, she got her trach out so when she coughs you can hear her voice. She had to have eyedrops put in to help moisturize her eyes and one of her eyes started watering in the corner so I got a kleenex which she took from me and wiped her own eye with. That is just awesome. I hope she keeps progressing and that she will be able to stay in her own home without having to be put in a nursing home. 
So now my great weekend is over and it’s back to the normal boring week. School and work and a annoying child who drives me crazy. I love him very much but he drives me insane sometimes. Jess is hopefully getting his hours changed and he will be able to spend more time at home. 
    
"
176,https://www.opendiary.com/m/torturedsoul_1/dcfs-2-5150210/,2010-09-09,DCFS,"
So I come home from depositing my pay check and letting Lil Michelle’s dogs out to find DCFS at my door. About a few weeks ago I had gotten really angry at Kacey and he has wooden train tracks and wooden train cars which were in a plastic container so I took the tracks and cars and threw them over my shoulders and ended up accidentally hitting Kacey in the forehead with one of the tracks. Well his teacher or someone at school had asked him where he got the bruise on his forehead so he told them that I threw a train track at him but he didn’t add the accidentally part so now they are investigating me for abuse. 
I had to go take Kacey to get a physical exam at the immediate care place. The doctor asked him what happened and he told her about me throwing the train tracks and hitting him with one of them. I told her it was accidental and I wasn’t aiming for him I was just throwing them over my shoulder in anger. So now the investigators are coming back Monday to look over our apartment again. So I have to clean the house top to bottom and make it look great. I got a lot of work to do.
I have to take the lock off his bedroom door and one of our doors, I have to put the cleaners in the bathroom because I can lock that cabinet, I have to talk to our landlord about getting new smoke detectors and a new carbon monoxide detector and make sure everything else is put away and looking nice pretty much. I had just taken winter clothes out of our attic and washed them and am in the process of putting them away I guess I have to move a little bit quicker. I also have to straighten up a closet that has a lot of stuff in it. So hopefully everything goes well and I don’t get in trouble or get Kacey taken out of the house. I’m definitely keeping my fingers crossed. 
Other than that not much excitement going on. The same boring stuff. School and work.

177,https://www.opendiary.com/m/torturedsoul_1/lil-michelle-visitpic-added-5150211/,2010-09-12,Lil Michelle visit**PIC ADDED**,"
So yesterday I went to go vist Lil Michelle in Chicago. She is ROCKING it. We walked in and she was sitting in her wheelchair. She looked so much better than she has been and much more active as well. She was laughing at my jokes and was able to nod her head yes and no. She was having a tongue sticking out contest with Kacey and we went outside for a hour and on our way to outside Michelle reached out her hand for Kacey to hold it. 
Then when we were outside Jess called me to make sure we got to Chicago ok and Michelle said hi jess to him and then I put the phone up to her and she asked him how her boys were doing. Her boys are her 2 cats and 2 dogs. So overall she is doing excellent. The day before we came to visit her mom called to tell me that she was stood up by herself with the help of her physical therapist on parallel bars and was doing a good job sitting down and standing up and she was moving her legs and feet yesterday when we went. The only thing she has to work on is her talking and being able to use her voice more and her swallowing so she can actually get solid food. Right now all she can have is ice with a lil bit of juice. She has to pass the swallow test in order to be oked to eat solid food. So she is doing SO much better and her mom did mention something about her moving in with her and her husband so maybe they won’t be putting her in a nursing home I sure hope they aren’t gonna do that. I think she would do so much better if she was either in her home or at her mom’s house. 
The DCFS lady came back today to do her follow up visit and I think it went pretty well. So now have to wait to hear back from them. 

Here is a pic I took of Lil Michelle holding my son Kacey’s hand. Sorry it took me so long to post it. 
    
"
178,https://www.opendiary.com/m/torturedsoul_1/shes-rocking-it-lol-5150212/,2010-09-18,She’s Rocking it lol,"
Well me and Jess went to visit Lil Michelle today. She is doing awesome. She got the cast off her arm but I think there is more damage to it and her mom said they were thinking of doing surgery on it. She has both feet in casts in the hope that they will help straighten her feet so she can start to walk. She is doing awesome on her swallowing but has to wait until Wednesday for her swallow test. Basically they are going to take a x-ray to see where the substance is going because obviously they don’t want it going into her lungs because of pneumonia so hopefully she passes that because she was doing a really good job today with her speech therapist. We got to see what kind of stuff the therapist has her do. First the therapist was working with her on her swallowing then she was showing Michelle pictures and asking her to tell her who is in the pictures, then they went back to more swallowing, and then did flashcards, and then more swallowing and sorting playing cards into the different suites. She was doing really good and she is speaking more even though it’s only a whisper sometimes but most of the time she does a good job and you are able to tell what she is saying. Her stay got extended til October 6th because she is doing so well. 
It sounds like her mom is thinking of doing a nursing home thing but hopefully I can try to get her to get more info on RAMP and get her some help through there so she can go back to her own house. I know she said that she misses food which I don’t blame her and the next sentence was Mcdonalds lol. I brought my laptop with today so she got to talk to her friend Amanda on facebook even though I had to help her. They think she might have something wrong with one of her eyes because when she was using the computer she had to close her right eye to see out of her left so hopefully they are going to get that checked soon. Me and Jess were wheeling her around her floor she really liked that because the nurses said that’s the first time in a few days she’s smiled and been laughing. Her mom came back to Rockford to take care of some public aid stuff so that might be why she was so down. The only bad thing was she was sliding down in her wheelchair and we couldn’t figure out how to tilt her chair back so we could help pull her up so we went down the hall to have them help pull her up in the chair. So every time we go she seems to be doing a lil bit better. Hopefully the next time we come she will be able to have something to eat besides the milk shake looking stuff they got her on. 
I haven’t heard anything from DCFS yet. I’m not sure if that’s a good thing or a bad thing. School is going pretty good.

Well let’s see where do I begin. Last Thursday night my mom decided to not watch Kacey anymore. She made the comment that she wasn’t going to watch him until I got him some “help.” Well in my town there are only 2 places I know of and both weren’t much help so I have no clue where else to go to get him some help. Maybe I will try to do some research on the net after I get done writing this. So the weekend was REAL exciting. Tab came up this past weekend and me, her and a girl named Tiffany that used to work at Goodwill with us went to Tab’s friend Margaret’s bon fire but it wasn’t that big of a fire on Friday night. Jess had to stay home and watch Kacey. Then Saturday night me, Tab, Jess,Kacey and a few other people went to Tab’s friend Margaret’s weenie roast. That was pretty cool. Then Sunday me, Jess, Kacey and Amanda went to Chicago to see Lil Michelle. Amanda was the girl that was in the car accident with Lil Michelle. They both work at wal-mart together. I have to add some photos and video from the visit. Michelle is doing so well. 
It’s incredible how much has come back to her. She still has some work to do but is coming along really well. She has to work on her walking. She had 2 casts on her legs to help get her feet to straighten because they were like ballerina toes. She got the casts off yesterday. She also had to do a swallow test but didn’t pass that. The food or liquid is not going where it is supposed to be going which is no fault of Michelle’s. The poor girl misses food so much. She told me before about that and that she wanted McDonald’s. This week she said she wants a cheeseburger from McDonald’s lol. She talks very well but still has to kinda whisper because she said her throat still is bothering her which might be connected to the swallowing issues. She also has some problems with one of her eyes and she was supposed to get glasses yesterday. I texted her some funny friend message someone sent me and she replied with tanks lol. So then I asked her about the glasses and she said she wasn’t going to be getting them until like 2 weeks. So she was doing pretty good chatting with me even though she couldn’t see. She was commenting about how she missed her boys meaning her 2 dogs and 2 cats and how she wished she was at home. I told her she has to work on the walking and other stuff and she’ll be home before she knows it. 
So other than that not much really going on. I found out today I got bronchitis and a sinus infection so I got antibotics I’m gonna start taking tomorrow. Also this week is mid-terms. The ones for my small animal classes sucked. I don’t think I did good on either one of them. Tomorrow I have to take my mid-term for my animal hospital principles 2 class. That has a written part and a lab part. I’m not too worried about the written part but the lab part worries me. We have to do a few different types of restraints on both cats and dogs. We have to take a temp, take a heart rate, take a respiratory rate. So yea a lot of stuff to go over tomorrow before class and I have to work too. 
Other than that haven’t heard anything from DCFS after their updated visit so I think that’s a good thing. Other than that not much else going on.

180,https://www.opendiary.com/m/torturedsoul_1/what-to-talk-about-5-5150214/,2010-10-09,what to talk about?,"
Well let’s see what do I got to talk about today? My friend Lil Michelle is hopefully coming home from Chicago on the 13th. She has a hospital bed at her house now and I found out that she is able to have some solid food but they still give her the milk shake like stuff for now so that is awesome news. She has her casts off and is working on walking. She was getting a brace for her arm today when we were there visiting so hopefully they can figure out what happened to it because she said it feels numb in her fingers. 
But other than that she is doing awesome. She is doing a good job of talking and she is able to text people. She has to wear glasses because she kept seeing double of things. So we will have to see if she gets out on Wednesday. I might be going up to Chicago to pick her and her mom up but her mom isn’t sure what is going on right now because her stepdad is having some mental issues and said he was done with everything so it’s basically a wait and see situation. 
School is going pretty well. I found out though that if we took all our gen eds that when we did our externship we would have to pay for it ourselves which there is no way I can do so I might not be completing vet tech. I might be done after this quarter anyway because one of my friends was able to get her large animal class we have to retake covered by financial aid but when I talked to our program director she said it’s different for everyone so now I have to get a hold of financial aid and see about it. Me and my friend Ginny were talking about starting our own business of some kind that relates to animals. She was talking about pet sitting but I’m not sure about that. 
Other than that health wise I still have this damn bronchitis which is driving me crazy and lately I have been getting headaches so I’m gonna schedule a appointment on Tuesday to get that checked out. Other than that not much else to really write about. My mom started talking to me but I still don’t ask her to watch Kacey which sucks because it would be nice to have time away. I might not be able to go to work on Monday depending on when Jess is working. So yea that’s my exciting life lately .

181,https://www.opendiary.com/m/torturedsoul_1/lil-michelle-is-home-5150215/,2010-10-13,Lil Michelle is HOME,"
My friend Lil Michelle got home tomorrow. She is so happy to be home. I don’t blame her one bit. She didn’t like being in Chicago or at least not for the reason she was there. She told me she doesn’t remember the accident and only what happened before it and then she doesn’t remember anything until September 22nd when she was in Chicago in rehab. She doesn’t remember being in the hospital here in town. She told me she’s worried about where she stands with her friends but I told her not to worry about it too much. She knows who her real friends are. I think she is FINALLY done with this girl named Amber. I’m not sure if I talked about Amber or not so I’ll do a quick run down of why I don’t care for her. When Michelle was married her and her husband were friends with a couple named Brian and Jewel. Well her now ex husband decided to cheat with the Jewel chick so Michelle got together with Brian. Brian’s niece is Amber. So Michelle would hang out with them and she told me before the accident that Amber would ask Michelle to take her places or Brian would ask Michelle to take him places so to me it made them seem like users. I didn’t like Amber for other reasons. One of my friends from school named Melissa actually worked with Amber at her job and I went to school with Amber but different program so I didn’t have to see her too much. Well Amber lost her job because she kept doing no calls/no shows and dropped out of school because she decided to not show up for her externship. 
So Michelle told Amber not to tell her ex husband anything about her progress or anything at all but Amber turned around and told her ex husband info about her and her ex husband tried to call Michelle to which Michelle’s mom answered and hung up on him. So hopefully that is the case. Michelle’s mom said she has to have a “babysitter” for a while because she fell out of her chair when she got left alone yesterday. Michelle said she basically slid out of her chair because it didn’t have footrest on it. So she’s doing pretty good. I was finally able to upload a video of Michelle from when she was in Chicago. 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Trd-LBCMIc
You will have to copy and paste it into the browser to see it though sorry. 
I also have some pictures from when Michelle was in Chicago but I have to upload them to photobucket first.

Well I don’t have a whole heck of a lot to write about or at least nothing of excitement. I did need a bit of advice on something. Everyone by now knows about my friend Lil Shell and her being home. We were going to have a halloween party that was originally going to be at my house but I was thinking of having it at Lil Shell’s house for the simple fact she can’t exactly go up stairs yet because she is still in a wheelchair and her house is all one level. So her mom mentioned something the other day about how you have to be careful with her being overstimulated because then she becomes agitated. I haven’t seen any of that when I come to visit except when we were trying to figure out how to get her VCR to work so Kacey could watch a movie to leave us alone lol and we couldn’t figure it out so she started swearing at it but hell I do that too. So now I’m worried because we usually play games at my parties and I know she can play UNO but not sure if her mind would be up to playing any other games and I don’t want her to feel left out or anything so do I just have the party at my house and plan something else with her like watching scary movies with a few friends at her house later or have the party at her house and hope it’s not too much for her. I’m gonna text her tomorrow and talk to her about it and see if she’s ready to be around a lot of people. When we went to visit her in Chicago there was one time there was like 3 of us there visiting her and she did really well so I don’t know. I just don’t want her to feel pushed into it and it be too quick for her. 
Other than that not much else of excitement going on. Tab is coming next week which is awesome. It seems like I will have a fun packed weekend. Friday I have my party, Saturday going to possibly see paranormal activity 2 and go to a girl from school’s party and then Sunday is halloween. For my costume seeing as I can’t really fit into anything that doesn’t make me look like a slut I decided to kinda make my own costume. I’m trying to find a goth like dress that isn’t too short, long black boots that are goth like, arm warmers that are either fishnet type or just black or maybe black and red if possible and black lipstick and wings. I’m going as like a goth angel or I should say HOPEFULLY. If not I have no clue what to be because i’m too fat to fit into anything else to be honest. So that’s it for now.

The following are tips for any character in a horror film. If you do happen to find yourself in a horror film someday, use these tips wisely and you may make it out alive. Until the sequel that is… 
Survival Tips:
When it seems that you’ve killed the monster, never check to see if it’s really dead. 
If you find that your house is built upon or near a cemetery, was once a church used for black masses, had previous inhabitants who went mad or committed suicide or died in some horrible fashion or who performed necrophilia or satanic practices, move away immediately. 
Never read a book of demon summoning aloud, even as a joke. 
Do not search the basement, especially when the power has just gone out. 
If your children speak to you in Latin or any other language which they do not know, or if they speak using a voice other than their own, shoot them at once. It will save you a lot of grief in the long run. Note: it’s unlikely they’ll die easy, so be prepared. 
When you have the benefit of numbers, never pair off or go off alone. 
If the gang plans a fun midnight party in the town’s old abandoned mansion, don’t tag along. Especially don’t tag along if everyone’s going as couples, except you’re the odd guy/gal out. And if you’re the gang’s jokester, you may as well write up your last will and testament while you’re driving with them to the place. 
As a general rule, don’t solve puzzles that open portals to Hell. 
Never stand in, on, above, below, beside, or anywhere near a grave, tomb, crypt, mausoleum, or other domicile of the dead. 
If you’re searching for something which caused a noise and find out that it’s just the cat, leave the room immediately if you value your life. 
If appliances start operating by themselves, move out. 
Do not take (or borrow) anything from the dead. 
Don’t fool with recombinant DNA technology unless you’re sure you know what you are doing. 
If you’re running from the monster, expect to trip or f all down at least twice, more if you are female. Also note that, although you are running and the monster is merely shambling along, it’s still moving fast enough to catch up with you. 
If your companions suddenly begin to exhibit uncharacteristic behavior such as hissing, fascination for blood, glowing eyes, increasing hairiness, and so on, get away from them as fast as possible. 
Stay away from certain geographical locations, some of which are listed here: Amityville, Elm Street, Transylvania, Nilbog (God help you if you recognize this one), the Bermuda Triangle, or any small town in Maine or Massachusetts. 
If your car runs out of gas at night, do not go to the nearby deserted-looking house to phone for help. 
Beware of strangers bearing tools such as chain saws, staple guns, hedge trimmers, electric carving knives, combines, lawnmowers, butane torches, soldering irons, band saws, weed-whackers or any device made from deceased companions. 
Listen closely to the soundtrack; and pay attention to the audience, since they are usually far more intelligent than you could ever hope to be. 
Never, never, NEVER try to communicate with something icky because “there’s so much we can learn from them”. 
Don’t make fun of or play with dead things. 
If you find a town which looks deserted, it’s probably for a reason. Take the hint and stay away. 
If a meteor strikes nearby, move out of town. 
When something bad is chasing you, bear in mind that when you try to start your car, no matter how reliable the vehicle is normally, you’ll have to crank the engine over many times before it will fire up. 
If you walk into the local abandoned-looking church to seek help or shelter, and you notice that the crucifix is mounted upside down, turn around and go back outside as quietly as possible. 
When you happen to be one of the fortunate ones and actually make it through the film alive, never, NEVER sign on to do a sequel. If you do, expect to depart this world in the first five minutes. 
Strange lights are seldom harbingers of joy. 
People arriving to rescue you generally get ambushed by the monster, so don’t rely on them as your only means of escape. In fact, expect to be surprised and delayed by encountering their flayed corpse at some point. 
On no account do ANYTHING because someone dares you to. 
If you realize that the people in your town/county are having their minds taken over by some strange force, alien or otherwise: DO NOT call the police as they are 
either already taken over themselves and will turn you in or 
will not believe you and laugh at you. 
Either way, you must handle the problem yourself. 
If a small band of children appear to be smarter then the adults that are around them, be cautious. If they stay together in a small, secretive group, and display nothing but hostility towards their elders, authority, and the church, leave town at once. If you wish to stay, be as kind to the children as possible, but expect to die anyways because you are inferior to them. 
If you assist the villian of the film, do not expect gratitude in exchange for your services. In fact, do not expect anything other than death, which will come in the final minutes of the film and usually over the girl you have become attracted to, but the villian wants as this own. 
If any animals, such as Birds, Pirahna, Spiders, etc. begin to exhibit behavior that seems a bit more hostile towards mankind than normal, immediately call in the authorities, get out of that town, and do not try to talk to any scientist who specializes in that animal (ornithologists and the like) for they will not believe you. 
Whatever you do, DO NOT keep pets such as cats, dogs, hamsters, or anything cuddly. If you must, do not let them out of your sight for so much as a second. 
When you land on a distant planet and find some objects that look like eggs, leave them alone. 
When one of your spaceship’s crew finds a hideous parasite attached to his body (as a result of disobeying the previous rule), don’t let him back on the ship. The guy’s dogmeat anyway. 
When a hideous alien menace is hunting you (as a result of disobeying the previous two rules) never wander off alone to hunt for the ship’s cat. 
Never, EVER go in/out there (There being the attic, closet, barn, basement, dark alley, dark anywhere else, the all-concealing shadows, the woods or the lake) 
If someone who seems important tells you to do or NOT do something (like DON’T fall asleep, DON’T leave me, DON’T look for the homicidal-chainsaw-wielding- psychopath by yourself) by all means, listen to them, unless doing so would break another of the guidelines. 
If you manage to lose a few body parts along the way, don’t despair. Take this opportunity to replace them with weapons, such as chainsaws, harpoons, etc. 
If you are using a gun to combat the all-comsuming evil, it is a good idea to quickly find a new means of defense, because no matter how much ammo you have, you’ll run out just before you kill the monster. 
If you are wounded by flesh-eating zombies, aboandon all hope, because sooner or later, no matter how many anti-biotics you take, yer gonna become one of ’em. 
If you’re the the last main character left, and a bunch of people are hunting the monster/monsters DON’T stand out in the open, because you will immediately be mistaken for a/the monster. 
Don’t open the closed door, especially if you hear scratching, heavy breathing, or any other strange noises from the other side. 
DO NOT go into the dark room. 
If you’re a male, get out of there as fast as possible! The only one who ever survives is a female. 
While in a horror film, never bathe, especially when in the house alone. 
In terms of weaponry and general equipment for fighting the monster, never rely on any tool more complicated than a pointed stick. Generators will inexplicably run out of power, just as the nasty space-vegetable climbs onto your jury rigged electrical grid. Just when you’ve got the ghoul lined up in your sights, your gun will invariably jam. 
If you are a female, never show your breasts, easy women are expendable. 
Never camp or build homes on Indian burial grounds. 
Ask why the estate is being sold so cheap. 
If the phone lines are dead, and you hear footsteps upstairs, when you’re supposed to be alone, don’t follow the noises to see who your “guest” is . LEAVE IMMEDIATELY. Unless you want to die!! 
Never pick up the phone and call for help, chances are your phone will be dead and the next thing you’ll see is the monster swinging some sort of sharp object. 
If you have defeated the monster, pay close attention to the camera, if it pans away for no apparent reason at all, get the heck out of there. 
Your dog can take care of itself… 
So can your spouse… 
And your kids. 
Self-sacrifice is a bad idea, as the person you saved will usually die anyway. 
Skeptics are always proved wrong in some horrible, nasty, painful way. Be a believer. 
If you’re not a main character, suicide is a quicker and easier way out. 
Your plan takes into account all possible situations… except for the one that actually occurs. 
Don’t be a smart-ass. It’ll only get you killed. 
When you have actually gotten a monster down on the ground with your gun, immediately empty all your shots in the monsters’ head. 
Never be present immediately before, during, or anytime after a succesful demon/devil/monster summoning. 
People driven by veangance always die. 
Mentioning any goals in life, anything to look forward to, or any loved ones will get you killed. 
Never, under any circumstances, go to summer camp. 
Puzzle boxes are hard to solve for a reason. 
Feel no guilt. 
If you throw away some possession of yours (antique dolls and ventriloquist’s dummies in particular), and you find it again in your house/car/pockets/etc. move to another country IMMEDIATELY! Of course, it WILL be waiting for you in the car as you go to leave. 
If you try to run away, always take the bus. If you take a car the monster will be in it. Cabbies are always demonically possessed. Monsters will destroy any plane/boat you try to take. And you have to go through dark, underground stations to get on a subway. 
If you are a child, don’t panic! Monsters only attack overly horny teenagers. Children can NOT be killed in a movie, only possessed or absorbed. So cheer up! 
If you see a loved one you know to be dead, RUN AWAY! Many people will ignore this bit of common sense, but remember: you can always buy a new pet, always have more kids, and always get a new spouse or significant other. 
If you’re being chased by a monster and you think it’s behind you, chances are it will appear in front of you (and if you’re a girl, this will happen right after you trip and fall, and then stand up and look behind you). 
If you’ve beaten the monster into a bloody pulp and you’re sure he must be dead, take the opportunity to dismember, burn, eat, blow up or otherwise destroy him. 
If you’re being chased by a monster and you find one of your friends and they ask “what’s wrong?”, don’t stop and try to explain. Just tell them to run as you go by. If they’re really your friend they’ll follow. If not – that’s their tough luck. 
If you should easily enter a home that you’ve either heard a scream from or there is no sign of life when there should be, do not be surprised to find that all means of escape (i.e. doors, windows, etc.) will be locked, effectively allowing the monster to come within a gnat’s hair to you. 
If you should run across one of the escape routes from the previous rule that is made of glass, DO NOT waste time pounding on it. Breaking it would prove to be a better course of action. (Remember, a cut-up hand is better than a chest wound.) 
If you are a good dog you have a 50-50 chance of survival. Good dogs will only die if they stand up to the monster in defense of their master. Bite the hand that feeds you and run away! 
If you are a bad dog, you WILL be dead by the movie’s end. Therefore, kill all people you encounter, except for your ex-master, whom you feel strangely compelled to avoid. 
If you’re a cat, just hide your head and pray that the monsters won’t eat you, the Catholic Inquisitors won’t burn you as a witch’s familiar, and/or the horny teen-age guys don’t throw you over the edge of a cliff to see if you land on your feet. 
If you’re a bird, CONGRATULATIONS! Your people will triumph and rule all in the end (or you might at least escape your $%^& cage!). 
If you are even somewhat religious, BECOME AN ATHEIST IMMEDIATELY! Monsters will invariably seek you out, gloating in defiance of “your weak faith,” and say mean things about your deity. 
Whenever a strange weapon is presented (e.g. a harpoon gun, flare gun, can opener, etc.) TAKE IT! If you don’t, the monster will, and sooner or later the weapon WILL BE USED! Better you use it then the monster. 
If you find a lot of dead people running around making zombies out of the living, kill yourself IMMEDIATELY! There is no happiness to be found when you’re being eaten alive. 
A single monster can never be killed. Multiple monsters can never be driven to extinction. Therefore, try to get one kind to go after the other. 
When you fight a monster use fire, electricity or acid whenever possible. Prefferably use all of the above. And an atom bomb. 
ALL atomic weapons cause normal creatures to grow huge and carnivorous. As do all chemical and germ weapons. 
ALL genetic experiments will create humanoid mutants (whether or not human/primate DNA is used) with BIG teeth and claws, and a tough hide impervious to bullets. NEVER play god and try your hand at gene-splicing! 
Always make eye shots whenever possible as all mosters ignore chest/limb attacks. If you hit the eye the monster will be blinded for a while (maybe… and if you’re really lucky… and if the creature even has any eyes to shoot in the first place). 
If you look out the window and see a monster, chances are he’s coming after you some time or another. Go into seclusion very very far away. 
If you set the monster on fire, or he is set on fire, he will not die but instead try and fight you while he is on fire. 
If a dog, cat, or horse begins to behave in an erratic fashion in a particular person’s presence, avoid that person at all costs (even if it is your spouse or child). 
A small-town’s little summer celebration sounds like fun, but if you hear the locals say things like, “Why you’re the guest of honor! We couldn’t even *have* the barbecue without you!” run like hell. 
Remember: quaint rural corn ceremonies are NEVER really about corn… 
Stay away from ‘quaint’ hotels and inns. Go for the brand names. 
Turning around in general is a bad idea, as the monster is usually waiting right there for you. 
Never open strange cannisters, especially not if they’re government owned. 
Stimulating glands that were not meant to be stimulated is a REAL bad idea. 
Never meddle in God’s domain. 
Learn as early as possible that Man is a feeling creature, and therefore the greatest in the universe. 
If you catch snatches of the theme song, you know the bad thing is close by. 
If your car breaks down in the woods, take the time to walk the extra 5 miles into town. 
Make sure what you use to kill the nasty things is a poison, and not a stimulant of any kind. 
If you’re gonna go out, don’t do it quietly. Take out those annoying friends of yours with you. 
Don’t work the night shift. 
Never fool yourself into believing you’re powerful enough to contain anything you summoned. 
Under no circumstances remove any unusual item from glaciers or large blocks of ice (ie. flying saucers, Frankenstein’s monster, Dracula, the wolfman, etc…) 
If you do remove something unusual from the ice, do not let it thaw. (Specifically, do not throw an electric blanket over ice, do not bleed on ice, and do not let the freezer’s power go out.) 
If you do entomb a monster in ice (Godzilla, the blob, etc) make sure that the monster’s location is not well known. (Sightseers have an annoying habit of bringing electric blankets, bleeding on ice, or detonating A-Bombs.) 
Don’t explode A-Bombs in the Arctic, South Sea atolls, or deep beneath the ocean. These locations are thickly inhabited with survivors from the prehistoric past. (Not to mention the blob, giant octopi, etc.) 
Don’t explode A-Bombs in the desert, which are full of many insect species just waiting for their chance to mutate into gigantic forms. As a corollary, don’t store sugar or picnic foods anywhere near a desert which has been the site of an A-Bomb test. 
Don’t explode A-Bombs near men or women. They may grow to gigantic size and battle casino signs in Las Vegas. 
Don’t submerge yourself in a bathyscaphe and search for prehistoric monsters under the ocean. You may as well just drive a giant fish hook through your body and get someone to troll with you. 
Don’t visit backwoods regions of the United States, especially those regions filled with quaint people with colorful names like Leatherface or Pun’kinhead. 
Stay on the Interstate. 
If your parents killed a serial killer before you were born, chances are the serial killer will come back from the dead to kill you. 
If you are trapped in a house surrounded by demons, making coffee will not help anyone. 
If a maniac or monster or zombie is trying to get into your house, don’t decide to try and find your lost cat or dog. Give it up, Fido and Fluffy are on their own. 
Any military containers that accidentally get mailed to you should be sent right back. And never, ever hit a container to test how strong it is. 
Whenever someone warn’s you not to go up, down, under or over there, whatever you do, don’t go! (They are only trying to save you from a most certain and Horrible death) 
Do not, under *any* circumstances, ever go skinny dipping, especially at night. 
Always carry several guns and lots of hollow point bullets. Shoot everything. All the time. Don’t even wait. 
If you can avoid it, try not to swim in lakes or natural bodies of water. If you swim in a pool, you can see what’s under the water. also, don’t swim at night, especially when alone. 
If you are female and you just found any of your friends dead by any means it’s probably not the time to get naked and take a shower. 
If you really must run screaming through the woods, remember to dress for it. Jeans and sneakers always beat a filmy nightgown and high heels. 
When the bad guy stops to tell you what he is going to do to you, that’s when you RUN AWAY!! 
Don’t mess with objects that you have NO earthly idea what they are. They will either conjure up the evil creature, or teleport you to alternate worlds. 
Don’t take food or drink from any strangers or new people in town. 
Don’t volunteer to go for help ! 
Always be nice to the shy, quiet, unpopular girl in school. 
Don’t get locked in any building or business after hours. 
Don’t accept sexual advances of ANYONE who never knew or liked you previously. 
If you discover any odd scars, wounds, tattoos, or other irritations on your body—you are a goner!!!!! 
Breaking mirrors usually makes a difference in horror movies. 
If you share a last name with the killer, creature, demon, or other nasty, make darn sure it is a coincidence. Otherwise, get a new identity. In any case, you will probably become it’s new incarnation. 
NEVER go back for anything you lost, anywhere. 
Never tease anyone. They either gain extraordinary powers, or go psycho. 
All myths and legends have a basis in fact… 
If you know a planet is inhabited with thousands of acid bleeding creatures, it is generally not a good idea to go to that planet and try to bring back one of the creatures. 
On the off chance you decide to disobey the above rule, and your tracking device says the acid bleeding creatures are moving towards you, immediately point your gun at the ceiling and fire. Try not to look directly up… 
Never climb a fence with barbed wire at the top to go skinny dipping in an unusual, mysterious, government-owned body of water. Especially if there are rumors about government “happenings” circulating. 
If you are home alone and hear a noise coming from another room or outside your window, don’t assume it’s just the house settling or the wind. 
If you send your husband down to check out a mysterious sound and he doesn’t return within five minutes, don’t go downstairs. He’s probably already dead. 
If you value your life, stay a virgin. 
Crosses NEVER work on demonic beings. 
Never try to kill a monster the same way it was done before. (This must cause something real, real bad because no one ever tries it.) 
If you feel funny and start to grow hair, shoot yourself in the head with a silverbullet – AT ONCE! 
When you walk into a room / house etc, ALWAYS at least TRY to switch the lights on. 
OR… When you walk into a room / house etc, NEVER even TRY turning on the lights, dress in black and be quiet. 
All in all, stay in the light, inside a well-boarded up house forever surrounded by people and do not make yourself vulnerable in any way possible (by getting naked, allowing yourself to be left alone, etc.) 
Cigarette lighters are always handy things to have on you. 
Don’t bother telling another character to “Stay in the car.” They won’t anyway, and will end up saving you. 
Do not visit Prom Queen’s grave, better to remember her the way that she was. 
Do not allow children to watch television, read old books or play with puzzle boxes or dolls unsupervised. 
Do not move into a fully automated computer controlled house. Unless your Bill Gates. 
Do not allow a computer the ability to lock doors. 
Don’t eat food supplements, health food or yogurt. Its not as good for you as you think. 
When scientists start saying they have made a breakthrough in Gene splicing. Pull the plug on the project or resign as C.E.O of the Corporation. 
Avoid men in black. 
Also avoid men with pointy teeth. 
Natch facial hair. 
Also people with pale complexion who moan and sway. 
When Granny starts frothing at the mouth it’s time to send her to the retirement home. 
If you manage to find a good bludgeon or any other good weapon, DO NOT throw it away after you use it. You WILL need it later. 
NEVER ever pick up hitch hickers on deserted rural roads, especially if you live in texas. 
NEVER start crying/whinning when the monster or villan has you cornered, it wastes precious time that you could use to fight back and the monster or villian does not really give a damn about your life anyway. 
Never ask a vampire if he’d like to stay for dinner. 
If you hear weird music start to play run like hell. 
If you answer the phone and hear someone breathing heavy on the other end, never assume it is your boyfriend playing a trick on you. And never never, never, say “come on over, my parents are gone for the weekend.” 
Fnd a city before dark. Never turn off down a nice looking dirt road. 
When shark hunting, it is always a good idea to have any underwater power lines marked out on your map. 
If you are a woman your chances of survival are much much better if you are a good woman. To be a good woman you must 
Be a natural blond. Blondes with visable roots are the food of choice of 9 out of 10 aliens 
Be the daughter of a venerable and crusty scientist, preferably the world’s leading expert on things with scales, Latin names or way too many legs. You can dramatically increase your chances of survival at this point by following in your father’s footsteps and becoming the world’s second best leading expert on things with scales, Latin names or way too many legs. 
Refrain from wearing makeup, in particular red lipstick or nail polish. This is catnip to monsters 
If it is too late to become a virgin, become frigid and make sure people know about it. The no makeup thing can be a big help here. 
Be in love with the bad scientist, at least for the first part of the movie BUT at all costs switch allegiances to the good scientist the second the bad scientist begins to mutate. 
Wear a rip away blouse and learn to faint gracefully. You will be called on to do this alot. 
Hang around next to the bad woman a lot. It will make you look pure. 
Bad women have only the slimmest hope for survival. Cast jealousy aside and buddy right up to the good woman. Be ready to squash the bad scientist like a bug the second his fortunes turn. Loyalty here is misplaced, he doesn’t respect you anyway. 
If you are from another planet and of royal blood, abdicate fast. Intergallactic Empresses almost always end up with a face full of acid and a bad attitude. Even the princesses end up as mind slaves to giant insects. This is especially true of royalty whose names end in a vowel. Change your name to Mary Lou and leave the planet. 
Man or woman, if you have a kid brother with a cute name and freckles, lose him. Especiallly if he spends a lot of time looking at things through a telescope. Eventually he is going to go into the abandoned mine shaft and everybody is going to expect you to follow. 
When your loved one is infected/assimilated/zombified/possessed or whatever and someone grabs your arm and says ‘It’s too late for her/him’ BELIEVE THEM! Shoot the former human and get the hell away from there! 
Always listen to the crazy man warning you something bad is going to happen, because he’s probably right! 
When on the way to camp, you stumble across an old man carrying eyballs, and claiming he is a messenger from god, get back in the car and go back in the direction you came from. 
If ANYONE says they are are messenger from God, listen to them, because they usually are. 
If you stumble across the body of a dead friend, do not go looking for the rest of your friends, because they’re probably dead too. 
If you can find any of your friends, leave immediately. 
When someone tells you not to look behind you, don’t! 
Never go mano-a-mano vs. any monster which lacks a discernable head or limbs, or can infect you with something. 
Never be funnier than the main character. 
Always use the buddy system. Also, make sure that your buddy is slower, weaker, or dumber than you are. 
NEVER eat/drink ANYTHING brought forth for a weird ceremony. 
NEVER make it obvious that you did not eat/drink anything brought forth for the weird ceremony. 
Don’t be a belligerent drunk. They have a nasty habit of getting left behind by the group and wandering to a deserted room (= deathtrap) to sulk. 
When investigating a house or place shunned by the whispering townsfolk, don’t try on the clothes in the trunk in the attic, don’t look in the mirrors, and don’t read the diaries. 
If the barber remarks on the “666” tattoo your buzzcut kid now has, abandon the kid and move to Irkutsk. 
Remember, the priest will NEVER make it to your domicile to relieve you of those pesky supernatural occurrences. Whether by plane, train, auto, horse, donkey, bus, or afoot, he’ll never ever make it to your doorstep alive (unless he’s secretly in league with Satan). 
Never walk backwards! 
If you are travelling through a wasteland and the locals advise you to go no further that night, DON’T! 
Do not poke strange steaming rocks with sticks. 
If you rise from the dead, you’d better learn to like human flesh, ’cause you’re gonna eat some. 
Don’t run through the woods wearing high heels, as most of the time one of the heels will break. 
If, at any point, you are running from a monster/ villian in a car/truck/etc… don’t ever run straight on the road. Zig Zag, run off the road, do a U-Turn, what ever! It’s faster than you, and will catch up. 
If you see a burly man wearing a hockey mask and toting a hachete/chainsaw/axe/electronic-brain-sucker-thingy, DO NOT stick around to see if he’s with the Philadelphia Flyers. 
Never, never, NEVER try to remove the mask from the ‘dead’ villian. He’ll just get up again, and this time he’s gonna be pissed. 
When going down the basement stairs, (You will… you ARE in a horror film, right?) always send your little brother/ sister/grandpa/grandma down first; this’ll tell you if something’s hiding under the steps. 
If you are a wuss and run away from one confrontation with the serial killer/demon/spirit/sla

This weekend went pretty well. On Friday I had my party. It was awesome and a lot of fun. The only people that didn’t come were my friend Melissa and her sister Tammy. That whole situation was a bit screwed up. Tammy had told me the night before that she had to work until 6 so she would be a lil late which I was fine with. Then she said that they would only be able to stay until 7. They meaning her, her sister Melissa, Melissa’s 2 kids, their mom and their dad. So I suggested that her dad drop her off and I could take them home. So then the next thing out of her mouth was would it be ok if she held her niece on her lap instead of putting her in her car seat. I was like NO so then she managed to talk her dad into letting them stay until 8. So Friday night comes around and Tammy texts me about 7 and says she will be late. I find out that they haven’t even went to pick up Melissa and the kids yet so I just tell her to forget coming over only because it would be a waste of gas for them to come from the other side of town, go over to get melissa and the kids, go to a store and then come to my house. It would be 8 or very close to it so therefore they would just have to leave as soon as they got to my house. 
So then Saturday me, Tab, and April went to see Paranormal Activity 2. That movie is awesome and really freaky. A guy farted really loud and tried to cover it up by coughing really loud. It was so funny. Then after the movie was over with we went out to the apple orchard to get some apple cider donuts and hung out there for a bit. Then me and Tab came back to watch scary movies until she went over to Candice’s house. 
Today we sat around watching scary movies and went to visit with Lil Michelle until it was time to go meet Belinda at her sister’s house to go trick-or-treating with her and Anna and her sister and her lil girl. It was fun. Kacey had some minor issues with not listening but not super horrible. Then when we came back to the house and put Kacey to bed me and Tab went through his candy. So all in all it’s been a good weekend. Now I have to study my ass off for these finals so I can pass them all. It’s gonna be a LONG week.

ok this should be interesting because out of my many years on OD I have never done this so I’m trying it. 
My day didn’t go horribly wrong. I got done with two of my three finals. Tonight I did my written final for my small animal anatomy and physiology and husbandry and disease classes. I have the lab portion of finals for these classes tomorrow and then Wednesday I have my lab final for my animal hospital principles 2 class so this week is nothing but finals. I also have a project and quiz due by tomorrow so tonight after I put my kid to bed I gotta get cracking on that stuff so I can get it done.
So now I’m debating whether I want to take a bath and do the project and quiz or do the project and quiz and then take a bath. What to do, what to do lol. Either way I think I better go so that’s it for today. Be back tomorrow with more exciting stuff NOT!!!

Boy today has been interesting. I’m officiallly done with 2 of my classes finals. So that is definitely good but still have 1 more final to go. I have a lab portion where I have to do different restraints on cats and dogs, give them a pill, do a temperature, pulse, and respiration on them, put a e-collar on a stuffed animal, put a regular muzzle on a dog and a gauze muzzle, put the cat in a “kitty burrito” and I think that’s it. Then Thursday I have to do the written part of the final. I will be going out to drink on Friday or Saturday and I don’t drink lol. Then while we were waiting to do our lab final tonight I was looking on facebook and noticed that my friend Tab had written something about not ever dating again and so I scrolled down and noticed she had changed her relationship status to single so I texted her and asked her what’s going on. I came to find out that while she was visiting here this past weekend her now ex bf decided to just pack up his stuff and move out. How much of a coward can someone be? You can’t tell the person face to face you have to pack up and leave with just a note. WHAT A MORON. It pisses me off so much that he would do that kind of thing to her. So now she’s going to be moving back to Rockford some time soon but I think it’s b.s for the reason. She deserves better anyway. He wanted kids and she didn’t which I think is part of the reason he left but come on she was honest with him and told him she didn’t want kids so if that was the reason then he should broken it off a long time ago before she moved to Springfield to be with him and move in with him. I don’t get how it’s so damn hard to talk to someone.

Well technically this would be day 4 since it’s after midnight but oh well it’s my day 3 lol. Today I took my lab final for my animal hospital principle class and did pretty well or at least much better than my mid term. I got 104 out of 160 which isn’t great but much higher than midterm. Today is my written part of this final and I talked to the teacher because I have a D right now and she said I would have to get like 85% of the final right and only get 15 or less questions wrong so I’m gonna be studying my butt off later today before class. Other than that went to “babysit” Lil Michelle today. I say babysit because she has to have someone with her all the time for the time being. Her friend Amanda and her husband came over so we had a fun time. 
My friend Tab had some issues with her bf or ex bf or i’m not even sure what he is right now. When she was visiting this past weekend he up and moved out so she came home to a half empty apartment. His supposed excuse was he was afraid to break up with her in person because he was afraid she would start throwing things. She was totally against having kids but I guess he wants one so now she is considering possibly having one. I don’t think it’s gonna help anything to bring a kid into the relationship especially if she doesn’t really want any kids. I love the girl like a sister but I hope she decides not to do the kid thing. I would be worried about a lot of things such as what if he decides to run off again? Then she is stuck with a kid she doesn’t even want or what if he figures out that fatherhood isn’t what he thought it was gonna be either way doesn’t sound like things would end good but it’s her life and her choices. I just don’t want her to regret her choices to stay with him. He won’t even talk to her when there are problems in the relationship and if he can’t do that then honestly I don’t think it will work. 
Well that’s enough for now need to get my butt to bed.

Well I’m so happy today I took my last final of the quarter. THANK GOD IT’S OVER!!!!! LOL. It was crazy. In the end I have to retake the class but I did pass my other two classes for small animal so that’s good at least. Me and some of my friends/classmates are hopefully gonna go bowling tomorrow to blow off steam,vent about how crappy this quarter was and celebrate that it’s finally over lol. Hopefully it will happen. 
Other than that not much else going on. I have to go to work tomorrow which I really don’t want to do but oh well. Guess that’s it for now.

Well today went pretty well. Me and some girls from school went bowling tonight. We had a lot of fun. I’ll have to post some of the pics on here sometime soon. Other than that not much else going on. I have my bowling league tomorrow night and then a sleep lab study so that should be interesting. I should find out if they wi fi or anything there so I can bring my laptop with but I don’t think I will just in case don’t want to chance it getting stolen or freezing because I would have to take it with to bowling so maybe I won’t. I’ll just try to go to sleep early because they wake you up at like 5 in the morning. 
So other than that not much else exciting going on.

Well I would have wrote last night but the sleep lab place said I couldn’t use my laptop there because it interfered with their equipment. I was only going to make sure I have the correct pressure for my CPAP machine but they didn’t say anything so I don’t know. Other than that not much of excitement happened yesterday. Just sat around until I had my bowling league. 
Nothing else to really report on.

ok let me try this again. The first time I wrote the entry it decided to do the anti spam deal and I didn’t save it first. My fault. So anyway I went out to a place called Hoo Haven around our town with my friend Ginny and Kacey. They rehab wild animals. It was definitely pretty cool. I will have to upload pics in a lil bit and post them sometime soon.
Other than that just sitting around being lazy. So glad we have a week break from school. I only have one class though because I asked about the other one I failed this quarter and the director lady said the class was filled for this quarter so have to wait and see how things play out for next quarter. Hopefully they won’t give me three classes especially if it’s micro and pharm because I heard those two are REALLY hard. 
So I was watching a Hannah Montana episode (it’s Kacey’s fault) and they had an episode about her horse and they had a song that reminded me so much of Bear and it made me realize I still think of him so much. I miss playing fetch with him and him doing his tricks. It’s weird. Well anyway that’s all for today. See ya tomorrow.

My house needs to be cleaned but I have no energy to do it which is horrible to say. I have no school this week so I’m entitled to be lazy right? I’m watching a show called My dog ate what? It’s very interesting. This family’s lab dog ate a whole corn cob with a skewer attached. It’s crazy what dogs will eat. 
Other than that had work today and tomorrow I have off so need to find something to occupy myself. Maybe I’ll take some stuff to goodwill to help get rid of stuff. Well that’s all I have to talk about today. I know my life is just so exciting.

Hey everyone another day in my boring, crappy life lol. Let’s see not much excitement going on around here. Still trying to get my house cleaned. I did clean out my fiancee’s car the other day and took it to get vaccumed and took my van to get vaccumed today so that’s one thing not to worry about. I have been doing laundry and putting it away. So I have been working on some stuff around the house little by little. 
In other news my damn wireless internet decided it doesn’t want to work but the regular DSL works just fine so I’m gonna try to call AT&T tomrrow after work to see if it’s the internet or my laptop. I’m gonna get on my wii and see if the internet works on there if it does then it’s my laptop if not then I would assume it’s the internet but who knows. 
So that is my exciting day today.

Ok I know I didn’t write but I had a good reason. For one my laptop was still having its issues and two I was spending time with Jess and Kacey. I know it’s no excuse but I couldn’t resist. I didn’t much yesterday except go to work even though I ended up oversleeping and didn’t get up until 11 when I was supposed to be at work at 10. Jess set the alarm for me to take Kacey to school but forgot to set it for work for me. He had to go in at 6 am so that’s why I had to take Kacey to school in the first place. So after work didn’t do much but be lazy pretty much. So I guess that’s it for yesterday.

ok so today was quite eventful. I spent an hour and a half on the phone with AT&T to see if the problem I was having with my laptop and it not connecting to the net but my desktop and wii did could be fixed. It couldn’t so then I took my laptop to Best Buy and they said it was the internet card in it. So now I have to try to contact Dell and see what they can do. So that was part one of my exciting day. Then I went to school to see why I still haven’t gotten the second part of my disbursement check from school. I received 400 but all together I’m supposed to get 2,000. So they told me that basically it sounds like the company I had to send the verfication to didn’t like how it was filled out so I had to refill out the paper and have them refax it after it’s already been sent 2x so let’s hope 3rd time is a charm. Other than that not much else of excitement really going on. Not looking forward to redoing this large animal class that starts Monday. Hopefully it will go better than it did last time I took it and I can pass it this time. I kept all my papers from the last time so that should make it a lil easier. The only thing I’m not looking forward to is having to drive in snow to go to Janesville which is about a hour away from us or maybe closer can’t remember. So that’s my griping today. I’m gonna go eat my dinner and chill out for a while and then probably get back on here some time tonight.

Well tonight I went over to my friend Ginny’s house and we played a game and I listened to her and her friend Mandy talking. My phone has been dying pretty quickly lately so I think it’s time for a new battery for it. So it’s my luck that my phone dies and the van runs out of gas so I didn’t find out about it until I got home and connected my phone to the computer only to find a voicemail from Jess saying the van was out of gas so I drove back out there to get Kacey. So yea that was the excitement for my night. 

Other than that not much else going on. I unfortunately start class on Monday night. I’m a tad confused on the whole FA part of things because I was told by the FA lady I spoke to that I wouldn’t get my grant but my two loans would cover the class. The class is 900 and something but my friend went to talk to them and they told her she would have to pay like 400 and something and her grant would cover the other 400 and something so I’m really confused and hope they don’t try to pull that crap on me because if that’s the case I’m gonna be done with school because I don’t have any way to save up 400 bucks to keep going. 
Besides if I fail this class again I’m done anyway. So we’ll have to wait and see what happens.
My laptop issue got resolved. I just had to do a system restore back to the factory settings and it works just fine now.

They are playing House of the Dead overkill right now. Don’t know what we are gonna play next but I’m sure we’ll find something fun. Waiting for dinner to be ready LASGNA and garlic bread YUM.

Billy
Meow! Meow! Meow! That was the melodious song my mother, Florence Ruehl, heard emanating from the bedroom one morning as she was cleaning the breakfast dishes in the kitchen. This startled her because, although inveterate ailurophiles, my parents did not own a cat!
	When she ventured in to investigate, she was shocked to see a plump black tabby with a thick fluffy tail atop the dresser, pawing through her jewelry. He promptly hopped off, approached her meowing, and rubbed his soft fur through her legs. Of course, she could not resist his charms and began stroking him, including a loud cascade of delighted purrs. She also poured a saucer of milk for him, which he quickly lapped up.
	Then, the feline introduced himself to me, his furry body against mine. At the time, I was a three-year-old toddler, and while I certainly do not remember many of the events of that period, I have a vivid recollection of enjoying playing with this kitty!
	Later, my mother opened the front door and he scampered off. But, she was still thoroughly perplexed as to how he had gained entry to our domicile. At the time, we had just moved into a unit in Philadelphia that was actually the second floor of a home that had been converted into an apartment by the owners after their adult son had moved out on his own. When she mentioned the incident to them, Florence was informed that the cat was their own Billy, and that he considered the upper level his domain, even if it was occupied by another family. 
	From then on, Billy paid us a regular morning social call, making the rounds of the apartment as though he were a feudal lord inspecting his estate. 
	After several days, Florence still had not figured out how Billy was getting in. Because this was a sweltering summer, she kept the windows open,but all were screened. One morning, she decided to maintain a vigil, awaiting Billys arrival to find out how he entered. And that was when she learned that he was truly a cat burglar. He apparently had used his claws to widen a small tear in the bathroom window screen, and despite his girth, was able to deftly squeeze through it and into his kingdom. 
	While Florence initially enjoyed his intrusions, she became decidedly unhinged one day when Billy, on his favorite spot on the dresser, swatted a compact onto the floor, creating a powdery mess for her to clean up. Then and there, she decided to block his entrée by taping a piece of cardboard over the screen opening. There would be no more uninvited trespassing by Billy!
	But the next morning, unbeknownst to her, Billy, with the sagacity of an animal Einstein, used his claws to push away the cardboard barrier and enter once again. No one was going to deny him entry to his realm! She was asleep on the sofa when Billy suddenly pounced onto her chest, yowling loudly and persistently. She could not believe that he was back again, and could not understand what all the caterwauling was about, which was atypical for Billy. Then, he leapt onto the floor, still wailing, as though trying to sound an alarm. 
	She followed him as he led her to me, lying on the kitchen floor, choking to death! My mother slapped me several times on the back (the Heimlich maneuver had not yet been invented), and dislodged a chunk of chocolate chip cookie that had stuck in my throat. Billy had saved my life, and he became an instant hero with my mother. She even widened the hole in the screen to make sure Billy would not scratch his fur when shimmying in! 	
	As an incredible footnote, despite this experience, I still have a pronounced fondness for chocolate chip cookies. Dr. Franklin Ruehl, Ph.D

I don’t have much to write about. School seems to be getting interesting. One of my friends dropped out and me and April might not be far behind. If I don’t pass this class this time I’m done for good. So a lot of pressure to get my butt in gear and pass this class. The good thing is at least there are some people I know in this class so it hopefully won’t suck that bad and there will be no annoying, bitchy chicks like last time. 
Other than that not much of excitement going on. I went on Jess’s facebook page and pretended to be him and was talking to Bridezilla. I found it very funny that she kept asking when Jess got off work like she wanted to make sure he was the one Russ talked to. So I made a comment saying I know you and Russ don’t care for Shell but if I’m not home she can relay the message to me. I found it interesting that she didn’t say anything about me in the reply. Jess’s mom I guess called them trying to get our numbers but I guess they didn’t give it to her. I find it interesting that she can remember Russ’s number but they can’t remember ours. That crap pisses me off and gives us even more reason not to associate with them. I’m guessing it was about Thanksgiving but who knows. I highly doubt Jess will call her to find out. Last year they called about Thanksgiving time to tell us they were gonna be going to one of the uncles houses but our problem is we never know what Jess will be working so we can’t make plans and he can’t request it off either. 
Work isn’t too bad. I got my evaluation towards the end of October and it wasn’t too good. My supervisor was basically saying I don’t do anything around Marjorie’s house which is bullshit. I bust my ass cleaning her apartment but it’s hard to do when she has appointments all the time and now she is going through stuff in her place because she might be moving into a assisted living place soon. I tried to explain why I’m not able to vaccum or sweep and mop. I can’t because she has stuff everywhere and it’s hard to move the stuff which I explained to my supervisor. It’s just crazy. So now next week on Monday she is coming to sit down with me, Marjorie and her daughter to see how I’m doing. It should be interesting.

Tonight was my first night of my class for this quarter. It went really well. The teacher is 10x better than the other one we had the first time I took the class. She is a vet so that should help. Our labs should be interesting because they said if the weather is bad then they would call off lab which is awesome. So now I’m not so worried about that whole thing. I’m gonna carpool with another girl in our class because then I won’t have to drive lol. 
Other than that not much else going on.

Sorry I didn’t write yesterday but I think I had a touch of some kind of bug because let’s just say I was visiting the restroom quite a lot and didn’t get much sleep because of it which in turn made me have a HORRIBLE headache. I checked the mail yesterday and noticed 2 envelopes with DCFS in the corner. One was addressed to me and the other addressed to Jess. So I opened mine and it basically said that the investigation into the train track incident was unfounded. I was so happy. So that’s great news that I’m not a child abuser lol. I get very angry with my son but I would never abuse him. So that was yesterday’s big news.

So today I got my house in top shape. I’m proud that I actually cleaned the WHOLE thing. It looks quite nice. I’m trying to get laundry done now. It sucks so much that we have to go downstairs and out into the cold to get to the basement. I can’t believe next week is Thanksgiving. Time just flew right by. It will just be the family for Thanksgiving unless Marjorie’s daughter blows her off for Thanksgiving again this year. Her daughter has this weird thing with not having both of her parents for Thanksgiving dinner just one. I asked Marjorie if her and her ex husband fight and she said they actually get along better since they have been divorced. So I don’t understand why her daughter doesn’t want them both there to celebrate. I would have invited Marjorie over last year but I had invited my friend Melisa and her family which turned into a disaster. From getting bitched at because I asked them to bring a few items to her daughter sitting there screaming her head off while her bf just sat there and didn’t even bother to try to comfort her. I will definitely not be inviting them again. The in-laws we have no clue what is going on with them but since they can’t even remember our numbers not too worried about them. 
Well I guess that’s it for now.

not much excitement going on. I found out the lady I work is gonna be moving like the week after next week so now it’s a crunch thing to get a different job. I’m quitting once she leaves because I’m getting burned out from the job and don’t really enjoy it anymore. The bad part is they are just now deciding to give me a raise. So that sucks that they wait until I’m tired of the job to decide to give a raise WTF. So either way I’m gonna be looking for a different job. So we’ll see how it goes. Hopefully it won’t take long to find one with the holiday season going on.

Well today wasn’t too horrible. I had to go for my inservice for work and there was a lady who was talking about her 11 year old daughter who died of a brain cancer.

The Story of Sydney Ives from Jeremy Wells on Vimeo.
It was so heartbreaking to hear this mom’s story and for all the parents out there it makes you think if your child was going through it would you be that strong. I liked the way her mom said that every medical decision they made she was in on it and that they didn’t just lay around and not live their lives because of the cancer. The mom also told the daughter that when God came for her that it was ok to go.

Well still debating about the job quitting. I found out something interesting the other day at our inservice meeting. The place where my friend Lil Michelle would be going through is now connected to my work but the problem is if they can’t get her hours figured out I won’t be able to work for which would suck so it’s kinda a wait and see deal. Other than that not much else exciting going on.

Well today wasn’t too bad of a day or I should say at least the beginning of the day wasn’t horrible. I was supposed to have a meeting with my supervisor and Marjorie but the supervisor never showed and so I called the office to find out what was going on and so we rescheduled for Wednesday. So that should be interesting especially since Marjorie’s place looks like a disaster because she has been packing things to move and there isn’t even space for me to move anything off of the floor to sweep,vaccum or mop so we’ll see what Aubrey says. 
Then after work me and Jess took the dogs for a walk because it was a absolutely beautiful day out before he had to go to work. Then me and my mom went to pick up Kacey from school and went to Lil Caesar’s to get some breadsticks and to Logli’s to get some items. Well by the time we got home the sky wasn’t looking too pretty. As I was going up the stairs to my apartment the tornado siren went off so I’m running around trying to gather up cats to put in their carrier and trying to watch one of the local news stations to find out where exactly the tornado was. So I ended up finding out that the tornado was in our county but kinda in between our county and the next one and was heading towards the other county so that was a relief . The tornado was about a 1/2 mile wide from what I heard and did some darn good damage to the towns it hit. There was even a report of a school bus that got flipped over by the tornado. There was 6 kids on the bus but luckily none had life threatening injuries so that was good to hear. So quite a eventful night. It’s much calmer now but COLD. I guess that’s all for now.

Not much going on around here or I should say nothing of real excitement. Thank god for Thanksgiving I get a nice 4 day weekend but depending on when Marjorie is officially moving I might not be working next week either. I tried to go around town asking to see if anyone knew of any places that could do the assessment so my friend Lil Michelle could get some hours so I could come work for her since my work now works with the place that could pay me to work for her but the way it’s looking that isn’t gonna happen so I might as well tell them I’m gonna quit. 
I have been putting in applications to different places so we’ll see how that goes. Just keep trying to find a different job. I wanted to have a different job before I quit this one but don’t really want to get another client before I find one. So that’s what has been going on.

I never got to be the part of the meeting today for work. When I got there the supervisor lady was getting ready to leave and she said to wait until after Thanksgiving to go over the meeting they had. So hopefully that’s nothing bad. I also found out that Marjorie isn’t moving until the 15th so that helps with my job search hopefully I’ll be able to find a new job or get Lil Michelle approved before marjorie  moves into her new place. Other than that not much else going on. 
Hope everyone has a awesome thanksgiving with friends and family.

Well since my numbering is off and I didn’t write yesterday because of Thanksgiving (Thursday)I’ll write some. My thanksgiving was nothing super special. My brother came over so that was nice. We ate and played wii most of the night lol. Other than that I think my school money is FINALLY gonna be coming in which is nice because it will be just in time for Christmas. We just have to figure out what exactly we are gonna do with it. I know for sure we are using part of it for bills and the car repairs. Hopefully after that we will have some for x-mas if not then at least the bills will be a bit ahead and we can use our paychecks for x-mas or at least most of them for that. So we have to draw up a plan and figure out how much the bills will come up to. Other than that not much going on.

I’m going to school for vet tech and before I even started this quarter I checked with financial aid about it being covered because our school has a policy if you’re only taking one class then it’s not covered or at least at the time that was the rumor I was hearing so I went to check with financial aid. I was told that I wouldn’t be getting my grant money but I would still get my loans. They had screwed up on my loan for last quarter and didn’t know what to put on the paper so I had to redo it like 2 times. So my money is FINALLY in from last quarter that they owed me but they ask me if I want to use most of that money to pay for this class because I only got my grant money and not my loan money. 
I’m fucked either way. If I drop the class I now have to pay for it because it’s already past the 1st week which is when you can drop it without having to pay. So if I drop out of the class and wait until next quarter I will still have to pay for it or at least what I have attended which I have no clue how they figure that out. Besides I’m not even sure if they will let me drop the class because it is a retake one. 
I don’t think I should have to give up the money they owed me because they fucked up. I was gonna use the money for bills, getting one of our cars fixed and x-mas gifts and that’s what I intend to do. So now I don’t know what is gonna happen. 
Then the lady7 I work for is leaving the place I work for on 20th of this month and I was planning on quitting unless my friend Lil Michelle was able to get assessed and then I could work for her but I’m not sure if that would happen. So I have been busting my butt looking for another job. At this point I’ll work wherever. I was trying to get a job cashiering or stocking since I like those two types the most besides trying to get into a vet tech job or at least something associated with animals so I can get my foot in the door. My friend who dropped out said to e-mail all the clinics in our area to see ifI could get a job so that is what I’m gonna do and see where it leads me.

My doctors appointment to get my Implanion removed was very interesting. They were trying to find it and they couldn’t. They took me up to a different floor to do an ultrasound and they still couldn’t find it so then they sent me over to the hospital for a better ultrasound and they found it right away over there so then I had to go back over to the doctor’s office and they were able to take it out and put a new one in. So it was an interesting day. I’m glad I got most of my x-mas shopping done. I’m still trying to find a different job since the lady I work for is going to be moving on the 20th. Hopefully I’ll get one soon. If not I’ll have to do something like clean people’s houses or something on the side to make some extra money. I’ll figure something out. I was tempted to charge people like 5 dollars to trim their pets nails or something like that. Other than that not much else going on. 
I figured out the financial aid crap for this quarter and now have to figure out for next quarter. I have the option of taking my last gen ed and being covered but having to take  my externship by itself which means I would have to pay for it. The cost would be around 1,200 or taking the class by itself and having to pay 457 but being covered for the externship. I don’t have the money to pay for that one class so I’m thinking of doing the gen ed with it and then I can save up money for the externship.

Today I was sitting around messing with Jess’s phone and I went into his text messages to start deleting some of the old ones because he never does and I happened to open up a text message that I didn’t understand until I happened to open up a pic of a hot looking half naked chick. My mom was here with us so I didn’t really get into it with him but I’M PISSED. According to him this chick is a lesbian but can someone please tell me why would a lesbian be sending a half naked pic of herself to a guy then. I don’t buy it. I was trying to find a text message he sent back to her but mysteriously there wasn’t one so either I deleted it the other day without realizing it or he deleted it. So I texted the ho from his phone and told her not to be sending any more half naked pics of herself to him and that it was a tad inappropriate. If she had sent a pic to him with ALL her clothes I wouldn’t have such a problem with it because he has the right to have female friends as well but the fact that this chick was half naked in the pic got me wondering is something going on I should be worried about. I’m half way scared to ask him because he wouldn’t lie to me and if I found out that he was fucking this chick we would be done. I made the mistake of cheating on him when we first started dating but I have NEVER done it since then and I never would. I’m tempted like everyone else is but I have resisted. I know my weight is a issue to him whether he wants to admit it or not. I wish I could be the weight I was when we first got together. We don’t have sex anymore which got me wondering is there something going on or is he really tired and not in the mood. I don’t know what to do. I want to trust him and not be the crazy jealous chick. I guess we’ll see what happens. I don’t need this shit though not with christmas so close and my birthday not too far after that. I don’t expect many people to show for my birthday if any. So I guess I’m gonna go to bed and hopefully by me ignoring him tomorrow maybe he will tell me what’s going on. We’ll see.

213,https://www.opendiary.com/m/torturedsoul_1/ok-feel-stupid-5150247/,2010-12-18,ok feel stupid,"
So I kept making smartass comments to Jess and he finally asked me what I was talking about and so I told him I found the pic of the half naked girl and how he said she was a student at his school so he asked what pic I was talking about and I showed him the pic and he was like I never seen her before. I believe him because he’s very honest with me so he asked if that was why I was mad at him yesterday and I said yes. 

So now I feel stupid that I got all pissed about the chick and he had no clue what I was talking about. He thought I was talking about a elf mooning people text message one of his students had sent to him lol. So we figured things out and everything is good again.
Tomorrow is my last day of working for Marjorie.So I need to start looking for another job which I have been filling out applications like crazy. I applied at k-mart, target, wal-mart, pizza hut, subway, a us cellular job, receptionist job, animal related jobs. I’m trying pretty much everything I can think of and will keep doing it until I get a job. Right now we are on break from school which is definitely awesome. So I get to relax for a while.

I don’t know what it is about the holidays. A few years ago me and Jess got the stomach flu on New Years. Then there was the Thanksgiving after I had Kacey where I almost had to spend it in the hospital because I had to get my gallbladder removed. This year I get the stomach flu on Christmas. It’s crazy. As far as gifts were concerned I didn’t get too much. I got the biggest loser wii game, my fitness coach 2, 10 minute workout all wii games. My mom got me mario party 8 and jeopardy for the wii. Jess also got me a pair of tan pants, a workout outfit that I have to lose weight to fit in, a beautiful orange sweatshirt with wolves on it. My mom got a devotional book from me, a chicken soup book about what i learned from my cat, a bookmark, a pair of slippers, a $10 gift card. My brother got the michael jackson wii game and michael jackson video collection dvd. Jess got 2 workout outfits and the karate kid dvd. Kacey got 2 3 in 1 lego houses, a football and basketball set, a thomas the train pack n go train set, a extra thomas the train figure like 2 or 3 of those, 5 mini monster trucks and a monster truck track, a thing to help him read, shrek forever after dvd set and I think that’s it. So gifts weren’t too bad.
I didn’t start feeling sick unti like 8pm on x-mas and by the time 1:30am rolled around I couldn’t even keep water down so that’s when I decided it was time to go to the E.R. When they were doing the triage the nurse asked if I had ever had a fast heartbeat to which I told her no so that was kinda scary to hear. So I have spent the past 2 days sick. I did lose 7 pounds. Me and my friend Ginny went job hunting today so hopefully we’ll get a call some time soon. 
My birthday is Thursday but I’m gonna wait until Sunday to have my party. We were originally gonna have it a local bowling alley but almost everyone seems to be too poor to afford it and I would feel bad if I had a party but no one got to join in on the fun so I was thinking of having the party at my house. I’m not exactly sure what we are gonna do though if as many people come as they said they are going to. Probably just play party games that we have and just do teams. 
So that has been my x-mas. I will have to post pics on here soon from x-mas.

215,https://www.opendiary.com/m/torturedsoul_1/birthday-new-years-5150249/,2011-01-02,Birthday/new years,"
Well my birthday wasn’t too exciting. I went bowling with my friend Ginny and Kacey and my mom took me out to eat afterwards. We got a few things here and there which my mom paid for. Then for New Years my friends Ginny and her husband came over because Jess had to go to bed early so they came over to keep me company. Then yesterday Jess took me out for a belated birthday present since he actually didn’t get me anything not even a card. Today was my birthday party. Not too many people showed up but that’s a usual thing for me. We had some fun and that’s all that matter. 
Other than that I worked out a few days ago but overworked some muscles so I had to wait a few days to work out again. Tomorrow I’m going to work out while Kacey is at school. I hope this year I can lose some weight. I learned a very depressing thing today. One of our games called 7 Deadly Sins had a sin where I had to guess what everyone’s weights were. Two of my friends look heavier than me but they actually weigh less which is really bad. So I’m going to bust my butt working out to get this damn weight off. I’m tired of it and since I’m not working I need to focus on something besides sitting on my butt even though sitting on my butt seems so darn nice.

216,https://www.opendiary.com/m/torturedsoul_1/crappy-lab-5150250/,2011-01-05,crappy lab,"
Yesterday was an interesting day to say the least. I met this girl named Brandy and my friend Mary at school to take Brandy’s jeep to go to Janesville for our large animal class lab. So poor Brandy was already having a crappy day. It was her birthday and her hubby didn’t even say happy birthday or get her anything and they ended up fighting most of the day. Then we ended up getting lost on our way up there and being late to lab. Not to mention the fact that we almost ended up in a accident when a semi decided to switch lanes and almost pinned us between him and the guardrail. 
The actual lab went ok. The goat I had kept trying to eat my sweatpants, boots, and even tried to bite me. He even resorted to chewing on the wood for the stall. The sheeps weren’t horribly bad. We had to “tip” them lol. It sounds funny and looks funny too. So thankfully the return trip back to Rockford wasn’t eventful.
I have been working out except for yesterday because I figured that I would be getting enough working out working with the goats and sheep. Hopefully it pays off in the end. I’m gonna try really hard to stick with it. 
Let’s see the only other thing to really report on is Lil Shell. She is getting better and better. Right now the only thing she needs to work on is being able to walk. Her feeding tube got taken out of her stomach, she can take her pills by mouth, she was just taken off one of her meds, she can talk quite well, her arm seems to be improving. I was talking to Amanda the girl that was in the crash with her and Amanda said that Lil Shell was apologizing to Amanda for the accident. Amanda told her it wasn’t her fault at all and it was the dumb drunk moron. I texted Lil Shell yesterday to ask about when her appointment in Chicago was today and told her it’s not her fault at all and to NEVER blame herself. It was the stupid moron who decided to drink and drive. I’m just so proud of her that she is trying so hard. I found out something very interesting. I had went on Youtube quite a while ago to see if I could find a video of the guy who hit Lil Michelle. Well I came across a video with his name so I left a comment asking if he was from Freeport and if he was involved in a car accident. Well it turns out that the video was shot by his former friend and the reason the guy took the video was to show to everyone how dangerous the guy was. So I asked if the guy could send the video to me or to Lil Michelle and Amanda’s attorney because it might help with their case. So far I haven’t heard anything back from the guy so I guess I’ll have to wait and see. 
So that’s my update for now.

I started working out probably the beginning of this week and I’ve lost about 2 pounds so far but it keeps flucatating so it drives me crazy because I’ll eat dinner and then work out when Kacey goes to bed. I do 3 different workout wii games. I do one called Fitness trainer 2 fitness and nutrition. Then I do my wii fit plus and then I do MJ or one called gold’s gym dance workout so I’m on for about 30 minutes to an hour all together. I’m trying very hard to ween myself off of pop. So far I’m not doing too bad. I was proud of myself today when I went grocery shopping because I didn’t buy any pop and got a lot of juice. I’m trying very hard because I want to get rid of this weight. I will try to keep everyone updated on my weight loss hopefully I will able to lose a lot and keep it off. 
Other than that not much else of excitement going on. Still looking for a job and still going to school. I get to take next quarter off because 2 classes weren’t available. So yea that’s my boring life. Hope everyone has a more exciting life than me.

This was my second time going so I already knew pretty much what to expect so it wasn’t horrible. I actually have pics I’m going to share at the end of this entry. Just to warn people there are a few pics that might be a bit gory so if you don’t like blood and guts you might not want to look at them. I’ll try to put the blood and gut ones towards the bottom.

I don’t have much to really update about but figured since it’s been a while I might as well. I have been doing pretty good at exercising, eating right and I have actually been losing weight. Today when I weighed myself I was down to 275. So I’ve lost about 5 pounds so definitely happy about that. My friend Ginny is gonna come over Wedsnesday to work out. We are gonna do DDR and try to switch between the different work out wii games I have. She asked if we could play my MJ experience game but she said she wasn’t gonna grab her crotch I thought that was hilarious because most of the dances he’s grabbing himself lol. Other than that quarter for school is almost over. We have about 3 or 4 more weeks I believe. We have one more lab up in Janesville which I’m so happy about because the last lab we went to in Janesville didn’t go so good. We got lost and then almost got ran off the road by a semi. I will be so happy when this quarter is over.
Next quarter I’m taking off because only one of the classes I was going to take was available and there is no way I would be able to pay another 427 especially since I don’t have a job right now. Kacey’s ADHD meds were running out so I went to go pick up the prescription from the doctor and I spoke with her about Kacey and his sleep problems so she told me to start giving him Melatonin and since then he’s been sleeping much better. Before we would have to put him to bed at 9-10 just to get him to sleep until 7 and even then sometimes he wouldn’t stay asleep until then. We also have tried something different with his meds. We give him his normal dose in the morning and then instead of giving it to him at noon like we were we have been giving it to him at 10 and it actually has been helping. Jess isn’t too thrilled about Kacey taking the melatonin I told him melatonin is a hormone that is already in his body but since he’s ADHD that he just doesn’t have enough of it. After that he shut up about it. I understand where Jess is coming from with the meds but without them Kacey would be 10x more harder to handle and with Jess at work or karate who gets stuck with him. I DO. The change with his ADHD med is because he seems to burn it more quickly because he’s more active so we might have to up it to 15mg instead of 10. 
The search for a job is still on. I haven’t found anything yet. Jess was talking about getting a 2nd one. 
I haven’t updated about Lil Shell in a while so I figured I would say some things so if I said these already sorry. She got her feeding tube out of her stomach towards the beginning of December, she can eat food, she has been working on walking, and her mom said she can now leave her by herself for a hour or two. I’m so happy she is doing so good. I told her when Spring comes we are going for a “road trip” and going to the bike path so the girl can get out of the house since she can’t really good many places because of still being in the chair but even if she still in the chair I’ll take her somewhere. I know her temperature has some issues so that’s another reason I would rather wait until spring and warmer weather. She is doing so well though. I have different websites with her story on it. There is http://www.carepages.com/users/6222993/profile, http://www.caringbridge.org/visit/michellemorin
so if anyone wants to visit those pages and leave any words of encouragent she would love that. You don’t have to know her. Other than that nothing much else going on.

not much of anything really going on. Kacey has been getting in the habit of lying about things and it’s beginning to tick me off. I was putting laundry away a few days ago and I found my LINK card cut in half. So I asked Kacey about it and he claimed he didn’t do it so when Jess got home later that day I asked him if he had cut up the LINK card to which he said” no why would I?” So I went back to Kacey to adamantly said it wasn’t him. Something isn’t right. I didn’t cut up the LINK card, Jess didn’t cut up the LINK and supposedly Kacey didn’t cut up the LINK card so what happened? Kacey is either a very good actor or he honestly didn’t do it because he actually started crying and he usually doesn’t do that if he actually did it. So I’m at a loss as to what happened to it. Either way I needed a new one so I requested a replacement one. Other stuff he has lied about too lately though so I’m not sure what is going on but hopefully it stops soon. 
Other than that I am now down to 273 from 280 so I must be doing something right. I have wii fit plus and it’s hilarious because I had originally set a goal I think it was 3 lbs for 2 weeks well I didn’t think I would achieve the goal so I lowered it to 2.5 lbs. So the other day I was on it and it said that I was reaching my goal at a good rate because I only had 7 days left to complete it. Today I got on and only needed to lose like 0. 2 or something like that. So I worked out and reweighed myself and actually reached the goal. Then it says I’m concerned about your health because you’re losing weight so fast or something along those lines LOL. Wii fit plus cracks me up. 
There was one time before that Jess got on and it asked him if I looked slimmer so he said yes well the next time I got on it told me that someone said I looked slimmer and that it was concerned about my health again. WTH too funny. 
I have been trying to lose weight and have been trying to eat healthier. I still drink pop but only one can a day until my pop is gone and then I won’t be buying any more. I have stopped eating candy,cookies and anything really sweet. I think you can have candy and cookies and things like that as long as you set limits for yourself. I used to eat a whole container of cookies in one sitting. Now I say ok I’m gonna have 6 cookies today for dessert. I’m determined to lose this annoying weight because I want to get healthier and feel better too. I have to get this sleep issue figured out. I literally sleep 12 hours which I’m pretty darn sure is not normal and that is even with my CPAP machine so something is not right there. I need to stop procrastinating and call the sleep lab place to schedule an appointment because before christmas I went and had the sleep study done again because I had gained so much weight that they thought I might need a different setting for my CPAP machine so we’ll see what they say since I’m losing weight. 

Well guess that’s my update for now. I think I have 2 more weeks in this quarter for school and then I get a break for a quarter.

So today I get a call from my friend Melissa and Tammy’s mom asking if I would be willing to take them to Sycamore because the dad has a court date on Wedsnesday. I told them I would need at least 50 bucks to fill my tank. They reply back with they don’t have 50 and they think that’s a tad much to be paying me for gas so in the end they offer me 15 bucks. Sycamore is almost an hour away from where we live. I have a newer mini van that takes a LOT of gas to fill. Our gas gauge is broken so it doesn’t register the right amount of gas which is why I wanted to fill the tank to make sure I wouldn’t get stranded somewhere. I explained all this to them. This is not the first time they have asked me to take them places. For my birthday party I was nice to come get them from Melissa’s house but then had to take the mom and Tammy to their house on the opposite side of town and they only gave me 2 or 3 bucks for gas. With gas being over 3 I can’t afford to waste the gas I have. I’m all for helping out my friends but to me it seems like they are trying to take advantage all  because they don’t have their van. I kept telling them to go where we go to get our vehicles but they were insistent on going to the place where they got a broken down truck from that barely worked. So in the end I kinda lied and said I had to take my mom to a doctor’s appointment to which they tried the guilty thing saying their dad would go to jail then. Most people know about court dates at least a few months in advance I’m not understanding why they would wait until the last minute to get someone to take them without having a backup plan or saving up money to take a cab there. It just makes me mad that they would try to put it on me to take them somewhere when they should have thought things through.

Well tonight I took my final. Hope I got a good grade or good enough to pass. I had a B in the class before the final so hopefully I do pretty well and it doesn’t go down too much. Another interesting thing tomorrow evening we are supposed to get from 5-16 inches of snow. Not looking forward to that. Hopefully we get the lesser amount of snow. Other than that not much else going on. Still working on losing weight and eating healthier. Well I guess that’s it for now.

Well in my neck of the woods we had a wonderful blizzard Tuesday night into Wedsnesday. I took a lot of pics during it. It was very interesting. We ended up with 14.3 inches of snow. My fiancee had to work on Wednesday so he ended up having to walk to work which is almost a mile from where we live because our cars were stuck in our driveway. This leads to my neighbor drama part of things. Our neighbors got a new garage courtesy of our city or I think they went half and half for it. Either way the new garage is on the other side of their house and it’s a nice garage. The old one is supposed to be getting torn down but who knows when. The thing I don’t understand is why they wouldn’t use their new garage and park their nice NEW car in front of the old garage. Christmas eve me and my mom had gone out the day before and I pulled the van in front of her house so she could get her groceries out and it would be a shorter distance for her. Well I forgot to move the van all the way back in our driveway so I go outside to move the car and the neighbor is out there bitching at me so I asked her why she couldn’t park in the new garage. Her response was they taken apart their SUV that they had given to one of their sons. She then went on to rant about how she pays taxes for the driveway and all this other bullshit. I told her take it up with our landlord then because if our landlord let us use one of the 4 garages he has useless shit in we would be able to put Jess’s car in and I would be able to just leave the van in front of one of the other ones but we never know when they are going to decide to park back there and it’s not like they can’t use the street in front of their house to park their car too. We have always parked our vehicles in the back. Another issue is the fact that they have all these people staying with them so they have trucks and crap in their driveway so they can’t park there. The whole situation drives me nuts. Our driveway is gravel and the city has rules that says that if a driveway is gravel it’s not considered a driveway so our landlord wanted to pave it and I guess the neighbors wouldn’t go for it. Just drama drama drama over a dumb driveway. We honestly have no other place to park our vehicles except for the road. They have a new garage and driveway they could be using. 
Well here are some pics from the wonderful blizzard in our area.

Well Saturday night not long before I went to bowling my side of my back started hurting and has been hurting ever since. So I finally made a doctor appointment for it which isn’t until Friday. Hopefully I didn’t do something too bad to it because I want to work out but can’t because I don’t want to take the chance of injuring it any more than I did already at least until I find out what exactly I did. I’m thinking a pulled muscle but I guess I’ll have to wait and see. Valentine’s day and our anniversary was uneventful. Jess told me that he wasn’t gonna get me anything so I didn’t bother to get him anything only to find a valentine’s card and some candy while he was at work so I felt bad. For our anniversary he is gonna take me out Friday night just the 2 of us. Other than that not much else going on. It sucks for my working out because I gained all the weight back since my back has been bothering so when I am able to start working out again I have a lot of making up to do. I feel so pathetic that I couldn’t keep the weight off but at least now I know what causes my weight to go back up. I seriously think it’s mostly because of me being lazy and sitting around. 
So that’s my update. Hope everyone else’s life is going better than mine these days lol.

226,https://www.opendiary.com/m/torturedsoul_1/possible-job-17-5150260/,2011-02-28,possible job,"

Today I had an interview for a school lunch lady. It appeared to go good because the lady said they would be contacting me to do fingerprinting but who knows when that will be. Hopefully soon. The only thing I’m worried about is the DCFS issue I had not too long ago. Jess said I shouldn’t be because the background check is for legal issues so if the DCFS was “unfounded” then I should be ok but I’m still worried about it. I’m keeping my fingers crossed that I pass it.
So my day was going good after that. My mom was nice and took me and Kacey out to eat for lunch since she knew we didn’t have too much groceries in the house until the 7th. It sucks but not much we can do. We got our taxes done and we should be getting our refund back around March 12th so hopefully it comes when they say it will. We figured out what we are gonna do with the taxes. Jess and mine combined is gonna total over 5,000 so we are gonna use a 1,000 for the cars. Jess has to get one of his brakes fixed, his muffler replaced, and oil change and I want to get my gas gauge fixed and a oil change. So hopefully all that doesn’t cost over a 1,000. We are gonna go to someone we know that works on cars to hopefully make it cheaper too. Then we are gonna try to get ahead on our bills, pay off our lawsuit against our old landlords, Jess has to pay for his martial arts testing, and then hopefully get some other stuff like new cat trees, cat boxes, mp3 players, maybe a few wii games, scrubs for school, clothes for kacey and jess and maybe a few for me, and i think that will probably be most of it. 
Today after we went to eat we were on our way back home when my van decided to run out of gas hence why I want to get our gas gauge issue fixed. It sucks not knowing how much gas you do or don’t have in your tank. So we are on a busy road waiting for Jess to show up which sucked even more because he had to leave work to go get gas to come bring to me. My back hazards didn’t work so we had to keep waving people to go around us. There were able 3 who were yapping on their cell phone and stopped almost on my bumper and then had to back up to go around me. Finally Jess was able to give me gas and we went home after my mom gave me some gas money and we filled up.

First I have good news. We got our income tax return so we got some much needed items for our house. We got our cats a new cat tree. We got ourselves some items we needed. We are using some to get our vehicles fixed. Now on to the bad news I got a call last Wedsnesday from my program director at school informing me that I wouldn’t be able to finish my degree because I ran out of financial aid. So I spoke with the financial aid director and she explained it like this. A independent student has a limit of 57,500. According to them I am at 38,000 and still need 68 credits before I graduate so I wouldn’t have enough to finish. 
Everyone I have talked to says that doesn’t sound right but that is what I was told. I was never told there was a limit when I started at this particular school. I did go to another school before this one and got a diploma in medical transcription. My big issue is the fact that someone should have told me I might not have enough money to complete the degree. If that was the case I would have never started a degree I knew I wasn’t going to be able to finish. It just pisses me off. 
Other than that not much else going on in my boring life. I’m still waiting to hear from the school district about the lunch lady job. Hopefully I will hear something soon. I hope everyone else’s life is going much better than mine these days. 
The only highlight is Tuesday we are going to be taking my friend Lil Shell out to eat a lil early for her birthday which isn’t until the 18th but Tuesday was when everyone was available so we decided to do it then. I’m not sure where we are going seeing as I’m obviously gonna let Lil Shell pick since it’s her birthday. She is hoping to be walking by April 30th. She has off to a great start. She has to do a exercise where she stands up and sits back down with the assistance of her wheelchair and a walker and a gait belt. The only problem was her mom was helping her with it and kept telling her every time she didn’t do it right and Michelle actually got a lil agitated with her mom which I don’t blame her one bit for. I went over there last Tuesday to help Lil Shell’s mom take the dogs to the vet. That was interesting because Lil Shell’s mom got dragged by her dog whose name is Turbo. He is a lab/english mastiff mix and he weighs 103 pounds. 
Well I hope everyone is doing well these days.

Today was my first day at my new job of being a lunch lady. I got to the school and went to the office to ask where the lunch room was. I went to the lunch room and no one was there so I then went back to the office to let them know no one was back there so they just told me to go back there and sit. A few minutes after I got back there and sat down the lady came in. Her name is also Michelle lol. Then another lady who was a sub named Mrs. Box I guess was assigned to help me. It wasn’t too bad because it was pizza day so it went by pretty quickly. Tomorrow they are supposed to have turkey aand cream with mashed potatoes which i have heard is a lil more complicated than pizza but hopefully not too bad. I guess I’ll find out. I only work for 2 hours so that kinda sucks but it’s a job so I’m definitely not complaining and the school is pretty small. The only things that bugged me was only about 10 of the kids out of 300 said thank you and some of the kids were ghetto and rude. I teach  my son manners but I guess that’s too hard for some people. I was talking to my friend Ginny today and she is gonna teach me how to make quilts and sew. We were talking about making a quilt of Kacey’s favorites like Cars and Thomas the Train and giving it to him for x-mas or maybe his birthday.That should be fun to do.

229,https://www.opendiary.com/m/torturedsoul_1/my-life-is-so-depressing-2-5150263/,2011-04-06,my life is so depressing,"
What more can I say? I honestly hate my life. Yea I have a fiancee, a kid and a job but what else do I really have? I guess this is my reflection entry of sorts. I have a wonderful fiancee I just wish he helped me with the housework and stopped nagging me so much about the exercise/weight loss deal. Some days I don’t feel like doing crap. I know I need to get off my lazy ass and work out but some days I have to sit here and clean the whole damn house because there is shit strewn from one end to the next. Like right now as I sit here writing this entry. I spent about a hour or two washing dishes, cleaning out the cat boxes, folding laundry, sweeping the kitchen and dining room and straightening up the bathroom. I still have to pick up wii games that are scattered across my living room, clear off a big portion of my couch, vaccum in the living room and bedroom and putting clothes in the hamper. So after having to do all that crap he wonders why I don’t have the motivation to work out. Hmm I wonder why. 
Then there is Kacey. I love the boy to death but when you have a 6 year old throwing tantrums like he’s 2 you get tired of it quick. Not to mention the boy doesn’t ask for anything. He gets into shit constantly he shouldn’t be touching. When DCFS came they told us we had to take the locks off the doors. I even explained why the locks were there to begin with. I would put  my son to bed at 830 and he would be up at 2 in the morning getting into stuff, playing the wii or watching cartoons. I’m sorry but I value my sleep and shouldn’t have to get up that damn early to supervise him so he doesn’t get into something he’s not supposed to be in. So the locks went back on the doors. According to DCFS they didn’t want the locks on the doors because they said if there was a emergency we wouldn’t be able to hear him like our doors are soundproof or some b.s like that. We can hear the boy perfectly fine. Some days I’m at wits end and just want to run away and never come back. He behaves better for me than Jess but he claims that’s because he’s scared of me but Jess gets a lot stricter with him. 
I love my friends to death but most are too busy to hang out with me. My friend Amy the one I’ve known since 5th grade posted on her facebook about how she had a great night with her friends but I wasn’t even invited. I tried to make it look like I was joking with her and said what about me. She claimed that she met them at her place after she got off work so why couldn’t she text me to see if I wanted to go too. The only thing she has contacted me about was to see if I would watch her kids. I don’t want to give up on our friendship but I’m getting tired of being blown off. All my friends know I don’t drink but that doesn’t mean I can’t be around people when they are drinking or anything like that. It just hurts to know that no one seems to want to hang out. Some of them I chose not to hang out with. Mainly the one girl Melissa and her sister Tammy. Just too many negative things have happened between us. I went out of my way to take them almost 3 hours into WI so they could see some friends they hadn’t seen in like forever because their vehicle wouldn’t make it. I ended up having to help money wise on a few issues while we were there. Then there was the thanksgiving fiasco. I decided to be nice and invite them over but asked them to bring some things. They told me they shouldn’t have to bring anything because they are my guests. WTF. Then the lil girl was screaming her head off while her DAD sat on his ass playing on his phone. When I asked Melissa about it she said that her bf doesn’t have patience. No offense but why the hell is he having kids then? Then there was the big fight about us not attending their BBQ and pizza parties and other crap coming up. Then not too long ago the whole dad ticket in Sycamore deal. Just so much drama that I don’t feel like dealing with.  My friend Belinda is always busy or at least too busy for me. I wish we got to hang out more. 
Work is ok. I only work 2 hours a day 5 days a week. It’s a job though so I’m not complaining one bit about that.
Next week I have to go for a physical exam for my new job. I’m gonna talk to the doctor about getting my thyroid checked again because my sleep doctor told me to get it checked and I want to get it checked too. There are quite a few issues I have been having that are related to thyroid problems. Some of them are trouble losing weight, high blood pressure which I don’t have yet but it does run in my family, being tired, period problems and probably some more I can’t remember what they are. It would be nice if that was the problem or maybe led into another direction. My feet have also been swelling up even after I sit down and relax them so not sure what that is about. 
So I guess that’s my rant for now.

Today I went to the dr for a work physical exam. I told my doctor about some other issues I’ve been having and told her what my sleep doctor said about getting my thyroid checked again. I’m hopeful that it is my thyroid that is causing some problems. I have problems with literally being able to sleep 12 hours a day even with my CPAP machine for sleep apnea. I’ve been exercising and eating healthier than what I used to I still occasionally eat bad but not nearly as much as I used to but I can’t seem to keep the weight off. There are a few others I can’t remember right now but she scheduled an appointment for another issue I’ve had for a while and she said she was gonna have me get my thyroid and glucose checked at that appointment. The only sucky thing is I have to fast and my appointment won’t be until 2:15 in the afternoon so I have to wait quite a while to eat. 
Other than that I’m officially a regular food service employee at a elementary school in our town. I still get paid the same amount of money and get the same hours just won’t have to go to different schools. So that’s nice to not have to drive all over the city. The lady I work with is named Michelle too so that makes it interesting. Some of the kids are bad asses though. There’s one girl that always asks me to give her my money i always tell her what money lol. She has a smart lil mouth and most of the kids are mexican or speak spanish so it sucks because I can’t understand some of them when they try to talk to me. Some of the kids don’t have any manners but I just hold my tongue. So those are minor cons to the job but I get paid for it and it’s a job so I’m not complaining too much.

I just had a massive yelling argument with my mom. Kacey decided to not behave today mainly because he did not take his afternoon pill and we had some running around to do with my mom. So he decided to throw a huge tantrum in the middle of Wal-mart. Jess had asked him if he took his pill to which he told him yes well when Jess came home we came to find out he never took his pill and lied about it so Jess took him upstairs well supposedly my mom wanted to put her fucking two sense in and say how if Jess touched Kacey she would call the cops on him and how we shouldn’t be mean to him. So I told her well since you’re such a fucking expert on taking care of him you can have him. I went upstairs, packed his suitcase and told him good luck. She came upstairs to grab his pills and then proceeded to say we treat Kacey like a dog because we lock him in his room during the night because he has issues sleeping and gets up and roams the house getting into stuff he’s not supposed to be in. It’s only at night that we do this beecause I have to work early in the morning and don’t want to be up all night supervising him to make sure he’s not getting into something he’s not supposed to be in. She never disclipined me when I was younger and luckily I didn’t turn out bad but I don’t want my son to have the chance to turn into someone who thinks they can do what they want and not have respect for anyone. 
So as of today I’m done with my mom. I want nothing to do with her until she understands that in order for my son to learn respect and disclipine we are going to have to DISCLIPINE him. I’m not talking beating the living days light out of him or anything like that. For me I disclipine him by taking away things he enjoys to do. Recently he didn’t want to pick up his toys in his room so I took them away and put them in our attic until he can show us that he can pick them up when asked. If he gets in trouble at school or doesn’t listen or throws tantrums he doesn’t get to watch cartoons, play wii or play with toys he can read, draw or color. If he decides to misbehave in a store or at a restaurant we get our food to go and we don’t eat at the restaurant and if its at a store he stays out in the car if it’s possible.If he gets into something of mine like paint for example and makes a mess with it he has to clean it up.  Does anyone see any of these things as I’m treating my son like a dog or beating him? I don’t think I’ve had to spank him in a LONG time. I don’t like to spank him or be mean to him but I’m not gonna let him do what he wants whenever he wants.

The doctor called the other day to see my thyroid/glucose tests were normal which sucks because I was hoping that was the reason I couldn’t lose weight but guess it’s me and nothing medical. I’m going to talk to my doctor about having too much testerone because I think I have that issue. I actually get embarrassing facial hair and my arms are super hairy but that could be hereditary too but it’s worth looking into if it doesn’t mean I have to shave my face every few days. 
Today we got a call from my son’s school saying he has ringworm on his head so we had to take him to the dr and get medication. The funny thing is we saw it on his head last week but thought he had gotten ahold of Jess’s beard trimmer and decided to give himself a cut only today after I looked at his head did I see the tell tale ring around the circle. So I apologized to him for yelling at him for thinking he was lying about messing with the trimmer. 
Also today I called the lady that prescribed his ADHD med and told her that he has been having temper tantrums which I think are related to his medication so we are going to try a different one called Concerta and have a appointment next week with the lady to see if hes doing any better on this one. So hopefully he will do better on this one. 
Other than that not much going on. May 21st is our 10 year reunion for high school. We are going to take Lil Shell with us. Jess has been going over to her house and helping her work on her walking. She hasn’t been doing too bad. The only thing that isn’t good is she isn’t progressing with her left arm so they decided to stop physical therapy for her so Jess tries to work with her on that too. 
Work is good. Some of the kids bug me because they seem so ungrateful. To me if it’s free you shouldn’t complain about it but with kids they aren’t grateful for much. I tell them if you don’t like it don’t eat it. I just try not to let it get to me.

My friend Lil Michelle has come such a long way from when I last updated. I can’t even remember what the last time I talked about with her was. Not because I didn’t want to but just because I would have to keep going back and rereading to figure it out. She is now working on walking. She still has problems with her arm where she can’t bend it straight and I guess they discontinued her therapy for her arms because of her not making any progress. She has issues with her mood from time to time but not too bad. Her speech is getting pretty good as well. The man who hit her is still waiting to go to trial. Hopefully this month is when the trial will finally start. The lawsuit is going to be starting in July. I made a slideshow to show her progress as well. 

The first 3 pictures are of her before the accident happened. Then there is pictures of her car after the accident. Then the ones where she is in green were when she was in Chicago at RIC or rehabitilitation institute of Chicago. The ones where I’m in blue were also at RIC but a few weeks after the first. Then the ones with her walker at her house were about a month ago and the ones at the playground were this past week. 
We are going to our high school reunion on the 21st. We took her out yesterday because my fiancee tries to work with her on her walking and using her arms as well. She has definitely come such a long way from when the accident happened.

My mother’s day sucked. I spent most of it cleaning my diastrous looking house. I’m just now relaxing. It also didn’t help that Kacey decided to be super noisy so I couldn’t go back to sleep so I got up super early. Other than that this past week wasn’t super horrible. Wedsnesday me, Lil Shell, Jess, Amanda, Tab, Kacey, my mom and Tab’s friend Brian and Amanda’s husband Terry all hung out at a park for a while. Then everyone except my mom and Tab and Brian went to a different park and hung out a bit longer and then we went to Tac o John’s to eat. Then Saturday me,Jess, Kacey and Lil shell hung out at a park for a while just to get her out of the house besides Jess works with her on walking and with her arms to try to get her to be able to use her damaged one more. We went to Taco Bell for lunch before we brought Lil shell back home and her and jess fell on the way in. Luckily neither one was hurt. She texted me today asking if he was ok and I told her he was fine. 
She has this habit when she walks of doing it like she’s walking on a tightrope instead of walking normal and therefore it throws off her balance. We nicknamed it the “diva” walk so we always tell her NO diva walk lol. We even took her bowling last Saturday with Ginny and her husband Steve and our crew lol. She did quite well. There was a guy that was sitting at the next lane and he said “god bless you for taking her out.” He told me about his brother who was in a motorcycle accident and was disabled like Lil Michelle is. After that I noticed my friend Ginny wrote a very touching note about me on facebook. It also made me notice how many people stopped coming around after Lil Michelle was injuried. 
This guy named Dustin who tried to lie and say that he came to the hospital to visit and all this other b.s but now he never comes over to see her. Then there was a guy named Adam that came to visit her while she was in the hospital so they started dating and Michelle came to find out that dude was dating another chick and then tried to claim his facebook got hacked which doesn’t make sense because even if he got hacked it would still send a message to both parties asking if they were dating and obviously the chick said they were. Then there was Amber she also came to visit Lil Michelle while she was in the hospital but surprise surprise isn’t around anymore. I think people who do that crap are losers. The whole point of being someone’s friend is to be with them through the good times and the bad ones. I would do anything I could for my friends and I hope they would do the same if something happened to me. It makes you so sad to see how a lot of people desert you and take advantage of you when you need a true friend.

Our 10 year high school reunion was last night. We went and picked up lil shell and went. We ran into a few people who we were cool with and then a lot of the preppy people started coming. Not too many even remembered Jess or Michelle but a few remembered me which makes it really funny because I was a total nerd back in high school. It was actually pretty boring for us. The music sucked and no one was even dancing except a few of the preppy ones who were dancing like sluts. We ended up leaving early because we were so bored. We decided to go drive around blood’s point since I hadn’t been out there since before lil one’s accident. Jess fell asleep as usual. It was pretty cool. Then we stopped at Taco Bell and went back to lil one’s house and ate and waited for her mom and stepdad to get back home. Then went home and crashed. Today was the reunion picnic which only like 6-7 people showed up to. Everyone was probably hung over from the night before. So after that I dropped off Tammy’s camera back to her. My camera is in the shop since its under warranty and the zoom was having issues. So I needed to borrow someone’s camera but no one would let me so I asked her and she was nice enough. Then after that we dropped lil one off at her house and stayed and chatted with her for a bit. Not too long after I got home I noticed that the sky was getting nasty looking and then got a text alert that said that there was a tornado warning so I turned to one of the news stations in our area and the weatherman was talking about the whole situation saying there was a possibility of rain wrapped tornadoes popping up. So I started getting the cats rounded up and the dogs ready. While I was watching the station actually had to go off the air so they could take cover so that scared the crap out of me and I told Kacey let’s start heading down to the basement. When I tried to pick up one of the carriers it came apart so I just left them upstairs and hoped there wasn’t a actual tornado. I heard that a tornado did touch down near our airport but I’m not sure if that was true or not. Luckily there was not much damage around our house, flooding in some areas and our power went out but not too bad considering when we were headed down to the basement the trees were blowing so hard I thought they were gonna come out of the ground. The hail was pretty big too.

Yesterday we had a cook out and invited Lil Shell over too. We ended up eating upstairs because it was a bit chilly to stay outside. Michelle was actually able to make it up our 20 or so back stairs. She now has a cane instead of a walker but still has her chair too. She seems to do a bit better with the cane because with the walker and her bad arm she would have to hunch over and it would mess with her balance. With the cane she uses her other hand and can stand up straighter but she does the “diva” walk as we nicknamed it. She looks like she’s walking on a tightrope pretty much. So we tell her no diva walk. Otherwise she is doing pretty darn well.

237,https://www.opendiary.com/m/torturedsoul_1/fishing-41-5150271/,2011-06-05,fishing,"
For the past week I have been going fishing with my friend Ginny. Kacey has been going with because Jess was working. There was one day Jess was able to join us and we decided to go out to Rock Cut. We invited Lil Michelle to go with us but there was a issue. She now has a 4 legged cane she uses and the place where they decided to fish at had a HUGE hill so we had to help her down the hill and up it. She did really well. I try to take her out at least once a week to a park or path mostly to practice her walking but also just to get her out of the house because she obviously can’t drive right now and has to be stuck in the house quite a lot. 
During the week my friend Tab came into town to go to her younger brother Sterling’s graduation. We unfortunately weren’t able to make it because the parking in our town was horrible and by the time we got down where the ceremony was being held there was no parking. Kacey actually started crying because he was sad we couldn’t go. Then the next day Tab came over to my house with our friend Tantasia. I haven’t seen Tantasia in a few years. So we talked about the past and caught up on what’s going on now. It was definitely great to see Tantasia. 
Other than that not much going on in our neck of the woods. Jess is talking about possibly getting a 2nd job. My job with the school district is going well. We get summer break like the kids do so that’s nice but now I gotta think of things to do with the kid so he doesn’t drive me crazy lol. So I guess that’s it for now.

I’ll start out with my crazy day. My day actually started out pretty good. I got my butt up before 11 and got my public aid stuff taken care. I was gonna take Kacey to the library to get him signed up for their summer reading program but the library is now closed on Mondays so we will have to do that tomorrow I guess. So then when I went to get my mom from work when I started pulling away from the curb I discovered that I had a flat tire. So I went to get the jack and discovered it didn’t have the handle to it so I couldn’t get my spare off because the handle that I didn’t have had a piece to it that was supposed to fit into my rear bumper to get some mechanism thing to release the spare so I had to call my friend Ginny and her husband to come out to help us. Their jack had the handle but didn’t have the special part that we needed so luckily we had enough money to get a new tire and Steve was nice enough to put it on the van for us. 
We found out this past week that we might be getting Jess’s great grandma’s car. It’s a 2003 Buick Century. We ended up finding out that we got the car. We are supposed to be going up there next weekend to go get it. I’m excited but torn at the same time because now we gotta figure out something to do with the cavalier because there is no way we can keep all 3 cars. I want to keep my van so that way if we have some event where we have a lot of people going we can take everyone.His car is just a tad small for most people to fit into lol. If we decide to get rid of his car what would we do it with it. I doubt anyone would want to buy it. The windshield wipers are stuck in the upper right postion. It smells like gas for some reason when you start it, it has a dent on the driver side near the hood. These days you never know though because it still runs. There was a few people I was thinking of giving it to or working out some kind of deal but don’t think it would be wise. One was my friend April since she doesn’t have a vehicle of her own but she also doesn’t have a job so no clue how she would afford to pay for insurance, title of the car and the repairs if it needed it. Her dad already pays for everything for them. Then there was the ones I had issues with a while back Melissa and Tammy but the only one working is the dad and mom and they can barely pay their rent or bills so I don’t think that would be a wise choice either. The only other person I was thinking of was Lil Michelle but she would probably want a bigger vehicle because she likes to take the dogs with and Turbo is 103 pounds and Lab/Mastiff mix I don’t think he would fit too well in a small cavalier. So no clue what to do about the car situation but I know we wouldn’t be able to keep all 3 vehicles. 
I happened to see on one of our local news stations website about civil union. I know most people think civil union is only for gays and lesbians but it can be for straight people as well. Civil union is pretty much almost the same thing as marriage except you wouldn’t get all the benefits that you would if you were married. Me and Jess were gonna do a ceremony without getting a marriage license anyway but I don’t think you could get a pastor to wed you if you don’t have a marriage license besides as much as I hate to say it I need my LINK and medical card and if we me and Jess went and got the marriage license I would lose all my benefits and we would be struggling even more. When I was waiting to get my LINK and medical card back after a issue with child support it sucked. We could barely afford to get groceries in the house so I think a civil union would be perfect for us because then we would be married but wouldn’t have to worry about the government issues. 
Other than that not much else going on right now. Kacey lost his first tooth today so we told himm to put it under his pillow. I was just talking to Jess about what to give him. We are gonna give him one of our dollar coins. I’m gonna go over to Lil Michelle’s this weekend and spend it over at her house. We went fishing last Thursday with Amanda and her hubby and Michelle was very angry with her mom. Her mom nags her a lot about stuff which annoys Michelle. She said her mom treats her like a kid. I understand Michelle needs help with things still but it doesn’t mean her mom should be treating her like a kid that’s ridiculous besides how is Michelle supposed to be independent again if her mom isn’t helping her get stronger with personal and day to day tasks. I know when we take her somewhere we let her make her own choices on what she wants to do. The only thing we nag her about is when she walks it looks like she is on a tightrope so we tell her no diva walking and Jess gets after her when she doesn’t use her injuried hand and arm. She can do things with it but she uses her good arm and hand so we try to get her to use the other one. Jess came up with the idea for me to go over to her house and spend the weekend with her so her and her mom can take a break from each other. Not sure what we are gonna do though because she only gets local channels on her tv, has no cable, no internet. My thought is see what movies that I have that she would be interested in seeing and if she still has the wii at her house bring over some wii games to play or maybe even just some board games I have or cards or something but I’m sure we can find something to occupy ourselves. If it is nice weather we are gonna go to a park or bike path to get her out for a while.

239,https://www.opendiary.com/m/torturedsoul_1/lipstick-15-5150273/,2011-06-14,lipstick,"
According to a news report, a certain private school in Washington
was recently faced with a unique problem. A number of 12-year-old girls were
beginning to use lipstick and would put it on in the bathroom. That was fine,
but after they put on their lipstick, they would press their lips on the
mirror leaving dozens of little lip prints. Every night the maintenance man
would remove them, and the next day the girls would put them back. Finally
the principal decided that something had to be done.
She called all the girls to the bathroom and met them there with the
maintenance man. She explained that all these lip prints were causing a major
problem for the custodian who had to clean the mirrors every night (you can
just imagine all the yawns from the little princesses).
To demonstrate how difficult it had been to clean the mirrors, she
asked the maintenance man to show the girls how much effort was required. He
took out a long-handled squeegee, dipped it in the toilet, and cleaned the
mirror with it.
Since then, there have been no lip prints on the mirror.
There are teachers.. . . and then there are educators.

TOP 8 MORONS OF 2010
1. WILL THE REAL DUMMY PLEASE STAND UP?  
AT&T fired President John Walter after nine months, saying he lacked intellectual leadership.  He received a $26 million severance package.  Perhaps it’s not Walter who’s lacking intelligence.
2. . WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM OUR FRIENDS.  
Police in Oakland , CA , spent two hours attempting to subdue a gunman who had barricaded himself inside his home. After firing ten tear gas canisters, officers discovered that the man was standing beside them in the police line, shouting, ‘Please come out and give yourself up.’
 3.  WHAT WAS PLAN B??? 
An Illinois man, pretending to have a gun, kidnapped a motorist and forced him to drive to two different automated teller machines, wherein the kidnapper proceeded to withdraw money from his own bank accounts!
4. THE GETAWAY! 
A man walked into a Topeka , Kansas Kwik Stop and asked for all the money in the cash drawer.  Apparently, the take was too small, so he tied up the store clerk and worked the counter himself for three hours until police showed up and grabbed him.     
5.   DID I SAY THAT???  
Police in Los Angeles had good luck with a robbery suspect who just couldn’t control himself during a lineup.  When detectives asked each man in the lineup to repeat the words: ‘Give me all your money or I’ll shoot’, the man shouted, ‘that’s not what I said!’
6.  ARE WE COMMUNICATING??? 
A man spoke frantically into the phone: ‘My wife is pregnant and her contractions are only two minutes apart’.  
‘Is this her first child?’ the doctor asked. ‘No!’ the man shouted, ‘This is her husband!’
7.  NOT THE SHARPEST TOOL IN THE SHED! 
In Modesto , CA , Steven Richard King was arrested for trying to hold up a Bank of America branch without a weapon. King used a thumb and a finger to simulate a gun.  Unfortunately, he failed to keep his hand in his pocket. (hellooooooo)!
8.  THE GRAND FINALE!!!  
Last summer, down on Lake Isabella, located in the high desert an hour east of Bakersfield, CA, some folks new to boating, were having a problem.  No matter how hard they tried, they couldn’t get their brand new 22 foot boat going. It was very sluggish in almost every maneuver, no matter how much power they applied.  After about an hour of trying to make it go, they putted into a nearby marina, thinking someone there may be able to tell them what was wrong.  A thorough topside check revealed everything in perfect working condition. The engine ran fine, the out-drive went up and down, and the propeller was the correct size and pitch.  So, one of the marina guys jumped in the water to check underneath. He came up choking on water, he was laughing so hard.
NOW REMEMBER…THIS IS TRUE.
Under the boat, still strapped securely in place, was the trailer!

    When my husband and I arrived at an automobile dealership to pick up our car, we were told the keys had been locked in it.

This past Friday I went over to stay with my friend Lil Michelle for the weekend. I figured her and her mom could use some time apart and it was nice to get a vacation from Kacey as well. Friday we didn’t do much but chill around the house. Saturday we went to Jess’s kid’s safety class and watched. Only 3 kids showed up. After that we went back to our house for a cookout. Michelle pretty much went up the stairs by herself Jess was standing behind her to make sure she didn’t fall but he said she pretty much did it all by herself. We played on the computer for quite a while and then went back to her house to let the dogs out and just chill. We tried some BBQ frozen pizza she had and it sucked so we decided to go out to IHOP and eat and then went for a road trip like we used to do. We didn’t get back to her house until like 330-4 in the morning. I will definitely say this she is almost to the point of being independent again. She can brush her hair and teeth, get dressed, get around in her house, let the dogs out. The only thing she still needs help with is putting her pants on and going to the bathroom. She can transfer herself into vehicles pretty darn well. She pretty much did it by herself I just stood close by in case she slipped or her leg or arm gave out. 
Her mom came over to give us a demo of how to put on her arm and leg brace she has to wear to bed and her mom was getting on her about using her injuried arm and hand. I told her mom she had been using it which she had been. She used it brush her hair and teeth, she used it to get dressed, she used it to transfer herself into and out of vehicles and she used it to go up the stairs and a lot of other things. 
I’m so proud of her. It would be awesome if she got approved for a PA and I got to work for her. She said she would only be getting 30 hours a month which is low but that is actually a good thing because it means she doesn’t need much help. This coming Saturday we are supposed to be going up to Wisconsin to go get the car so I asked Lil Shell if she wanted to go with but she really didn’t say anything so I’m gonna text her Thursday or Friday and ask again. If she doesn’t want to do the Wisconsin thing I’m gonna see if she wants to go over to my friend Melissa’s house for a movie night at least to try to get her out of the house.

I had a pretty darn good 4th of July this year. Lil Michelle, Amanda, her hubby Terry, my mom, me and Kacey all had a cook-out at my place. Then when Jess got home from work we all went downtown in my city and watched the parade and then walked a bit to the spot where they were shooting off the fireworks and watched the show. 
Lil Michelle had a bad moment. We were packing up to go move to the spot for the fireworks and Terry said to Michelle about getting her seatbelt on so she wouldn’t fall out of her chair if he hit a bump or something and so she was trying to get the seatbelt on but it wasn’t cooperating and she was smoking a cigarette at the time so she got frustrated and threw the cigarette and was swearing and everything. I think in the end she just said f*ck it with the seatbelt. So while we were on our way to the firework spot she made the comment” I wish someone would let me buy a gun so I could put myself out of everyone’s misery and I wouldn’t be a burden to anyone anymore.”For her brain injury and most brain injuries it affects a person’s moods and we all knew that that was what it was and of course we told her she wasn’t a burden to anyone. When we got to the spot and she got a chance to cool down she said she just HATED the fact that she couldn’t just get up and go like she used to be able to. She was a very independent before the accident and I know it drives her crazy not being able to be independent like she was before. 
I texted her not too long ago and told her that I had a great time with her tonight and that she wasn’t a burden to any of us. I told her to NEVER let herself think she was a burden to anyone and that we hung out with her because we love her and enjoy hanging out with her. I also said that it was going to take time before she could just get up and go and to be patient. The time would come for that. She wrote me back saying tru and that she was trying. I told her we knew she was and that she has been doing great and has come such a long way. 
My heart hurts so much to watch her go through this. She is such a wonderful and caring person. She has questioned why such a horrible thing has happened to her and I do the same. It’s hard to watch someone you care for struggling with things. She has definitely come such a long way. When I spent the weekend with her not too long ago I saw how good she does. She combed her hair, brushed her teeth, washed her face, shaved by herself. All she needed my help with was to fill up a plastic basin with water. She pretty much dressed herself except she needed help with her pants and underwear and a tiny bit of help with her socks and shoes. She can transfer herself to couches and chairs pretty good. She needs help with going to the bathroom in the sense she needs someone to hold her up so she can pull down her pants and to sit on the potty but she can pull up and down her pants on her own she just has issues with balance still so you have to hold on to her so she doesn’t fall. So she has come such a long way. Hopefully they can figure out her arm problem and get it fixed properly so she can use her bad arm again and go back to work in the near future. 
She told me her therapist had her on the treadmill. She said the first time the therapist stood behind her and the second and third time it was just her on the treadmill. The second time was 4 minutes and the third was 6 minutes so she is doing something right. I need to talk to Michelle about going with to one of her therapy appointments so I can find out what is the best way to support her while she’s walking. Well I guess that’s the progress report for now lol. Hope everyone had a safe and great 4th of July.

Last night was quite interesting. We got hit with a storm that produced 80mph winds. Both counties on the sides of us got hit with possible tornadoes. It was just crazy. Our power stayed on which was good. Hopefully soon I can post a slideshow of some of the awesome lightning i caught during the storm and some of the damage around our town. We actually went out and kinda went around our neighborhood last night when it had calmed down a lil bit. I heard that someone had a boat tied to their dock on the Rock River and the wind caused the boat to end up in a tree. Someone else said there the force of the wind blew out people’s windows in some areas. I heard about a huge tree that fell across 11th st in our town which is a pretty busy road. So that was the interesting night we had. We are supposed to possibly get storms again tonight. I have discovered that I’m beginning to lose my fear of storms to a degree. I still get freaked out when I look outside and I can barely see and the wind is whipping around but when it comes to lightning I am a bit less freaked out and enjoy trying to get awesome pics of the lightning or at least the bolt type kind.
Other than that tomorrow we are gonna go bowling after Lil Michelle gets out of therapy. I’m gonna try to take pics and videos to show her progress in that area. Then Saturday we are gonna go mini golfing if it isn’t too hot even though its supposed to be 90 out so we might skip mini golf and try to find something else to do and then go out to eat. Jess is supposed to be going to a wrestling event with his friend Ryan on Saturday. 
So other than that not much excitement going on around our house that’s why I haven’t written. I figured no one cares about my boring life. I have been losing weight little by little so that is awesome. I have my on and off days. I have been trying to eat healthier and stop drinking so much soda and other crap and trying to drink more water too. I wanna try to play tennis or something more and have been doing some abdominal type exercises here and there. Next month is gonna be a busy one it seems. I’m gonna go to 2 county fairs, my son’s b day party, a weiny roast and bonfire, have to go to a meeting for work, have to register my son for school and help register other kids at the school i work at for reduced and free lunch so it should be quite eventful. Hopefully soon i can make a slideshow of my friend lil michelle to show her progress over the months. The anniversary of her accident is my mom’s birthday which is the 30th. Lil Michelle is going to her friend’s wedding on her anniversary so maybe we will celebrate somehow tomorrow.

Friday was pretty fun. We went to the bowling alley and actually didn’t get there until like 8 because we had to wait for everyone. The only people that came were us, lil michelle, and my friend Ginny and her hubby. We had some fun. I got pics I will hopefully upload and post on here soon. Then today the original plan was to do something just the family but at the last minute last night Lil Michelle asked if me and Kacey could come over and spend the night so her mom could get used to having to work 3rd shift again. I had to take Kacey with to her house because Jess had to get up early to go help a co-worker move. 
Lil Michelle’s plans of going to a friend’s wedding I guess fell through so she spent the whole day hanging out with us over at our house. 
As for Lil Michelle’s one year anniversary she is definitely such a fighter and has come so far. When I went over to get her to take her to therapy since we were gonna be doing bowling after her mom was telling me how they got her signed up for the paratransit so she could go to her doctor appointments and therapy sessions. She got approved by the state for a PA or personal assistant so I can start working for her soon and hopefully her friend Amanda and her husband Terry can maybe get paid to do it too. I’m not sure how many PAs you can have but hopefully she can have that many. The original plan was her mom was going to go back to work working 3rd shift but I guess her mom freaked out and couldn’t do it so she quit  even though she had been there 8 years all because she doesn’t think Lil Michelle can be left alone overnight. 
I think Lil Michelle is fully capable of being able to be left alone overnight. When I spent the night yesterday with her she got up and transferred herself from the couch into her wheelchair by herself. My idea was bring her port-a-potty into the living room near the couch so that way if she did have to in the middle of night she could transfer herself from the couch to the potty like she did with her chair. The only issue we could think of was her pants and underwear because obviously we don’t want her to get tangled in them trying to transfer so my thought was have her wear nightgowns or nightshirts with just undies under so she wouldn’t have to worry about the pants. 
I took a few videos when she was at therapy that I have to upload on youtube and post the link on here for but she is doing so awesome in my opinion. I think her mom overreacts and needs to let her try to become more independent. In a way her mom is because Lil Michelle signed up for paratransit in our area which is basically a van or shuttle bus type vehicle that picks up people who are in wheelchairs or have other impairments and takes them to their appointments or to go shopping. The doctor appointments and other medical related ones are free and she would have to pay 3 bucks to and from for shopping. I told her between me and jess and Terry and Amanda I’m sure we could work out some way to take her so she wouldn’t have to worry about the money. 
It’s just so frustrating because she was ALMOST free of her mom but her mom’s fears and paranoia got in the way. I understand that her mom is only trying to help but treating your grown daughter like a kid is ridiculous. Yes Lil Michelle suffered a brain injury but she can think for herself and she does try to do things for herself as well but when her mom is around she’s either bitching at her to do something more or doing everything for her. When I’m around her I let Lil Michelle do things for herself and only help her if she needs it and says can you help me. Then there is the patience issue her mom is always tellin her “oh you need to hurry up and do this or that.” It’s ridiculous. The bigger one that ticks me off is the fact that her mom and stepdad basically moved into her house and took it over. The bed issue I guess isn’t that big to michelle because she likes sleeping on the couch but the whole thing with the TV and having to sneak around to smoke is ridiculous. Her mom and stepdad won’t let her watch movies on her own tv and won’t let her listen to her music and she smokes in secret because she doesn’t want to listen to her mom start bitching at her about how bad it is. I mean come on people you are pretty much guests at her house she should be able to listen and watch what she wants and do what she wants.
To be truly honest I don’t really like the idea of her smoking again but it’s her decision and to her its a stress reliever which she has said helps her performance in therapy and dealing with her mom. So yea that’s my rant on that one lol. So glad she didn’t die in that accident and that she is trying her best to get up to speed and recover from this. She gets angry at the idiot drunk which I don’t blame her one bit for and she gets angry at her ma for doing the nagging/bitching thing but she at least still has her sense of humor. I’m sure she has days of being depressed but she tries and that’s the best thing ever in my book. I’m so honored to be her friend and help her try to get through this “hell” in her life.

This past weekend was pretty fun. Thursday we met up with Lil Michelle and her friend Amanda and went out to eat at Steak N Shake. Then after that I went over to Lil Michelle’s house and hung out with them until like 2 in the morning. Friday I sat around the house. Saturday Lil Michelle went with  us bowling again and my brother came home for his visit. Michelle ended up spending the night and we stayed up til 2 again. Then Sunday me and Michelle went grocery shopping and came back to the house and watched Paranormal Activity 1 and 2 to see if she wanted to see 3 with me and Tab if Tab can afford it. 
Today I had to get up at 8 in the morning to go to a mandatory meeting for work. It wasn’t too bad. We got to sample some new items they are going to be putting on the menus but they didn’t have any bags so that kinda sucked. They also had items to give away. I ended up getting a movie basket that had popcorn, glass bottles of coke, and different candies and some movies I didn’t like so I took them to Wal-mart and got money for them and bought some items including my hair dye for my hair. I gotta get a hold of Amanda and find out when her days off are this week so we can do that. I’m gonna do black with blue streaks near the front and then do like half black and then kinda the under part of my hair blue. This time I remembered to buy the bleaching stuff too so the blue will actually show up lol. Me and Michelle tried once but we didn’t get any bleach so the red didn’t show up against the black. 
This month is gonna be busy. If I already talked about this sorry. I was going to go to the Boone county fair which is one of the counties next to us and take Michelle so she could meet a girl named Chloe that was also in a car accident and suffered a TBI but her mom said there were no booths. Wednesday I have another work related meeting I have to go to about lunch applications for registration. Sunday is Kacey’s birthday so we will be having a party. A friend from school said she waas gonna make a cupcake cake of Cars but I have to message her on FB and find out if she’s still gonna do it. If not I will probably make a cake and put Cars stuff on it. Then if there aren’t a lot of people at his party we will probably just order pizza which I don’t think there will be a lot of people. Then next Friday we are going out of town for the in-laws family reunion and I’m taking Lil Michelle with to get her out of town and to have a NORMAL person to talk to. Then next Saturday me and Lil Michelle are gonna go to a bonfire/weiny roast with my friend Tab and probably Sunday we are gonna go to the fair for our county. Hopefully Lil Michelle will be able to go too because she was talking about how they are having a benefit for her cousin in-law because the mom and baby got strep B and almost died. The mom is ok but if I remember correctly the baby is deaf and blind and has other problems. 
So yea exciting stuff going on. I also start my bowling league so I will have to prebowl because it’s supposed to start the Saturday that Tab is coming into town and there is no way I’m gonna miss a chance to hang out with her since I don’t get to see her much. I’m not like my annoying ass in laws who couldn’t miss their damn bowling league not even for their nephew/grandson’s birthday. I’m still working on putting the videos and slideshow of Lil Michelle on here I promise.

This weekend was quite fun. Lil Michelle came over yesterday and we hung out at the house since it rained all day. The original plan was to go out to a park but it was icky so we stayed inside and played some wii and just talked. Her mom wouldn’t let her spend the night because the day before she was sick and her mom said she was coughin a lot so she was afraid she might have pneumonia but it was fine. Then today Lil Michelle came over for Kacey’s party and then I dropped her off at a bar for her cousin in-law’s benefit because the mom and baby had strep B and almost died. 
So that was my weekend. I have pics to upload which I might do tomorrow. This week is gonna be a busy one. Tomorrow I have to register Kacey for school since I have to work the days of registration at the school I’m at. Then Tuesday and Wedsnesday is the days I work and Thursday I have to go prebowl since Tab is going to be in town on Saturday which is the day I bowl on. Friday Lil Michelle is going to the family reunion with us. I told her it would be nice to have someone NORMAL to talk to lol. I guess that shows how much I enjoy my in-laws. Plus it gets her out of the house and city for a while. Then Saturday is the weenie roast/bonfire that I’m gonna take Lil Michelle with for too because a old high school friend of hers might be there if he doesn’t come then its another opportunity to just get out of the house for a while. Then possibly Sunday me, Lil Michelle and Tab are gonna go see Final Destination 5 and go to the fair. 
I’m so pissed because Jess was supposed to have this week off for vacation from work and when he went and looked at his schedule it shows he has to work but he’s hopefully gonna be able to get it off still. I guess we will have to wait and see on that one. 
Here is the slideshow I promised everyone:

248,https://www.opendiary.com/m/torturedsoul_1/oscar-21-5150282/,2011-08-14,Oscar,"
New mothers who are also cat owners have had to deal with that unsettling old wives tale about evil felines that suck the breath out of babies as they lie sleeping in their cribs. Kandy Phillips is able to testify that her cat reversed the ancient myth by saving the life of her choking baby.
	Kandy, who resides in Modesto, California, was in the kitchen doing dishes one afternoon in the fall of 1990 when her cat Oscar ran into the room and began a loud yowling. Before she could quiet the noisy cat, Oscar jumped up on the kitchen counter. 
	Irritated by Oscars blatant disregard of one of the basic no-no rules of the house, Kandy brushed him off the counter.
	But even though he knew he would be punished Oscar jumped right back up, Kandy said.
	This time when she shoved him off the counter, Oscar nipped her on the leg. He didnt bite me hard, but just enough to let me know that he was really serious about something. Then Oscar started making a lot of noise and began running around in circles.
	Totally puzzled by Oscars bizarre behavior, Kandy became even more baffled when he ran toward the bedroom where she had just placed her son Anthony for his nap. As far as she knew, her four-month-old baby was sleeping peacefully in his crib.
	Out of a mixture of curiosity and annoyance, Kandy followed Oscar into the bedroom. Once inside, she was astonished when Oscar boldly violated another basic house no-no by jumping up on the changing table. Then, before she could even swat him, Oscar had bounded directly into Anthonys crib.
	Perhaps dreadful images of all those old tales about cats suffocating infants momentarily flashed before Kandys mind, but she was soon crying out in a real, not imagined, terror.
	Anthony was lying on his side, his face purple, his eyes tightly shut-and he did not appear to be breathing. It was obvious that he had spit up in his sleep and had choked on the vomit.
	Trembling in horror, but acting on mothers instinct, she tapped Anthony on his back and attempted mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.
	Nothing seemed to help until, in desperation, Kandy held her baby upside down and hit him hard on the back. 
	That did it! A stream of vomit left his mouth, and he gasped and brought air back into his lungs. Anthonys crying was music to my ears.
	Once her baby was out of danger, Kandy was able to sort out the pieces of the household drama that had nearly become a tragedy. Oscar had saved Anthonys life. If he had not summoned her to the bedroom, her four-month-old son would almost certainly have choked to death.
	Something had alerted Oscar to the babys dangerous situation. Perhaps the childs unusual gagging and choking had disturbed Oscar. Or maybe the cat simply tuned in telepathically to the infants distress.
	Whatever the motivating cause, Oscar was so upset by the babys situation that he violated all the basic house no-nos in order to signal Kandy Phillips that she must check on Anthony at once.

Yesterday was pretty awesome. We spent most of the day with Lil Michelle until Tab came into town. Then we went to go see Final Destination 5. It was a very awesome movie and the death scenes were pretty gory. Tonight we are supposed to be going to a bonfire thrown by one of Tab’s friends but it’s raining right now so I guess we are waiting to see what happens with that. The person’s house was pretty small for a lot of people in it so not sure we will go if there are a lot of people because its hard to manuever Lil Michelle around. So hopefully it won’t rain for long and they are still able to do it. Then tomorrow we are going to the fair. The only sucky thing for today was my van’s battery decided to die on us which was partly my fault. I was playing my mp3 player while cleaning the car and ran it down. BOO so now we have to drive the Buick and avoid the cops because our registration is expired and the title isn’t in our name yet. So this weekend so far has definitely been pretty fun.

Today me,Jess,Kacey, my mom and Lil Michelle went to the county fair in our area. It was fun. We got something to eat and rode some rides. Lil Michelle rode a few too. One was the ferris wheel then a catepillar mini roller coaster with Kacey and a boat one with everyone. So it was really fun. So hate that this weekend has come to an end. I wish I got to spend more time with my friend Tab but it’s cool I know she will be back soon and I understand she has to try to squeeze in seeing most of her friends and family into a few days so it’s kinda hard to see everyone every time she’s in town. Our van decided to die the other day. Hopefully its just the battery and nothing else going on with it especially since I have to start work this coming Thursday. The bonfire was pretty interesting. Me and Lil Michelle didn’t do much except sit and chat but it got us out of the house for a while.

Today has been an interesting day to say the least. Today was my first day back at work. That was hectic especially since we didn’t get the food until like 5 minutes AFTER lunch had started. The kids had tacos and we had to wait for the meat. It was crazy but we managed to get caught up and good to go. Today was also my son’s first day of school. He did pretty well the only comment the teacher made was that he was a little chatty but not too bad so that was nice to hear. So later in the day I went on Facebook and noticed a person that lets people listen to the police and fire scanners had posted about my fiancee’s work possibly being robbed. So I called him and found out that they had been robbed. A black guy walked up to the customer service desk and demanded cash from the lady behind the counter. He got away with 2 tills full of cash. I’m so glad my fiancee wasn’t up front anymore because if he was he would have tried to tackle the guy or do something stupid. He works in the back in the grocery department. Luckily no one got hurt but they still haven’t caught the guy yet so hopefully they will soon. So that’s my interesting news.

The other day I had uploaded some old pics to my facebook and thanks to facebook’s new privacy setting since I tagged my fiancee in the picture it was on his profile so bridezilla and her pussy hubby saw it so big shocker she had a comment to make about how rude and disrespectful I was and my brother in law called jess to have him “talk to me” about it. We tried to explain that it was from a LONG time ago back when we were going back and forth related to the wedding. The funny thing is bridezilla tried to tell me what to do with pictures i took with my OWN camera. I told her it’s my profile and I can do what I please with MY pictures. Not like she can see them anyway because she’s not even my friend on FB and most of my pictures are marked friends only.

updateWe do not want any of our wedding pics up on your’s or Jesse’s page so take them all down. Do not mention either of our names on any of them or i will report as spam, not even our names.

3 hours agoMichelle 
all the pics from your wedding are of just me and jess and most i didn’t even say where they were from and not any of you guys i deleted those the first time you asked. The pic that got featured on jess’s page was also from a LONG time ago and just to let you know im not the only one rude and disrespectful. I let the shit that happened from a long time ago go and have moved on. So not understanding why shit is being mentioned now after all that time.
3 hours agoMichelle 
btw you can’t see my pics anyway so why should it matter?

2 hours agoJaime Geerdts-Regnas
Because Michelle, we do not want to be any part of your page. We do not want to be associated with you and we are asking you to just take them down off of yours as well. I do not want my name accosiated AT ALL with you and neither does Russ. Russ actually wants you to take any pic of him down on urs and Jesses. He is not on FB, and unless it is me posting a pic, he does not want himself on here. And bcuz any pic that we are in on Jesse’s page is also associated with you and your albums, we want our names and faces in pics removed. 
It has NOTHING to do with Jesse, this is not HIS fault at all, its you. And that is why we want our names and faces removed from anything to do with you.
2 hours agoJaime Geerdts-Regnas
And you know what, do what we are asking and stop the childish games. That crap should never had been said in the first place. EVER. I dont care if it was a year ago– Get our names off of your pictures, and any with our faces! Thats it!

about an hour agoMichelle 
your damn names weren’t EVER on my pictures except to say where it was at other than that why i would even bother to acknowledge you.The only pics of Russ that are on my page is ones with him and Kacey in it and that’s the only reason its on my page. I could care less whether russ is on FB or not. I took the pic so therefore i can have it on my fucking page if i want to. SO GO FUCK YOURSELVES YOU AND UR PUSSY ASS HUSBAND.
After that I blocked the dumb asses and then they tried to call my phone and left a voicemail which I haven’t checked yet. I don’t want stuck up bitches who think they are better than everyone anywhere near me. I have much more awesome people to associate myself with. It doesn’t bother me that they want nothing to do with me because I feel the same way. If they didn’t give a shit about Kacey they would have been out of my life a long time ago.
*****************************EDIT**************************************So not too long after I blocked her on Facebook she decided to call me and of course I wasn’t gonna answer because I didn’t feel like cussing her out in front of Kacey. So I let it go to voicemail and she’s going on and on about the dumb pics which I had deleted all of the ones her and Russ were in and even the ones with Kacey in them since I have prints of them anyway and she was trying to say I was JEALOUS of them. OK what do I have to be jealous of them for. Russ fucks up when he gets a good job and quits, they live way up in the boonies, Russ is closet gay and so many other things I can’t think of right now.Another thing she tried to talk about was my looks.Ok I’m a little chubby and have bad teeth 
So I unblocked her on FB and wrote back this: wow great voicemail. Why the fuck would i be jealous of you guys? Russ can barely keep a job and when he does get a good one he blows it. Oh I am so jealous of that or the fact that your husband is gay but n’t want to tell you. Whatever is I definitely know I have NOTHING to be jealous of. I have a man that loves me and a wonderful son and I have awesome friends who love me and I love them. As for my looks I have no problem with my looks and if other people do hey that’s their problem. Yea I’m a bit on the chubby side so fucking what. I’m working at it and trying to change it and thats all i can do. I took all of your pictures off my page. I don’t need stuck up people like you and Russ in my life who try to sit there and pretend like they have tons of money and that they are all that. Good for you guys if you do no one gives a shit. So I did as you ordered so you can leave me alone. If im so childish why keep replying. Just chalk it up to we are obviously all very different people. What happened in the past is in the past you don’t want me in your guys life and same for me. FAREWELL

Ok so I’m sure everyone has read the previous entry about my SIL. Well today I went on my fiancee’s page because I check that every once in a while and surprise surprise she had left a message for my fiancee. Here it is:
Jesse, I am dropping you as a friend on here and I want you to know it is NOT about you what-so-ever. I asked Michelle to remove our pictures and names from her FB page, bcuz Russ and i decided we want no part of her childish name calling antics- we just do not want to be associated with her at all. She had to question it, and make it difficult– like a child would. She decided to call me names, Russ names, spread gossip and make things up in her own mind, and we have no time for the pestering. We left messages to tell her to leave us alone and she keeps it up… leaving nasty messages in my inbox. Enough is enough! We love you and Kacey dearly, but I do not want to risk her sneaking around on MY page thru yours, so that is why I decided it is best to drop you off my friends list:( Sorry to you.
Ok first off I did remove all pictures of her and Russ off my page even though I didn’t even care that they were in the pics. The only reason I was keeping them on there was because either my fiancee was in the pic or my son was in them but I was nice and took them down and TOLD the dumb ho I did. So I have no clue why she is lying to Jess saying that I didn’t take them down. The only thing I questioned was she couldn’t see the pics anyway so why did it matter. As for the name calling that was after she called me childish so who the fuck started that one. I love how this bitch tries to put all the shit on me like I started it. She started the whole damn thing by trying to ORDER me to take the pics off my page to begin with. These were pics I took with MY camera. As for the messages she left everyone got to read those in the last entry and there was one message where I told them FAREWELL and they STILL continued it by calling my phone and leaving a voicemail claiming I was jealous of them and that if I changed my looks  etc etc etc so that is when I said the comment about them but if they would have left it at that farewell message it was good. As for the sneaking around shit I’ve been doing that since day 1 but it’s not like her fucking life is that interesting to really SNEAK through anyway mostly her posts are about how she’s going to some cabin to get drunk with her friends so theres no reason to really SNEAK around anyway. Besides her page is public so anyone can see it unless she changed it which I doubt because one of my other friends was able to view it last night. 
As for the gossip and other b.s it wasn’t gossip because I never said any of it to anyone except you guys and only a few of my favs actually know what the heck I’m talking about anyway so no clue where she got that and no clue where she got things that I make up in my own mind. So yea I just replied with “just so you know she did take the pics down after you asked and it should have ended there.” I’m so tempted to write back after she replies with just so you know it’s been Michelle the whole damn time replying to everything so obviously I’m not that CHILDISH but I want this shit to end once and for all and I know if I say that she will just keep going and going and going and I want to be fucking done with her stuck up cunt faced bitchness and her pussy ass gay husband too so I’ll keep my mouth shut. 
I swear if Russ tries to call my phone and it actually goes thru I will cuss his ass out and tell him if he wants nothing to do with me why the fuck does he keep calling my fucking phone then. Me and my fiancee both have phones but whose phone does he call to talk to my kid? MINE. I say if it goes thru because I went online and blocked him from calling my phone or texting me because I sent a text saying basically leave me alone and I’m done with the whole thing to which they replied with some crap there too. So that would be 2 times I told them I’m done with it all and they were the ones to keep shit going but of course I’ll be the one blamed for it all. I feel a picture burning is needed soon I’ll cut jess and kacey out of the pics and burn the morons.
Sorry for continuing my rant about this crap but needed to get it out and now it won’t be mentioned again. Thanks for reading if there is anyone that read the whole entry lol.

This week at work has been interesting to say the least. My manager/coordinator has been sick all week so I’ve been going in early and working with my supervisor. She is a nice lady and has helped me quite a lot. I was asking about a position that became available at my son’s school a few weeks ago. She was nice and put in a good word with the supervisor in charge of his school and hopefully next week I will be going over there. She told me she has to wait until they find a replacement for me at the school I’m at now. So that is awesome especially since my son’s school is only 3 or 4 blocks from our house so if our cars broke down or something I would be able to walk or ride my bike to work. Plus I know a lot of the kids and staff at the school too. This past Saturday me, Jess, my mom, Kacey, Lil Michelle and a few friends from high school Amanda and Sylvia all went to the apple orchard. I will definitely have to post the pics from it soon. Other than that not much else going on. The usual boring stuff I guess you wanna say.

For once the family drama does not involve me YAY!!!! I’ll give everyone the back story first. We recently got a very nice car from my fiancee’s dad’s adopted mom. From my fiancee’s understanding they were going to let him know when to start with the payments and how much they were going to be. No one said a thing so he thought that meant whenever he could afford to send payments and however much he could afford. Well about the middle of last week he got this letter from his grandma saying how horrible a person he was and how he stole her car and with welfare we could get a decent car and to give her car back. It was about 4 pages of this crap. I couldn’t believe his grandma would do such a thing. How hard is it to just write a simple letter asking when he was going to start paying or just please  start paying me for the car or return it. No she had to say he was a horrible grandson and how all the other members of the family were great except him and all this other bullshit that didn’t need to be said. If the car wasn’t in awesome shape and much better than our other vehicle we would have just said fuck it and gave it back after the letter. Jess did write her a letter  back and sent 25 bucks so it’s basically wait and see but if they do decide they just want the car back he is going to make them come to Rockford to get it back. We had to go all the way out to tenbucktwo to get it so they can come here to pick it up.

A friend of mine named Paul received an automobile from his brother as a Christmas present. On Christmas Eve when Paul came out of his office, a street urchin was walking around the shiny new car, admiring it. Is this your car, Mister? he asked.
	Paul nodded. My brother gave it to me for Christmas. The boy was astounded. You mean your brother gave it to you and it didnt cost you nothing? Boy, I wish. He hesitated.
	Of course Paul knew what he was going to wish for. He was going to wish he had a brother like that. But what the lad said jarred Paul all the way down to his heels.
	I wish, the boy went on, that I could be a brother like that.
Paul looked at the boy in astonishment, then impulsively he added, Would you like to take a ride in my automobile?
	Oh yes, Id love that.
	After a short ride, the boy turned and with his eyes aglow, said, Mister, would you mind driving in front of my house?
	Paul smiled a little. He thought he knew what the lad wanted. He wanted to show his neighbors that he could ride home in a big automobile. But Paul was wrong again. Will you stop where those two steps are? the boy asked.
	He ran up the steps. Then in a little while Paul heard him coming back, but he was not coming fast. He was carrying his little crippled brother. He sat him down on the bottom step, then sort of squeezed up against him and pointed to the car.
	There she is, Buddy, just like I told you upstairs. His brother gave it to him for Christmas and it didnt cost him a cent. And some day Im gonna give you one just like it then you can see for yourself all the pretty things in the Christmas windows that Ive been trying to tell you about.
	Paul got out and lifted the lad to the front seat of his car. The shining-eyed older brother climbed in beside him and the three of them began a memorable holiday ride.
	That Christmas Eve, Paul learned what Jesus meant when he had said: It is more blessed to give..

I guess you could say I’ve been depressed. I have a fiancee who doesn’t clean and obsessively works out. A son who doesn’t seem to understand the meaning of NO or anything else. He’s constantly getting in trouble at school or I should say at times he gets in trouble. I have people saying that just because I only work 2 hours a day that’s its not a real job or its not that hard of one. I had a co worker of Jess’s send me a message on FB about Kacey calling her big which I didn’t hear him say to her. 
“I can’t. Can I just say something? I know there is no book on how to parent but yesterday when you came into Logli with Kacey I was extremely upset when you did NOTHING at all to correct his actions when he said I looked bigger. You have no right to just sit there and do nothing. This kind of parenting creates bullies and that is not acceptable. I realize that he is just a kid, and I was not upset with him, but for you to just stand there and hear what he said without trying to correct him or making him apologize was pretty ridiculous. It was a simple comment from a kid but it really ticked me off that you did NOTHING about it. At least I made him apologize”
If I would have heard him say something like that to her i would have immediately told him to apologize. I know kids can be a tad TOO honest at times and I have talked to Kacey about not saying things out loud that might offend or hurt someone’s feelings. So it pissed me off that she would say that but big surprise I can’t seem to do any fucking thing right. 
I suck at being a parent according to some, i suck at being a friend, i suck at being almost anything. Why do I bother to do anything. I alwasy either piss someone off or fuck something up. I can’t seem to lose weight to save my life and I have been trying to eat healthier and exercise, I feel more like a maid in  my own house than anything else. 
well i guess im done bitching not like anyone will actually read this anyway. I’m actually thinking of deleting my diary.

259,https://www.opendiary.com/m/torturedsoul_1/stupid-ass-people-5150293/,2011-09-27,Stupid ass people,"
So of course there is more to add to the interesting convo with the chick that works with Jess who got so worked up about one little comment. Here is the added messages
ME-I seriously didn’t hear him say anything about you being bigger or else I would have made him apologize. I don’t put up with him saying rude things about people. So I will apologize for him now and the next time we come in I’ll make him apologize but honestly I didn’t hear him say that. I heard him make a comment about your hair but not that.
ME-the only 2 comments I need to make is next time you have issue with something my son does don’t tell anyone at Logli’s because then it gets around Logli’s and it’s honestly not their business and the other is my “parenting” wouldn’t lead to my son turning into a bully. We teach them to be honest and not lie. I have talked to him about the right and wrong things to say to someone and how some things even though honest in his eyes aren’t appropriate to say to someone. If anything that would lead to him being bullied because he said the WRONG thing to the wrong person. Bullies do it for power and to feel better about themselves by making someone else feel like shit. My son isn’t like that and as far as I can help it NEVER will be.
M-I told people because the people around me were wondering what he said because of the way I reacted. And you say you didn’t hear it but I know you did. And I have heard other stories of him being mean to other kids and you have never done anything about it. And I also have an issue with Jesse making comments, its probably where kacey gets it from. if you dont know what im talking about, you can ask him. he took a joke way too far and really hurt me with what he said. In the last 2 weeks, jesse and kacey have really hurt me with comments about my weight and I dont deserve it. kacey is a kid, i get that. but he is WELL old enough to know right from wrong by now, hes 7 right? he should know that saying someone is bigger is not polite if he is being taught properly. but jesse? theres no excuse for his comments and im getting rather sick of it. people like them cause people to go anorexic, they’re bully comments that hurt people. i can ignore kacey’s even though he should know better by now. but jesse’s comments were rude and hurtful and way below the belt and as an adult, it was pathetic. maybe thats where kacey gets it from, IDK.
ME-I honestly didn’t hear Kacey make the comment about your weight or I would corrected him right there. I don’t tolerate my child making fun of anyone. You can believe me or not I could care less either way. Even if we tell our kids not to say things they do. Maybe when your child gets a lil older you will see. As for kacey learning from jess its not like jess goes around saying oh you’re fat to everyone. Jess doesn’t talk like that to me or anyone else so that must just be a work thing. I teach my son manners and get on him about things but he is a kid so he doesn’t listen from time to time just like every kid does I don’t care how well behaved people say their children are. No one is perfect and I damn well know my child isn’t nor have i ever said he was but I have discussed with him about the situation and how he needs to watch what he says and how some things hurt people’s feelings. By the way whose kids was Kacey mean to that I never disclipined him because whoever told you that is full of shit. I have NEVER let my child get away with being mean to another child whether hitting or name calling. So you can tell whoever that is to stop their lying.
The biggest thing that bugs me about this whole deal is the fact that someone is trying to say I’m a bad parent and I don’t disclipine my child. I teach my son manners and I try to make him understand that he needs to think before he speaks or answers someone’s question. Like I said I’m not perfect and my son is not perfect he’s a KID so of course he isn’t gonna listen to me but if I catch him saying something rude to someone I make him apologize immediately. So it bugs me when someone accuses me of not doing anything. How the hell does she know what I do with my son. Maybe I didn’t disclipine him right there in the store maybe I waited until I got home and had a talk with him. The dumb bitch thinks that I did hear him but I just didn’t do anything about it. I may not be the greatest parent but I damn well am not one of those parents that lets their kids run free and do what the fuck they please. You can make fun of me or say crap about me but don’t try to say something about my parenting skills when you know NOTHING about my life or how I disclipine my child. Jess had the nerve to say that if I’m that worried about it or focus that much on it it must be true. I know its not true I just can’t stand someone saying shit about me that isn’t true when they aren’t with us 24/7. Besides not trying to make ADHD an excuse but ADHD kids are known to say things or act out without thinking and Kacey does that from time to time. 
Would people like me to be one of those parents that scream at their children or swear at them or beat their ass in front of everyone. Of course not because then if I did that I would be accused of “abusing” my child. So what do you do? Either you suck as a parent and you aren’t discliping your children enough or you are being too strict and abusive in the way you disclipine them. As for the comment Jess made about the chick being fat quite a while ago I don’t know why that is being brought up now besides trying to say to say that maybe Kacey gets it from Jess but Jess never says I’m fat or anything like that to me and not to anyone I know either so no clue where she got that theory from. Besides no offense to the girl but it’s not like anyone is lying about her. She is just like me she got big after she had her baby and just hasn’t lost the baby weight yet. Whatever shit is done and over with and I vented about it so I’m done talking about it.

260,https://www.opendiary.com/m/torturedsoul_1/sleep-dr-apt-thyroid-5150294/,2011-10-03,sleep dr apt/thyroid,"
Let’s see what I have to update about. I went to the sleep dr yesterday and I had to do this paper where I rate how likely I would fall asleep doing different things and I scored a 11 and I guess normal is a 10 so I wasn’t horribly bad but the dr was talking about how it’s funny that I’m still pretty tired even with my CPAP so he scheduled me to get a ultrasound of my thyroid done today. So I did that and have to find out how I find out the results. I really do think I have a issue with my thyroid for these reasons:
1. weight gain- I of course gained weight when I was pregnant with my son but I weighed maybe 240 after I had him and jumped up to 280. I’ve been trying to cut sweets and soda out of my diet and figured I should be losing something especially since when I first got pregnant and started eating healthier I actually lost weight at the beginning of my pregnancy. I have been exercising and trying to eat right but I still can’t seem to lose anything.
2. period problems- When I actually had periods they were very irregular sometimes they would be like 2 weeks and were very heavy most of the time. 
3. infertility- I say this because me and my fiancee stopped using protection when we were like 16-17 and I didn’t get pregnant until I was 22. I can’t believe it took 5-6 years to get pregnant.
4. tiredness- I can seriously sleep 12 hours a day if someone lets me. Sometimes even after having a good night’s sleep I get so tired during the day
5. carpal tunnel/muscle and joint aches- I read about this part on a checklist. I know I have carpal tunnel but I also get muscle aches in my shoulders and feet.
6. low tolerance to hot/cold- I definitely have this. I have to wear a blanket in the summer when it’s like 90 outside. My feet get so cold sometimes
7. eyes dry- I’m not sure if this is because of my CPAP machine or because of a thyroid issue but I have it sometimes
and there are probably a lot more I cant think of right now but it all worries me. At least if it does turn out to be my thyroid maybe I can start losing this annoying weight I’ve been trying so damn hard to lose all this time. 
Other than that whole mess Lil Michelle had surgery on her bad arm on the 22nd of September. She just got the cast off last Thursday and will hopefully be getting the 33 staples out of it on the 13th. She has to wear this brace that looks like it’s from one of the SAW movies. She said she has to wear that til the staples are out and then she has to wait and find out if she can stop wearing the SAW contraption. She has to do exercise with her shoulder and elbow so they don’t lock up on her but hopefully when the swelling has gone down that she can get some function out of it. 
Jess might have a 2nd job working at UPS. He hasn’t heard anything yet after the 2nd interview but he said it sounded like he got the job but they were just waiting on the background check which I know he won’t have a problem with. I’m still waiting to be transferred to my son’s school they have to find a replacement for me at the school I’m at now before they can let me go over to the other school. So other than that nothing super exciting going on in our lives.

261,https://www.opendiary.com/m/torturedsoul_1/halloween-plans-update-5150295/,2011-10-21,halloween plans/update,"
I can’t wait for next Saturday to get here. I’m throwing a halloween party. So far I got 7 people I believe coming. There is my friends Sylvia and Amanda. We went to high school together, then there is another Amanda and Lil Shell and Belinda is hopefully still gonna come too. Hopefully more people will come but that’s the ones I know for sure are gonna go. We usually just sit around playing games but they are pretty fun ones. I have one called 7 deadly sins. It’s kind of like truth or dare but with some trivia mixed in. Then there is boxers and briefs. That one is kinda a party ice breaker type one. The next day I’m looking forward to is of course Halloween. My friend Lil Michelle sounds like she’s cool with going trick or treating with me and Kacey. I’m not sure what Tab’s plans are but hopefully will be able to see her. I wanna go see paranormal activity 3 but can’t go by myself. Kacey’s friend Breanna and her mom and 2 little brothers might join us too not sure yet what their plans are though.  

As for my update not much going on. I have to go see about the thyroid results sometime this week. Kacey is doing so so in school. He seems to be doing very good academic wise but not so good in the social part of the things. There is two funny stories I gotta share lol. The first one was a while back. I went to Kacey’s school to bring his homework that he had completed but forgot to put in his folder to school so he wouldn’t get detention for not completing it and me and his teacher were chatting while the class was at art. She told me a interesting story about Kacey. She said that Kacey’s classmates said he had gum so the teacher asked him if he had gum and of course Kacey lied and said he didn’t. So a few minutes later the classmates said he had gum again so the teacher held out her hand and told him to give her the gum. So what does Kacey do? He pulls up his shirt and removes a wad of gum from his BELLY BUTTON. We were both cracking up laughing. 
Then just recently Kacey had a really loose tooth that he was complaining about for a while.  So one day I gave him a banana as a snack and he ended up accidentally swallowing the tooth. Bedtime comes around and I put Kacey to bed and leave. I happen to hear him crying so I go in and ask him why he’s crying. His reply was he was afraid the tooth fairy wouldn’t bring him any money because he didn’t have his tooth to put under his pillow so I told him I’m sure the tooth fairy would still stop by. So the tooth fairy did stop by and even left a note for him lol. 
Other than that still at the same school waiting to try to go to Kacey’s school but have to wait til they find someone to replace me at the school I’m at now. Life is boring otherwise.

262,https://www.opendiary.com/m/torturedsoul_1/army-national-guard-2-5150296/,2011-10-22,army national guard,"
My fiancee’s friend Ryan from Logli’s somehow talked him into trying to go for the army national guard. My biggest worry is what if we decide to go meddle in someone else’s business again and end up in another war and he gets deployed. It’s lonely enough now but would suck even more if he was gone all the time for that. It’s just a big worry for me. Kacey didn’t take it too well either. His response was ” You’ll be gone even more than you already are.” I understand why he wants to do it but it scares the hell out of me. He wants to do it for better pay and benefits. The shitty job he has now is screwing him over. He has been at the same store since it opened but yet they aren’t giving him any management positions. Now his company has taken over highlander/kroger stores in our area so it’s even more shittier because now the managers from highlander are getting management positions. 
He found out for his schedule this coming week that he only has 23 hours. He talked to the store manager who said some bullshit about senority. WTF he’s been there for 11 years and hes not considered part of senority. The only reason he’s held on to this job this long is because he was hoping to move up to management but that doesn’t seem like that is going to happen so now he’s thinking of the guard. It would really suck for me because I would be the one having to be with Kacey 24/7 without a break. No one would watch him for me for me to get a night to myself. I don’t have many friends to hang out with now and if he left to go do that it would be even more lonelier for me. 
It’s something I want to support him in but its hard to think of the what ifs.

I know it’s bad we went to a zoo around our area last Sunday but it took until today to write about it mainly because I had pics I wanted to post too. They had a trick or treating type deal out there which was a lot of fun. There was 2 horses that really seemed to like my fiancee and kept trying to eat his clothes lol. We went to a different exhibit and the horses actually followed us down almost all the way. 
Yesterday I had my annual halloween party. My friend Lil shell came along with her friend Amanda and my friend Belinda. Then Jess came after he got off work and Amanda’s husband Terry and Belinda’s finacee Richard. Even though we didn’t have a lot of people it was still really fun. Then after the party pretty much ended me, lil shell, amanda and her hubby went out to a place around our area called Blood’s Point. It wasn’t super exciting but we hadn’t been out there in quite a while and I knew Lil Michelle would enjoy it since it had been a while. 
I was thinking of going to a trick or treating thing at one of the local community centers but think I’ll just hang around the house. It seems to be pretty chilly and windy out. Maybe me and Kacey can play some board games since he’s been bugging me too or I can start another puzzle since I finished the other one or have my mom bring up her puzzle and we can start it. Right now Kacey is down with grandma and they haven’t come up yet so I’m guessing he’s behaving. We had an appointment the other day to see how his ADHD meds are doing and the lady decided to up it a lil bit because he seems to have trouble focusing in school still so hopefully this will help him. Other than that not much of excitement going on. I will also have a few pics and a video from Kacey’s fall festival at his school on Friday on here at the end.

Trick or treating went well. My friend Lil Michelle went with. Kacey did very well listening I was very impressed with how well he behaved. There was one house we went to that Kacey had seen a group of teenagers ahead of us get scared by a guy with a chainsaw so when we got to the house he goes to the guy “can you please not scare me with the chainsaw” The guy just sat there staring at him and I told him to go up and get a piece of candy from the guy he ended up running down the street away from the guy and he didn’t even start up the chainsaw or anything. 
Other than that I dropped Kacey off with dad and me and my friend Tab who was in town went to see Paranormal Activity 3. It was pretty good. The only thing that was bad was we had watched the trailer for it and most of the scenes from the trailer weren’t in the movie and then when I went on after the movie it was a totally different trailer all together so we were thinking maybe the one we saw was gonna be on the DVD but as alternate scenes or endings or something. It was still pretty good. 
So not a bad Halloween hope everyone else’s was safe and fun too.

I’m sorry to be on this rant but this is one thing that drives me crazy. I was reading a girl’s mom’s status on FB. The background story is the girl’s name is Chloe. She was in a bad car accident and suffered a TBI like my friend Lil Michelle did but hers was much worse than my friend’s. Her and her mom went out somewhere and there was a few girls that had went to the same high school and knew who Chloe was but they didn’t bother to say hi or anything to her but chose to go sit somewhere and talk about Chloe. 
To me I think most people are afraid to go up to someone whether they know them or not and ask what’s wrong with them maybe in fear that the person will be mean and say it’s none of your business or something but it’s better to go up to the person and ask then sit there and stare at them or whisper to your friends or laugh at them. 
My brother is mentally handicapped and suffers from bipolar disorder and schizopheria(sp?) so I know what it’s like to be stared at when we are in public together plus it doesn’t help my brother used to just sit and stare at people which of course made them uncomfortable. There have been a few times where he has had issues with his bowels and had accidents while we were in public. It’s so embarrassing to have people staring at you,pointing, laughing or going ewww gross and sometimes I’m embarrassed to be seen with him but he’s my brother and I have to deal with it because once my mom is gone I’m gonna be his guardian. He lives in a group home so we only see him once or twice a month when he comes home for visits. 
Then there is my friend Lil Michelle. On Halloween after we went trick or treating we went to Taco Bell before I dropped her off at home and we walked in instead of using her chair. We ordered our food and ate. When we got up to leave I happened to look over and see 3 older teens/younger adults looking at us and laughing. I so wanted to go over and ask what was so funny but decided getting the cops called on me for cussing them out or worse wasn’t worth it. 
I don’t understand why people have to be so ignorant and rude. What if their family member or friend had some kind of disability or even them. I just tell everyone don’t let those kind of people get you down. My friend Lil Michelle didn’t ask for a drunk driver to hit her and cause a TBI just like Chloe didn’t ask for it to happen to her or anyone else who has a physical or mental disability and they deserve more respect than to be stared at, laughed at, pointed at or whispered about. If people just showed respect they would be amazed at the courage,determination and other lessons they could learn from these truly amazing people. Please feel free to pass this entry around on FB and other places.

Jess found out from his recruiter for the Army reserve that if he passes the tests we have to get married. So he goes for his test next Tuesday and Wedsnesday so hopefully he will pass and then we will go get the marriage license. It just seems so weird to be getting married after all this time but we were going to anyway we will just have to hold off on a official ceremony for a while. 
Other than that not much else going on as usual. If Jess does pass the test he won’t go for basic training until February of next year so that was nice knowing that he wouldn’t be leaving right away and I wouldn’t be spending Christmas by myself. I’m not gonna be too thrilled to have to get up super early to take Kacey to school but I’ll just have to deal with it. As long as my mom will watch Kacey sometimes so I can have some me time besides my bowling league I think I should be pretty good.

It feels so weird to not have Jess here at home with me but today I’ve done nothing but running around anyway so in a way it wouldn’t matter but still feels weird. So anyway I talked to him earlier and he did pass his written test which basically means we are about half there to the marriage license. He has to have a physical tomorrow morning so we will see how that goes. I don’t think there will be a problem because he is a very athletic guy and pretty healthy so it looks like we are getting the marriage license probably Thursday sometime if there is a appointment available. I’m gonna have my friend Lil Shell be one of our witnesses and then my mom as our other witness. I wish Tab was in town because I would have her as one of them. 
So I guess that’s my big huge update of sorts. Nothing else really going on. 
It’s hard to believe I’m gonna be married in a few days. So weird after all this time we are FINALLY doing it. Now will come the other part of figuring out if I will be able to still get anything on my LINK or if Jess’s income will push us over the line to get anything. My fingers are crossed that we are able to still get something for LINK.

Hopefully tomorrow is the big day. Other than that so happy Jess is back. The only problem is he lost his suitcase that he brought with that had his phone, his wallet and mine and my son’s SSI cards in it. I’ve been texting the person all day in the hopes that the person would at least text back or something. No luck yet on that one. Other than that Jess cancelled his card and I blocked most of the features on his phone so the person couldn’t download any apps or songs or go online. He is just gonna get a new phone tomorrow. So the only big worry is the SSI cards which hopefully he will call about tomorrow to see if there is anything they can do about it. 
I would have to get a new one either way because of getting married but still am worried about someone trying to use it for the wrong reason so we will have to see what can be done. 
"
269,https://www.opendiary.com/m/torturedsoul_1/not-happening-til-monday-5150303/,2011-11-16,not happening til Monday,"
We weren’t able to go get the marriage license yet. We have a appointment on Monday to go get it. Jess found out when he called that after getting the license we have 60 days to do a ceremony or the license will expire so our plan was to go do the cheap courthouse ceremony on or near my birthday and then in the spring do the actual ceremony. The whole deal with the marriage license because of the miltary is really weird to me. Since Jess is pretty much now in the Army reserve we were told we have to get married. I thought it was pretty much because of insurance reasons but I guess that’s only part of it. According to Jess the army has a issue with us just living together because if Jess were to be deployed somewhere I guess they would be worried that he might try to petition for custody or I would try to go after him for child support if we weren’t married which to me doesn’t make sense because why in the world would he want to petition for custody if he was going to be deployed somewhere and technically for court ordered child support I would be screwed anyway because when Kacey was younger I had a issue where Public aid told me I had to go deal with child support before they would let me have my medical card back so I went down there and the lady I spoke with said since I didn’t want to do the court ordered child support at the time that I couldn’t come back later and try to get it which I’m not worried about either way because IF me and jess ever split I know he would still provide for Kacey as much as he could.

Boy this past week has been beyond shitty. First there was Jess losing his bag with his wallet, phone and mine and Kacey’s SSI cards in it. Then Thursday night my dog was trying to go after something and after that he couldn’t use his back legs too well. Then Friday I got a touch of the stomach bug and had the shits all day long. Friday was also when we took Buck to the vet and he had to stay over night. They think it’s a problem with his back and neurological problem but they couldn’t be for sure because the x-ray wouldn’t show anything and the only other option would be to take him to Madison and get an MRI which I think the lady said would be like 1200. So the only options were have a 5,000 surgery or load him up with IV steroids to see if the inflammation would go down which we did last night and they kept him overnight at the animal hospital until today when we picked him up. He still doesn’t understand where his back legs are so we have to put a towel under them like a sling and we have to pick him up to take him outside which sucks since we live on the 2nd floor of an apartment building. We got lucky and the animal hospital was willing to work out a payment plan with us so we actually only owe 130 bucks more or 43.50 a month. 
We are still worried about being to afford x-mas with how things are going. I guess it’s a wait and see situation. Thanksgiving was almost a no go too except my mom was awesome and got the rest of the things we needed for dinner. So I’m hoping things get better.

Today at 230 we went and got our marriage license. It was interesting because the girl that was asking for our information went to high school with us. So I got the marriage license and took it over to the army reserve office because they had found jess’s bag so I had to go there anyway and they told me at the office that the marriage license wasn’t the official one and that we had to have it signed by the judge which means we will have to do the courthouse ceremony sooner than we wanted to which was originally gonna be my birthday but it’s cool we will try to do it very soon. I was gonna talk to Jess about doing it on Wedsnesday of this week since he said he had off but I will have to wait til he gets home to talk to him about it. 
Other than that already thinking of things for the ceremony in the spring of next year. I found a beautiful blue dress from David’s bridal that I think I wouldn’t look too bad in. Here it is hopefully it will show up for everyone http://www.davidsbridal.com/Product_Spaghetti-Strap-Chiffon-Dress-with-Beaded-Waist-F12495_Bridal-Party-Bridesmaids-Shop-By-Color
As for the bridesmaid dresses I was thinking of a light purple dress but just let everyone pick something out for themselves maybe. I found a ordained minister my old teacher from RCC her husband is a ordained minister and I have a few friends that are good with photography so maybe I could ask them to take photos for me. As for reception not sure how we are doing that yet. My friend Ginny does good bouquets and flower arrangements so maybe I could ask her to do that for me. So I have some of the details worked out already so that’s not a bad start. We don’t need a huge expensive as hell wedding just a nice one that doesn’t look too ghetto lol. 
I have a video I took of my dog Buck and how he walks so everyone could see just have to upload it on photobucket and put it on here so keep an eye out for an edit part.

I am OFFICIALLY married. We went down to the courthouse today and got married. There was only 4 or 5 other couples down there and it didn’t take too long. My friend Ginny came and brought my other friend April and her daughter Amaya. Ginny was nice and made me a awesome bouquet and even had corsages for Jess and Kacey. I told her I would probably just use the bouquet for the wedding in the spring and she told me she would make me a better one. She also made a delicious cake for us. Lil Michelle and Amanda also came which was awesome. After the ceremony we all came back to our house and had pizza and the cake as our “reception”. Ginny, Steve and April had to leave so Ginny could get ready for today and Lil Shell, Amanda, and Amanda’s husband Terry stayed for a lil while. The article about Lil Michelle FINALLY came out in our local newspaper. Here is the link to it:http://www.rrstar.com/rockfordwoman/x1567489011/Rockford-womans-recovery-from-crash-with-drunken-driver-amazing. 
So the day went pretty well. Now to get through today without going crazy. Jess has to work until 430. My brother is going to be coming over and of course my mom too. I’m definitely thankful for my wonderful friends I have online and in person. I’m also thankful that Lil Michelle survived her accident and is still with us. I’m thankful I have a job, a place to live, a vehicle, my animals, my family, Jess, Kacey and so much more. We aren’t wealthy by any means but we do have a lot of things that some more unfortunate people don’t. Hope everyone has a wonderful Thanksgiving with their families and friends and that they are thankful for what God has given them or what they have worked for for my non religious friends.

Today I finally got the call I’ve been waiting for forever. My supervisor called and asked if I was ready to go to Nelson yet and I said yea so she said I’m going over there tomorrow. I’m nervous and excited at the same time. Hopefully my new manager/coordinator is as cool as the one I had at Lathrop. The one at Lathrop was REALLY laid back. She was cool about us taking food home even though we aren’t really supposed to do that. I’m not talking about like tons of food but a bowl or two was ok with her. I don’t think it should matter if the food is just gonna go into the garbage anyway but you know how that goes. There was a girl at Lathrop named Arlette. Arlette is mentally handicapped I’m not sure what exactly she had but she started out not talking at all, having to wear a diaper, biting, pinching and yelling to being able to talk, going to the bathroom by herself and not doing any biting, pinching or yelling. One day a few weeks ago I played basketball with her when all my work was done before lunches started. Technically I’m not supposed to do that but my manager was cool with it. So now every time I see Arlette she says “Ball?” The few times she asked I had to make like 300 and something hot dogs so I had to tell her no I couldn’t play because I had to make hot dogs and today she asked and I was supposed to make cheeseburgers but the truck was late so I went out and shot a few hoops with her before it showed up. 
I still get my work done and I only play with Arlette when I have nothing else to do. So I think that’s pretty good. So will definitely update everyone on how my first day goes
"
274,https://www.opendiary.com/m/torturedsoul_1/first-day-at-nelson-5150308/,2011-11-29,first day at Nelson,"
Sorry I didn’t write about this yesterday I was working on my x-mas presents for a few friends and didn’t go to bed til late. Yesterday I started at Nelson and I met the other girl that is there I can’t remember her name though. I came to find out from the manager/coordinator that I was actually transferred there to replace her which sucks but according to the coordinator she seems to not be willing to do things by herself in a matter of speaking. The coordinator said that there was one day she asked the girl to do fruit because the coordinator had to go fax something. When she had left to go fax whatever the girl was running the water for the sinks and when the coordinator came back she was STILL running water for the sinks and none of the fruit was done. The girl knows what’s going on pretty much because she said she was gonna be quitting once another job somewhere else opens up. It sounded like she was lined up for another job somewhere else. I don’t have a problem with the girl but I can see where the coordinator might have issues. I also heard that the coordinator is lazy and doesn’t really help much so it should be interesting to see what happens. Either way I will stick it out because Nelson is WAY closer than Lathrop was to my house. 
I’m definitely gonna participate in the December Photo thing on here so that should be fun as long as I can remember to post a picture EVERY day lol.

Well today when I came in my manager told me I would be coming at 930 and staying until 1 and that I was the routine worker and the other girl was the backup and that she was going to get fired but they decided to keep her. I feel bad because I will be getting an extra hour while they cut an hour from her but she doesn’t have kids or anything but it still sucks. She has to leave early to catch the bus anyway so it would work better for her if she left earlier than 1. Then the manager lady told me not to follow in the other girl’s footsteps and to basically act like I was the chick’s supervisor so hopefully everything works out. The girl seems really nice. She said she hates how the manager talks about her but does pretty much right in front of her and even keeps looking at the girl as the manager is talking about her but doesn’t come say anything to the girl but my thought was maybe the girl doesn’t listen to her when she does confront her about stuff so the manager just resorted to talking about her to others which I think is wrong. As long as the manager doesn’t do that to me we won’t have a problem. 
Here is my first photo:
this was taken during the big blizzard we had last year. I like this photo because it’s so cute watching my dog Coco following Kacey around. Winter is her favorite season. She seriously goes crazy in the snow and gets so playful. Must be the husky in her lol

Even though its been a year or 2 since Bear has passed away I still constantly think of him and especially when winter and the snow starts falling. He LOVED the snow and would always try to help when I shoveled by eating the snow I threw off the shovel. He also loved to eat snowballs I would throw in the air and he would catch. It was so fun watching him and Buck and Coco chasing after each other in the snow. It’s definitely hard losing such a awesome dog as he was. So many things make me think of him from going to the pet store and seeing a toy he would have loved to watching someone’s else dog at the park running after a frisbee, ball or stick. It’s amazing how much our animals make an impact on our lives even if we don’t realize it when they are with us. I’m getting choked up just remembering all the moments we shared.

Im not sure if everyone can see this pic very good but it’s a pic of my in-laws bridezilla and closet gay. It was taken at their wedding rehersal dinner and describes their personalities perfectly stuck up bitches pretty much. I’m over what has happened between us and definitely don’t need them in my life. I have to learn to tolerate them because of my son and husband but try to have minimal contact with them. They should be lucky I’m not a total bitch and cut them off completely meaning they don’t get school pics of Kacey or any other type of pictures of him but seeing as Russ is the only one of that side of the family who seems to give a damn about him it’s only fair for me at least do the picture thing even though I hate their guts.
"
279,https://www.opendiary.com/m/torturedsoul_1/my-weekend-960-5150313/,2011-12-03,my weekend,"
This weekend has been crazy. First there was my mom’s work’s xmas party that we went to on Friday. It wasn’t too bad. Then Saturday I went to a party for a girl named Chloe Brunke. Chloe like my friend Lil Michelle was in a bad car accident and suffered a TBI or traumatic brain injury as well. It was fun. Her mom introduced me and Lil Michelle to her but we didn’t hang too closely to her seeing as she really didn’t know us but we stayed the whole time and just hung out and talked about stuff. There was also a girl there that had a TBI as well. I’m not sure of her exact story but it was nice for Lil Michelle to be able to talk to others with TBI. Also Saturday night I had my bowling league so Lil Michelle came with. When we got to the bowling alley we had to park quite a ways away because all the handicapped spots were taken and it sucked even more because it was pouring down rain. We had gotten out of the car and noticed a older guy sitting in his caddy talking on the phone but his reverse lights were on so I told Lil Michelle we would wait a few minutes to see if the man backed up and Kacey was with us too. So we waited a few minutes and the guy didn’t start backing up so we started to go, we got about 2 steps when the guy decided he was gonna start backing up. I had to grab Lil one and pull her back and with my other hand grab Kacey because they almost both got ran over by the guy. So of course this pissed us all over so Lil one yells really loud and says” HEY WATCH WHAT YOU’RE DOING!!!!” to the guy. I’m guessing the poor guy heard what she said even with his window rolled up because he hurried up and pulled back into the spot and waited for us to go by before he pulled out of the spot. He was at least nice enough to pull up next to us and apologize. Then after bowling was over one of the members of the other team we were bowling against who had her surgery on her foot and was crutches waited with Lil One while I grabbed the car which I thought was very nice.
Then today I went to Beloit for my friend Melissa’s lil boy’s 1st birthday. It was ok. There was a LOT of people there so me and my friend April just chilled out in another part of the house that wasn’t so crowded and let the kids all play together. The only thing that ticked me off was I had asked Jess before I left for the party if he could bring down the x-mas decorations from the attic and if he could take down the laundry to the basement I come home and neither are done so he’s sleeping on the couch until he can learn to LISTEN. I’m tired of everything I ask it never gets done. Damn men!!!!

I just realized out of all the people in this photo I’m only friends with 2 of them. Tab and Lil Michelle.
From left to right it’s Tab, Amy, Belinda, me, melisa and tammy and Lil shell is behind the couch. 
With Amy I just got tired of not being included in things. I don’t drink or go out and party like a lot of people do. I think that’s part of the reason why Amy didn’t invite me to go with her but just because I’m not a huge drinker or partier doesn’t mean I couldn’t be fun so I don’t speak to her anymore. 
Belinda-the only time I see her is when I have kacey’s b-day party or my halloween party. Half the time she doesn’t come to my b-day party anymore or tries to hang out with me and every time I tried to ask her she would just say she didn’t know. 
Melissa and Tammy- were the ones that were bitching about everything when I went out of my way to do beyond nice things for them and they didn’t even seem grateful for them so I got done with the drama and just deleted them off of FB and moved on.
Tab has been there for me for like 15 years I think it’s been. Even though she moved away and is trying to make something out of her life she still comes and visits me and her other friends in Rockford when she can. She has always been honest with me when she had issues with me and gives me her honest opinion on things and situations. I truly love her like the sister I never had. 
Lil Michelle- We have been friends since high school. She has always been a great friend and cheered me up so many times. Our favorite pasttime is going on “road trips” to just get together and chat about life or our problems. I definitely miss them even though we still get together and chat about life. She is truly a determined and very strong girl. She is determined to walk again by herself and to go back to work hopefully and drive again and gain back her independence. I think if anyone ever said she was lucky to have me I would have to say i’m lucky to have her because she has showed me what determination, strength, preservence is. Even though she almost lost her life she still has a smile and a great sense of humor. Sure she gets pissed off about things but the sense of humor definitely helps things. 
I have definitely learned that even though you think you know someone or you clicked way back then that sometimes life pulls you in other directions. Me and Amy were friends since 5th grade and me and Belinda were friends since middle school so for me you can be friends with someone for half of your life or you can know them for a lot less but eventually you learn who your true friends are and who you don’t need. Lil Michelle and the girl named Chloe unfortunately both had to learn it the hard way when people who were supposed to be friends turned their backs on them and ran away. I think that is so wrong. Friendship is supposed to be thru thick and thin isn’t it? Then why would you turn your back on someone when they need you the most. Ok so you’re afraid or just don’t know how to react around them. Write a note that says your feelings or just send a card that has encouraging words or something funny to cheer them up, text them every once in a while to see how things are going. Just don’t turn your back and run. It wasn’t easy for me to go to the hospital almost every night and see her lying in a bed barely moving with a ventilator in her throat in a coma but I toughed it out because I knew she would come out of it and needed me to help her recover. Jess almost couldn’t do it but he toughed it out and saw her. He even drove to Chicago even though he grew to hate it because we kept getting lost. 
All I have to say is don’t consider yourself someone’s friend if you aren’t willing to go through thick and thin with them because if you can’t then you aren’t a true friend to them.

I just can’t believe that Coco outlived Bear. She’s old but still kicking.

Talk about old school lol. This pic was taken our either freshmen or sophomore year of high school I wanna say sophomore. It is so crazy how different we are now from then. I was obviously SKINNY back then but wore some really BIG glasses. I do remember at least part of that night. Pat was nice enough to go pick up Jess at his then sister-in-law’s house and take us to the dance and then came to drop us back off beacuse obviously we were too young to drive at that time. The dance I don’t really remember much of I just remember that part of it.

Jess hasn’t changed much at all but me I’m much bigger but at least I finally got the glasses right and they aren’t too big on my face.

The crappy thing was I thought there were going to be more people but instead it was in a small room and only lasted about 10 minutes and me and Kacey were the only two “civilans” in the room. So we drove a hour and a half for a 10 minute ceremony go figure lol.

 It’s so hard to believe at one time in my life I was skinny. Also how much we have both grown in all the years we have been together. We may bicker and pick on each other but we still love each other very much. It’s scary to think that out of all our friends we have been together the longest. Hopefully that will continue for a very long time.

Sorry I haven’t written in a while. There really hasn’t been much going on. From the looks of it we still will probably not have much money to get gifts for x mas or I should say I won’t have money to get people gifts for x mas. I got my friend Lil Michelle and her friend Amanda collage pictures online but I have to wait til I can afford to pay for them before I can get them sent to me. I made my mom a calendar. For my brother I was thinking of buying him 2 posters and Jess probably something martial arts but it will have to be pretty cheap. So I guess in a way I did get everyone something so I don’t feel too bad but it still sucks not to get everyone something super nice. Kacey was able to go to this place and get gifts for people. He got something for me, jess, my mom, my brother, Amanda and Lil Shell, Uncle Russ and Aunt Jaime so that’s pretty good. My mom of course spoiled Kacey rotten I swear all together the gifts she got him are probably about 300 bucks. She got him 2 monster trucks that play laser tag with each other, a set of 3 different tracks from Cars, Cars 2 dvd, a 3 drawer lego organizer but she already gave that to him and I think a few things I can’t even remember right now. My mom got me a neck massager and a set of blue dog pjs and she was talking about giving me some money to get something for myself or Jess. Me and my mom got jess a new razor and a wolf wall calendar. So I guess its not going to be too bad of x-mas. 
One of Jess’s uncles called and was wondering if we could go down to their house on the 26th of this month but I told him that Jess usually doesn’t find out his schedule for the next week until Sunday so we might not be able to go because he usually has to work Mondays. Plus we might not have gas to get there and back either. They live like a hour and a half away from us and they were planning on doing it about 5-6 so we wouldn’t be getting home until like 11 or midnight if we stayed for a few hours. Plus we don’t have extra money to get gifts for their weird gift exchange/auction thing they were gonna do and we know Marilyn and them wouldn’t have any money or gifts. 
My birthday looks like its gonna suck as usual. No one has money to even go bowling but I totally understand but it sucks. I just hope at least a few of my friends show up it would be pretty lame if no one did but I know Lil shell will so at least that’s one person besides my mom, Kacey and hopefully Jess if he remembered to request off my birthday.

This one is of my friend Lil Michelle. Her and her friend Amanda came over to do our gift exchange. She is getting so much better and independent. When Lil one is at her house she can go to the bathroom by herself, dress herself and quite a lot of other stuff on HER OWN. She is working on the walking but is doing much better.

This is an interesting picture. I originally had Amanda take it because of me but when I put it on the computer I noticed something else. Lil Michelle was standing all by herself fixing her pants so she kinda became the center of that photo because it was only me, Amanda, Lil Shell and my son there at the time and obviously my son can’t hold up lil one and Amanda was more in the middle of the room taking the pic of me. Lil shell is definitely on her way.

 A very cute picture of my cat Lily playing with one of her toys. I thought this was especially cute because the way she was playing with it. It is very rare that I catch her playing with them. She is a super lovey cat. Today I was calling for my cat Squeaker and she heard me and started meowing at me. I think she was mad that I woke her up from her nap lol.

I will not run through the house with a condom wrapper in my mouth, especially when my human’s grandmother is over. 
My human will never let me eat her pet rat, and I am at peace with that.
I will not leap into my human’s chair which she has temporarily vacated, and then bite my human on the bum when she sits back down.
I will not puff my entire body to twice its size for no reason after my human has finished watching a horror movie.
I will not sniff at my male human’s feet after he takes his shoes off, freeze my mouth open in disgust and then sniff my private parts to compare odors. My female human might find it amusing, but my male human does not appreciate it, especially in front of company.
I will not slurp fish food from the surface of the aquarium.
I must not help myself to Q-tips, and I must certainly not proceed to stuff them down the sink’s drain.
I will not bite my human on the rear while she is sitting on the Big White Drinking Bowl.
I will not eat large numbers of assorted bugs, then come home and puke them up so my humans can see that I’m getting plenty of roughage.
I will not lean way over to drink out of the tub, fall in, and then pelt right for the box of clumping cat litter. (It took FOREVER to get the stuff out of my fur. )
I will not stand on the bathroom counter, stare down the hall, and growl at NOTHING after my human has finished watching The X-Files.
When my human is taking a bubble bath, the two pinkish-brown things sticking up out of the bubbles in her chest region are NOT to be played with!
I will not fish out my human’s partial plate from the glass so that the dog can “wear” it and pretend to be my human. (It is somewhat unnerving to wake up, roll over in bed, and see the dog grinning at you with your own teeth.
I will not use the bathtub to store live mice for late-night snacks.
I will not drag dirty socks up from the hamper in the middle of the night, deposit them on the bed and yell at the top of my lungs (Bengal LOUD yowling) so that my human can admire my “kill.”
I will not knead my male human’s groin at 2 a.m. with claws extended. It seems to cause him some discomfort and he wakes up all grumpy.
I will not perch on my human’s chest in the middle of the night and stare into her eyes until she wakes up.
I will not play Herd of Thundering Wildebeests Stampeding Across the Plains of the Serengeti over my humans’ bed while they’re trying to sleep.
Screaming at the can of food will not make it open itself.
I am a (neutered) cat, not a peacock, and prancing around with my tail fluffed up will not make my balls grow back.
I cannot leap through closed windows to catch birds outside. If I forget this and bonk my head on the window and fall behind the couch in my attempt, I will not get up and do the same thing again.
I will not assume the patio door is open when I race outside to chase leaves.
I will not back up off the front porch and fall into the bushes just as my human is explaining to his girlfriend how graceful I am.
I will not complain that my butt is wet and that I am thirsty after sitting in my water bowl.
I will not intrude on my human’s candlelit bubble bath and singe my butt off.
I will not stick my paw into any container to see if there is something in it. If I do, I will not hiss and scratch when my human has to shave me to get the rubber cement out of my fur.
If I bite the cactus, it will bite back.
It is not a good idea to try to lap up the powdered creamer before it dissolves in boiling coffee.
Just because I hear voices in my head, I do not have to answer them.
When I am chasing my tail and catch my back leg instead, I will not bite own on my foot. This hurts, and my scream scares my human.
When it rains, it will be raining on all sides of the house. It is not necessary to have my human open every door so I can check.
Birds do not come from the bird feeder. I will not knock it down and try to open it up to get the birds out.
I will not stuff my rather large self into the rather small bird feeder (with my tail hanging out one side) and expect the birds to just fly in.
I will not teach the parrot to meow in a loud and raucous manner.
The dog can see me coming when I stalk her. She can see me and will move out of the way when I pounce, letting me smash into floors and walls. That does not mean I should take it as a personal insult when my humans sit there and laugh.
Yes, there are still two very large dogs in the backyard. There have been for several years. I don’t have to act as if I’ve just discovered the Demon Horror of the Universe each time one of them appears in my window.
I will not play “dead cat on the stairs” while people are trying to bring in groceries or laundry, or else one of these days, it will really come true.
When the humans play darts, I will not leap into the air and attempt to catch them.
I will cease my obsession with the box my humans keep their condoms in This box is not for me. I will not knock it on the ground, I will not sit on it, I will not try to scratch it open. Especially when my humans are using the condoms.
I will not swat my human’s head repeatedly when she’s on the family room floor trying to do sit ups.
When my human is typing at the computer, her forearms are *not* a hammock.
Computer and TV screens do not exist to back light my lovely tail.
I am a walking static generator. My human doesn’t need my help installing a new board in her computer.
I will not bring the city police to the front door by stepping on the speaker phone button and then the automatic 911 dial button.
I will not speed dial the overseas numbers.
Any critter that lives in the house (hamsters) stay in the house and any wild critters (frogs and earthworms) stay outside. I am not allowed to set the hamster free in exchange for finding a frog to put in the fish tank.
I will not stalk the deer in the apple orchard next door. They have sharp hooves and could hurt me if they weren’t laughing so hard.
I will not watch the guinea pig constantly as the guinea pig likes to sleep once in a while.
The goldfish likes living in water and should be allowed to remain in its bowl.
I will not put a live vole in my food bowl and expect it to stay there until I get hungry.
I will not eat spider plants and hallucinate behind the toilet.
I will not drag the magnets (and the papers they are holding up) off of the refrigerator and then bat them underneath it so that they adhere to the underside.
I will learn to relax at the vet’s office so they will start writing things in my records like “Good Kitty” and “Sweet Kitty” instead of the stuff that’s there now like “MEAN!!”, “BITER!!!”, and “GET HELP!!!!!”
I promise I will meditate more closely upon the causal relationship between going dumpster diving on Sunday afternoon and projectile vomiting Monday, and being brought to the Evil Place Where They Stick Things Up My Butt on Tuesday evening. I realize that if I hadn’t done the first, none of the other things would have happened.
I don’t need to check my male human’saim in the bathroom.
I will not bat at my male human’s family jewels while he is engaged in the act of mating with my female human, no matter how tempting the danglies are. My humans get mad and I might get free flying lessons.
I will not be miffed at my human all day and then kiss her on the nose at 2:00 a.m. to tell her that she is forgiven and can now pet me.
I will not scratch the children of lawyers, no matter how much they chase me or how hard they pull my tail.
If I must give a present to my human’s overnight guests, my toy mouse is much more socially acceptable than a live cockroach, even if it isn’t as tasty.
I will not soak my catnip toy in the water bowl to make tea. I will not get high and sit there drinking my tea and kneading the floor afterwards. I will not then get delusions of grandeur and make tea in the toilet bowl or the tub. And I will not try to make tea with used socks, dirty panties or hair scrunches when my humans take the catnip toy away from me.
After my (female) human has enjoyed the company of a larger, but equally gorgeous, hairy animal, I will not leap onto the bed, smell where he’s been, and then jealously pee there to eradicate his traces.
A warm pepperoni pizza is not a good place for a nap.

Please ignore my wild looking hair and my fatness. I picked this pic because of the bumper sticker that Lil Michelle gave me. It says”I got a perfect body but it’s in the trunk and beginning to smell.” I love this one. I actually had it on my first car which was a saturn. I miss that car but just wish it had less problems than it did.

I went bowling for my b day and only 3 people besides my family showed up. I think next year I’m not gonna do crap because it doesn’t seem worth it anymore. Why even bother? I’m very grateful for the people that did come and I understand some people couldn’t come because of other things going on but the biggest thing that peeves me off is people who say they are going to come and then don’t even bother to let me know something came up. We did have fun with the people that did go. Then after Lil One was done with therapy we went out to eat at Noodles N Company and I got a wii game called Sing 4. It’s actually a pretty cool game. Me, Kacey and Lil shell went over to my friend Ginny’s house and played my game. So in all it wasn’t a horrible birthday but I don’t think I’m gonna do anything super special next year.

This is my plea to all my partying friends who like to drink. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE do not drink and drive.
There is many different ways you can drink and have fun but can get home safely. I will list some at the end of my note. I personally
know what it is like to have a friend or family member almost die because of someone else’s irresponsible choice to drink and drive.
Most of you that know me closely know about Michelle Morin or “Lil Michelle.” On July 30,2010 her and her friend/co-worker were driving to
a McDonald’s not far from Amanda’s house in Pecatonica. A drunk driver ran a stop sign on a side road and hit her Jeep Cherokee with so much force it caused
them to flip numerous times and both vehicles ended in a field on the side of the road. The accident occurred at 120 in the morning and Michelle 
and Amanda weren’t found until 420 in the morning. If Amanda hadn’t woken up and hit redial on her phone getting a hold of her husband Michelle might be DEAD.
Michelle was in a coma for 47 fighting for her life. I can tell you nothing is more horrible than going into a hospital room to see your loved one with tubes pretty much
coming out of EVERYWHERE. For her she had a ICP monitor coming out of her head, another monitor in her head to monitor CSF fluid, a ventilator to help her breathe, IVs in her arms,
a catheter to help her pee, a blood pressure cuff on her arm, restraints on her arms so she couldn’t try to pull out the ventilator, these weird boots on her legs. Once she did come out of the coma 
at RIC then came the hard part of trying to relearn almost everything from talking to eating and swallowing to walking. Now please tell me is it worth for one night of fun and drinking. Michelle and Amanda
were minding their business. Is the cost really worth it? The person that hit Michelle and Amanda now has court costs,attorney fees, Michelle and Amanda’s medical bills, the costs of the vehicle they totalled, criminal charges.Michelle’s
medical bills are up to about 360,000 dollars. So please be responsible in your choices.
Here are some numbers for places that offer rides
Tipsy Tow-offered by AAA (you don’t have to be a member) 6p-6a on New Year’s eve and night for free 1 800 222 4357
Designated Drivers of IL- you can drive your car to the bar or wherever and they can drive you home in your vehicle this one costs 855-384 7867
 checker cab 815-961-8888
Action taxi 962-5511
***I want everyone to have a great new years and not have to go thru what Michelle, her family,her friends and all the other families and friends of people who were KILLED by drunk drivers have gone through because of ONE person’s selfish and irresponsible
choice to drink and drive. If you know you are going to get drunk arrange plans ahead of time.

323,https://www.opendiary.com/m/torturedsoul_1/finally-something-to-actually-update-about-5150357/,2012-01-16,finally something to actually update about,"
I really haven’t had anything to update about which goes to show how boring my life really is and why no one really gives a crap what I write about. Jess wants to do a “going away” party before he leaves for basic training which is going to be around the 20th of February. He’s going to be going to Texas for basic so it’s not too bad. It seems like bad crap is happening to us lately. My van window had issues a while ago and we thought we got it fixed for a while but I guess that while was up a few days ago. So now we only have one vehicle so that is making things tough because I’m not driving a vehicle with no window when it’s freezing cold, raining, windy, or snowing. Then my LINK card or SNAP or whatever it’s called never got activated for this month so we are barely scraping by. I called last week and they told me they would e-mail whoever about the application but there is still nothing so I’m going to be calling them tomorrow and find out if maybe we could get emergency assistance or something because I can’t go to the food pantries because they are open only when I’m working. Another disappointing thing is we ordered photos from wal-mart in November. I had checked in the middle of December to see if they were in yet and they told me they would call me when they came in and no call so I went in to check about them and they basically said they had already been delivered a while ago and I’m guessing they throw them away after a month or something so they had to reorder them but they were at least nice enough to add like 5 more greeting cards, a collage and if I remember correctly a 25 gift card to use for future pictures. The bad thing is the uncles gave Kacey x mas gifts and so did jaime and russ and I wanted to send thank you cards but I might as well wait til I send the greeting cards out to save stamps. I get to break the news about the wedding and the army to the family so things should get interesting. Work hasn’t been too bad except today was a diaster. Most of the other work related issues was because of the girl I work with and her talking too much and not doing what she was supposed to be doing. Today part of my problem was I was concentrating too hard on the task I was doing so I kinda zoned out my boss so she got mad that I had to ask her things again. I’m really confused about why they haven’t fired the other girl. She isn’t even a regular worker and they keep giving her chances to stay. When I first came to Nelson I was told I was going to be replacing her but she was given another chance and then last week I was told she was going to be fired but a worker from another school quit so they kept her because I guess one of the workers from the other school they were gonna send to Nelson to work with me. The girl is nice but she just doesn’t listen. So that’s my interesting update.

Hmm let’s see what do I have to talk about. The chick that was working with me got put at another school so now it’s just me and the coordinator lady. She has her good moments but sometimes she’s kinda bitchy or tells me one thing and then turns around and says something totally different. I just do what I’m supposed to do and try to get through the day. Today was an interesting day I came in and there was no power in the kitchen or the gym and a few classrooms on the other floors were without power too. So instead of the cheeseburgers we were supposed to have we ended up having to dethaw 4 hundred and something uncrustables which are peanut butter and jelly sandwiches so we had pb&j sandwiches EVERYWHERE. By the time lunch was started the power was back on but it was too late to bring the hamburgers so the kids had to have pb&j sandwiches. I have a crapload of kids asking me every day if there is pb&j sandwiches but when they actually have them they complain. 
Jess is leaving for basic training on February 20th. He will be at Fort Sill in Oklahoma and then on to Arkansas for some more training. He will be a truck driver. We are having a going away party for him on the 18th but it doesn’t look like many people are gonna show but that’s not a huge shocker for us. I love how people say they will come and then don’t bother showing up. Jess’s dad said he couldn’t come and his mom and them said they might not be able to come but at least one of his uncles said they were gonna come. 
Now I work as a breakfast aide too at Kacey’s school. It’s only for an hour and all I do is hold open the door for the kids to either go outside or come into the gym to eat breakfast. It’s not horribly bad though. Other than that not much else to be really excited about.

In two days is when my husband leaves for basic training for the army reserve. He took vacation with his job this past week so we have been trying to spend as much time together as we can. He felt bad because he couldn’t really do anything for our anniversary because he was trying to make sure we had enough money to do his going-away party which was yesterday. I didn’t mind too much. He did end up getting me a corsage which I didn’t have anywhere to wear it to but I did get a pic of it which I will try to post soon. I think he’s afraid that I’m gonna not pay the bills and go crazy with his checks but I have no intention of doing that. He is supposed to be getting a 2,000 bonus for signing up so if he gets that with his first check along with his regular pay I’m gonna try to use most of that to get caught up on bills and try to get ahead if possible. He will only be getting paid the first and the 15th so I have to manage things just right. I think I can do that. I also have to collect the money from his martial arts school students and deposit it into the bank. 
It’s gonna be so weird without him here for 4 months. I know I’m gonna miss him quite a  lot and probably feel a lot more lonely without him here. I don’t have a lot of people to hang out with. My friend Ginny used to come over once or twice a week to play karaokee games with me but lately she’s been hanging out with her friend Mandy. My suspicion is that she was offended by a comment I made regarding her smoking. It wasn’t anything horribly bad I just said it was hard for us to go to her house because the smoke caused our eyes to burn and water and I get a bad headache from it. Mandy smokes too so I think that’s why Ginny has been hanging out with her quite a bit more than us. She  did come to Jess’s party yesterday and Ginny said her husband Steve wanted to come over tomorrow to say bye before Jess left so hopefully they will stay and hang out for a while if not oh well. Lil Michelle comes over on the weekends because during the week is pretty hectic for her with therapy. 
So it pretty much seems like it will be just me and Kacey. Its pretty depressing once I start thinking about it. No one to go out and do anything with and probably no one will come over here and visit us. The good thing is Jess’s going away party was quite a success. Ginny and her hubby came, Ginny’s friend Mandy and her husband came, Jess’s co-workers Ryan and Mike came, my mom and brother, lil one and amanda and amanda’s husband, one of Jess’s martial art school students, his uncle Ken and aunt alice and mark and cheryl. Big shocker his mom couldn’t make it but it was because Shawn had a blood clot and was in the hospital and his dad couldn’t come either and neither could his brother Russ. I will be posting pics from the party hopefully soon.

GOD BLESS THE BROKEN ROAD-RASCAL FLATTS
*I picked this song because it is how I feel about my now husband. 
I set out on a narrow way many years ago
 Hoping I would find true love along the broken road
 But I got lost a time or two
 Wiped my brow and kept pushing through
 I couldn’t see how every sign pointed straight to you
[Chorus:]
 Every long lost dream led me to where you are
 Others who broke my heart they were like Northern stars
 Pointing me on my way into your loving arms
 This much I know is true
 That God blessed the broken road
 That led me straight to you
I think about the years I spent just passing through
 I’d like to have the time I lost and give it back to you
 But you just smile and take my hand
 You’ve been there you understand
 It’s all part of a grander plan that is coming true
[Chorus]
Now I’m just rolling home
 Into my lover’s arms
 This much I know is true
 That God blessed the broken road
 That led me straight to you
That God blessed the broken road
 That led me straight to you

I’ll have you back before he even get home;
before anybody see.
[girl] 
I can’t. (Aww c’mon!) He ain’t gon’ let me.
[2Pac] 
Pleeeeeease…
[girl] 
Nah.
[2Pac] 
Oh aight. What’s wrong with your eye?
Why you got on glasses?
[Verse One: 2Pac]
Ever since I met ya I could beat depression
It’s like your man don’t understand, all he does is stress ya
I can see your state of misery from the introduction
Ain’t bout no suckin and touchin, just harmless discussion
Maybe we can see a better way, find a brighter day
Late night phone conversations — would that be OK?
I don’t wanna take up all your time, be the next in line
Tell me your size, let me find you things with you in mind
I can see you’re cautious and I’m careful not to scare you
But anticipation of love makin 
got you shakin when I’m standin near you
News of precision will prepare ya
In case you get scared, just ask the man in the mirror
Now the picture’s getten clearer all he does is hit you hard
I tell you to leave, and you tell me keep my faith in God
I don’t understand, I just wanna bring ya home
I wonder should I leave you alone and find a woman of my own
All the homies tell me that you don’t deserve it
I contemplate — but in my heart I know you worth it
Tell me can you get away?
Ebony, can you get away?
C’mon.. let’s go.. can you get away?
Can you get away?
[girl] 
So much pressure in the air
[2Pac] 
I know, I know
[girl] 
And I can’t get away
[2Pac] 
Just for a little while love
[girl] 
I’m not happy here
[2Pac] 
I know it’s hard but, can you get away?
[girl] 
So much pressure in the air
[2Pac] 
Let’s go man, get up outta there
.. can you get away?
[girl] 
And I can’t get away
[2Pac] 
Do you love him?
[girl] 
I’m not happy here
[2Pac] 
Do you love that man?
[Verse Two: 2Pac]
Could it be my destiny to be lonely?
And checkin for these hoochies that be on me cause they phony
But you was different — I got no need to be suspicious
Cause I can tell — my life with you would be delicious
The way you lick your lips and shake your hips got me addicted
I’m sittin here hoping that we can find some way to kick it
Even though I got your digits gotta struggle to resist it
Slowly advance and miss my chance not to miss it
You blow me kisses
when he ain’t lookin, now your heart’s tooken
My only wish is that you change your mind and he get shook
Wanna take you there but you scared to follow, come see tomorrow
Hoping I can take you through the pain and sorrow
Let you know I care — that someone’s there for your struggle
Depend on me, when you have needs or there’s trouble
I wanna give you happiness and maybe even more
I told you before, no time to waste we can hook up at the store
Can you get away?
[girl] 
So much pressure in the air
[2Pac] 
I know it is
[girl] 
And I can’t get away
[2Pac] 
Yeah you can
[girl] 
I’m not happy here
[2Pac] 
You ain’t happy huh ..can you get away?
[girl] 
So much pressure in the air
[2Pac] 
I know.. is he beatin on you?
[girl] 
And I can’t get away
[2Pac] 
Did he punch you?
[girl] 
I’m not happy here
[2Pac] 
Throwin you around the house?
[Verse Three: 2Pac]
I see you remiscin and I hope you listenin
In the position to pressure and offer competition
Me and you — was meant to be my destiny, no longer lonely
Cause now it’s on for you and me, all I can see
A happy home, that’s my fantasy
But my reality is problems with your man and me
What can I do? Don’t wanna lose you to the sucker
Cause if he touch ya, I got some drama for that busta
Don’t wanna rush ya — but make your mind up fast
Nobody knows — on who controls will it last, before I ask
I hope you see that I’m sincere, and even if you
stay with him today I’m still here
I refuse to give up — cause I believe in what we share
You’re livin in prison and what he’s givin can’t compare
Cause everything I feel for you I wanna let you know
Passion it be yours and I’ll never let you go
Tell me can you get away?
[girl] 
So much pressure in the air
[2Pac] 
Can’t get away.. why?
[girl] 
And I can’t get away
[girl] 
I’m not happy here
[2Pac] 
Let me take you away
All I really know, can you get away?
[girl] 
So much pressure in the air
[2Pac] 
Man..
[girl] 
And I can’t get away
[2Pac] 
Course you can get away
[girl] 
I’m not happy here
[2Pac] 
If you really wanted to get away
you could get away
[Outro: 2Pac]
You ain’t got to go through all this drama and this stress
with this old half a man, yaknowhatI’msayin?
I ain’t tryin to put you in a position
where you gotta give up your lifestyle for everything
you need but now.. he ain’t even takin care of you
He beatin on you and shit; look how you look
She motherfuckin wanna be with that nigga, yaknowhatI’msayin?
Shake that sucker to the left
Let me show you what this life is really about
YaknowhatI’msayin? You need to be on first class
Need to be goin to Hawaii, seein the world
Seein what this world got to offer you
Not goin to, yaknowhatI’msayin?
The emergency room, gettin stitches
cause this nigga done got jealous
Don’t cry, it’s all good
[girl] 
Can you take me from here?
[2Pac] 
Shake that man, get away
[girl] 
Can you take me from here?
I’ahhhhhm unhappy here
And I need you to show me love
Because it’s so much pressure now
And I neeeeed to get awayyyheyyyeahhh

I like this song because it reminds me of what I would for my friends or family no matter what the situation.
I won’t let you go-Rascal Flatts
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJqgxynZyH0-link to the song
It’s like a storm 
That cuts a path 
It breaks your will 
It feels like that 
You think you’re lost
But you’re not lost on your own, 
You’re not alone 
I will stand by you,
I will help you through
When you’ve done all you can do
and you can’t cope
I will dry your eyes,
I will fight your fight
I will hold you tight 
and I won’t let go
It hurts my heart to see you cry
I know its dark this part of life
Oh it find us all and we’re to small
to stop the rain
Oh but when it rains
I will stand by you,
I will help you through
When you’ve done all you can do
and you can’t cope
I will dry your eyes,
I will fight your fight
I will hold you tight
and I won’t let you fall
Don’t be afraid to fall
I’m right here to catch you
I won’t let you down
It won’t get you down 
You’re gonna make it
I know you can make it
Cause I will stand by you,
I will help you through
When you’ve done all you can do
and you can’t cope
I will dry your eyes,
I will fight your fight
I will hold you tight
and I won’t let go
Oh I’m gonna hold you
and I won’t let go
Won’t let you go
No I won’t

I like this song because it has a sad message but a good one about child abuse.
Concrete Angel-http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtNYA4pAGjI&ob=av2e
She walks to school with the lunch she packed
Nobody knows what she’s holdin’ back
Wearin’ the same dress she wore yesterday
She hides the bruises with linen and lace
The teacher wonders but she doesn’t ask
It’s hard to see the pain behind the mask
Bearing the burden of a secret storm
Sometimes she wishes she was never born
Through the wind and the rain
She stands hard as a stone
In a world that she can’t rise above
But her dreams give her wings
And she flies to a place where she’s loved
Concrete angel
Somebody cries in the middle of the night
The neighbors hear, but they turn out the lights
A fragile soul caught in the hands of fate
When morning comes it’ll be too late
Through the wind and the rain
She stands hard as a stone
In a world that she can’t rise above
But her dreams give her wings
And she flies to a place where she’s loved
Concrete angel
A statue stands in a shaded place
An angel girl with an upturned face
A name is written on a polished rock
A broken heart that the world forgot
Through the wind and the rain
She stands hard as a stone
In a world that she can’t rise above
But her dreams give her wings
And she flies to a place where she’s loved
Concrete angel

I like this song because I’m blessed by everyone that has come into my life whether good or bad and the things they have done for me or taught me along the way. 
Blessed-martina mcbride=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptkWYhX79N8
I get kissed by the sun each morning
Put my feet on a hardwood floor
I get to hear my children laughing
Down the hall through the bedroom door
Sometimes I sit on my front porch swing
Just soaking up the day
I think to myself, I think to myself
This world is a beautiful place
I have been blessed
And I feel like I’ve found my way
I thank God for all I’ve been given
At the end of every day
I have been blessed
With so much more than I deserve
To be here with the ones that love me
To love them so much it hurts
I have been blessed
Across a crowded room
I know you know what I’m thinking
By the way I look at you
And when we’re lying in the quiet
And no words have to be said
I think to myself, I think to myself
This love is a beautiful gift
I have been blessed
And I feel like I’ve found my way
I thank God for all I’ve been given
At the end of every day
I have been blessed
With so much more than I deserve
To be here with the ones that love me
To love them so much it hurts
I have been blessed
When I’m singing my kids to sleep
When I feel you holding me
I know
I have been blessed
And I feel like I’ve found my way
I thank God for all I’ve been given
At the end of every day
I have been blessed
With so much more than I deserve
To be here with the ones that love me
To love them so much it hurts
I have been blessed

I like this song because its a revenge type song where the girl was being abused but she seeks revenge on him.
Gunpowder and lead-miranda lambert=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyGAvulgWmw
County Road 233 under my feet
Nothin’ on this white rock but little ol’ me
I got two miles till he makes bail
And if I’m right we’re headed straight for hell
I’m goin’ home, gonna load my shotgun
Wait by the door and light a cigarette
He wants a fight well now he’s got one
He ain’t seen me crazy yet
Slapped my face and he shook me like a rag doll
Don’t that sound like a real man
I’m gonna show him what a little girl’s made of
Gun powder and lead
Well it’s half past ten
Another six pack in 
I can feel the rumble like the cold black wind
He pulls in the drive
Gravel flies
He don’t know what’s waitin’ here this time
Hey I’m goin’ home, gonna load my shotgun
Wait by the door and light a cigarette
He wants a fight well now he’s got one
And he ain’t seen me crazy yet
Slapped my face and he shook me like a rag doll
Don’t that sound like a real man
I’m gonna show him what a little girl’s made of
Gun powder and lead
His fist is big but my gun’s bigger
He’ll find out when I pull the trigger
I’m goin’ home, gonna load my shotgun
Wait by the door and light a cigarette
He wants a fight well now he’s got one
And he ain’t seen me crazy yet
Slapped my face and he shook me like a rag doll
Don’t that sound like a real man
I’m gonna show him what a little girl’s made of
Gun powder and gun powder and lead

I recently found this song one of my karaokee games and me and Jess fell in love with it especially since it was right before he left for basic training. 
Home-Blake Shelton-http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkoT1nZOexY&ob=av2e
Another summer day
Has come and gone away
In Paris and Rome
But I wanna go home
Mmmmmmmm
Maybe surrounded by
A million people I
Still feel all alone
I wanna go home
Oh, I miss you, you know
And Ive been keeping all the letters that I wrote to you
Each one a line or two
Im fine baby, how are you?
I would send them but I know that its just not enough
My words were cold and flat
And you deserve more than that
Another airplane
Another sunny place
Im lucky I know
But I wanna go home
Ive got to go home
Let me go home
Im just too far from where you are
I wanna come home
And I feel just like Im living someone elses life
Its like I just stepped outside
When everything was going right
And I know just why you could not
Come along with me
This was not your dream
But you always believed in me
Another winter day has come
And gone away
In even Paris and Rome
And I wanna go home
Let me go home
And Im surrounded by
A million people I
Still feel alone
And I wanna go home
Oh, I miss you, you know
Let me go home
Ive had my run
Baby, Im done
I’m coming back home
Let me go home
It’ll all be all right
Ill be home tonight
Im coming back home

I like this song because it’s another interesting song about breaking up.
Lucky 4 u(tonight I’m just me)-shedaisy=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46Vu6Z5xgYg&ob=av2e
You always said that I have multiple personalities
I bounce around somewhere between my dreams and reality
So where’d you dig up the audacity to ask me
How we’ve all been doing
Since you broke our hearts
(Well, so far)
Number 5 just cries a river a minute
7 wants to tie you up and drown you in it
Yeah, 14 just wants to say so long, bygones
32 wants to do things to you that’ll make you blush
10 would key the El Camino that you love so much
And there ain’t nobody wants to mess with 23
Oh, lucky 4 you tonight I’m just me
I guess this party’s more than your new Barbie bargained for
She’s got you by the sleeve, slowly easing towards the door
She’s probably right, you should be movin’ on
Don’t know how long we can behave
Better have the valet get your car
(‘Cause you know how women are)
Number 5 just cries a river a minute
7 wants to tie you up and drown you in it
Yeah, 14 just wants to say so long, bygones
32 wants to do things to you that’ll make you blush
10 would key the El Camino that you love so much
And there ain’t nobody wants to mess with 23
Oh, lucky 4 you tonight I’m just me
Forgiveness is the key
According to my shrink
But, it’s not just up to me
(I don’t know girls, what d’ya think?)
Number 5 just cries a river a minute
7 wants to tie you up and drown you in it
Yeah, 14 just wants to say so long, bygones
32 wants to do things to you that’ll make you blush
10 would key the El Camino that you love so much
And there ain’t nobody wants to mess with 23
Oh, lucky 4 you tonight I’m just me

Raise your glass-Pink=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjVNlG5cZyQ
[Verse 1]
Right, right, turn off the lights
We’re gonna lose our minds tonight
What’s the deal, yo?
I love when it’s all too much
5 a.m. turn the radio up
Where’s the rock ‘n roll?
Party crasher, panty snatcher
Call me up if you’re a gangsta
Don’t be fancy, just get dancy
Why so serious?
[Chorus]
So raise your glass if you are wrong
In all the right ways, all my underdogs
We will never be, never be anything but loud
And nitty gritty, dirty little freaks
Won’t you come on and come on and
Raise your glass!
Just come on and come on and
Raise your glass!
[Verse 2]
Slam, slam, oh hot damn
What part of a party don’t you understand?
Wish you’d just freak out
(Freak out already)
Can’t stop, coming in hot
I should be locked up right on the spot
It’s so on right now
(It’s so fucking on right now)
Party crasher, panty snatcher
Call me up if you’re a gangsta
Don’t be fancy, just get dancy
Why so serious?
[Chorus]
So raise your glass if you are wrong
In all the right ways, all my underdogs
We will never be, never be anything but loud
And nitty gritty, dirty little freaks
Won’t you come on and come on and
Raise your glass!
Just come on and come on and
Raise your glass!
Won’t you come on and come on and
Raise your glass!
Just come on and come on and
Raise your glass!
[Bridge]
Oh shit! My glass is empty
That sucks!
So if you’re too school for cool
And you’re treated like a fool
(You’re treated like a fool)
You can choose to let it go
We can always, we can always party on our own
[Chorus]
So raise your (oh, fuck)
So raise your glass if you are wrong
In all the right ways, all my underdogs
We will never be, never be anything but loud
And nitty gritty, dirty little freaks
So raise your glass if you are wrong
In all the right ways, all my underdogs
We will never be, never be anything but loud
And nitty gritty, dirty little freaks
Won’t you come on and come on and
Raise your glass!
Just come on and come on and
Raise your glass!
Won’t you come on and come on and
Raise your glass for me!
Just come on and come on and
Raise your glass for me!

Another awesome Pink song that talks about being perfect no matter what. This song made me think of my friend Lil michelle because she was putting herself down quite a lot since her accident. 
F*ckin perfect-pink=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDlOD1Hw9k&feature=relmfu
Made a wrong turn once or twice
Dug my way out, blood and fire
Bad decisions, that’s alright
Welcome to my silly life
Mistreated, misplaced, misunderstood
Miss ‘No way, it’s all good’
It didn’t slow me down.
Mistaken, always second guessing
Underestimated, look I’m still around
Pretty, pretty please, don’t you ever, ever feel
Like you’re less than fucking perfect
Pretty, pretty please, if you ever, ever feel
Like you’re nothing, you’re fucking perfect to me
You’re so mean when you talk
About yourself. You were wrong.
Change the voices in your head
Make them like you instead.
So complicated,
Look happy, You’ll make it!
Filled with so much hatred
Such a tired game
It’s enough, I’ve done all I could think of
Chased down all my demons
I’ve seen you do the same
(Ohh ohhhhhhh)
Pretty, pretty please, don’t you ever, ever feel
Like you’re less than fucking perfect
Pretty, pretty please, if you ever, ever feel
Like you’re nothing, you’re fucking perfect to me
The whole world’s scared, so I swallow the fear
The only thing I should be drinking is an ice cold beer
So cool in line and we try try try but we try too hard
And it’s a waste of my time.
Done looking for the critics, cause they’re everywhere
They don’t like my jeans, they don’t get my hair
Exchange ourselves and we do it all the time
Why do we do that, why do I do that (why do I do that)?
(Yeah!)
I’m Pretty, pretty, pretty
Pretty, pretty please, don’t you ever, ever feel
Like you’re less than fucking perfect
Pretty, pretty please, if you ever, ever feel
Like you’re nothing, you’re fucking perfect to me
(You’re perfect, you’re perfect)
Pretty, pretty please, don’t you ever, ever feel
Like you’re less than fucking perfect.
Pretty, pretty please, if you ever, ever feel
Like you’re nothing, you are perfect to me.

Like this song by Garth brooks because of the music video related to it. I guess because my brother is mentally handicapped I can relate to it but its a good one either way
standing outside the fire-garth brooks=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdDEi2EaqHM&feature=related
We call them cool
Those hearts that have no scars to show
The ones that never do let go
And risk it the tables being turned
We call them fools
Who have to dance within the flame
Who chance the sorrow and the shame 
That always come with getting burned
But you got to be tough when consumed by desire
‘Cause it’s not enough just to stand outside the fire
We call them strong
Those who can face this world alone
Who seem to get by on their own
Those who will never take the fall
We call them weak
Who are unable to resist
The slightest chance love might exist
And for that forsake it all
They’re so hell bent on giving, walking a wire
Convinced it’s not living if you stand outside the fire
[Chorus:]
Standing outside the fire
Standing outside the fire
Life is not tried it is merely survived
If you’re standing outside the fire
There’s this love that is burning
Deep in my soul
Constantly yearning to get out of control
Wanting to fly higher and higher
I can’t abide standing outside the fire
[Chorus x2]

Another good Garth brooks one about life in general. 
The Dance-garth brooks=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbBDyxLepyU&feature=related
Looking back on the memory of 
The dance we shared beneath the stars above 
For a moment all the world was right 
How could I have known you’d ever say goodbye 
And now I’m glad I didn’t know 
The way it all would end the way it all would go 
Our lives are better left to chance I could have missed the pain 
But I’d of had to miss the dance 
Holding you I held everything 
For a moment wasn’t I the king 
But if I’d only known how the king would fall 
Hey who’s to say you know I might have changed it all 
And now I’m glad I didn’t know 
The way it all would end the way it all would go 
Our lives are better left to chance I could have missed the pain 
But I’d of had to miss the dance 
Yes my life is better left to chance 
I could have missed the pain but I’d of had to miss the dance

This one my friend Lil shell got me hooked on. It pretty describes me pretty well.
I hate my life-theory of a deadman=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfnAOcBirAs&ob=av2e
So sick of the hobos
Always beggin’ for change
I don’t like how I gotta work
And they just sit around and get paid
I hate all of the people
Who can’t drive their cars
***** you better get out of the way
Before I, start falling apart
I hate how my wife
Is always up my ***
She always wants to buy brand new things
But I, don’t have the cash
[Chorus]
Well I hate my job, all of my rich friends
I hate everyone to the bitter end
Nothing turns out right, there’s no end in sight
I hate my life
How come I never get laid?
Nice guys always lose
How could she have another headache?
There’s always some kind of excuse
I still hate my job
My boss is a ****
I don’t get paid nearly enough
To put up with all of his ****
[Chorus]
I hate that I can’t tell
When a girl’s underage
And how when I tell her she’s a nice piece of ***
Then her daddy punches me in the face
So if you’re pissed like me
*****es here’s what you’ve gotta do
Put your middle fingers up in the air
Go on and say “**** you”
[Chorus]
So much at stake
Can’t catch a break
I hate my life
Now there’s nothing new
And it sucks to be you
I ****ing hate my life

I’m a big fan of Eminem and this one is definitely one of my favs. 
Beautiful-eminem=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDGTwcMySIM
Lately I’ve been hard to reach
I’ve been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world
Where they can be alone
Are you calling me, are you trying to get through
Are you reaching out for me, and I’m reaching out for you
I’m just so ****in’ depressed
I just can’t seem to get out this slump
If I could just get over this hump
But I need something to pull me out this dump
I took my bruises, took my lumps
Fell down and I got right back up
But I need that spark to get psyched back up
In order for me to pick that mic back up
I don’t know how or why or when
And I ended up in this position I’m in
I starting to feel distant again
So I decided just to pick this pen
Up and tried to make an attempt to vent
But I just can’t admit
Or come to grips, with the fact that
I may be done with rap
I need a new outlet
I know some shits so hard to swallow
And I just can’t sit back and wallow
In my own sorrow
But I know one fact
I’ll be one tough act to follow
One tough act to follow
Copy
One tough act to follow
Here today, gone tomorrow
But you have to walk a thousand miles
[Chorus]
In my shoes, just to see
What it’d be like, to be me
I’ll be you, let’s trade shoes
Just to see what I’d be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other’s mind
Just to see what we find
Look at **** through each other’s eyes
But don’t let ’em say you ain’t beautiful 
They can all get ****ed. Just stay true to you
Don’t let ’em say you ain’t beautiful 
They can all get ****ed. Just stay true to you
I think I’m starting to lose my sense of humor
Everything is so tense and gloom
I almost feel like I gotta check the temperature in the room
Just as soon as I walk in
It’s like all eyes on me
So I try to avoid any eye contact
Cause if I do that then it opens a door to conversation
Like I want that
I’m not looking for extra attention
I just want to be just like you
Blend in with the rest of the room
Maybe just point me to the closest restroom
I don’t need no ****ing manservant 
Follow me around, and wiping my ***
Laugh at every single joke I crack
And half of ’em ain’t even funny like 
Haha Marshall, you’re so funny man, you should be a comedian, god damn
Unfortunately I am, but I just hide behind the tears of a clown
So why don’t you all sit down
Listen to the tale I’m about to tell
Hell, we don’t have to trade our shoes
And you don’t have to walk no thousand miles
[Chorus]
But don’t let ’em say you ain’t beautiful 
They can all get ****ed. Just stay true to you 
Don’t let ’em say you ain’t beautiful 
They can all get ****ed. Just stay true to you 
Nobody asked for life to deal us
With these bullshit hands we’re dealt
We gotta take these cards ourselves
Flip them, don’t expect no help
Now I could have either just
Sat on my *** and pissed and moaned
But take this situation in which I’m placed in
And get up and get my own
I was never the type of kid
To wait but I know to unpack his bags
Never sat on the porch and hoped and prayed
For a dad to show up who never did
I just wanted to fit in
Every single place
Every school I went
I dreamed of being that cool kid
Even if it meant acting stupid
Aunt Edna always told me
Keep making that face till it gets stuck like that
Meanwhile I’m just standing there
Holding my tongue up trying to talk like this
Till I stuck my tongue on the frozen stop sign pole at eight years old
I learned my lesson and cause I wasn’t tryin to impress my friends no more
But I already told you my whole life story
Not just based on my description
Cause where you see it from where you’re sitting
Is probably a hundred and ten percent different
I guess we would have to walk a mile
In each other’s shoes, at least
What size you where?
I wear tens
Let’s see if you can fit your feet
[Chorus]
But don’t let ’em say you ain’t beautiful 
They can all get ****ed. Just stay true to you 
Don’t let ’em say you ain’t beautiful 
They can all get ****ed. Just stay true to you 
Lately I’ve been hard to reach
I’ve been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world
Where they can be alone 
Are you calling me, are you trying to get through 
Are you reaching out for me, and I’m reaching out for you 
Yea, to my babies. Stay strong. Daddy will be home soon
And to the rest of the world, God gave you the shoes
That fit you, so put em on and wear ’em
And be yourself man, be proud of who you are
Even if it sounds corny,
Don’t ever let no one tell you, you ain’t beautiful

This song is very much up my alley and talks about basically how our kids are a reflection of us lol. 
Anything like me-brad paisley=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZazrQYirYLs
I remember sayin’ I don’t care either way
Just as long as he or she is healthy I’m OK
Then the doctor pointed to the corner of the screen
And said “Ya see that thing right there, well you know what that means”
And I started wondering who he was going to be
And I thought heaven help us if he’s anything like me
He’ll probably climb a tree to tall and ride his bike to fast
End up every summer wearin’ something in a cast
He’s gonna throw a ball and break some glass, in a window down the street
He’s gonna get in trouble, he’s gonna get in fights
I’m gonna lose my temper and some sleep
It’s safe to say that I’m gonna get my payback, if he’s anything like me
I can see him right now, knees all skinned up
With a magnifying glass tryin’ to melt a Tonka truck
Won’t he be a sight with his football helmet on
That’ll be his first love til his first love comes along
He’ll get his heart broke by the time he’s in his teens
And heaven help him if he’s anything like me
He’ll probably stay out to late and drive his car too fast
Get a speeding ticket he’ll pay for mowing grass
He’s gonna get caught skippin’ class and be grounded for a week
He’s gonna get in trouble, we’re gonna get in fights
I’m gonna lose my temper and some sleep
It’s safe to say that I’m gonna get my payback, if he’s anything like me
He,s gonna love me and hate me along the way
Years are gonna fly by, I already dread the day
He’s gonna hug his momma, he’s gonna shake my hand
He’s gonna act like he can’t wait to leave
But as he drives out, he’ll cry his eyes out
If he’s anything like me 
There’s worse folks to be like
Aw he’ll be alright, if he’s anything like me

I like this song because it was my childhood. I was bullied quite a lot of kids in school and even now I see it as a lunchlady at my son’s school and hear about it all the time on the news. 
mean-taylor swift=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYa1eI1hpDE&ob=av2e
You, with your words like knives 
And swords and weapons that you use against me
You, knock me off my feet again, 
Got me feeling like a nothing
You, with your voice like nails 
On a chalk board, calling me out when I’m wounded
You, picking on the weaker man
Well then
You can take me down 
With just one single blow 
But you don’t know what you don’t know
Someday I’ll be living in a big old city 
And all you’re ever gonna be is mean
Someday I’ll be big enough so you can’t hit me 
And all you’re ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?
You, with your switching sides 
And your wildfire lies and your humiliation
You have pointed out my flaws again 
As if I don’t already see them
I walk with my head down, 
Try to block you out ’cause I never impress you
I just want to feel okay again
I bet you got pushed around
Somebody made you cold but the cycle ends right now 
‘Cause you can’t lead me down that road 
And you don’t know what you don’t know
Someday I’ll be living in a big old city 
And all you’re ever gonna be is mean
Someday I’ll be big enough so you can’t hit me 
And all you’re ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?
And I can see you years from now in a bar
Talking over a football game 
With that same big loud opinion
But nobody’s listening, washed up and ranting 
About the same old bitter things
Drunk and rumbling on about how I can’t sing 
But all you are is mean
All you are is mean and a liar and pathetic
And alone in life and mean, and mean, and mean, and mean
But someday I’ll be living in a big old city 
And all you’re ever gonna be is mean
Yeah someday I’ll be big enough 
So you can’t hurt me 
And all you’re ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so (mean)
Someday I’ll be living in a big old city
(Why you gotta be so mean)
And all you’re ever gonna be is mean
(Why you gotta be so mean)
Someday I’ll be big enough so you can’t hit me
(Why you gotta be so mean)
And all you’re ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?

I like this song because it brings up a good point about this being our temporary home.
temporary home-carrie underwood=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LraOiHUltak&ob=av2n
Little boy, six years old
A little too used to bein’ alone
Another new mom and dad, another school
Another house that’ll never be home
When people ask him how he likes this place
He looks up and says with a smile upon his face
“This is my temporary home
It’s not where I belong
Windows in rooms that I’m passin’ through
This is just a stop, on the way to where I’m going
I’m not afraid because I know this is my
Temporary home.”
Young mom on her own
She needs a little help got nowhere to go
She’s lookin’ for a job, lookin’ for a way out
‘Cause a half-way house will never be a home
At night she whispers to her baby girl
Someday we’ll find a place here in this world
“This is our temporary home
It’s not where we belong
Windows in rooms that we’re passin’ through
This is just a stop, on the way to where we’re going
I’m not afraid because I know this is our
Temporary Home.”
Old man, hospital bed
The room is filled with people he loves
And whispers don’t cry for me
I’ll see you all someday
He looks up and says “I can see God’s face”
“This is my temporary Home
It’s not where I belong
Windows in rooms that I’m passin’ through
This was just a stop, on the way To where I’m going
I’m not afraid because I know this was
My temporary home.”

I like this song because it’s a sad one but with a cool ending to it.
teddy bear-red sovine=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zoTLwrm9QE
I was on the outskirts of a little southern town
Tryin’ to reach my destination before the sun went down
The old CB was blarin’ away on channel 1-9!
When there came a little boy’s voice on the radio line
And he said: “Breaker 1-9! Is anyone there?
ome on back, truckers and talk to Teddy Bear!”
Well, I keyed the mike and said: “You got it, Teddy Bear!”
And a little boy’s voice came back on the air
“‘Preciate the break, Who we got on that end?”
I told him my handle, and, then he began:
“Now, I’m not supposed to bother you fellows out there
Mom says you’re busy and for me to stay off the air
But you see, I get lonely and it helps to talk
‘Cause that’s about all I can do, I’m crippled, and, I can’t walk!”
I came back and told him to fire up that mike
And I’d talk to him, as long as he liked
“This was my dad’s radio”, the little boy said
“But I guess it’s mine and mom’s now, ’cause my daddy’s dead!”
“Dad had a wreck about a month ago
He was trying to get home in a blindin’ snow
Mom has to work now, to make ends meet
And I’m not much help, with my two crippled feet!”
“She says not to worry that we’ll make it alright
But, I hear her crying, sometimes late at night
You know there’s just one thing I want more than anything else to see
Aw, I know you guys are too busy to bother with me!”
“But, you see, my dad used to take me for rides when he was home
But, I guess that’s all over now, since my daddy’s gone
Not one breaker came on the old CB
As that little crippled boy talked with me
I tried hard to swallow a lump that just wouldn’t stay down
As I thought about my boy back in Greenville Town
“Dad was going to take mom and me with him later on this year, Why,
l remember ‘I’m saying: ‘Someday this old truck will be yours, Teddy Bear!’
But, I know I’ll never get to ride an 18-wheeler again
But, this old base will keep me in touch with all my trucker friends!”
“Teddy Bear’s gonna back on out now and leave you alone
‘Cause it’s about time for mom to come home
But, you give me a shout when you’re passin’ through
And I’ll sure be happy to come back to you!”
Well, I came back and I said: uh! “Before you go 10-10
What’s your home 20, little CB friend?”
Well, he gave me his address and I didn’t once hesitate
‘Cause this hot load of freight was just gonna have to wait
I turned that truck around on a dime
And headed straight for Jackson Street, 229
And as I rounded the corner, oh, I got one heck of a shock
late wheelers were lined up for three city blocks!
Why, I guess every driver for miles around had caught Teddy Bear’s call
And that little crippled boy was having a ball
For as fast as one driver would carry him in
Another would carry him to his truck and take off again
Well, you better believe I took my turn at riding Teddy Bear
And then I carried him back in and put him down in his chair
And buddy if I never live to see happiness again
I want you to know I saw it that day, in the face of that little man
We took up a collection for him before his mama got home
And each driver said goodbye and then they all were gone
He shook my hand with a mile-long grin
And said: “So long, trucker I’ll catch ya again!”
Well, I hit the Interstate with tears in my eyes
I turned on the radio and I got another surprise
“Breaker 1-9!” Came a voice on the air
“Just one word of thanks from Mama Teddy Bear!”
“We wish each and every one, a special prayer for you
‘Cause, You just made my little boy’s dream come true
I’ll sign off now, before, I start to cry
May God ride with you, 10-4, and goodbye.”

This song is me and Jess. I don’t know how else to describe it.
baby-ashanti=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7P1GQGvD98
I don’t remember feeling like this
Baby, baby I love you, baby, baby I love you.
I got this jones forming in my bones (from a man)
Who indeed took over my soul, (understand)
I couldn’t breathe if he ever said (he would leave),
Get on my knees till they bloody red, (baby please)
See I don’t know if you get it yet, (just don’t know)
He’s like the lighter to my cigarette,
(Watch me smoke), I never knew another human life
(Didn’t know) can have the power to take over mine,
So baby baby.
[Chorus]
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby,(baby I love you) baby,
Baby,baby baby,baby, I love it when I hear
Ya name, got me sayin’ baby, baby, baby,
Baby, baby,(baby I love you) baby, baby, baby, baby, baby.
See, I could never feel alone with you (in my life),
I gave up everything I own for you (won’t
Think twice), almost a shame how I’m mesmerized (such a shame),
I loose my thought looking in your eyes (I know why)
Because your kisses make my lips quiver and (that’s real) and when you
Touch me my whole body shivers. (I can feel) now,
I can see how another life(nother life)could
Have the power to take over mine cause your my.
[Chorus: x2]

Baby, I can’t see my worth (I can’t see) living here on
God’s green earth, you don’t know what
You’ve done to me, (done to me) I never thought
I’d need you desperately,(desperately) it’s kind
Of sick how I’m stuck on you(stuck on you)
But I don’t care cause I’m needing you (I’m needing you)
And how I feel will remain the same (remains the same)
‘Cause you’re my baby, (cause your my baby)
Listen and when the world starts to stress me out,
(Where I run) it’s to you boy without
A doubt (you’re the one) who keeps me sane and I can’t complain
(Can’t complain) you’re like a
Drug you relieve my pain (may seem strange)
You’re like the blood flowing through my vain, (oooo)
Keeps me alive and feeding my brain,
(oooo) now this is how another human life (nother life) could
Have the power to take over mine cause your my
[Chorus: x2]

this song is a tad sad but so true. It talks about not laughin at people or making fun of them.
Don’t laugh at me-mark wills=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVjbo8dW9c8&feature=fvsr
I’m a little boy with glasses
The one they call the geek
A little girl who never smiles
‘Cause I’ve got braces on my teeth
And I know how it feels
To cry myself to sleep
I’m that kid on every playground
Who’s always chosen last
A single teenage mother 
Tryin’ to overcome my past
You don’t have to be my friend
But is it too much to ask
Don’t laugh at me
Don’t call me names
Don’t get your pleasure from my pain
In God’s eyes we’re all the same
Someday we’ll all have perfect wings
Don’t laugh at me
I’m the cripple on the corner
You’ve passed me on the street
And I wouldn’t be out here beggin’
If I had enough to eat
And don’t think I don’t notice
That our eyes never meet
I lost my wife and little boy when
Someone crossed that yellow line
The day we laid them in the ground
Is the day I lost my mind
And right now I’m down to holdin’ 
This little cardboard sign, so
Don’t laugh at me
Don’t call me names
Don’t get your pleasure from my pain
In God’s eyes we’re all the same
Someday we’ll all have perfect wings
Don’t laugh at me
I’m fat, I’m thin, I’m short, I’m tall
I’m deaf, I’m blind, hey, aren’t we all
Don’t laugh at me
Don’t call me names
Don’t get your pleasure from my pain
In God’s eyes we’re all the same
Someday we’ll all have perfect wings

This song I originally heard regarding a girl who died from brain cancer in our area. She was only 10 years old. She was very spiritual and she loved hannah montana lol. Since then ive started to listen to it more and more. Even if you don’t like miley cyrus listen to this song.

I can almost see it.
That dream I’m dreaming, but
There’s a voice inside my head saying
You’ll never reach it
Every step I’m takin’
Every move I make
Feels lost with no direction,
My faith is shakin’
But I gotta keep tryin’
Gotta keep my head held high
There’s always gonna be another mountain
I’m always gonna wanna make it move
Always gonna be an uphill battle
Sometimes I’m gonna have to lose
Ain’t about how fast I get there
Ain’t about what’s waitin’ on the other side
It’s the climb
The struggles I’m facing
The chances I’m taking
Sometimes might knock me down, but
No I’m not breaking
I may not know it, but
These are the moments that
I’m gonna remember most
I’ve just gotta keep goin’, and
I gotta be strong
Just keep pushing on, ’cause
There’s always gonna be another mountain
I’m always gonna wanna make it move
Always gonna be an uphill battle
Sometimes I’m gonna have to lose
Ain’t about how fast I get there
Ain’t about what’s waitin’ on the other side

There’s always gonna be another mountain
I’m always gonna wanna make it move
Always gonna be an uphill battle
Sometimes I’m gonna have to lose
Ain’t about how fast I get there
Ain’t about what’s waitin’ on the other side
It’s the climb
Keep on movin’
Keep climbin’
Keep faith baby
It’s all about, it’s all about
The climb
Keep the faith, keep your faith, woa

You were so blind to let me go
You had it all but didn’t know
No one you’ll ever find will be
Closer to all your dreams than me
Believing the grass would be greener
You told yourself “I just don’t need her now”
But I know you’ll soon discover
You’re never satisfied with any other

Someday Oh Someday
One you gave away will be the only one you’re wishing for
Someday hey hey
Boy you’re gonna pay ’cause baby I’m the one who’s keeping score
You’ll change your mind and call my name
Soon as you find they’re all the same
And when you find yourself alone
Don’t come back crying
You should have known
Believe me I’m not pretending
It’s not hard to predict
This ending now
‘Cause I know you’ll soon discover
You’re needing me in spite of all the others

One you gave away will be the only one you’re wishing for
Someday hey hey

That there will ever come a time when you’re cold and lonely
Baby, how could you ever believe
That another could replace me
The one and only
But when your down
In your time of need
And you’re thinking that you
Might be coming back to own me
Just think again ’cause
I won’t need your love anymore!

One you gave away will be the only one you’re wishing for
Someday hey hey
Boy you’re gonna pay ’cause baby I’m the one who’s keeping score

Man this week has been an interesting one that is for sure. Monday I went to a surgical consult about the nodules they found on my thyroid. They want to do a fine needle biopsy to find out if they are cancerous. That is scheduled for next monday . Then Tuesday Jess left for basic training for the army reserve. He will be gone for 4 months all together. I think the worst time for me is at night when I’m about to go to bed but all day I’m thinking about him. Then yesterday I woke up and found out I had pinkeye so that sucked. We also got Kacey’s meds switched because they weren’t doing a thing for him. He has had trouble sleeping for some time now and so the dr decided to put him on a sleep med. Last night I think is the first time in a while he has slept all the way through the night and today at school his behavior seemed much better according to his teacher.
Tonight there is a big snowstorm in our area. It doesn’t look like that much snow has fallen but it’s supposed to snow overnight and tomorrow morning so we’ll see how it goes. So yea that is my crazy week so far. Hoping the weekend goes much more better. Saturday I have bowling and my mom was talking about taking Kacey to get some new socks and maybe underwear we’ll see what she says. 
Jess’s first check isn’t until the 1st but he told me that he should be getting a 2,000 bonus which I hope happens because I plan to catch up on bills and try to pay some ahead of time so I won’t have to worry about them. He gets paid the first of the month and the 15th and I get paid every 2 weeks so hopefully his checks are good sized so we can get ahead on bills. I know Im gonna disconnect Verizon when his 2,000 check comes in. I lost 7 lbs so far and I think most of its been from eating better because I honestly haven’t been working out too much except if you count working.

I’ve realized something very interesting since Jess has been gone. I’ve realized how alone I really am. My friend Ginny has seemed to distance herself from me before Jess even left. I honestly think she was offended about a comment I made  about not being able to go over to her house because she’s a heavy smoker and being in her house made my eyes burn and I had a headache so lately she has been spending time with her friend Mandy who also smokes. No one has even asked me how I’m doing except maybe one or two people I barely talk to. The big comment I hear is “you must miss him.” I understand people have lives and they can’t talk to me or hang out with me ALL the time but I would just love for someone to stop by and hang out with me for a lil bit or offer to do something or even just text and say hey wuz up but no one has. 
If I knew their husband or bf was away I would check in with them and see how they are doing. I posted on FB about having a biopsy on my thyroid to see if I have cancer and not ONE single person said ANYTHING about it. I’m not a big attention whore or anything like that but I was expecting someone to say I’m sorry to hear or something like that but NOTHING. I was actually tempted to delete this diary and my fb. No one would give a shit and no one even reads my diary anyway. Why waste my time and everyone else’s with boring bullshit that no one cares about. I guess I’m just in a depressed mood about the GREAT friends I have and how no one gives a shit about me.

Today was a great start to my week. First I had to call in to work because I had the shits and didn’t know if it was just something I ate or if I had the stupid stomach flu that has been going around in our area. I drank some gatorade, ate a banana and a whole bag of saltines and didn’t have to crap after that so I think it was just something I ate. Hopefully tomorrow it won’t be a repeat. I felt bad enough about having to call in today because we are low on subs to fill in. Then today I had to go for my thyroid biopsy to see if I might have cancer in it. There are 3 nodules on the left side of my thyroid gland so they took a biopsy from 2 of them. There is also a cyst on my right side but they aren’t too worried about that one. I have to go back in a week to get the results. 
Well better get to bed.

362,https://www.opendiary.com/m/torturedsoul_1/craptular-week-5150397/,2012-03-02,craptular week,"
Well this past week was crappy just like the week before. I found out on Sunday that Jess was going to basic finally and that he can’t call us for a month pretty much. Also came to find out that his check wasn’t coming until the 15th so all we had to survive on for 2 weeks was my check which was only like 279. I paid my car insurance which was 97.10, I paid off the vet bill for when Buck hurt himself and the vet hospital was nice enough to let us do payments which was 89.00, I had to get a few household items including dog and cat food so that was about 50 all together maybe a lil bit more and I paid off the rest of my t-mobile bill which was 17.98. So hopefully I have a lil extra in my account I even transferred like 30 bucks over from our saving account just in case. The good thing is when Jess’s check does come he’s supposed to have a 2,000 dollar bonus on top of his check and I luckily get paid the next day. 
The crappy thing is I owe our landlord like 3 months worth of rent which is 350 each so that brings it up to 1,050. Then the Buick had the ORIGINAL manufacturer tires on it so I have to get 4 all new tires on it which is like 460 through just tires but I’m gonna see if I can find a cheaper deal somewhere so hopefully that will be cheaper but I doubt it. I was also hoping to put a lot of money down on my electric and gas bills because they are quite high and finally pay my early termination fee for verizon and the bill. So pretty much after I get all that paid I don’t think I will have much left for anything else. I was hoping to buy some shelves that can go on your doors to get rid of some of the furniture I have. There was one for dvds/vhs and another for canned goods and one for just misc stuff. So we will have to see what we can do. I was hoping to buy a treadmill somewhere down the road so I can exercise more than what I am. So yea money is a big issue for us but hopefully I can get ahead and stay there. 
Nothing has really changed with the friends situation. I was talking to my friend Ginny about coming over some time to do one of the new karaokee games but she didn’t really say she would come over and she didn’t say she wouldn’t but I don’t know I just get this feeling that she’s avoiding me. My feelings are usually off anyway so it could just be me being paranoid. Me and Kacey miss Jess terribly. I think the hardest times for me are at night because I’m used to being able to talk to him about our days before we go to bed. Besides not being able to get laid in 4 months sucks too. Too bad he wouldn’t let me have a booty call with someone(just kidding). It would be nice though but not like anyone would want to do that with me anyway.

My biopsy results were that there wasn’t cancer but that the biopsy was inconclusive so now I have to go back soon and have the biopsy done again. I’m so excited to have a giant needle shoved into my neck again. That crap hurt the first time but maybe it won’t hurt so much this time seeing as a radiologist is going to do it and I would think they would be more experienced than a regular dr/surgeon. 
I still miss Jess terribly. It’s just weird not having him here especially when I go to Logli’s. Go figure the place he hates the most is the place I seem to miss seeing him at the most lol. I’m going to be sending him a letter soon after I revise it a bit and send him some photos of me and kacey that we took at the mall in one of those photobooth type things. 
I just try to put on a happy face when I’m in public and at work and just try not to think of him but its hard. I’m hoping I can talk my friend Amanda and Lil one into coming over tomorrow after I get off work to do some Zumba. Amanda has a wii game of it. It will be nice to have someone come over. I have to get Kacey’s derby car ready for Saturday. He has a pinewood derby race on Saturday so hopefully we can get the kinks worked out before then especially since I have no clue what I’m doing when it comes to that. Maybe I can see if Amanda’s husband Terry is around and maybe he can help us figure something out. 
Well guess I better get to bed.

Man these past few weeks have been pretty busy. Saturday Kacey had his pinewood derby race for boy scouts. He got runner up for his grade and gets to go to the finals in April. Jess wrote me twice. I came to find out that his phone doesn’t get reception so he can’t call me which sucks. His graduation and family day is in May. I requested it off at work but according to my supervisor which is over my manager she told me I couldn’t request 3 days in a row off because they are morons. I don’t see what the big problem is if I’m requesting it off 2 months in advance. The supervisor said she was going to speak to the head person but that she would probably say no. My manager told me if they pull that crap go to the union I’m a part of and explain it to see if they could do anything for me. I don’t even care if I get paid for all 3 days off. If they want to pay me for just 1 and I’ll just take the other 2 days off I’m fine with that. My manager also told me to just take the other 2 days off anyway and the worst that would happen is they would write me up. I don’t want to get  a write up so I would try the whole union thing first before I went there route but if the union can’t help I’ll gladly take the write up because I think it’s ridiculous that I can’t get all 3 days off.  The head honcho is a real bitch and said at the beginning of the school year at one of our meetings that no one can request like a week off because we get spring,winter, and summer to do our vacations but it’s not my fault my husband’s army basic training graduation is towards the end of the school year.
Then another big issue going on is the teachers in my area might be going on strike and even if they go on strike we still have to show up to work so that means I would have to find someone to babysit Kacey for me so I can go to work because I can’t take him with me since there would be no school. I would probably ask my friend Ginny since she doesn’t work and see if I can pay her something for doing it. 
I’m still waiting for Jess’s first check to get here and hopefully it’s a good amount of money so I can get some bills  paid off and household stuff. Just have to wait and see. Me and Kacey both miss him terribly but we both understand we can’t do much about it and accept it. 
Kacey had his teacher conference today and he’s doing really well in reading, spelling, vocab and getting better with his writing but he has to work on some math skills so if I have any money left I’m thinking of going out to Barnes and Nobles(even though I still HATE them) and get him some math skill workbooks or something to help him bring that up. Otherwise the teacher said behavior wise he is doing better than he was and that the new meds seem to be helping him so that is a HUGE relief for me. 
I officially have lost 10 pounds and I’m still working on it. I’ll admit I don’t exercise in the traditional sense with actual exercises but probably all the running around I do at work is helping me lose and I’m trying very hard to eat better and get rid of soda and drink more water. Well I guess that’s all I have to write about
"
365,https://www.opendiary.com/m/torturedsoul_1/got-his-check-5150400/,2012-03-14,got his check,"
I did get Jess’s check today which I was very happy about. I paid a good portion of my gas, electric and rent. I was able to get household stuff and a few items we desperately needed for the house along with a laptop battery and some shelves i’m gonna hang on doors and put some stuff in so I can get rid of some other stuff to free up space. I got a new trash can and some new pots and pans and a dish strainer because we REALLY needed a new one. I also got the new tires for the car and actually will have quite a bit left which I’m gonna keep in the account until the next time he gets paid to add to what we already will have left. It will feel nice to be caught up on bills and maybe even get ahead a bit. 
Other than that not much exciting going on. I’m trying to go outside and do something with Kacey since the weather in our area has been GORGEOUS!!!. I think the temp today was 87. That is so weird for it to be that warm in March but hey it’s better than freezing cold and snow. I really want to start going to a local park in our area called Sinnissippi and start walking like every other oday or something but my mom hasn’t been feeling too well so I don’t want to bother her with watching Kacey while I do it because I know Kacey wouldn’t make it around the whole park without whining that he’s tired or being super slow. The only time I can do it is when he’s out of school so it sucks. I wish I had a friend that lived pretty close that would be willing to watch Kacey for me for a lil bit so I could do that but I don’t anyone well enough and even if I did I wouldn’t want them to think I’m just using them to watch my kid. Maybe when my mom is feeling better I will ask her if she wouldn’t mind watching him for me so I could do that. It would only be maybe like 30 minutes to an hour. Well anyway I better end this because I still have to take dogs out, check laundry, feed everyone, put fans in the windows, put a bulb in the night light and then go to bed myself.

I was just writing a note to one of my bookmarks who was having issues with her bf of 5 years. In that one I wrote about how me and my husband have only been apart from each other for maybe a few weekends all the years we have been together. I guess us being apart from each other for 4 months is a really good test of how much we really are a couple. I miss him like crazy and I have learned how to be a little bit more independent but also learned who my real friends are. Maybe I’m just destined to not have many friends. I think me and the Ginny chick are going our separate ways as much as I hate to say it. I try to do things with her and she ALWAYS wants me to go over to her house but the problem is since Jess has been gone I don’t have a crapload of gas to go all over the place and her house is rather far from mine. Besides she smokes and stinks because of it. So I don’t know I asked her if she wanted to go bowling with me a LONG time ago and she told me she would get back to me which she never did and now all of a sudden she’s going to Missouri this weekend. Nice of her to let me know. Then there was the whole biopsy fiasco. I got a call from the dr office today about tomorrow and they said I had to have someone drive me to and from so I went around asking almost everyone I could think of if they could take me to which everyone was busy. I was finally able to get my friend Amanda to take me even though I feel bad because she has to drive a bit of a distance to come to my house. 
It kinda made me mad that they waited until the day BEFORE the appointment to decide to tell me that. If they would have told me in advance I could have arranged for someone to do that and  wouldn’t have to scramble around to find someone at the last minute. Besides the fact if the stupid doctor would have done the damn biopsy right the first fucking time I wouldn’t have to do this at all. 
Then work has me stressed out. It  seems like I can’t do anything fucking right when it comes to my boss. She’s always yelling at me about one thing or another. I just want to quit to be honest but can’t do it. She will sit there and blame me for stuff I didn’t screw up like her computer. She sat there and tried to say I screwed up her computer because I used the minimize button instead of clicking on the program name on the taskbar thing that is at the bottom of the screen. Then the other day I had to print something out and I didn’t see the printer icon so I went to file and was about to do it that way and she was all like ” WHAT ARE YOU DOING? YOU DON’T DO IT LIKE THAT!!!! I was tempted to say there’s 3 different ways you can print something but figured I would keep my mouth shut. Everyday I’m being yelled at for something I fucked up on. It’s just crazy. There’s a lady who is a lunch aide right now who is thinking of becoming a food service worker i’m tempted to tell her don’t do it but if she did become one it might get better for me or it could get worse because then my boss would favor the new chick over me and point out my mistakes even more. I don’t intentionally try to screw things up but she sure does make it seem that way. She’s constantly saying I’m not listening but when I’m concentrating on trying to get something important done and she’s yapping about something totally different it’s a little hard to pay attention to what I’m doing and what she’s talking about. I can multi-task but not according to her. I don’t know what to do. I only have 2 more months so I guess I can’t complain too much and even if I do no one gives a shit anyway. That’s a big thing I’ve noticed no one gives a shit what I say or what I do. I could kill myself and I doubt anyone would care. (NOT THAT I EVER WOULD).

These past few weeks haven’t been the greatest for me. Last week I got a bad cold which I still have but it’s getting much better. Then Tuesday night I started getting this terrible pain in my lower right side so I ended up going to the ER.We got there about 630 and didn’t leave until 1030. The pain just disappeared which is good but it was really bad for the first few hours I was there. They thought I had a bladder infection but I don’t think that’s what it was. 
Then Thursday and Friday last week the teachers in our district decided to go on strike because of some b.s reasons. Their salaries are paid by us the taxpayers. I heard we pay like 96 percent of their salaries so they were asking for more money and more health benefits or something like that. I’m all for the teachers who are actually trying to teach our kids but some of them don’t deserve to be teachers and definitely don’t teach the kids anything. Either way I personally think it was selfish for them to go on strike and then claim that they were doing it for the “kids”. In the end the kids are the ones that have to make up the days at the end of the year. So Thursday I still had to go to work and clean our kitchen because we have a “no strike” clause in our contract so even though the teachers were on strike and there was no kids we still had to come in and clean. Then Friday I got sent over to East to help them clean which I think is b.s. Why the hell should I have to go clean someone else’s kitchen when I don’t work at that school. So was really happy to hear over the weekend that school was going to resume today. 
Today I had my appointment to find out the biopsy results. The nurse lady made it sound like I was just going to have to do follow up stuff but when the dr came in he said that they said some of the cells were considered “suspicious” for cancer so he wants to do surgery and remove the left part of my thyroid. He also said that they might have to remove the right side too in the future. The only good thing about the whole situation is I might be able to get it scheduled the week I’m leaving for Jess’s graduation in Oklahoma so I wouldn’t have to worry about the whole 3 day issue I’m having with them. I’m keeping my fingers crossed. Either way I’m going to Oklahoma whether they like it or not. If I am able to do the surgery that week I will probably have to take the whole week off anyway for recovery so it would be perfect timing for that. If not for the surgery my options are to work Wedsnesday and then leave pretty much right after and then call in “sick” for the other two days or just take all 3 days off and get written up for it. So I would probably do the work Wedsnesday and call in sick for the other 2 because I really don’t want to get written up. 
I had someone tell me to just wait til he gets home and not take the trip at all. I’m sorry but I already miss him so much and I would really like to get the chance to see him before he leaves for Arkansas for almost another month. I guess it’s hard to understand unless you have been with someone for as long as we have. You don’t realize how much they really mean to you until you spend a LOT of time away from each other. I got annoyed by things he did but I even miss those things since he’s been gone. Hopefully the Army has helped him with some of those annoying habits and I’ve been working with Kacey on some of the same things so hopefully by the time he gets home they will both be broken of them. 
Today at work was pretty interesting too. My manager made me wear a face mask after she asked me if I had a cold. I’ve had this cold since like Tuesday of last week and she never noticed even though my voice was all hoarse and icky sounding. Every Wednesday she has me do the register and the closing procedures so in case she has to be gone I know what I’m doing. Well she’s sitting there yelling at me telling me I forgot to do the close for last Wedsnesday and I’m thinking to myself I wouldn’t forget something like that and that there was a reason I didn’t do it. Well we came to find out we didn’t have school last Wedsnesday so she apologized for yelling at me. I was like I may be a little forgetful but I knew I didn’t forget to do the closing stuff. She has me so confused on some things it’s just ridiculous. It’s funny she told me the other day that when we came back from Spring break that things were going to be “less stressful” like all of it was my fault. It’s not all me she confuses me with some of the stuff she says to me and then when I ask to make sure I’m doing something right she yells at me and if I don’t ask she yells at me. What the fuck am I supposed to do then? When I was at the other school on Friday cleaning there was a lady there that worked at the school I work at now and I asked her if she was there when my manager and she said no but then said “she’s difficult to work with.” YOU THINK!!!! I can’t wait for the school year to be over so I can get a vacation. 
God I hope the rest of this week gets better before I go insane. I am seriously thinking of starting to drink that’s how stressed I am about everything. It sucks that I don’t really have anyone to talk to about anything. I just feel like no one would give a shit what I have to talk about anyway and that I would just be annoying them. I need to start walking around a park or something to get my mind off of things.Tomorrow I don’t care what is going on I am going to a park and doing that.

Wedsnesday the nurse from the surgeon’s office called me to tell me when they were going to be scheduling my thyroid surgery. It is on April 20th. That is the closest they could get for me because I explained the whole situation to the nurse about Jess’s graduation and how my work was being an ass about me taking the 3 days off for it. Good news is according to the nurse the surgeon basically lets me decide how long I want off work so I’m going to tell him 2 weeks so I can go to Jess’s graduation. Now the only problem is will my work accept that. I called my manager yesterday to tell her the date of my surgery and that I needed 2 weeks off but she didn’t get the message so I called her again today but she has to wait until Monday to call our supervisor because no one was in the office because of Good Friday. So I’m going to call my manager on Monday if she doesn’t call me to remind her to call the supervisor so they can get a lead on finding someone to sub for me for that time. Hopefully they won’t make a big deal out of the whole thing. 
So we will see how things pan out. I’m hoping Jess will be able to call me this Sunday since I sent him a calling card but I guess I will have to wait to find out. Today me and Kacey went to a park and went bike riding or maybe I should say I went bike riding Kacey complained and cried and beat up on his bike most of the time. I keep trying to explain about the training wheels and how they aren’t supposed to both touch the ground and that they are pretty much there to help him learn balance but he was too busy screaming, crying and beating up on the bike to listen. So if I go again I think he will stay home because it’s kinda hard to go riding when you have to keep stopping to deal with someone’s meltdowns. 
Not much else going on. I still have my cold and I think a sinus infection too but it is getting better day by day. I can’t wait til I can breathe normal again without being stuffed up and having pressure in my cheeks. Well guess that’s it for now.

It looks like I’m going to have to drive to Oklahoma after all. When I was about to book my rental car I found out that I have to have a CREDIT card. I don’t have one just a bank debit/check card so it looks like I would have to drive  which I think would make it much cheaper anyway. If I would have done it the other way I would have to take a bus to get to the airport in another city, then have to take a plane to Oklahoma and then get a rental car while there and a hotel but if I drive all I have to worry about is the hotel and gas for my car and food which would make it MUCH, MUCH more cheaper even with gas prices. The trip was going to cost over a thousand dollars with the bus,hotel,plane and rental car but so far I’ve only had to spend 229 to put a reservation on a hotel room and I don’t have to pay that until I get there. When I was looking up directions for how long the trip would be the site i was on had a fuel cost calculator and it said it would only be like 130 so all together it would maybe be about 300 bucks. We are going to take a cooler with and put some snacks in it and drinks so that way we won’t have to stop at fast food places the whole time we are there. I’m scared shitless about this thyroid surgery mainly thinking about how much pain I’m going to be in especially if they are going to give me narcotic pain killers for the first few days. 
I hope Jess calls tomorrow night but have a feeling he won’t. I sent him a calling card so he can call us since his phone doesn’t get reception there. Easter is going to feel weird without him here but we will manage. I have to get a new camera before the trip too since I lost mine. It’s nowhere to be found and it’s driving me crazy. Well i better get to bed so I can get up early to start making the ham since my brother is supposed to be leaving at noon.

370,https://www.opendiary.com/m/torturedsoul_1/surgery-update-31-5150405/,2012-04-15,surgery update,"
Well today at work I was going to get the paperwork for my leave filled out and my manager informed me that I could get fired if my leave wasn’t approved. The supervisor chick told my manager to write me up for the biopsy I had to take off work to do because I didn’t have any personal or sick days left. Dumb huh? So after work I notice  a missed call and voicemail on my phone so I checked it and it was the surgery place saying that they had to reschedule my surgery which in a way is a good thing. So I called the lady back and she was like the dr wants to be here for your surgery but he’s leaving for vacation on the day of your surgery so he wants to reschedule it for May 11. So I told the lady that my work is throwing a fit about me taking off time during the school year and how they want me to wait til the school year is over to do the surgery. Now the problem is I’m back to the original issue I had about the 3 days but my manager doesn’t think they will fire me because of that and that the only reason they were going to possibly fire me was because of taking 2 weeks off after the surgery. So now I’m going to get written up for taking the 3 days off which I don’t care about because my son being able to see his dad is more important to me than a stupid write-up. So that’s the surgery update. 
On to other things: my son won 2nd place in the runner up division for his pinewood derby finals for boy scouts. Him and the boy that got first place were neck and neck. I’m so proud of him. Another good thing Jess didn’t get any tornadoes where he was which he was disappointed about and I was thrilled about. Go figure! I joined the local YMCA and have been working out. I was on the stationary bike Saturday for 34 minutes and did 4 miles. I went today and did the stationary bike for another 34 minutes and worked on a few of the weight machines. I really wish I had someone that wanted to work out with me and do the machines but i don’t until Jess gets back. I’m thinking of signing up for a personal trainer until Jess gets back. He’s thinking of going to school to become a personal trainer when he gets back. Sorry so many sentences ended with back lol. I think that is all for my update for now. We got just a lil bit over 2 weeks til we leave for Oklahoma we are both so excited to see Jess.

I got a letter from Jess today and in it he says he would rather us come to his AIT graduation which is the one for the actual position he would be doing instead of us going to his BCT graduation. He said if we came for the BCT graduation that he might feel like quitting because he hasn’t seen us in  such a long time which I can understand so instead of Oklahoma we would be going to Arkansas but Arkansas is only 10 hours instead of 14. Then I won’t have to worry about being fired from my job because school will hopefully be out by the time his graduation is.

Today has definitely been a better day than most. I got a phone call from Jess finally. Oh my god it was so nice to hear his voice. I found out he’s going to Missouri for his AIT training instead of Arkansas so that’s good news too. Man two months needs to hurry up for a lot of reasons. School will finally be over and jess will be home. Two very good things in my book. Other than that good news not much else going on. One of my friends grandson’s sounds like he might have cancer. I’m not for sure yet but there was talks of a tumor growing in his brain and usually tumors mean cancer. I feel really bad for her and the kid. Well nothing much else to say.

Man I really wish I could quit my job. Today I was on the register instead of serving. Everything was going pretty good. We had these oatmeal bars and I had went through 1 and had about 20 from the 2nd box and so I opened the last box and was going to add the 20 or so from the other and count them to the last box so my manager starts yelling something and you can’t hear what anyone is saying so I dropped the bars to go see what she was saying. I get to the window and she’s yelling at me because I didn’t just add to the 20 or so box instead of bringing out the whole box and said I don’t listen to her. I’m only on regular ONE day a week so yea I’m going to forget and it wasn’t that major. Why not have me do it the way I was going to do it and figure out for myself that it would be easier to have the 20 or something bars and add to it instead of having to count a crapload of bars instead. She makes me feel like I’m such a idiot but then she turns around and says I need to be more confident. Hmm nothing like someone basically saying you’re an idiot to boost that confidence. I can’t ask questions about anything because then “I’m not listening”. I have even tried to repeat back what she tells me to make sure I’m understanding it correctly but to also let her know I’m listening to what she’s saying. Today she had me put my comments on my review and so I had put it would be nice i maybe I could be shown what I’m doing wrong so I can correct them. She took it as I was saying she didn’t show me anything on how to do things. Example she has me count trays at the end of the day and some days my counts are way off for some reason so I’m trying to figure out what I’m doing wrong so I go over it with her. Every day we have 450 trays set aside but yesterday I had 90 left over that had accumulated so I wanted to use those to get them used so she took away like 2 stacks of the trays so that brought the count to 350. So 350 +90 brought the count to 440. I ended up using up all the trays I had so I had to grab another stack of trays which have 50 in them so that brought the count up to 490. The count for how many kids we served came up to 420 something I think. I had 5 trays left from the 50 so I took 490 and subtracted 45 because I knew if I added the trays we would have served over 500 and we don’t serve that many kids so subtracting the 45 from the 490 was the only thing that made sense to me and my manager kept saying I had to add the 45 trays because I used them but that wouldn’t make sense to do. So yea she had me confused and she does this kind of crap all the time. The pizza recap is the stupidest one ever. Instead of just counting a whole pizza we have to put how many slices and how many whole pizzas we have left. The last time I did that one I got how many were left right but I had to figure out how many we served and I couldn’t figure it out and a teacher came in to talk to my manager about a student so I was standing at the computer trying to figure it out in my head what I needed to do. After the teacher left she started yelling at me asking me why I was standing at the register when I could have been working it out on the calculator. How the fuck am I supposed to work it out on the calculator if I have no fucking clue what the hell I’m supposed to be using for figures. I think it was like 23 slices were left. We receive 48 pizzas in all and there is 10 slices per pizza. So I was thinking it would be 46 whole pizzas and 3 slices but according to the manager that was wrong. So that’s the kind of crap I have to put up with on a daily basis. I can’t wait til school is out.

Man today was  another shitty day at work. We had to do creamed turkey and we usually are able to put them in cups and put lids on them and stick them in the hot cart before lunch starts. We got half of the trays done and my manager told me I would have to do trays in between lunches which I was fine with doing. So first lunch is over and I have 5 minutes until the next lunch period. I usually start putting out the trays for the next lunch 2-3 minutes before they are supposed to come in so I knew I probably wouldn’t have enough time to do a tray because I would have to pull out the pan of creamed turkey out of the hot cart, get the bowls and lids ready, find a tray and that  Swould probably take about 1-3 minutes to do so I restocked the mashed potatoes and grabbed more trays from under the table. My manager comes in and it’s like a minute til the next lunch starts and I was getting out the other trays we had made and getting them ready and she goes “what are you doing?”. I replied “I’m getting ready for the next lunch.” She then proceeds to yell at me about how I should have been working on the creamed turkey instead of worrying about the mashed potatoes and trays. 
So the next grade comes in and we get them served and I start working on the creamed turkey so I won’t get yelled at  and I’m only able to do a tray before the next grade starts coming  in but now I’m behind because I couldn’t restock the potatoes. Before the last lunch I discover that  we only have a half of a pan of creamed turkey left and that would definitely not feed the 5th graders since there is like 65 in the grade and only like 18 I was able to make so I tell the manager and she gets pissed that I waited to tell her and says she’s going to write me up for it. Then the principal comes over and asks what’s going on so I have to tell him what happened. The thing that pisses me off though is if the manager wouldn’t have had us fill the bowls so fucking full when we did the trays before lunch we would have had plenty left but she insisted that we fill them that full so I shouldn’t have to take all the blame for us running out of food. I will take the blame for being stupid and not letting her know sooner that we were running out but it wasn’t totally my fault. Then it was interesting I was waiting for Kacey to get out of school and was just sitting when the lady that used to work in the kitchen with my manager came up and started talking to me. She told me that she didn’t come towards the manager in a threatening way like the manager told me and that she almost had a nervous breakdown because of the manager which now that I’ve had to put up with her shit I totally can see. She told me to just focus on being able to go see Jess and not let the manager get to me. It’s really hard to do when you feel like you’re being blamed for every single thing that goes wrong when it isn’t all your fault and what is my fault i will owe up to and say it’s my fault. I can’t wait for this school year to be over with so I can get a break or I will go fucking crazy very soon
I was happy when Jess called to talk to me about the whole situation it made me feel a lot better. He told me to just play it cool for tomorrow and I told him it’s Friday so i could give a flying fuck what she tries to pull tomorrow. I’m not going to let her bring me down or screw up my day fuck that shit. Sorry for the swearing but that’s how I mad I am. I actually started crying on my way to get my mom and everyone that knows me knows I don’t cry easily so for someone to piss  me off to the point of tears must have REALLY pissed me off. Just had to vent about it and I’m sure no one will read or give a crap

Boy there are a lot of things I can’t wait for. Tomorrow we are going to the young at heart festival. I got me and Kacey unlimited ride wristbands. Then Monday we have the Memorial day parade which Kacey will be in I just have to figure out how I’m going to do that whole thing because the parade starts at one point and ends at another. I was tempted to park my car downtown somewhere and then bring my bike with and ride it back to the parade start and have my mom hold on to it for me during the parade or lock it up somewhere near where she was going to be but i don’t know. If worse came to worse we could just walk back home from the end of the parade. Then after the parade we were gonna have a cook out with my friend Lil Michelle coming over to hang out with us. Another thing I can’t wait for is school to be over with. We have until June 4th and then we are done. Things have been going better than before. My manager has this crazy idea that when she compliments me I don’t think I have to work hard anymore or try but that’s not it at all but I just let her think what she wants because she is the type that thinks that she is right and no matter what you say you are wrong so I don’t argue I just let her think what she wants.
Then of course the biggest thing I can’t wait for is going to Missouri on June 20th and coming home with Jess. I miss him so much in a few different ways. I’m sure no one cares but it’s been almost 4 months since I’ve had sex and it SUCKS. I invited a dude that Jess works with at Logli’s named Ryan to come with us to Jess’s graduation but I don’t know if he is going to or not. It doesn’t help that I have a crush on Ryan but would never do anything with him because I’m sure he just thinks I’m annoying and could care less about me.

It turns out that Ryan can’t go to Missouri so Jess suggested that I ask Lil Michelle to go with me so I asked her and it sounds like she is going but sometimes she decides at the last minute she doesn’t want to go but I hope that’s not the case. The young at heart festival went well except that it was REALLY hot the day we decided to go and there wasn’t a lot of rides for everyone there but it was still decent. Kacey actually went on 1001 Nachts or yachts which I was surprised about because I figured he would freak out. He also went down the water slide at the Y the other day when we went swimming. Yesterday at Kacey’s school they had their field day. For lunch it was really confusing for us and everyone else. The principal had ordered pizzas for the staff and volunteers but it was made by the same place that did our usual pizzas for a Wednesday so they all came at the same time but the manager had to keep them separate because there was only 9 pizzas ordered for the staff and the rest were ours. So the first group came in and there was a parent that was handing pizzas to the kids and I think it confused my manager and so she said to the lady  that the kids didn’t help getting their pizza which pissed the lady off. My manager has a habit of sounding bitchy when she talks to people so the lady got angry about it. Then the volunteers were asking if we had anything to drink and all we could tell them was that we were told that there was going to be beverages provided for them but no one told us where to get the beverages from because we didn’t have enough milks for the staff/volunteers to get one. So it was a diasterous day kitchen wise but it was fun playing with the teachers against the parents in a volleyball game. We only won one of the games but had fun and got some exercise doing it so no complaints. 
I’m so glad that we only have 2 days left for work. Then I can sleep in late and go to bed later.

I can’t believe it’s only going to be 4 days til I get to see my husband again. It’s going to be so great to have him home again. Saturday we are having a cook out for him coming home. His uncle Ken is coming, his uncle mark and aunt cheryl, his mom and brother Shawn, his friend Ryan, our friends Amanda and Sylvia, Lil Michelle and maybe Kacey’s friend Breanna and her family, a guy named Dash that works with jess, and I think that’s it. So hopefully the cook out goes well. Big shocker his retarded redneck brother CJ said he couldn’t come because he has to work all day. I told him you knew about the cook out like a month in advance so I find it funny that he couldn’t request the day off but whatever it will be hilarious if he ever throws anything. Then I asked him if his son was coming to the cook out and he said no he’s waiting for me to get off work so we can go do something together. As far as I know he has his son for the whole summer so why can’t his son come to the cook out to see his uncle and cousin. What a fucking douche. He might actually get custody of his other son Alex because the stupid bitch just dropped the boy off with his grandma(bitchs mom) and took off with her bf who didn’t want kids. 
Then I had to put up with bullshit from bridezilla. I checked my husband’s fb page and there was a message from her about how they wanted to hear from him when he got back because they were sending a gift to him and how they wanted him to be home for it. I wrote to her and said I didn’t work all summer so I would be home and I could set aside the package for him when he got home. She wrote back that she wanted him to be home and when I spoke to him he told me to tell them to send it so I did and she got attitude and said she would send it when she sent it. I told my husband I have been nothing but nice to her dumb ass since we had our disagreements like a year or two ago now but she always has something smart to say or write. My husband said they need to get their heads out of their asses and grow up. This surprised me because when all the crap that was going on before he acted like he didn’t care and didn’t really take sides on any of it but hey im for it now. 
Tomorrow I’m going over to a girls house I haven’t seen in like 3 or 4 years I think. Her name is Candice. I don’t know if I have the older entries where I talked about her but it’s kind of nerve wrecking in a way because it’s been so long. She is going to do my hair for me and hopefully this time it will look awesome. I’m trying the black with red highlights again. I gotta remember to take my camera with so I can get pics. I will definitely update on that tomorrow night. Yesterday I put new floor in my bedroom. It doesn’t look too bad but man was it a lot of work. That should definitely help with my weight loss lol. Well I guess that’s the update for now.

Last Wednesday me, my friend Lil Shell and my son went to go get my husband in Missouri. The trip down there went pretty good. We met up with my friend Tab in Springfield,IL where she lives and went out for lunch at Dairy Queen down there. My friend Lil shell seems to have issues with soap dispensers in Springfield. While we were waiting for Tab to get home from work we had stopped at a restaurant not far from her house because we all had to go to the bathroom. Lil shell went to the bathroom and then went to wash her hands and the dispenser fell off the wall. Then when we were going to leave Dairy Queen we stopped in the bathroom and we were joking about the other dispenser and it did it again. The driving wasn’t so bad except that there was construction in St. Louis so it took a little longer than we expected to get to the city we needed and my gps got a little confused and couldn’t find our hotel. 
We decided to go swimming on Thursday to kill time since we had to wait for Jess to get a pass so we could hang out. The pool was an outdoor pool which wasn’t too bad since we were the only ones who were there but it had a lot of bugs in it and poor Lil shell slipped like 2 or 3 times because the bottom was slippery. Then when we went to wash the tub was really slippery too for my friend. Then Kacey decided to lose the key card right before we were going to leave to go see my husband so we had to go get another one which luckily they didn’t charge me for. Then we got to go to the base and try to figure out where Jess’s barracks was. That was tons of fun. We finally found him and I had to go sign him out. I said to him man it’s like a mental institute where I have to sign you in and out lol. We went and ate and took Kacey to a playground right across the street from his barracks before he had to leave us. I felt so weird seeing him for the first time in 4 months. The next day was his graduation. We ended up getting there half way through it because we left the hotel a little late and we couldn’t remember how to get to the building and some of the roads were blocked. Luckily we got there right before he was supposed to accept his diploma and then after that we went and got his tons of crap from his barracks and started on our way to see Tab again and go out to eat and then home. 
Not to get too TMI but we had good sex that night. 4 months without sex will that to you. My husband took vacation and we have been enjoying our time together. We were planning to go to Great America this weekend but rethinking that because the tickets are like 60 bucks each so trying to find something else to do just the two of us but not sure what. We are trying to find something not too expensive but something out of town to do but not sure what. So I guess that’s my update.

I have been telling my mom since Jess was still doing his training that when Jess came back we were gonna go somewhere for a day by ourselves WITHOUT KACEY and so we got to talking in the car about tomorrow which is when we planned to go do our special event. She decided she wanted to pull the whole “I never told her” crap and now she doesn’t want to watch Kacey. So our choices are either forget the whole thing and not be able to do anything at all or drag Kacey with us. I honestly don’t want to take him anywhere with us so we might just say screw it. I was talking to Kacey’s friends mom about the whole thing and she was gonna see about watching him but her daughter has a friend over for the night and she doesn’t know when the parents are planning on picking up the friend. She said she tried to get a hold of the parents to ask but they never responded so hopefully the parents will pick the kid up early so we can still go but if not I guess we will have to unfortunately do something with the kid. All I ask for is ONE goddamn day by ourselves and no one can give that to me. I think someone loves screwing with us. I haven’t seen my husband in almost 4 fucking months and I can’t get ONE day alone with him. My mom knows how hard it was for me for 4 months but she can’t give me one day. Crazy shit.

After waiting forever to get my thyroid surgery over with I’m scheduled to have it on the 30th. This sucks for a few reasons. One is it’s my mom’s birthday, two it’s Lil Shell’s 2 year anniversary of her accident, three I have no one to help with Kacey for a few days. My mom is taking off on her birthday but not for 2 days after and I doubt Jess will take two days off to help me out when he’s the main one bringing home a paycheck so this should be interesting. According to the dr the plan is to go in and take out the right side because it has 3 nodules on it. They are going to have a pathologist there or somewhere near who is going to look at the section they take out to find out if it’s cancerous. If it does come back to be cancerous they are going to take out the left side as well so they won’t have to go back and do it later. If it comes back non cancerous they are going to leave the left side and I might have to have surgery again in the near future for that side. The risks are they could accidentally cut nerves which would lead to me being permanently hoarse for the rest of my life or accidentally cut the parathyroid gland which is behind the thyroid and it could screw with my calcium levels in my body. Neither sound that fun. I’m honestly scared shitless but hope there are no complications. 
Other than that whole situation not much else going on that is truly exciting. I haven’t spoken to most of my friends in quite a while. Ginny pops up occasionally asking me if I want to do something but it’s usually like that day and I’m busy or it’s a day Kacey decides he doesn’t want to listen and behave and so I don’t take him anywhere. Besides it’s usually at Ginny’s house and she is a big smoker and her house is super smoky and I can’t stay there for long. I told her about it before but I’m guessing she forgot but I literally can’t go to her house. My nose gets super stuffed to the point I can’t breathe and my eyes start burning and watering and I start to get a headache. I love the girl to death but I can’t do her house. My friend Lil Shell smokes and her house I don’t have a problem with because she goes outside and smokes. The thing with Ginny is her husband doesn’t smoke but she still smokes in the house. I have nothing against people who smoke but damn I’m not going to feel like shit from someone’s smoke. Even Candice’s house I can deal with her smoking in her house and it doesn’t bother me like it does at Ginny’s and Candice has smoked since I met her. Ginny is older but still. Me and Lil Shell get together when we can. With how hot it’s been this summer we haven’t invited her over to spend the weekend because our apartment even with air conditioners feels like a oven and we discovered she gets quite mean and angry when it gets hot out not that I blame her. I’ve been visiting with Candice the last few Fridays because Jess goes up to Freeport for his taekwondo and I don’t really want to sit at the place waiting for him because we have to bring Kacey with and I know Kacey wouldn’t be able to sit still that long so we go over and drive Candice crazy lol. At least until she gets sick of me and tells me not to come over anymore. I have a annoying habit of trying to clean her house for her. I’m a tad OCD about cleaning these days. 
So other than Candice and Lil Shell I don’t have many people to hang out with. In a way it’s my fault because I don’t ask too many people to hang out because I’m used to being told nope got plans or have to work or I don’t know yet even though it’s like a few days in advance or just yea and then when the day comes I get screwed over. I just feel like no one gives a shit. The whole time Jess was gone I felt so alone and there was a few people who were like we’ll be there for you. One of them was Ginny but with her her grandson was diagnosed with brain cancer and she had to have some medications rearranged so I left her alone and tried not to ask her for too many favors. I feel bad when I have to ask someone to watch Kacey for me for one reason or another. Partly because I know how bad he can act sometimes and partly because I tend to ask Ginny to watch him a lot because I know she can keep him occupied. Even though Jess is back I miss hanging out with friends but it just seems like I don’t have any. 
I better stop rambling about the friends deal. No one really cares anyway.

Monday I went in for surgery. I was scheduled for surgery at 930 in the morning but didn’t get in until noon. Jess had to work and my mom was watching Kacey so I had no one to come hang out with me in the hospital. That sucked but I just watched tv. The nurse I had was nice but I think she was new or just not good at IVs because she thought she put the IV in my vein and so she said if she didn’t and it wasn’t in the vein my arm would start to swell up because the saline would go in the tissue. So she left to go take care of another patient after waiting like 5-10 minutes to make sure she had it in the vein. Well after about 10 minutes after she left my fingers started tingling and I noticed my wrist area was hurting a little like the tape was too tight and my fingers were getting cold so I hit the call button and a pregnant lady came in and asked what I needed and I told her my fingers were tingling and my wrist was hurting a little bit like the tape was too tight around my arm. So she went to go get my nurse which she took forever to come back in and we came to find out the IV wasn’t in the vein. So she took out the IV and wrapped my arm in a warm blanket to get the feeling coming back and had to send in another nurse to get an IV going. 
I finally get down to surgery and actually don’t remember much except waking up in recovery with my CPAP on feeling really sleepy. They took me up to the surgical floor and I tried to stay awake but I had a bad headache and had these annoying bouts of nausea keep hitting me. It sucked. My neck didn’t really hurt though so that was good. I did have a roommate she had her appendix taken out and the next day she was gone so she must have left during the night and I didn’t know about it. Jess did come by after he got off work and stayed for a bit. The next day I was feeling much better. The doctor came and saw me and said that they only took out my right side and that the frozen section they took was still iffy so I’m scheduled to see him Monday to find out if I have to go back and get the other side taken out. I really hope not. 
Well guess that’s the update for now.

Went to the doctor on Monday he said no cancer but I do have to have ultrasounds on my left thyroid every 6 months and if it grows then I have to have my other side removed so let’s hope it stays small. Jess is only working 3 days this week which is nice to have him home so much but sucks when it comes to paychecks. I had a meeting on Monday for school and have registration tomorrow from 645a to 12 15 so it sucks I have to get up at the buttcrack of dawn but trying to do things to tire myself out so I’m ready for bed early. 
I got a chance to talk to my friend Ginny and we have plans to get together this weekend but not sure if she will be able to do it because a cousin passed away so we will see what happens. Other than that not much going on in my neck of the woods.

383,https://www.opendiary.com/m/torturedsoul_1/what-more-can-go-wrong-5150418/,2012-08-17,what more can go wrong,"
For the last few days my neck has been really swollen. I assumed this was because of the surgery. Wedsnesday I got a call that I had missed an appointment at the surgical place so I tried calling for almost an hour and the line was busy so I figured I’d just go over there because I wanted to ask about the swelling anyway. So I talked to a nurse who looked at it and said there was nothing wrong and that the swelling was probably because the stitches were dissolving back into my body and to take ibrophen so I’ve been doing that. Last night I’m about to go bed putting on my CPAP mask and I feel something wet running down my neck so I go to the bathroom and there is clear fluid coming out of my suture so I went to the ER to have it checked out because they told me if there was any fluid coming out of it to get it checked. Four hours later I finally get home. I found out that the fluid is nothing to be worried about and it’s something called a seroma which is a fluid filled space between my skin. So this morning I wake up and the fluid is now a yellowish solid color so I call the surgeon’s office and speak with the doctor who has now prescribed me an antibotic as a precaution and wants to see me on Monday. So yea not exactly good news because I was reading online and it says they have to sometimes be drained or have a drain put in so we will have to see if that is what he wants to do. It has been draining on its own so I think that’s a good thing. The only bad thing is when I go to sleep I have to wrap a towel around my neck because I tried to just do a gauze taped to my neck and it was soaked within like 5-10 minutes. 
Other than that me and Jess FINALLY get a day to ourselves thanks to one of Kacey’s friends grandma taking him to a circus that is in town and keeping him overnight. Hopefully he behaves and maybe they will invite him to spend the night more often. The only downfall is my brother is over so its not technically just us but it works. We don’t really have extra money to go out and do anything really special anyway but tomorrow we are going to the fair and I’m gonna go on a few rides that aren’t too  dangerous lol like the pharaoh’s fury, swings, bumper cars and maybe a few more if they aren’t too bad speed wise. 
I’ve been trying to talk my husband into switching to National Guard instead of the army reserves. As far as I understand the National guard is a part of the army but they do more natural disasters and they do go overseas but to help with more humanitarian tasks than fighting and combat type situations. Hopefully that would mean that he wouldn’t have to go so far for his weekends since there is an armory not too far. It’s worth a try. I truly think if the did national guard it would be safer than the army because there aren’t too many hostile areas compared to the army and IEDS either. 
Work starts on the 28th. Definitely NOT excited about going back to deal with the disrespectful kids but it’s a job. I will still have the same hours I had last year and still have to do the stupid weird break situation and we are going to be serving earlier than we did last year but at least we will have someone to help in the kitchen. My manager told me to try to call the union president and talk to her about the whole break issue because it’s stupid to have to clock in at 915 then sit for 15 minutes and leave the kitchen at 1 and sit for another 15 minutes. The 15 minutes at the beginning of the day I could be helping prep stuff because the guy that is coming in to help won’t get to the school until we start serving so me and the manager are going to have to be the ones that do the prep and I’m worried about a day like cream turkey day where we need to try to get as many bowls done BEFORE as we can. So yea some major issues involving work and hopefully this seroma issue gets fixed or I might not be able to go back to work because obviously I can’t be serving kids food with a drain hanging out of my neck with fluid in it or have a gauze taped to my neck with nasty fluid on it so hopefully they won’t have to do either or I might not be able to go back to work on time. I guess I just have to have patience and wait til Monday to see what the dr says. Everyone please keep your fingers crossed.

Sunday me, my husband and son all went to the county fair and I rode a few rides but it sucked not being able to ride most of them like I usually do but I didn’t want to take the chance of doing anything to my neck so didn’t ride as many as I usually do. I just received a phone call from the hospital that said that I have staph aurelus. Luckily the day after I left the hospital I called the surgeon and he had started me on antibotics because that’s when the discharge turned yellow. I had a doctor appointment with him yesterday and it stopped draining by that time go figure. I have cashier training tomorrow and I have no one to watch Kacey so Jess will either have to call in or go in late tomorrow. It sucks that I can’t find anyone to watch Kacey but I can’t exactly blame people for not wanting to watch him. His friend Breanna’s mom has a funeral to go to and my friend Ginny won’t leave her house for some reason because she said her driver license expired so I said well I could have Jess come pick her up and I could drop her off after I got home and she said no so whatever. We will figure it out.

Yesterday my husband noticed that our dog Coco was having more trouble than usual getting up. She had bad arthritis in her back legs for quite some time but she could usually get up with our help. This time I tried to help her up and she would just fall back down so my husband asked me if we should finally put her to sleep. I told him to be truly honest I was selfish and wanted to keep her around for as long as possible but that I too thought it was time to put her to sleep. During the night she ended up vomiting numerous times and laying in it and she couldn’t do much of anything so this morning when we woke up we decided to put her to sleep. We couldn’t let her suffer anymore. I’m really going to miss her because  she was a awesome dog and she did live 15-16 years so I’m not complaining one bit about it. 
Before Coco passed away me and my husband talked about getting another dog  after she passed away. We went to the local shelter today and picked out one. We ended up going towards the time they were about to close so my husband is going to go tomorrow while I’m at work to turn in the application for the puppy. He’s 7 months old and a pitbull terrier. They named him Stanley but we are going to rename him something else. So we have to wait to find out if they will approve the application before we are able to get him so hopefully everything works out and we are able to get him. 
Other than that work has been going pretty good and much better than last year. My manager gets stressed out about other things but she doesn’t take it out on me or my co-worker so that’s nice. My husband applied for a loss prevention position at a place called Ross’s dress for less which we have one in Rockford but the position he might get would be in Dekalb and then when a position opened up in Rockford he could get transferred so he might finally get to say good bye to Loglis.

So far this year work has been much less stressful than last year. Every once in a while something will pop up like it did last year but it’s been so much better. So Thursday evening Jess looks at my right eye and says it looks like I have pink eye so I had leftover eye drops so I start taking them to be on the safe side and call my manager to let her know so she can get a sub if she needs to. So she calls me Friday afternoon and says be prepared because I’m going to be written up for taking off since I had no time coming to me. We get a certain amount of personal days and sick days. Tomorrow when I go in I’m gonna ask her if it would be better if I came in and then she sent me  home and see what she says. I get the whole situation with not having sick/personal days but WTF they want me to come to work with contagious health issues. That is the dumbest thing ever but with this job it’s not shocking. So I will update tomorrow after work.

So sorry to everyone for not writing what happened with the write up deal. I went in Monday and asked my manager if I should just come in next time and work and her answer was they basically had a issue with it because they didn’t believe I had pink eye for one because I didn’t go to the doctor and two because I called after working that day and said I had it but according to my manager my eye didn’t look irritated when I was working which that morning it was looking red but I wasn’t sure if it was from my CPAP blowing air in my eye or a piece of animal fur got in. My eye was actually hurting while I was at work but I didn’t want to sit around and complain about it. So who knows I guess next time if it happens I’ll make sure to go to the doctor and get a note so they can’t write me up for it. Other than that no other drama has really happened this year so that’s good.

I get a call today from my manager saying she’s sick and won’t be in tomorrow so I have to go in at breakfast time and do breakfast which I was never shown how to do. I think I can manage figuring out the register part of things but not sure how to do the rest and it doesn’t help that I don’t have my supervisor’s number to find out if she is going to come by to help me out. When I was at Lathrop and the manager was out for a week and I had to come in and do breakfast the supervisor came in and did the paperwork and register and I just served. I know how to do lunch pretty good but never did breakfast so it should be an interesting day tomorrow will definitely let everyone know how it goes.

This weekend was pretty interesting. Friday my son had his fall festival at school and I volunteered to help with one of the games and dressed up as a zombie nurse. It was fun. Then Saturday was my annual halloween party. Only 5 people showed up my friend Lil shell, Amanda,Belinda and her fiancee Richard and Amanda’s hubby and Tab came for a lil bit. My husband had to work but came later. We played my 7 deadly sins game and ate lots of candy. There was a few friends that didn’t show but that’s usually how it is so no big surprise there. After the party was pretty much over me, Lil Shell and Amanda went on a road trip out to Blood’s Point which is supposed to be a hot spot for scary stuff but not much has actually happened to us except a drunk skunk but I know Lil Shell misses going out for road trips so figured she would enjoy it. Yesterday I pretty much sat around the house and today after work me and my friend Tab went to see Paranormal activity 4 before she left to go back to Springfield. It wasn’t too bad but not too exciting either. Other than that not much to really report on. The same boring shit of no one comes to hang out but there’s no point in bitching about it because it won’t change.

Boy I have so much to write about but just havent had the motivation to do ANYTHING. Let’s see I’ll start with why I wrote the entry which would be more b.s at work. It never seems to end does it? Yesterday we had creamed turkey which we have to put in bowls so we were did some up ahead of time but were only able to do like 5 big trays with 24 on each one so we were out by the 2nd lunch period. We also had to serve green beans and mashed potatoes. I started out doing the bowls and the mashed potatoes but when we ran out I told the guy I work with that I would just scoop up the cream turkey and asked him if he could do the potatoes and green beans which he was cool with. So we were doing that for a little while until my manager came over to the window while the kids were going through none the less and started yelling at me saying why was he doing the beans and the potatoes and that I was supposed to be doing the potatoes and the creamed turkey and that I was in charge in the kitchen so I should be doing more than him. So we started doing it the way she wanted us to but I was getting behind so the guy started doing the potatoes here and there and she came back again and said why aren’t you listening to me I told you to do the potatoes and how I got more hours than he did and all this other b.s. 

We get a break in between the kindergarteners and the 1st grade so I was doing up more creamed turkey so I wouldn’t have to scoop so much of it and she came back telling the other guy that she was writing me up because I didn’t listen to her and how not to follow my lead and that I was making him do all the work because I was lazy and some other crap I don’t remember. It pissed me off but I kept my mouth shut because if I would have opened it I would have cussed her out because she assumes she knows why I do things wrong but she has no fucking clue. There was one time I was doing the grapes and concentrating on them and she’s talking about sandwiches or some other shit and so after I was done I asked her about whatever it was and she was like I already said that but obviously you weren’t listening to me because you didn’t want to and all this crap. To myself I was thinking I was concentrating on what I was doing because it needed to be done ASAP and how if I was listening to what she said and doing what I was supposed to be doing it would throw me off. I asked the guy if he felt like I made him do everything and he said no so  goes to show she has no fucking clue what she’s talking about. Nobody at the school really likes her anyway so I’m not too worried about it. 
Some other stuff that has been going on not related to work but my son. Last Thursday my husband caught our son trying to set a roll of bright orange duct tape on fire. We definitely weren’t happy about the whole situation so we contacted a place in our town that works with mental health in kids. This place has a worker that comes to my son’s school along with a few other schools and talks with my son once every 2 weeks. So we went and discussed things with them about the whole situation because this is the 2nd time as far as we know that he has tried to set something on fire. So there is a 24 hour number we can call so we did and they sent out a worker to come talk to my son to see if he was a danger to himself or others which thankfully the worker said he didn’t need to be hospitalized and that they would be coming to talk to him once or twice a week so we are happy about that. 
So lately I haven’t been the most motivated person maybe because I was worried about what was going to happen to my son and the whole crappy work situation but I’m trying to get motivated like today I’m trying to get my house looking awesome.

I’ll start off with my thoughts on the whole CT school shooting. There are a lot of things about this incident that ticks me off and saddens me at the same time. I don’t understand how anyone can basically execute little kids. From what the media is saying the shooter was mentally ill and unfortunately the mentally ill are running out of places to receive help. In our area they just closed the mental health center so where do these people go? My brother is mentally handicapped and ill and does occasionally have issues with meds which causes him to be hospitalized but now that there isn’t a place for him where does he go? From the sound of it they are trying to put the mentally ill in jail to help them get treatment. I think that is worst possible place for a mentally ill person. My brother doesn’t deserve to be put in jail with dangerous inmates because his body got used to his meds and needs to be adjusted. How is that fair? You try to imagine what if something like what happened in CT happened at your child’s school. I think I’m more terrified because I work at my son’s school. It’s scary to think of someone coming in and shooting innocent people especially since you know most of them. The even scarier thought is the way some of the classrooms are set up. They call it “the pod” and there aren’t any doors at all just classes set up in a circle. The kitchen where I work has a lock on the door but as far as I know you have to lock it from the outside so that wouldn’t help us except the good thing is there is a door to outside right next to the kitchen. A lot of the classes have doors somewhat near them which is good in a way depending on how far the class is from the door and where the shooter is. My son’s class is right near a door so hopefully they could get out safely. It’s just scary thinking of different scenarios in your head of different things you could do. 
Now for my update. I can’t wait for x-mas break. It will be nice to not have to go to work for 2 weeks. Plus it helps that my birthday is during that time but sucks too because only 1 or 2 of my friends will probably come hang out with me for it. Kacey is getting better on attitude since the med change and he will go see the dr this Friday so we will see what happens for that. I have a sleep dr appointment Weds. which I’m going to tell the dr about being so tired and see what we can figure out. I personally think it has something to do with my thyroid but we’ll see. My son had a school dance last Friday. He was excited and told everyone he was going to kiss his friend Breanna. I told him it wasn’t going to happen at school because he would get in trouble so he gave her a kiss on her cheek at her house. My son is weird I know. Well I guess that’s it for now.

My xmas went pretty well. I got a gold’s gym cardio wii game, a hip hop dance experience wii game, boxing gloves for the wii, a piggy bank i can paint myself, a tablet, 2 pairs of aloe infused slipper socks, a watch and bracelet,popcorn, 25 mastercard gift card, 25 joint wal-mart gift card, 2 beach towels, snowflake pj pants, a coat, and I believe that’s it. 
I’m supposed to be having a birthday party on my birthday so we’ll see how it goes. I think as I get older I get more depressed because less and less people seem to come to my party. So far my friend Ginny and her hubby are supposed to come, my friend Tab’s two younger brothers, and Lil Michelle and my mom and maybe Kacey and Jess will be there for a little bit before he has to go to work. The last few years we went bowling so I decided to try to do like a games night because I have dance games for wii, singing games, board games. 
So maybe next year I just won’t do anything for my birthday unless someone offers to do something with me and just treat it as a regular day. 
I went to the doctor last week for headaches I’ve been having so the doctor ran blood tests and big shocker my thyroid levels came back abnormal so I have to go in 2 weeks to see what’s going on. Hopefully we get something figured out.

I get into work on Monday and my boss tells me she needs to talk to me about something and that its serious but it’s not about me and I’m not in trouble. I had been reading on FB before I left for work about a terrible house fire that killed 2 kids and 2 adults and I thought maybe she was going to tell me that one of the kids from the school were involved. So I clock in and get ready and go down to the kitchen and she tells me that the fire was actually my coworkers house and him and his niece were the only ones to make it out. We instantly started thinking of donations and ways we could help. It sounds like their christmas tree which was a real one somehow got set on fire they are thinking either something electrical or possibly a cigarette. He lost his mom, his brother, his niece’s 10 month old daughter and his mom’s grandson in the fire. He came in today  and said he’s going to be coming back on Thursday which sucks but I can totally understand why he’s coming back so soon which is so he can get paid since they only give him 3 days of bereavement pay.

Today was my co worker Dontiae’s first day back at work. He seemed ok. I gave him a ride home since he had 3 boxes of stuff from people at work. He’s living with one of his sisters 5 houses down from the house that they lost. I found out that one of their dogs died in the fire because he said it was in his nephew’s room. I wanted to seriously yell at this one lady. Her name is Estelle and she has a thick hispanic accent and she kept asking him questions like how did you get out?, why didn’t your mom get out and stuff like that. I didn’t bug him with questions related to the fire and just let him talk about it if he wanted to. There was quite a few of the kids that said they were sorry which was surprising because most of them are pretty rude. My son even came through the lunch line and told him he was sorry for his loss which I found touching considering my husband came to school and I asked him if told my son to say that to my co worker and my husband said he didn’t tell him anything. 
I’m just glad he’s willing to talk about the fire and seems to understand that there was nothing he could do to save his family which is sad to say but some people torture themselves with the what ifs. The family members funerals are next Thursday but unfortunately I have to work or else I would love to go. Well I guess that’s it for today.

If I remember correctly the last time I wrote was about my co-worker’s family members passing away in a fire. He is doing well with it. He lives with one of his sisters right now but she is moving and he is looking for a place for himself. Me and my husband’s anniversary was the 15th of Feb. and we had a good time. We went to Texas roadhouse and Jess of course embarrassed me. This past Saturday was probably the most exciting (NOT!!). First my mom pulled a muscle in her upper leg walking down the stairs so I took her to the immediate care and they told her to go to the ER to get a better look at it so we were on our way to the hospital when there was a lady that was attempting to make a left turn but she saw another car coming to make a right turn so they both stopped so I started to go because I was going straight and the lady that was making a left turn decided to go and ran into me. Luckily we weren’t going too fast and her car suffered more damage than my minivan. See mini vans are good for something besides being associated with soccer lol. She had a broken headlight and paint transfer all I had was a dent near my front driver side wheel so that’s not too bad. So yea other than that work has been awesome this year. My manager hasn’t been yelling and screaming at me like last year and we are getting along much better. My son has his good and bad times. He got suspended not too long ago for finding a toy gun on the playground. The reason he got suspended was because he was dumb enough to take it out and play with it. He only got suspended for a day so that was good at least. Not much else going on.

397,https://www.opendiary.com/m/torturedsoul_1/friends-1244-5150432/,2013-04-02,friends,"
I know this is a reoccurring issue in my diary but it just drives me crazy how friends just seem to disappear for one reason or another. There are a few that I got rid of by my choice but it seems like others just stopped hanging out. Melissa and Tammy and their family were my choice because of drama that kept coming up. I will say I did enjoy when we all hung out but it felt like there was more giving than getting. Amy I barely talk to anymore and that one really hurts especially since we have been friends since 5th grade and same thing for Belinda. The only time I ever see her is on Halloween which I hate. My friend Ginny has seemed to drop off the face of the earth. I see her occasionally post something on fb but we never hang out anymore and she never talks to me either. The only friends that seem to be around the most are Lil Michelle and Amanda. I don’t get to see Amanda too much because she’s working but when we do we have tons of fun and Lil Michelle cracks me up. Tab is one of my best friends but we don’t get to see each other too often because usually when she comes to town she hangs out with Jason most of the time and that’s fine plus I know she doesn’t care for my son too much and that he gets on her nerves. Hopefully this summer we can figure out a way to get together. I was thinking of possibly going down to Springfield one weekend or something and hanging with her if she’s cool with it.  
I know losing friends and gaining them are a part of life but it just makes you feel like shit when it seems like you lost more than you gained and how it makes you feel so alone. When Jess was gone for basic training I was so lonely and felt like no one gave a shit. I always try to check in on friends and if there’s something going on check in on them even if it’s just a text but no one did that for me when I needed it. I would have felt better if someone had just said how are you or how are you doing today. They didn’t have to ask me every day but just checking in every once in a while would have been nice. I guess I should just shut the hell up and stop whining about it.

398,https://www.opendiary.com/m/torturedsoul_1/r-i-p-missy-5150433/,2013-04-23,R.I.P. Missy,"
When I went to my mom’s house on Sunday to help her with something and to clip her cats nails I noticed her cat Missy was drooling really bad so I told my mom she might want to take her to the vet because usually if a cat drools there is something going on with their mouth either a bad tooth, infected mouth or infected sore somewhere near their mouth. So my mom took her in to the vet today and they informed us that she had a tumor growing on her jaw which basically meant she had cancer and that there wasn’t anything they could do for it so my mom decided to put her to sleep. We got Missy from my best friend’s Tab’s mom. Missy’s family had been evicted and they pretty much left her to fend for herself and she used to go looking in the garbage near Tab’s moms place. We aren’t exactly sure how old she was but I’m sure she was up there. It’s so hard to put any animal to sleep because I feel like I’m betraying them because they trusted me to take care of them and its so hard to feel them purring and loving on you and you know you’re going to put them to sleep. 
Today we had a new 4th grade girl come through the lunch line who couldn’t  remember her number so I asked her to go to the back of the line which there was only like 3 or 4 people behind her and she got a attitude with me and then when she came back up I asked her what her last name was and she got an attitude about it. I got her in the computer and she sat down to eat her lunch. I went back and told my manager that she had an attitude so keep an eye out. So the kids get up to throw away their trays and we have been telling them if you don’t want your milk don’t take it because if you take it you will sit down and drink it. The new girl comes up and she has a unopened milk on her tray so my manager tells her she needs to sit down and drink the milk and the girl replies” I don’t have no time for you GIRL.” So my manager and her go back and forth about the milk and I can’t remember if she drank the milk or not but my manager went to the vice principal about her and the arguing with my manager and the fact the girl basically elbowed my manager in her chest and all the vice principal said was “why were you arguing with a teenager.” I’m thinking WTF!!! So the vice principal has no problem with this girl basically abusing staff and showing no respect to us. Then they wonder why some of these kids don’t have respect for any adults. Maybe because no one is teaching to show respect. I get angry when the kids come through the line and say “hurry up or make some retarded comment to us or even make fun of my co worker because of his handicaps either the way he talks or anything else about him. I feel sorry for our future because it’s going to be fucked up if people don’t start teaching these kids manners and respect.

Life is boring as usual. I started going to the gym again since I won a 3 month gym membership to the place where my friend Lil Michelle goes to therapy so I can go with her or I can go with my husband. I’ve been trying really hard to go more than once a week. So far this week I’ve gone 2 days this week and maybe go again tomorrow. As for Mother’s day it doesn’t look like we are going to be able to really do anything or have anyone get me anything because we are broke as usual. Jess only worked 1 day last week for Logli’s. He’s getting tired of this crap and I am too. I’ve been trying to find jobs for him and I’m trying to find a summer one for me because I know we won’t be able to survive if I don’t. I’m hoping to put Kacey in a summer day program so I can work somewhere. 
Other than that not much else going on. Work is going 10x better than last year.
"
400,https://www.opendiary.com/m/torturedsoul_1/summer-so-far-14-5150435/,2013-07-19,summer so far,"
This summer has went pretty well so far. Kacey is in a playground program through the park district and he really seems to enjoy it. They go on field trips to different places around the city. Jess got the loss prevention job so no more shitty hours. He gets 40 guaranteed which is so nice. I wasn’t able to get a job for the summer which sucks but it is what it is. I’ve had a lot of health stuff going on. I found out back in December that I have hypothyroidism so I have to take a pill for that. I just got my labs done last week and they upped my thyroid med because it was too high, I have to take 1200 mg of calcium a day and 800 of Vitamin D a day. I was told to watch my carbs and sugar because my glucose was 103 and its only supposed to be 99 or under. I still have sleep apnea and I have to schedule another ultrasound for my thyroid in August. School around here starts August 26th or 29th and next month is when all our meetings for school start and Kacey’s birthday is next month as well. I was thinking of taking him to Magic waters on his actual birthday or maybe to Madison Zoo. Jess is going to be leaving for his 2 weeks in August and unfortunately it overlaps on Kacey’s birthday so it will be just me and Kacey doing something. 
The end of this month is my mom’s birthday and Lil Michelle’s 3 year anniversary of her accident. I can’t believe it’s been 3 years since her accident. She has lost so much and gained so much. Her and her friend Amanda who was in the accident with her stopped being friends. It was over something pretty stupid but the way it sounds was coming. From what Lil Michelle has said ever since her accident Amanda has acted different towards her. Amanda had a annoying habit of trying to tell Michelle she was lazy and according to Amanda it was to motivate her but I don’t know too many people that would motivate. Then there was the way Amanda explained injuries to people like Michelle’s injuries weren’t that bad and how she got hurt too. There was a few occasions when Amanda actually threatened to hit Michelle and a few occasions when she actually did hit her or Michelle hit her first because she threatened to hit her. Michelle’s ex husband used to abuse her and threaten to hit her so now if someone threatens her she hits them first. I don’t blame her one bit. Amanda has this annoying habit of thinking only of herself and no one else. Whenever I hung out over at Michelle’s house when Amanda was there she was constantly bitching about being in pain and usually sat on her phone going on FB talking to her “friend” Shayne and dealing with his drama. Michelle told me that Amanda and Shayne are a bit more than friends and that her husband doesn’t know about it. It’s a weird situation because Amanda basically saved Michelle’s life but its not worth putting up with drama. Michelle is doing so well in therapy and life. She is going to be taking a 7 hour driving test in Chicago to see if she is ready for driving. I didn’t tell Jess this but I let her use his car in a church parking lot. She did pretty good even with her bad hand so I don’t think she will have a problem. 
Speaking of Jess some idiot hit his car so now he can’t open his driver side door all the way and the quote we got said it would be over a thousand dollars to fix and that our insurance which is affirmative is one of the worse to have because they won’t cover it all and we will probably have to pay for half of it so I think we need to look into a different insurance company. So yea thats been our summer so far.

Jess’s two weeks for the army is creeping closer and closer. If I can do 5 months with him gone 2 weeks should be a cinch but it sucks because Kacey’s birthday is the 14th and Jess won’t be back until the 17th. He’s going to be leaving tomorrow and Kacey’s summer program ends tomorrow so that means two weeks of me and Kacey being together except for the few days when I have meetings for work or registration to do. For his birthday we are hoping to go to Madison zoo with a few of his friends because Madison is free so all we would have to worry about is gas so that’s not too bad. Then on the 18th we are hoping to do his birthday party. I say hope for everything because he will get paid next week through his full time job and then we will probably have to wait til the first of the month for his army paycheck so have to keep an eye on money and try to pay bills. It’s gonna be hard to do but we will see how it goes. I don’t work during the summer which sucks except for meetings and I’m not sure how they are going to pay us for them. It’s gong to suck to have Jess gone for 2 weeks but I’ll manage somehow.

402,https://www.opendiary.com/m/torturedsoul_1/the-time-has-come-80-5150437/,2013-08-08,The time has come,"
Jess has been gone since the 3rd and he hasn’t been able to call or text lately so that sucks. We took our dogs for a walk out in one of the forest preserves and I ended up getting poison ivy or something poison so got a rash on my right arm on the inside near my elbow and same hand in between my fingers. I went to the immediate care place yesterday and got some pnedinstone(sp?)pills for the itching. Kacey got himself grounded for a month because he didn’t tell me where he was going and he has been grounded two previous times for a week for the same thing so I made it a month this time since a week wasn’t doing it. He’s also grounded from his tablet and the computer. I told him if we have any more issues he won’t have his birthday party on the 18th or go to the zoo. 
Registration yesterday was interesting. My manager was yelling at me because she claimed I filled out a form incorrectly but I don’t think I did so hopefully she figures out that it was correct but with her im used to it. 
So other than that not much else going on at this present moment. I think we will have enough to go to the zoo. We have 113 in our checking and then I’m going to transfer some over from saving to hopefully make it more. So the next hurdle to get over is affording his birthday party and making it a good one.

One week til I go back to work and my son starts 4th grade. Jess is officially back from Army training and it’s awesome to have him home. Kacey’s birthday was the 14th. We went to Madison zoo in Wisconsin and also a botanical garden. It was pretty good and Kacey’s two friends were well behaved too. His birthday party was a different story. I think next year he might not have a party because of the way he acted this year and the way he treated a few of his friends. 
You try so hard to raise them to be grateful for what they have but sometimes they are so rude. I was really embarrassed and angry at the way he acted. He kept telling his friend Breanna to shut up and for one of the presents he says “oh great I got a stupid gun.” When he got a card from his grandpa Rob he says ” you gotta be kidding me right there is no money in here.” I told him not everyone can afford to give you money. So I think no party next year and if he keeps up with the crappy attitude maybe no presents for xmas this year either. 
I’m not looking forward to going back to work and dealing with the ungrateful little brats who also have no appreciation for anything. Some are very appreciative but most annoy me.

Monday was my first day back at work and boy was it exciting. The weather I guess decided that it wanted to be close to 100 and with all the stuff in the kitchen it made it even hotter. My manager was told that she can’t have a fan going because it blows around dust according to the health department so that sucked but my manager put a few on low so we had some circulation. Then yesterday the students actually got to go home like 2 hours early because the temps were close to 100 again. My manager seems a little bit calmer this year so that’s a plus.
The kids aren’t too bad either or maybe it’s because it’s the beginning of the year so they haven’t gotten the guts yet to start stuff. Other than that not much going on.

This week has not been the best week for us more for my hubby than me. Towards the beginning of the week at his job which is a loss prevention officer he stops a guy at a store he is at that is trying to exit through a entrance only with a drink and something else. So my hubby stops him and asks the guy to come with him. The guy refuses and my hubby asks to see his receipt for the drink and other item. The man claims that he doesn’t have a receipt so the man and my hubby start arguing and name calling. Finally the man pulls out the receipt out of his pocket and my hubby lets him go on his way. The guy then called my hubby’s manager and complained. So the next day when my hubby goes into work he goes in at 2 and comes home at 6 and tells me he is suspended until further notice. So today he got the call that he was terminated for supposedly lying because he couldn’t remember the exact names him and the man exchanged. What kind of bullshit is that. So now my hubby is trying to find a new job. I told him try for truck driving jobs because he has his CDL thanks to the military and there are more truck driving companies that aren’t cross country like our friend Pat’s husband Randy. I remember it was horrible for her because she only got to see him maybe once a month but these days its a lot different. 
So today my hubby leaves for his monthly drill for the army. He calls me not long after he gets there and tells me they screwed up the booking for the hotel and the hotel has no record of them staying there this weekend. So he starts calling around to find out what is going on. He finds out that they are supposed to be staying in a dorm building but that the building isn’t going to be available until tomorrow so he pretty much told the person that he wasn’t going to be able to come back because of gas money issues so he is driving back here tonight and staying. 
Then today we went shopping at one of our local Aldi’s stores. We come out and there is a huge suburban parked REALLY close to our car. My hubby was like WTF? They were so close I couldn’t even get in the passenger door. My hubby even asked politely if they could repark so I could get in the car. Nothing they just sat there. So luckily there was no one in the space behind our vehicle so I just told my hubby to back up and I would get in there. So I get in the car and proceed to take out my phone and take a picture of their shitty parking job to post on FB. The dude actually flicked me off. I started thinking my hubby should have either got in on the passenger side and hit dude’s car on purpose or stayed in the space and pulled out hopefully hitting the dumb fucker’s car on the way out but we live in a extremely ghetto town and knowing our luck the dumb fuck would be carrying a piece and try to shoot us. So that has been our excitement for this week and hopefully this weekend gets nicer and not worse.

As my title says I just might be crazy. I actually volunteered to be a soccer coach at my son’s school. Unfortunately my son isn’t on the team because he wanted to do bowling which is fine with me. Jess is going to be able to help me because he got fired from his job for supposedly lying to them which is bullshit because they claimed he lied because he couldn’t remember word for word what happened with the guy he stopped. What kind of crap is that? So he applied for unemployment so we are waiting to hear about that. Hopefully he will be approved for it because we might not be able to make it on just my lunch lady salary. He is going to see about a few jobs that don’t have online applications for them tomorrow and call the truck driver guy about that job. So hopefully something happens quick for us. We are just trying to keep our heads up.

Friday when I was leaving for soccer practice I ended up falling down 5 or 6 stairs and sprained my ankle. Luckily it wasn’t all of them which would have been 20. So I took off today til I found out how long I was supposed to be on crutches which the dr said I could stop using them as long as I used my brace and iced my foot and tried to elevate it as much as possible. Then Saturday was Jess’s birthday so we took him out to Texas Roadhouse and made him get on the birthday saddle and then went out for ice cream after that. 
Today was our first soccer game and our team won 7-1. The other coach was a asshole. He came over and rudely said to us” I want that goal because I’m the home team.” So I thought to myself good for you and I then asked him does that mean we get the ball first because it was our first time coaching and he replied whatever I don’t care as long as we have that goal. Then the guy made a joke to Jess about both of them being experienced I bet he would be pissed to know that we had no clue what we were doing and that we beat him.

408,https://www.opendiary.com/m/torturedsoul_1/crazy-work-crap-5150443/,2013-09-25,crazy work crap,"
So Tuesday my day starts out super shitty. My husband took both sets of keys with him so I couldn’t drive our son and our next door neighbor to school so I had to walk them at least part of the way. I was able to get a friend of Kacey’s mom to take me to get a key for the car so I could go to work. I get dressed and get to work only to be told to go home since I was limping still. The way my manager said it to me was our supervisor told her that if I was limping when I came in to send me home because if I damaged my ankle more by being on it then they could be held liable for it and of course they didn’t want to do that. So my manager told me I couldn’t come back until I had a doctor’s release saying my ankle was healed and that I could do my job. So I go home thinking everything is good. I get a call from her on Wednesday asking me why I haven’t been calling when I should have been even though I had told her that I had a doctor’s appointment scheduled for this coming Monday and the fact she never told me I had to call her everyday to basically tell her I wasn’t coming into work. My co worker messaged me on fb saying that she was mad about me having to take off work and the whole not calling in deal. She was the one that told me I couldn’t come back until I had a doctor’s release and its not like I’m just saying I have a sprained ankle to get out of work because with my hubby just starting a new job and him still having to pass his test for his CDL I’m the only income we have even though it’s not that much so why in the world would I want to miss work? 
So I called her tonight and she yelled at me again saying I have to call while she’s at work so she can get a sub. I told her I didn’t want to bother her at work that’s why I waited to call so tomorrow I will call her at work to tell her I won’t be there Monday. It’s just a bunch of bullshit if you ask me.

409,https://www.opendiary.com/m/torturedsoul_1/shitty-first-day-back-at-work-5150444/,2013-10-14,shitty first day back at work,"
Today was my first day back at work from my sprained ankle. My manager has a meeting and then proceeds to say that I faked my injury all because I was also a soccer coach and still went to games and practices and because I was around the school on a few occasions. Then she said that I was the reason the kitchen was running crappy. 
Let me explain why she’s full of shit. Yes I did go to soccer practices and games BUT for practices I sat on the grass or a wall and didn’t move until the end of practice and let my husband run practices.For games I went to them but had a fold up chair that I SAT in most of the game except if I needed to tell my husband something which wasn’t very often. 
There was a few times I went in the school to get a bag that had soccer balls and jerseys in them for practice. There was also a accident that happened in the staff parking lot at the school one day and I had looked over across the street because the soccer field is across the street from the actual school. I would let my son play on the school playground while we did soccer practice. I had looked over at the playground and noticed he wasn’t there and that there was no other children on the playground which usually there was. So I LIMPED over to the school to find out where he was and was stopped by one of the soccer player’s moms who told me that the police were chasing a guy that had taken off from the accident around the neighborhoods surrounding the school. I then went inside the buildng to find out if they wanted us to bring the kids back in for the time being because of the police presence and was told don’t worry about it pretty much. I didn’t quite understand that one because you would think if the police were CHASING someone near a school that they would lockdown the school until the person was caught but guess the kids aren’t that important. 
When I first injuried my ankle I went to a immediate care type place and was told by the doctor I saw there to go to my REGULAR doctor so I went and saw the regular doctor for the rest of the time and according to my manager I was full of it because I said I was going to my family doctor and not the one that originally saw me. DUH I’m going to my regular doctor because that is where I was told to go. Why go bother a doctor that I only saw once for the injury? My regular doctor didn’t give me any favors or extend my time because I told him to. 
Another big thing of why I know I didn’t FAKE my injury. I was only paid for maybe a week of being off because of personal and sick time. Now if I was faking why in the world would I waste those days just for the hell of it and if I was faking as soon as my manager told me that my paid time was up and I wasn’t going to get paid for it I would have come back then especially since my husband had just started his bus driver job and hadn’t gotten paid for it yet. Yea who in their right mind would want to not work when the bills would start piling up from not working and they could lose their apartment, have no gas for their vehicles, no electricity, no gas, no phones. I don’t think there are that many that would do all that to fake an injury or illness. 
I understand me being gone made things harder for everyone and I feel guilty enough about that but telling me I’m the reason that things suck in the kitchen is bullshit. If she’s the manager then obviously it’s not all my fault. I will admit I suck at speed in a lot of areas especially when prepping things and serving certain items but it was funny how before I got hurt my manager was always saying how my co-worker was slow on stuff too but now since I have come back its my fault for everything. I’m so tempted the next time she says I’m putting you on the computer to say well since you said I suck at everything you might not want me to do the computer then either and let my co worker do it instead. I told my husband no matter how sick I am from now on I will come into work to prove it since every time I get sick or have the shits and  puking I stay home from work just in case its something contagious but now I don’t give a shit and if I ever get injured again in any way I will go to work and if she says I have to send you home I will say NOPE I’m staying right here wouldn’t want you claiming I’m faking it. 
Then I get off work to find out that husband got laid off for the time being from the bus driver job because they can’t run background checks on anyone because of the government shutdown.  
Then we go to get my mom who had told me yesterday what days she had therapy which include tomorrow which is our last soccer game and the times clash so I asked if she cancel it and she got all bent out of shape about it. It pisses me off because I feel more like a fucking taxi driver and all I wanted was to do something besides my job and coaching soccer wasn’t exactly a great choice but its something to do with my time but god forbid I get to have a life. I had to cancel a eye dr appointment and a ultrasound result appointment because of soccer which was my fault for not checking first before I made them but I did it but other people can’t check with you to see if you have plans for a certain day or time and even if you tell them that you can’t do something on a certain day or time that they actually remember but get mad at you for having plans. I could be a bitch and tell my mom to get a ride to her appointment from paratransit or vans that take people to their appointment but I’m nice and don’t and she is nice enough to put gas in our vehicles but it just bugs me that I can’t do it one time and she gets pissy about it. 
So sorry for this long rant but I had to write it out somewhere or I was going to go crazy. Now its off to bed. Hopefully tomorrow is 10x better than today. I plan to not say much to my manager unless I absolutely have to  and do my job and get the hell out of there.

Who would have thought that OD would be back. A lot has happened since then. My son is 13 and going to be a freshman in high school. I can’t believe it!!! I work as a paraprofessional or fancy word for teacher assistant. I work in self contained classroom 3rd through 5th grade. Self- contained basically means our students can’t be in a regular classroom for either behavior issues or because they are so far behind. Our class basically helps them catch up but at a pace they can understand stuff unlike in a regular room. A lot of the behaviors come from not being able to keep up with the regular students. I also work for my friend Rachel who has CP as a personal assistant when I can get a free day. I work for our park district during the summer for summer school. My husband is a school bus driver, is still in the army reserves and works for a security company and is still trying to get his taekwondo school going. We have a decent relationship with part of my in laws. My husband’s cousins are awesome and have invited us in their lives. Usually at least a few times during the summer we get together and go to the zoo or go for a birthday party or some family event. Big surprise we still don’t hear much from MIL or FIL. MIL was upset because she can’t figure out why my son doesn’t call her grandma like he does my mom. Maybe it’s because my mom has actually been in his life all this time and has done things with him and even if my mom lived somewhere else and drove she would still come visit more than his mom does. It’s always a excuse why they can’t come visit. Their car broke down or someone had to work blah blah blah. I’m so done with it. The big thing that ticks me off is every family event that they actually show for they ALWAYS come up to us and say why haven’t you guys called us? We don’t know maybe because we don’t have anything to say just like you guys never do and oh let’s not forget that they can’t remember our numbers. Our numbers have been the same for YEARS and they still manage to lose them. FIL NEVER calls and hasn’t visited but they want us to go drive 3 hours to visit. I don’t fucking think so. Same thing for the one BIL that doesn’t live with mommy. He is still married to Bridezilla. The last time we tried to set up a time for my son to go visit they didn’t want to meet us halfway, I wasn’t invited to even come and they expected us to drive 3 hours up there and 3 hours back on the 4TH OF JULY!!! Are you fucking nuts? That is one of the busiest holidays to drive on!! Then to say I wasn’t invited uh excuse me that is my son I will come if I damn well please. How the fuck are you going to tell me I can’t come? One of my husband’s uncles is amazing. We don’t like that he pays for things but at least it gives my son something to do. He did horseback riding lessons the last few summers thanks to this uncle and this year my son is going to get to go to a technology camp for a week because of him. The price I saw was almost a 1,000 dollars but it might be cheaper since my son will be staying with him for the week since the college is close to his house so I’m sure that will bring down the cost but still. I’m so appreciative to him that my son gets to do something even though we don’t have that kind of money.  We lost one of our dogs and 2 of our cats since the last time. Aries, Squeaker and Lily.

***I wrote this entry for the marriage group but don’t think I can just publish it in that group so you can skip if you would like**
Hi everyone my name is Michelle. I live in a place called Rockford,IL. I have been married since November 21, 2011 but we have been together since ’99. High school sweethearts. I love my husband very much. I love his sense of humor, his gorgeous blue eyes and love that he supports me in anything I choose to do. The things that annoy me about him are he doesn’t help clean up the house as much as he should, he procrinates a LOT, we have different opinions on how to raise our 13 year old ADHD son. We have been through a lot. My family is only me, my older mentally handicapped brother who I’m his legal guardian and my mom who is 73 but still works and lives independently. His family is much bigger. He has 3 brothers, 5 cousins, 2 nephews, 4 uncles his mom and dad are still alive. The sad part is the only ones out of the family he actually sees or talks to is the cousins and the uncles. One of his brothers who is married to a chick I nicknamed “bridezilla” hates me so that makes things tough. She was fine until the wedding hit and then me and her had some drama over some stupid shit with the wedding. The last time we asked them if they wanted to see my son they tried to say I couldn’t come with,they weren’t willing to meet us halfway which for us a round trip would have been 6 hours, and they wanted to have us go get him on the 4th of july. MIL has a lot of issues. So yea it’s mostly us and my family lol. We are trying to get a house but can’t seem to save much money. He literally works 3 jobs. School bus driver, army reserves,and he does security. I work 2 jobs paraprofessional and personal assistant. We barely get to see each other because of jobs but we try our best.
"
412,https://www.opendiary.com/m/torturedsoul_1/summer-school-is-over-2-5243654/,2018-07-14,Summer School is over,"
So I work summer school through the park district during the summer for some extra money since we don’t get paid during the summer for the school district. I’m a para short for paraprofessional. I’m in a self-contained class. Summer school is only 4 weeks. This year there was a lot of drama. There was a big tall guy named Jamarion. He did pretty much everything you could do wrong and didn’t end up getting fired until literally the last day of summer school. This dude made fun of me and he’s bigger than me. I would be talking to someone and he would start laughing. He told a teacher to shut up, got complaints from numerous students, stole a teacher’s lunch, was looking a nude photos around the kids and one of the kids saw them and he kept making fun of one of the teachers constantly until she went and complained and he got a shout out which is supposed to be a good thing  but in his case he didn’t do anything to deserved it. I made some new friends Makenzie and Armarlie. Hoping next year goes better. Then our group went out to eat after work one day and one of the site directors that I have worked with for the past 3 years during the school year and had some drama happen to her so she won’t be coming back to our school which I’m really sad about found out that a teacher that works at the school stole one of her logos that she made for this teacher and never paid for. Also the teacher scammed one of my other friends Armarlie for some seminar she was doing and when Armarlie didn’t want to go she wouldn’t give her her money back. So I messaged the teacher I work with during the school year and told her to be careful of this teacher so she went and told the teacher what I said so the teacher confronted the director lady about it so I was mad and not sure I can trust the teacher I work with now. So this should be a interesting school year. We only have a part time principal and behavior person, a new secretary and a few teachers left.

413,https://www.opendiary.com/m/torturedsoul_1/its-been-quite-a-while-5358212/,2018-11-16,It’s been quite a while,"
It’s been a while since I wrote anything so figured I better stop by and update everyone. My son’s freshman year is going well. His grades are awesome since he’s started back on meds. He even made honor roll. We were able to get him a 504 plan so that helps with some stuff. A 504 plan is basically my son can get accommdations because of his ADHD. Like for tests he gets longer time and he get go to a quiet place to take the test if he needs to. My job as a para has good days and bad ones. A few of my students I’ve known since they were in Kindergarten. I’m just sad to see where life has taken them. Some of it is because the parents are shit and don’t disclipine their kids and spoil them rotten or just have no clue how to be  a parent. One student his mom had him when she was 14 and still hasn’t figured shit out because he throws the most ridiculous fits over the stupidest things. The other day he shut down all because he had to TRY to read a story by himself. It was a short story and he could have easily probably read it but he refused so the teacher told him he wasn’t gonna be able to go on a IPAD if the work didn’t get done. He walked into our back room which is a “cool down” and started banging his body against the wall. Then when the teacher went to the restroom he snuck a IPAD and started playing on it. When he got caught with it and was told he wasn’t getting on for the rest of the week he threw the IPAD thankfully didn’t break it and walked back into the back room banging his body on the wall. In the end me and the teacher ended up having to assist him to the principal’s office. Nothing was done and yesterday he decided to snuck on the IPAD again and ended up again in the principal’s office but got suspended since he was trying to force me out of the way so he could run out of the principal’s office. He didn’t harm me because he’s scrawny but still. So when he returns on Monday no IPAD til probably after Christmas break but just the fact that all of the drama was because of a IPAD is ridiculous. Another student doesn’t eat food. He used to only eat red fruit snacks. We are making progress he will take tiny bites of food and drinks milk now so it’s a start but mom used to give him candy all the time and pretty much let him misbehave so now we have to deal with the behaviors from mom letting him get away with stuff. He stalks me and the teacher, he refuses to do work and comes up to us and asks dumb questions to avoid doing work or claims he “needs help” when me and the teacher have already showed him a example of how to do it. He just the other day stole some gum from the teacher. He hit his mom from what his brother told me. He’s a tiny little thing too. Then we have a 5th grader who throws tantrums when he doesn’t get something that others get. The other day he threw a fit because the teacher gave some students who were doing their job gum. Literally in the back room throwing things around, crying over gum. Then there’s another 5th grader who tattles and gets in everyone’s business and he pouts like a little baby too over stupid stuff. I’m like they are gonna get the shit beat out of them in middle school. I just hope we get through to them before it’s too late. I also work in the afterschool program. I’ve had a 3rd grade student call someone a “crackhead pickle” and another one say someone’s mama looked like a “chicken nugget.” Just today we had one of our students who is known for her sticky fingers go to the bathroom with nothing in her hand and come back with a muffin. We questioned her about it and she claimed she “found” it. So when another student went to the bathroom we told her to look for any more magicial muffins in the bathroom. I’ve had a girl in another class bring her cat to school and another one not in our class bring her mom’s dildo to school. Just recently one of the students mom that was very pregnant stood up in the middle of the her daughter’s conference and said it’s time so her cousin proceeded to dig down her pants to check to see if she could feel anything. Our old principal got to see a mom’s “bush” when she was bringing the mom’s son home to get a spanking. One child smeared poop all over the kindergarten bathroom. I mean I could go on and on with the stories lol.

Hi everyone,
I hope your new years was good. Mine wasn’t too bad. I have a video somewhere I will try to upload of my birthday dinner. My birthday was December 30th. We went bowling and I invited friends to come. Not too many showed up but that’s normal for me. My teacher I work with Mrs. Spangler and her grandma came, my family which is just my mom and my brother, my husband, my son, a few of his friends. Anna,Callee, MacKenzie, Tawaina and Jay.  Then we went to a restaurant called Texas Roadhouse and they have a birthday saddle  which I got on with the help of a lady sitting in across from us and she paid for my meal. I will have to upload pics from both festivities. Our new years wasn’t too bad. My husband actually got the day off which is very unusual and he made it to midnight which is amazing. My son had a few of his friends over so that was nice. Then Jan.6th came and my husband had to go to California at Ft. Irwin until Jan. 31st. It was hard because where he was they weren’t supposed to be on the phone but my hubby snuck a few texts here and there when he was able to. I’m so happy to have him back. It’s been tough without him. I had to use my lunch break to come home and let my dog out because the poor dog wouldn’t be able to go out again until close to 4pm if I didn’t come let him out. Mrs. Spangler was nice and sat with the student in our room that I sit with for lunch. He has a gastrointestinal condition where he doesn’t eat much food so we have been trying since he’s been in kindergarten to try to get him to eat actual food. When he was in Kindergarten he only ate red or orange fruit snacks and that was it. Now he’s been trying little bites of different foods and he drinks milk so it’s a process. I have a funny story about my friend. One day he got mad and we have a “cool off” area in our back room so he went back there and  we were hoping he decided to take a nap. So I go back to get him for something and he was in a ball with the blanket on him. I pull off the blanket and there he is in just his underwear LOL. I was like “why are you in just your underwear?” He was like “I don’t know.”  So yea that was my funny moment for the week. It’s been super cold where I live like last Wednesday it was -30 for the high so most of last week we didn’t have school because of either snow or the freezing cold. It’s supposed to be much warmer this week so I’m sure we will be having school.

So let me do a bit of recapping. Our principal and dean at our school SUCK at their job. Since the beginning of the year the kids have pretty much gotten away with murder. The beginning of the year one of our students slammed another one of our students head into a table because he thought she was laughing at him. NOTHING was done. No suspension, no call home ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. Another student punched a classmate in the face because he thought she hit him on purpose with a basketball when it was a accident. He got to come into our room and be on a IPAD all day. NO SUSPENSION or anything. Just recently on Monday 2 students slapped another girl student in the face nothing happened to them. Today one of our students who was fighting with another student over who got to be first in line PUSHED a staff member and threw a plastic lunch card at her again NOTHING happened to him. He got to hang out with the dean and got to play basketball with a para. We have a girl in our room 2 weeks ago we had to call the mental health crisis number in our area because she was trying to harm herself with scissors. First time nothing happened. Then again last week we had to call again because she told the teacher that she was going to stab her with scissors and then stab herself “til she bled out.” Me and the teacher both think this poor girl has schizopherenia. She’s only 10 or 11 but she says she has voices telling her to do things, she has lied in the past and constantly lies about things. She told a previous teacher that her mom killed her baby brother and buried him in the backyard. She has told us that she sees a bathtub full of blood. She told me one day earlier this school year while we were outside for gym walking around the track that I needed to go get the woman that was in the middle of the field when no one was there. So this past week when we called they decided to hospitalize her so we were thinking great she will finally get some help. WRONG the teacher gets a call last Thursday accusing her of letting this girl be bullied at school by a girl who is also in our room. The girl and this other girl have been friends since KINDERGARTEN. They are now in 5th grade. For one she never told us that this girl was bullying her and we don’t believe the girl was. She told us she was being bullied online to which the teacher reported that to the principal. Then this lady proceeded to ask us why we would let her on FB at school. UH we don’t let the kids online it’s blocked on everything in our school so if she got on FB or whatever app it would be at home and when we asked mom she claims she has no access at home either. So in the end we got blamed for her “issues” and told it was because the bullying that she was acting like that so in the end she didn’t get a mental health diagnosis or any treatment and we just got accused of letting her get bullied which is BULLSHIT. So the girl came back on Monday and the teacher apologized to her and said pretty much if she would have told us we could have done something. From what the teacher told me the girl started screaming at her and threatened to walk out of the school. Then our principal and dean were both gone so my teacher was in charge of the building. So now the girl just keeps arguing with the teacher and said she will only talk to me. Well today she had a super easy assignment for spelling. The teacher was nice and highlighted all the spelling words so all the girl had to do was write the sentences so she asks for a pass to the dean’s office and the dean probably did part of the work for her. The whole situation is just ridiculous. Last Friday the mom of the girl  with the issues called the teacher and told her she didn’t her daughter near the “bully” so we honored mom’s wishes but today the girl kept trying to go near the “bully” and the dean had the nerve to say maybe we should let them UH no you dumb bitch the mom doesn’t want her daughter near the other girl. It’s bad enough WE meaning me and the teacher are being blamed for the bullying when there was none so yea it’s a smart idea to go against the mom’s wishes and have the girl say the other girl is bullying again. I’m just done with the school I’m at. Some of the children are so disrespectful I wish I could beat some sense or respect into them. The adminstration doesn’t back us up at all. They just let them pick shit out of a prize box or let them do what they want. I wish I could just hide in a corner and not have to deal with the naughty ones. It’s been a week. Friday needs to hurry up and get here.

So I have diaries from when I was in middle school that I just found so I’m trying to add them here so I have them on a computer. I believe I was in 8th grade for these ones.
Today I was going to sleep in until 10:30 AM because I didn’t have to be at school to pick up my check until 11:30 AM but Colleen had to wake me. I was having this wonderful dream. My dream was that it was the last day of school and we were going to watch a movie ahnd Mike was sitting with his friends and I was sitting with Tyson and Nicole Rausch. Every few minutes would look to see if Mike was still with his friends. One time I looked and he was gone. Then he came over and covered my eyes with Tyson’s stocking cap and he said “guess who.” Then he started playing with my hair and then started tickling me, and then he laid his head on my shoulder. Then Nicole said “why don’t you just do it on the table.” Next I said “eeh! Nicole you’re sick and then under my breath I said “I wouldn’t care” and Nicole said “what did you say?” and I replied “nothing” At 1:30 pm Mr. Dillard picked me up for b-ball camp at East. When I got to East I saw a lot of girls I knew like Kim Skaggs, Bianca Black, Tiara Green, and some other girls I knew. It was fun but also hard on my feet. I might get to go to Magic Waters on Weds. Mike called me at 8:50 pm and we talked . Better go.
So Mike is short for Michaelangelo my fat ass ex bf. His family owned a pizza place in my town called Luigi’s. His younger brother Diseppe  was really annoying. Tyson was the guy who friend zoned me pretty much. Everyone said we should date and he of course said I only want to be your friend.

So work has been interesting to say the least. Since the last time I wrote thatthere has a been a female 3rd grade student who has put her hands on the teacher on 3 different occasions because the teacher told her she was going to call her mom because she has been doing NOTHING work related. NOTHING has been done with her. She has not been suspended once for putting her hands on staff. I just don’t understand it. Then we still have a 5th grader who acts like a 2 year old when he doesn’t get his way. It’s gonna be interesting to see what happens next year. I’m just done with this year. It needs to hurry up and be over with. We have school until June 3rd. Oh and get this last Thursday I had my evaluation that part wasn’t so bad. I got a decent evaluation. The bad part came after when me and the dean lady were talking. She asked if maybe I could use a break from the room from time to time so I was like ok I’m willing to try it. Monday rolls around and the dean emails my teacher and asks what parts of the day she doesn’t necessarily need me. I was like wait a minute why is she trying to make a schedule when we discussed it I said from time to time not every day. Oh and supposedly I sometimes trigger the kids like the little 3rd grader who tried to choke the teacher she talked disrespectfully to me telling me to shut up talking to her, leave her alone, shut my mouth. So she had the nerve to come ask me for one of MY coloring sheets that I brought with my own money. I told her since she has been disrespectful to me I don’t want to let her color one of my sheets until she could treat me better. Is that wrong?  I purchased them with my own money and I gave them to other students who treat me respectfully. Well anyway back to the break issue. So they have basically turned me into a building para which is a para who helps out all over the building that’s not my job title. My job title is instructional para which is supposed to mean I’m in the self-contained room to help exclusively in there so confused on how I became a building para. So yea that’s been my last few weeks. I’m ready to be done with this year.

Well my summer is officially over in 2 days. I’m not sure if I’m ready for it be over. I’m at a new school this year like a brand new just built new school. So I’m excited to be in a new school and getting to see my old kids but I’m going to be with a new teacher and I’m not too sure about that whole thing. I was with my other teacher for 2 years and it wasn’t either of our choices to be separated. It was the principal. I guess I will try to update some time next week.

I’m not sure what is exactly going on with me. I just feel depressed. Not like I’m gonna kill myself depressed. I just feel like I’m here but nobody gives a shit that I’m here. My husband works all the time. I’m the main one trying to keep the house clean and actually giving a shit about it being clean. I get tired of feeling like a maid and when I do sit and watch some shows or just do me then I’m lazy or the fact I sit in a chair and use a picker upper type thing to pick things up. I’m still cleaning my back just starts hurting if I stand too long or have to keep bending down constantly. I’m not trying to say anything bad about my husband I appreciate that he works so hard for us I just wish we had more time together and then when we do have time together he wants to do stuff I don’t like doing especially after I’ve been cleaning all day and he wants to go on a hike or for a walk. I would rather get the house cleaned up. Maybe that’s part of my problem. Then right now he’s the only one working til Tuesday when we start back to school so that doesn’t help stuff because we don’t have money to do much of anything let alone pay the bills.

420,https://www.opendiary.com/m/torturedsoul_1/rocky-start-to-the-year-5508446/,2019-09-10,rocky start to the year,"
Well my year has been interesting. There are 2 students that are the main ones to not listen. One is a boy who had a teacher who I was told basically had no business teaching. She had no classroom management skills and the kids basically did what they wanted. She didn’t particularly care for the boy and picked on him from what I was told. So now he thinks he can just do what he wants. He has left the room but the interesting thing with our door is once you leave the room you can’t come back in unless you have a swipe card. So we just left him in the hallway. He stopped doing that thankfully but still has a hard time listening. The other student is a girl. She’s a interesting one. She has Downs syndrome and maybe some other stuff going on. Last year at whatever school she was at they didn’t collect any data on her and the teacher just wanted her out of her room so they wanted to put her in a PLUS room which is where nonverbal and mostly kids in wheelchairs who have profound disablities go. Mom didn’t like that choice so she claimed that the district wasn’t educating her daughter but the problem is mom lives with grandma. Grandma believes that this girl will grow up to be a doctor. She’s supposed to be in 4th grade and doesn’t even know how to write her name. No offense but I think grandma is delusional. Plus grandma’s idea is to spank her with a switch like that’s going to help the girl improve. I believe in disclipine but it has to be with someone who understands why they are being disclipined and I don’t think she has the capability to understand that so grandma may be getting a response of sorts but I believe it’s the just the girls response to being spanked like she’s fearful of it but doesn’t comprehend why she’s being hit. So I talked to her para from last year and heard she’s a sweet girl who is just a little stubborn and will hit if she gets excited. What we got to see is a completely different girl. Last Friday she literally almost hit every kid in our class, she won’t stay seated, she tips her desk over so many times that she broke it. She destroyed our room and the principal’s office yesterday. Like something major is going on with this girl. I’m thinking she’s just having a tough time adjusting but I can’t blame the principal for not wanting to deal with this all year. Then the girl got a 1-on-1 para even though she’s already in a self contained class and I’m the class para. The para told me that she’s been a para for 19 years and that she did self contained for like 7 years got bones actually broken by students and that she didn’t want to work with this girl. The para is a building para which basically means you help students with special needs but you go to different rooms. She told another para they either make her a kindergarten para or she’s gonna quit. So we will see how that plays out. The principal said she wants to meet with me and the building para so I’m a bit worried. I will try to fill everyone in on that tomorrow after school. The poor teacher I’m working with is brand new to teaching so she’s at wit’s end and actually started crying to the vice principal on Friday because of the student going around hitting everyone. Something else I find interesting is that mom is convinced that she needs to be in a regular classroom. I hate to say this but if she was put in just a regular room someone will beat the living crap out of her when she decides to hit someone. I would rather my child be in a self contained room if they can’t keep their hands to themselves than in a regular room because for 1 it’s a smaller class size and 2 he kids are pretty understanding compared to a regular room. Some of those kids don’t care if someone has a disability if they touch them it’s on. So that’s been my first week and half .

So I’m no longer in the 3rd grade self I am now in the 5th grade self contained. It’s interesting to say the least. Thankfully there’s not too many violent students in there but there is a big, tall girl in there that could do some damage if she got angry enough thankfully it’s only been a few times with her hitting other students. Both students she has been in a room with last year. One boy does get a bit annoying if he doesn’t take his meds. He has severe ADHD. So when he doesn’t take meds he’s touching other kids and saying things to them. The other girl the big girl has a issue with supposedly said something about her godcousin that is in the 3rd grade self contained room so they have had beef since last school year but they are getting along better but it’s a day to day relationship lol. Then there’s a boy who is super tall to be in 5th grade who is constantly touching other kids, taking things from them. I gave one of my kiddos that I’ve known since kindergarten a squishy stress ball because he gets really anxious and has been chewing on his fingernails til he has no nail left. This other boy kept taking the ball from him and messing with it and eventually busted it TWICE. Then there’s my friend Jimmy. I’ve been with Jimmy for 2 years. This will be my 3rd year being with him and it’s seeming to be getting worse for the meltdowns. He had meltdowns with us as well but usually we figured things out but since his dad has landed himself back in jail things have been getting worse in the meltdown dept. He didn’t want to go to his reading group because he claimed it was boring but also said it was too loud. Jimmy is very low like a kindergarten level and it’s hard to tell if that’s what’s bothering him or if it’s the situation with his dad. He also refused to go to specials because he claimed it was too loud. Jimmy sees calm down corner or going for a walk as a punishment but for whatever reason when the big tall girl talks to him he seems to listen to her which is weird but hey whatever works. So yea that’s my room for now. I feel bad for the 3rd grade teacher because she has the girl that hits and got another student who is a boy who hits,kicks, bites, scratches, pinches when he doesn’t get his way and according to my friend who is also a para and has been with him for a few years said mom sells his medication and doesn’t give it to him. DCFS has been called numerous times and nothing has been done. Even his GRANDMA called and still nothing. I wasn’t given a official reason why I got switched a week before this boy got put in her room . I was only told that the 5th grade room needed a para and that the CNA who is from a temp agency was just that a TEMPORARY person and that after our computer system was fixed because someone hacked our system that the job would be posted and since it was a new school EVERYONE would want to come work there. WRONG!! I’ve been a para for going on 6 years. No one wants to work with special needs kids. It takes a lot of patience and abuse from someone to want to deal with this population of kids.
Now that I’ve vented about the school situation let me vent about my halloween party. So the original plan was I was going to have my party at my co-worker/friend’s house. I worked with this person for 2 years. I love her to death she is a awesome teacher and truly wants to change the world for the kids. I’ve invited to pretty much everything I’ve done from game nights to my bday parties to now my halloween party. I had told her that I didn’t like doing parties at my house because our apartment stinks from animals and that our place is pretty much falling apart. So maybe a week ago she offered for me to throw my party at her house. The party was supposed to start around 4 and I was going to stop by around 3 to decorate. Well I got a text from her husband around 1130ish saying that the friend was heading to somewhere with her parents because her grandma was rushed to the hospital. So my worry is what if she’s making it up so she didn’t have to host the party. I really hope she didn’t but my mind still thinks that. Literally even if she had gone through with hosting it would have been her and my other friend and her bf who showed up. My kid decided at the last minute to go and his 2 friends came too but he had told me he didn’t want to go since I said something about doing the party and even earlier he said he was gonna go with a friend to something but changed his mind. This whole trying to do stuff with my friends drives me crazy and makes me feel so sad. I just feel left out on a lot of stuff. Like a while back this friend posted a pic of her and the other teacher I worked with earlier this school year at some dining place and I felt bad because I wasn’t invited. Just someone inviting me somewhere would be ok but no one ever does. It makes me feel like no one gives a shit about me or I’m a boring person. I don’t drink but neither does this friend but I just feel like people make up excuses to not want to hang out with me. I literally have 1 friend that will hang with me and with my husband working all the time I love to do game nights or even go bowling or out to eat or even like at a park or something but I don’t seem to be worth anyone’s time. It truly hurts to no end. Life sucks!!!! Then there’s a police officer in our city who has done great things to help people in the community. I’ve met him a few times and I even asked him to come speak to our class last year a few times. He is very caring and truly wants to change the community. Well he was put on adminstrative leave in May because of a investigation and I just found out the other day he was arrested and charged with sexual assault. I truly don’t believe he did it. He’s a very handsome man and I truly believe he either didn’t give in to a lady’s advances and so that lady wanted to get back at him or she tried to bribe him and he didn’t give in so she made false accusations against him. I am totally in support of victims of sexual assault but there’s just something that doesn’t add up about this whole thing. Like I said he’s a handsome guy so I highly doubt he would need to rape any lady. I think someone is jealous of his success and wanted to knock him down a few notches. I guess we will see how this plays out but I hope he is not guilty because he truly seems like a genuine person who cares about our community.

So last week we were thinking Halloween and the day after were going to be horrible. Well it actually went better than we were hoping but this week I don’t know if these kids are a sugar high or what but it’s been pretty bad this week. Yesterday the big, tall girl jumped off the teacher’s desk and then proceeded to destroy our classroom. I should have taken a pic of the chaos. OMG and this was while I was taking my friend Jimmy on a walk because he had a meltdown about something dumb. Then my other friend with ADHD was having a rough day because he ran out of meds and couldn’t get them yet so I had to take him out of specials early because if he would have stayed I’m pretty sure someone would have beaten the snot out of him. Then today same kid didn’t have meds and as soon as I walked into the pod area to go to the gen ed class where our kids go for morning meeting the gen ed teacher is telling me she doesn’t want him in the room because he’s threatening to stab one of her students. Then my teacher had to go for a IEP meeting so we had a sub and it was a sub we had previously that the kids didn’t care for because she wasn’t playing their bullshit and she had a background in self contained. So I asked my old teacher I worked with who is also self contained 4th grade if my ADHD friend had any issues could he go in her room which she was cool with so thats where he ended up going because he was irritating the other kids. Special went better than I thought it would so that was good. Then the tall guy started up his crap in the afternoon touching people, he squeezed out a female student’s chapstick all over his hands and was putting santizer all over the teacher’s stuff. It was ridiculous. Some days I feel like I’m in a zoo. I’m so ready for bed and its only 330 here where I live. They literally drain the life out of you. They are little energy vampires.

Well Thursday night my husband ended up in the hospital. He went to light our ancient stupid heater because the pilot light had went out but the gas was still on so when he went to light it poof. He got first degree burns on his face and is missing a eyebrow, a eyelash and got 2nd degree burns to his hand. The worse part was his hand so now he’s off work til Tuesday. So tonight there was a veterans moonlight bowl and I asked my old teacher Mrs. Spangler if she wanted to go with me because originally my husband was gonna be working and she said yes but of course something came up AGAIN and she never showed. The thing that irritates me about this is almost everything I invited her to she found a excuse not to go but she can make it to dinners and other stuff with other teachers or friends. I feel like I’m getting the shit end of the stick. If you don’t want to go just say you don’t want to go. I would rather you be honest than make up excuses. The moonlight event was fun anyway and my husband just used his opposite hand so at least we got to spend some time and the people on our lane with us were pretty cool. Just I guess life doesn’t want me to have any friends to enjoy things with. It would be nice
"
424,https://www.opendiary.com/m/torturedsoul_1/violet-rip-5537793/,2019-11-17,Violet RIP,"
So my cat Violet that I’ve had since she was a kitten started losing weight quickly and just not acting like herself so we took her to the vet when we noticed she had stopped eating which is serious in cats. If they don’t eat for 48 hours I believe it is they form something called hepatic liver or “fatty liver”. Their liver basically turns to fat and makes their other organs start shutting down. So we took her to the vet Thursday night they hospitalized her and found out she had liver issues and was anemic. So they put her on fluids and some other meds and she was improving the first few days but then Friday when they called with an update they said she seemed to be getting worse and then Saturday morning they called us and said she had passed away. I feel guilty about the whole thing mainly because I was trying to help out one of my son’s friends moms. She has a colony of cats literally in her backyard so she took in a lot of them. She unfortunately isn’t a expert in this kind of thing so she didn’t get blood work done on the kittens. She was able to find out they carry the herpes virus but I’m guessing didn’t get bloodwork on more serious conditions like FeLV or FIV. FeLV is feline leukemia and is pretty much fatal to any cat who gets it. Not like instantly but over time and it’s making me think that’s what Violet had and I believe another one of my cats has as well. My husband is going to take our other cat whose name is Leo tomorrow when he goes to pick up the paw print from Violet. The good thing is Leo is at least eating still but he’s very lethargic and has some of the other symptoms Violet has. So my guilt is the fact I should have gotten the kittens tested for those things BEFORE I brought them into my house. So IF they test positive for this disease more than  likely that means I just sentenced my cats to death which really sucks and then I feel bad for the kittens because that basically means they might not live that long either and they will be stuck with us because I’m not adopting them to someone and make that person’s cats sick too. So I got myself into a big mess just trying to help someone else out. It SUCKS!!

425,https://www.opendiary.com/m/torturedsoul_1/sorry-its-been-so-long-24-5566933/,2020-01-19,sorry it’s been so long,"
So about 2 weeks after Violet passed away another one of our cats passed away. Leo was his name. He had the same symptoms as Violet but we still aren’t sure what happened to either one of them. None of my other cats are sick so no clue. Work has its moments. We have a few kids that are usually our major issues. One whose name is Leiajha is a big african amercian girl who is tall. Before I came into the room she would walk out a lot but she has been doing better. Some days are better than others. Recently she kept telling us that her mom went to Texas and that she was gonna be gone for 3 months and that they were going to be moving there. Well unfortunately Leiajha lies a LOT so we didn’t believe but her grandma is watching her and her sister and I believe brother confirmed her story so hopefully March she will be gone. The other one is Davontay who is another african american student who is tall. He likes to touch people and call them names and of course tries to say he is being framed pretty much because he didn’t do it even though he will do stuff right in front of us. The other kids in the room really don’t like him and I can’t blame them. Another one is Jayquan. Jayquan is touches people and does annoying things but usually when he is not medicated. He is a little guy so Davontay and Leiajha like to mess with him a lot. Most of our class was in the same class last year which for some of them I don’t understand why you would  put them back together again knowing all the issues from the previous year. So christmas was pretty good this year. The only bad thing was my brother was in a mental hospital during that time. Something has been going on him with since after Thanksgiving and I’m not sure what it is. He was swearing at his staff and they didn’t do anything or say anything to him. He literally told his staff when they told him that they were going to call me that I could kiss his white ass. Not sure where he’s getting this stuff from. He’s been in the hospital 2 more times since then and is currently in the hospital right now. My mom ended up getting double pneumonia and ending up in the hospital for a few days after Christmas. She’s doing better. My birthday wasn’t too bad but the one person that said she would come SURPRISE SURPRISE didn’t show and had a crappy excuse about her phone crashing. What does that have to do with coming to my party? My new years was lonely as usual. Other than that just working and helping out with basketball team. They have lost 2 games and just won their first game yesterday. I was so excited and proud of them. Not much else to really write about but I do need to start writing in here more just so tired after work that all I want to do is just sit and relax.

This past week at has been a rough one. Davontay has been very annoying and it was nice when he didn’t come for a few days. Leiajha has been doing good but I think that’s only because the behavior lady made a deal that if she does good for 10 days she will get her mcdonalds. In fact she gets her mcdonalds on Monday. She only had 1 bad day when she lost her temper because she lost 1 point on her sheet and destroyed our room. She didn’t go after anyone or swear or anything. Jayquan did pretty good I have to get on him from time to time about messing with people but he does pretty good. Basketball has been going good. They now won 2 games and lost 3. Nothing else exciting going on outside of work.

427,https://www.opendiary.com/m/torturedsoul_1/my-last-few-weeks-2-5576103/,2020-02-08,my last few weeks,"
I don’t know what is going on with these kids. It’s hard working with kids especially ones who have learning disabilities and ADHD but also the ones who have shitty home lives. I have one Jayquan he’s always kinda smelly but that could be because he doesn’t like to take baths. He has different clothes on every day so I don’t think it’s neglect. We have two that are cousins one Izic I’ve known since kindergarten. His mom had him when she was 14 and I still don’t think she has her stuff together but she has a job and is going to school so I guess it’s better than it has been. I know Izic came to me last year and told me that mom’s bf was mean to her and would yell at her. I asked him if he put his hands on her or him he said no. Mom was pregnant at the time. He told me that he was terrified to go to sleep because he was afraid the bf would kill them in their sleep. What do you say to that? My heart was broken for him. I think things have gotten better. Antonio I just met this year. His stepdad was beaten to death with a bat and metal pipe. I’m sure its super hard on mom because Antonio usually doesn’t show up until like 930. They claim that it’s because of Antonio’s younger sisters but I don’t know. He recently said to me that they don’t have much food in the house so I got him in a program we have at school called bookbag buddies where they rent bookbags and get them filled every Thursday with food. Leiajha is my bigger girl who has a LOT of issues. Her mom is currently in Texas looking for work and a house. They are supposed to be moving in March. She has a history of lying, mental issues and she’s been in juvie. She has good moments but unfortunately the bad outweigh the good. Contrell I’ve known for 3 years. When he first came to us dad had just gotten out of jail and mom abandoned him and was into drugs and such and grandma had custody. When grandma had him he was medicated, on time and at school and his behavior was improving. Grandma wanted to give him a chance at raising him so she let dad take over but I think grandma is regretting that decision because dad won’t even put her as a emergency contact for Contrell. He NEEDS medication and dad claims that he can’t get it which I don’t believe. Dad doesn’t seem to realize that all this letting Contrell stay home just because is gonna catch up to him in the future. Middle school is much faster paced than grade school and unfortunately Contrell will just get lost in the shuffle if he doesn’t start being at school. Its sad because Contrell is a kind, loving kid who is smart but I think all these days off just because isn’t helping him. Last school year he was gone for a total of 60 days and this year so far he’s at 35 for being absent and like 25 for tardy. That’s a issue. Davontay is our other tall kid. He has a lot of issues with impulsivity touching, saying things to others. Just basically trying to instigate things. We heard from the other kids that he was much worse last year than this year. Jimmy I’ve known for 3 years as well. This poor kid has a rough life. Dad has been in and out of jail. Mom is a lower IQ like Jimmy is. His little sister got hit by a car and the person took off of a few years ago. Thankfully she recovered. Mom just had  a baby this past year. This poor kid just doesn’t know how to deal with his emotions and then he has meltdowns. One meltdown he called me a fucking bitch, a fucking whore and told me to get my fucking hands off of him(which I didn’t have on him) I was blocking a door so he could calm down. In the 3 years I’ve known him he has NEVER swore at me no matter how angry he has gotten. I truly feel bad for him. Shomaria is lower IQ like Jimmy. Her and Leiajha had a lot of issues last school year at their past school. Things have gotten better between them but it seems some of the regular general ed girls like to pick on her. Her aunt tells her to not take any shit and fight them but mom doesn’t want her to do that. I guess the aunt threatened the principal one day. That’s why I love doing what I do because if I can bring some happiness to their day or make them forget something for a little while I’m for it. Even just be someone they can go to it’s worth it. They can call me whatever names they want to. I don’t let their words bother me because I understand some of them don’t mean what they are saying.

So next week for us is spring break and I’m so ready. It’s only Monday and today was a nightmare. My big student Leiajha has had a tough couple of weeks. Last week one of her grandmas died and today she came to school talking about her uncle was in a bad car accident. Her mom is in town because of the grandma stuff and honestly just needs to get the kids and take them back to Texas with her. So this morning Leiajha was getting upset about a test she had to take on the computer and just walked out of our pod and was at the side door when I went out. The social worker who is useless was out there and was like I’ll come out in 15 minutes I have to go with another student in one of the other 5th grade rooms. Thankfully I guess that student was busy so she came out but Leiajha had the door half open and was threatening to leave the building which usually is a phone call to the cops so the social w0rker said to her if you leave we are going to have to call the cops and that she would give her 1 minute before she called. Thankfully Leiajha came in and went with the social worker back to her office. The rest of the morning went good. Leiajha came up with a idea about a school supply store where the kids could purchase supplies with golden tickets they can earn by being good. So the store is in the process but I’m waiting to hear back from the principal because I only have limited supplies and no extra money to buy other things and according to the principal after the items run out that is going to be it. So it’s in limbo because she still hasn’t written back to me because I told her the only supplies I have are notebooks and folders and not many of either so I need help purchasing other items or I don’t think there is a point of having a store and especially with her moving soon because the principal said after she moves the store will be done. So after lunch Leiajha starts talking about us planning stuff and I was like we already did the planning part and I’m basically waiting to hear back from the principal about my issue so she got mad and started kicking our classroom door which is clear glass. The teacher called a BIS or behavior interventionist to come down and the BIS talked to her for a few minutes and then left. After that she came into the classroom and started throwing little bins of markers and colored pencils on the floor. So the teacher tried ” clearing” the room but Leiajha stood in front of the classroom door and wouldn’t let us go out into the pod area. The teacher told her it was a safety issue and she needed to move out of the way of the door to which Leiajha wouldn’t listen. Thankfully the assistant principal came about that time and he asked her to go out in the pod to talk to him which she refused and then was claiming he was putting his hands on her which he wasn’t because the teacher was standing right near as a witness in case of that situation. So eventually he gets her calmed down enough to go back into the room and she picks up her mess and things go back to normal UNTIL….. she sees the teacher hand a ziploc bag of OObleck to a student that was at school on Friday but he had to leave early so we made him one and he had to wait til today to get it. So she starts getting on and on about how it’s not fair that we made it while she wasn’t here and we tried to explain to her that she wasn’t the only student that didn’t get to make it. We only have 13 students in our room because of it being a self contained room and like half the kids were gone on Friday. So she just walked out again which worked because it was almost dismissal time anyway. I’m hoping she gets sick or just decides to stay home tomorrow OMG. Then our tall guy had issues on Wedsnesday last week messing with a few different students and he ended up getting OSS or out of school suspension and will be back tomorrow. We were emailed and told that if he makes fun of any students, calls them names ect. that we are to tell him to stop once. If he still continues to not listen and do whatever it is then I’m to bring him down to the office with some work. The sad part is it took someone’s grandpa to have to come down to the school for us to get to this point. The grandpa told me that the next time the tall boy puts his hands on his grandson he is pressing charges against him. I told him I totally agree with you. So we will see how tomorrow goes.

So this past week didn’t go too bad. It helped that Davontay wasn’t there and neither was Leiajha. Thursday the teacher I work with had to call in so we had a sub. It was a resource teacher so it wasn’t too bad but then Leiajha showed up and we were both worried that the day wasn’t going to go good but she had a pretty good day. She got a little upset in art when she took one of the teacher’s sharpies without permission and the teacher was kinda lecturing her about it. Then when the social worker came in her for her group session Leiajha didn’t want to go in the room and I told her she had to because of the minutes. I told her if she wanted to she could just chill in our chill out corner and not participate but she came in and did participate. Friday was a different story. The teacher was back and she was having a rough day. I think she was gonna miss us. She started the day out by refusing to take off her coat. Then she got upset and started throwing baskets of markers, colored pencils, dry erase boards all because the teacher had to help other kids log on to the computer and I was busy helping a student at the time too. Then she snatched a basket of fidgets out of another student’s hand and threw them on the floor so the teacher and the rest of the kids went into the pod except one student who was helping me santize our headphones so she followed them out into the pod and then started throwing wet paper towels at the same student as before so then the teacher tried to take the class for a walk around the building but that didn’t work either so she finally just told them to go down near the office but the kids actually went into the office lol. So the student that was with me I was trying to rush him out of the room so we could go join the other students. So we run down the hallway I get the other students out of the office and I’m about to have them go sit down and read some books until we can go back to class but about that time the teacher signals for them to come back so we go back to the room and it’s pretty close to lunch time so they go to recess and lunch and everyone comes back to the room. Leiajha picks up all the stuff she threw across the room but the teacher informed her that she would have to go into the gen ed room while we watched a movie because of her behavior from earlier. So then she decided to unhook all the cords to our smartboard and stood in front of it so no one could see anything so we had to call the BIS back down for her. The BIS told us we could go into her office and watch the movie since according to Leiajha if she couldn’t watch it no one would be. So I’m taking the kids down to the BIS office and here comes Leiajha so I let the kids run down the hallway and we can shut the certain sets of doors and then kids can’t get out unless they are with someone who has a badge. So we get into the BIS office and maybe like 2 seconds later there’s Leiajha outside the door so we start setting up to watch the movie and then the assistant principal opens the door and lets Leiajha in and I explain to him that Leiajha isn’t supposed to be in there with us and he says we can go back to our room and he will stay with Leiajha but she has different plans. So maybe 4 or 5 of the kids make it into the pod and I have 3 kids with me and we see Leiajha need the door we need to go in and she starts walking to the other door so I tell the kids to run to the door. Well she turns around and starts coming towards us and the door but the assistant principal blocks her and we all run in. After that she is with the assistant principal til the end of the day and the rest of the kids get to watch their movie. It was a interesting day for sure. Then we find out that our governor has closed all the schools so now we aren’t going back to school until after March 30th. So the only problem with that is we aren’t sure about how we are going to get paid for the week we aren’t in school. The governor said we can apply for unemployment so I’m gonna try to do that on Monday. Hoping its only that one week we are off.

It’s so weird these days. You never really realize how many freedoms you get until you get them taken away. I have mixed feelings about not having to go to work. I’m happy we got a break but then after a while it starts to become boring and you wish you were back at school dealing with kid’s bullshit. Weird how that is. I truly miss my students and really wish I could talk to them. I sent notes out and a few got back to me but not many and our school made a video with the teachers doing signs or quick videos. It was cool. I’ve been keeping myself busy by volunteering to pass out meals to families in our district who need it. We do the social distancing and its a way for me to get out of the house and feel like I’m doing something positive besides sitting on my fat ass all day watching youtube, hulu, netflix or playing video games. I have about a million pictures I need to organize which I’ve slowly been doing but I’m waiting for some more to come from shutterfly before I do more. Hoping everyone else is doing well and staying safe and healthy. I try to keep my distance from my mom because she is diabetic, has heart issues and just got over double pneumonia in January so I only take her out to go get groceries every few weeks and my son has been nice to do her shopping for her.

431,https://www.opendiary.com/m/torturedsoul_1/my-opinion-about-race-issue-5862742/,2020-06-26,my opinion about race issue,"
So I’m a white woman who has a lot of (african american, black, brown, POC) friends or acquaintances. I love everyone and could give a shit less what color you are and that’s the honest truth. It seems like no matter what us white people say or do we are wrong. I was in a teacher group on FB and I said I don’t see people by their color which is true I don’t I was told I’m “color blind” and that I needed to learn about diversity and they wouldn’t have their children in my class because I said I treat each and every one of my kids equally. I have the rule you treat me with respect I’ll do the same and I try to teach them that their actions have consequences and that it doesn’t have anything to do with race. I understand that some students don’t respect me because I’m white and I’m fine with that or they use the “it’s because I’m black isn’t it?” NO it doesn’t have a thing to do with you being black it simply comes down to you need to be held accountable for your actions. Then I have a biracial friend that every post I put on FB about police officers she says F*ck the police. OK I understand where she’s coming from but why every single post. I personally can’t say I’ve been discriminated by the police but I also don’t run from the police, argue with them, make shit harder than it needs to be and I know not all POC do that stuff either but watch a episode of COPS or Live PD and it’s interesting how many argue, run or just do dumb stuff but they can’t understand why SOME of the police do what they do. I’ve said this everything has a good and bad to it. Every job, every race, every thing. I agree we need to get rid of the bad ones who are just cowards with a badge that want to share their hatred and judgement but there are so many good ones too.  There is a officer on FB named I think Officer Norman. White cop that goes into the housing projects and hangs out with the kids, he goes to the elderly and checks in on them making sure they are OK. Some in my own community that do so much good. I don’t judge every POC so why does it feel like they group us all together. The whole world just needs to learn understanding even if they don’t agree with everything someone does or says. I try not to argue about the cop stuff because POC are right we don’t understand what it feels like to live in their skin but they don’t understand what its like to live in our skin too. I lived in a housing project when I was in my teens. I hated it besides the few friends I made . 2 people were POC. These ladies are my best friends. Me and my biracial friend were literally  2 out of the 3 WHITE families that lived there and the others did not like us being there. I was punched in the mouth by a POC who was 12 who accused me of hitting him with a basketball and I  had never seen him before in my life so no clue how I could hit someone I never saw before. Rioting is another thing that a lot of POC are upset about. I’m totally with them if they want to protest beceause I feel they have a right to do that but I truly don’t understand what is the purpose to rioting and destroying property  that has nothing to do with the protest. I also have heard by POC stop using MLK. Why can’t I? MLK made change and I’m sure if some POS hadn’t assassinated him he would have made a lot more of it. With MLK he faced some horrific things :people bombing his house, spitting on him and his protestors, threatening to murder him,being thrown in jail and so much more but did he resort to violence or revenge? NO he just kept boycotting things and protesting WITHOUT violence. That’s why I talk about MLK and use him. He knew how to do a peaceful protest and still made some change even with so much to lose. Then there is the vandalism of historic figures and taking down statues and pretty much rewriting history. Abraham Lincoln was the one who freed POC from slavery so why are people destroying statues of him? To me what is the point of trying to erase history? I don’t understand it. Yea slavery was awful and some of the things done through history were too but by trying to erase it it isn’t going to fix what’s going on today.
 
I love this song because it has different sides to it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSurzeGvPrQ.
Theres another song by joyner lucas called I’m not racist but I won’t share the link because it does have racist slurs in it so parental discretion advised  but it has a good point to it and has 2 sides of it.
 
I don’t want to lose any POC friends I have or this whole thing. I just try my best to see others opinions on this situation without judging. It’s very hard but that’s the only way there is going to be change and I know there are many people who just don’t get it from any perspective.

So back in June I had a lot of medical tests done and I have found out a lot of info which has helped shed light on some of my issues I’ve been having. I’m tired all the time and I just feel like crap a lot. I would post it all but it is a LOT of stuff. I have found out that my brain hormones are all out of whack and it makes a lot of sense because I seem to be more depressed than usual and I just don’t have the motivation some days to want to do anything besides my joints and muscles hurting. Like I can’t even walk to the end of my block without being in severe pain. My husband has good intentions but he just doesn’t get it and it drives me crazy. He doesn’t listen to me and that makes me more upset. Like he wants to go on hike but if I can’t even make it to the end of the block there’s no way I can do a hike and I really want to but my back and legs hurt SO bad. It just makes me more depressed about stuff. I’m really worried about going back to school because I don’t want to get COVID or me to give it to anyone in my house. I miss the kids and I miss getting out of my house but I don’t think it’s safe to go back to school just yet.

I live in IL and we went back to school the day after Labor Day. It hasn’t been too bad. I work in a SCCC class which stands for self contained cross category class. I work with students who have learning disabilities for the most part but could have autism, downs, or other impairments along with their learning disability. We have 9 students right now and one got sent home on Friday with COVID symptoms. She disclosed to me when we were going outside for gym class that she had thrown up the night before but didn’t want her mom to know because then she couldn’t go to her grandma’s house. I asked her if she had thrown up that day and she said no but that she felt like she was going to.  We just found out yesterday that her test was negative which was awesome and I believe she went back today. I stayed home today because I get vertigo and it’s pretty bad to the point I can’t get out of bed because the room is spinning so much and if I do I have to be very careful I don’t fall down. Usually it goes away if I sleep for a few extra hours which it did. The teacher I’m working with this year I was supposed to work with last year but mysteriously I got transferred to work with a different self contained class in the building. I loved the teacher I worked with last year but she was terrified of a student that was going to be in our class this year so she decided to go back to middle school which I don’t blame her. This student has a very foul mouth and just says whatever comes to mind. So to be honest I was nervous about having her in the class too but thankfully she is doing remote learning for now. I have dealt with some pretty rough students especially one of the ones I had last year. I can deal with them swearing at me but I don’t put up with disrespect either so if the other girl would say something rude I would probably say something rude back to her. My building is super new. It opened last year and it’s pretty big but thankfully only one floor but with the COVID situation you basically have to walk ALL the way around the building so my sciatica has been REALLY bothering me and one of my knees that I fell on a few years ago has started bothering me too and then of course there is having to wear a mask most of the day. I understand why we have to but I’m so happy this year they have me going to specials,recess and we get mask breaks as well but it kills me when I have to go from one end of the building to the other. I’m overweight so that of course doesn’t help me either. I’m seriously considering quitting just because of the the fact I can’t breathe in the mask and I’m in pain every day. I just feel like I can’t do my job well  and that I’m letting everyone down. My husband is OK with me quitting because last year was a rough one so he said I came home upset quite a lot and then was not in a good mood with him or my son which I agree on. This year the class we have is not bad at all. The kids are really well behaved. So anyway the teacher i’m working with asked me to come chat with her about something towards the beginning of year saying that she heard I didn’t like her and that we didn’t have to be best friends but obviously we have to be able to work together which I don’t ever remember telling anyone I didn’t like her. There was a student we had last year when I was with her that she babied really bad and that drove me crazy because he would just leave the room but she would never write him up but if any of the other students did that she would write them up in a instant. The one thing I’ve learned working in a self-contained room you can’t treat certain students different than the others because then it causes meltdowns by the student or the others who don’t get to do what they get to do. The only other thing that bugged me and the teacher I worked with last year was my current teacher and a previous teacher I worked with became good friends which is awesome I have nothing against that BUT the problem I had was they would post pics on FB of them going out to eat with other school people but we never got invited to anything. It made us feel like we were on a deserted island by ourselves. So hoping this year goes well and most of the time I feel like I can suggest things to the teacher I work with. With her I’m almost afraid to suggest anything or even ask if she needs help with anything. I don’t know. Also possibly pretty soon they might be having the schools go remote because our positivity rate for COVID is up but according to the health dept. person the students who are getting it are not getting it from school or it’s not being transmitted through the schools. Something like that but we won’t be surprised if it does happen. Other than school stuff not much else going on. My husband’s birthday was yesterday and he seemed to enjoy it even though he didn’t get any gifts from us but they are on their way so this whole week he will probably be getting them. His mom is on hospice care and has dementia but he isn’t in contact much with her or his brothers. So yep that’s about it for now.

So I know its been a while since I have written. My situation with my teacher hasn’t gotten any better in fact it has gotten worse. She started sending me emails titled Daily summaries. Here is all the emails she sent to me:

Tuesday 10/6/2020


Overall good day today! We were able to get some more MAP done which is great. I need to have all the kids done by Friday. Adrian and Brisiana will be tested by you when they come back so I don’t have to give up whole group instructional time.






Important reminders:


-When MAP testing students if a student needs help please go to that student instead of helping them at the testing spot, that can cause a distraction to the student who is testing


-If I correct a student’s behavior please try not to make a comment following the correction (for example if I tell someone to pull their mask up please try not to be like MHMMMM or “Yea”)


-If a kiddo has an issue during specials I appreciate you telling me but please let the specialist tell me or wait until a different time to tell me rather than telling me in front of them or in front of other students.


-I have noticed and had some students and parents express that they feel that you target them or single them out, please be mindful of how many times a day you correct someone’s behavior, please also if you do correct behavior try to give them a compliment shortly after, a little goes a long way.
So her part about telling her when a student has a issue is very interesting because recently I was working with a student named April. The teacher has said that she doesn’t care for this student which I understand because I have students I don’t particularly care for either but I still treat them respectfully. So this day I was sitting near April during math time and April did well on  the first 2 problems that the class was doing. Mind you I’m not allowed to help the students during whole group math time which something is brought up later in the daily summaries about that situtation. So she did well on the first 2 problems but then the teacher tried to trick the kids and April got confused so the teacher came over near her and there happened to be another student that sat not too far from April and when April got nervous she looked over towards his area so she says out loud in front of the whole class” oh so you cheated off of Adrian.” I was like are you kidding me? How is her doing that any better than me talking about a students misbehavior in front of them at least with the student I was talking to her about it actually happened where as for April she wasn’t cheating I was sitting right there with her the whole time and she never once looked in Adrian’s direction until she made her nervous and she looked that way. 

The second part about she has witnessed me picking on students is bullshit. I even talked to the 2 former teachers I worked with and asked them if they noticed me doing that with students and they were like nope have never seen you do that. As for the parent complaint I know exactly who it was and I don’t understand why this student’s mom doesn’t care for me but I’ve known both her sons for quite a while and she lets them both get away with everything so it doesn’t shock me. The son that is in our class doesn’t eat anything. They are just now getting him to try stuff. I don’t sit with him at lunch because all he will do is avoid doing it and just keep talking to me. 


Daily Summary 10/7/2020


We finished MAP testing, YAY!!!! Adrian should be coming back to school either Friday or Monday, when he does return, we are going to need to test him right away. Brisiana should be back after next week, if the window is still open when she returns, we need to get her done as well. Tomorrow and Friday will be normal days. I should be having my informal observation coming up as well. Jesse is my evaluator so he will be popping in to observe.


Important reminders:


-Keep up the good work! 🙂
one of the few where she has something positive to say.



Daily Summary 10/8/2020


Long night for me so I apologize this is getting out late! I am super pleased with the fact that I was able to get some small groups done.


Important Reminders:


-Tomorrow is Friyay!



-When working on sight words with kids, I would like to be the one keeping the data on their data sheet. The kids should know what color they are working on by next week, I will assess them about every two weeks depending on the student and their need/ goals. Please do not have the same students doing sights word every day. It is important that each student is given an opportunity to practice and I would like them to complete other tasks.


-When I am doing small groups please be up and walking around to assist other students instead of sitting with the groups that are going on.


-During whole group math please make sure the students are trying the problems that I have put up before assisting them, I use their responses to help drive the upcoming questions and lessons. (My reply-For the whole group math are you referring to April or someone else because with April all I did was draw what you had up on the elmo and asked her what goes where and she did the rest.) I did this because April forgot her classes and I wasn’t sure that she could see what was on the board so I used a small dry erase board and drew out the problem but I didn’t solve anything for her. She did all the work by herself)
-her response- Yes, I am okay with your drawing what is on the board but I would not even ask her what goes where because the point is for her to do it independently, I would like to see if she is able to do the whole thing on her own instead of being asked what goes where because then that guides her. They were asked to place the numbers where they go on their own to show me that they are understanding the concept being taught and if they are meeting the learning target.
my reply-So I’m confused with what you want me to do then.
her reply-If you have time in the morning come in. We can discuss it then.(I did not go in because of our first conversation being negative)





Daily Summary 10/13/2020


Today went well. I appreciate your help with running a few copies and that you were up assisting students during math groups.


important reminders:


-Keep up the good work!


-If you need to take some sort of medicine please do not take it in the classroom in front of students, please make sure to do that in the bathroom or in private. Please also do not be taking those bottles out in the room either.


-When the students are working independently on tasks please continue to be up and walking around to assist all students rather than staying at one spot and helping just one student.


-If you have a reminder for me please write it down on a piece of paper or a post it and stick it on my desk, sometimes when you want to remind me something it disrupts instructional time. (For example: I know attendance is due at 8:00am, I do not need a reminder at 7:45 or 7:50 to complete attendance, if it gets to be 8:30 and you are unsure if I have taken it then please write that reminder for me.)


-Following up with reminders, if I forget to do something please do not point it out to the students, yes I make mistakes and I am not perfect and I own up and show my mistakes to the kids but they do not need to know that I was reminded and I still forgot (For example: Last week you reminded me to take attendance, things got crazy and I had to take care of somethings and I forgot, when a student reminded me I said thanks for the reminder and you made a comment to the student “See we even gave her a reminder and she still forgot” is hurtful to me and is a comment that the students do not need to hear.)

So for the medicine I brought in ibruphoen and tynelol because I was having issues with my knee and sciatica at the beginning of the year and I had bought the pill containers that you unscrew to put them in so there was a DAY where I was putting them into the pill containers and I did take some a few times in the room but none of the kids were paying attention to me but after the first few weeks I didn’t take them out again in the room so why she is bringing up something that happened the first few weeks of school I couldn’t tell you. Then there was the thing about reminding her about stuff. How petty can you be? There was one day I reminded her about the kids needing to take their ipads to specials with them and she was like I KNOW. I guess she didn’t think being a bitch to me hurt my feelings but I did apologize to her but never got a apology for her snapping on me. 






Daily Summary 10/19/2020


First off thank you so much for your help while I was gone and this morning. We were complimented with how well you and the students know their routine.


Important reminders:


-For morning meeting, I would like us to switch between gen ed rooms that we push into for morning meet just to make ourselves present in both rooms.


-Keep up the good work, I appreciate all that you do.
So the only reason she had something positive to say this time was because she had to be out a few days because she got sent home with COVID symptoms and was waiting for her test results so I was pretty much the sub and knew our routine and we did pretty good without her. 



Thursday 10/22/20


What a week! Thank you again for all your help last week and making things go smoothly. Also to follow up with Monday’s email even though we did touch on it, when in the Gen ed rooms yes we will switch days that we are in there, for example Monday and Friday you would be with one class and me with the other and Tuesday we switch and then the next week it would be flipped so whoever you were with on Friday you would be in the other room on Monday.


Important Reminders:


-When related service providers are in the room doing group please assist with behavior but do not help them with responses to the questions that they are asking the students, they are in the room to work with the students and their goals that they have. They use their responses for data collection towards their benchmarks and goals.


-When the students are taking any assessment of any kind especially pre/post-tests please do not help them at all with the assessment, I use their assessments as data to track their goals to set new goals for the class. Looking at some of the data it is apparent when a student is helped on an assessment when they are given a pre-assessment that is about something that is challenging and slightly above their level since they have no learned it yet and they do well on that assessment.


-When we are doing whole group activities or the students are taking an assessment please do not take that time as time to complete a word search or other leisure activities , instead please monitor the students making sure that they are on the correct question and on task.





Tomorrow is Friday!! 🙂
So for the assessment part of things it’s interesting that she wrote not to help on assessments but she does it after telling the students we are not helping them on it. As for the word search comment yea I did a  word search during their assessment but what else am I supposed to do when she is reading the questions and answers to them because they should be on task if she’s literally reading the whole thing to them and if they aren’t that’s not my problem because in another daily summary she says how she wants them to be independent. Well if she wants them to be independent then they should be paying attention when they are taking a assessment. 



Friday 10/23/2020


I apologize I’m sending this so late it was a crazy end of the day yesterday. What a week it was, the weekend was definitely earned!


Important reminders:


-When we are doing small groups during math and literacy please only working on the topics and skills that we have been addressing. I understand and am aware that some students are higher than others and can do the skills well, when doing extra practice with them please work on only the skills we have worked on during whole group. For example if a student has mastered two-digit addition without regrouping, please do not introduce them to addition without regrouping, there are certain skills and steps I would like them to use and I want to make sure they are fully ready for it. If they are choosing to do extra practice and they master it with you, you can encourage them to also do freckle math since that is at their level and independent practice.


-In response to your email about practicing for remote learning, you do not need to bring your personal laptop but rather we have a extra chrome book for you to use I’m not sure how much you will be able to utilize the devices when practicing since they will be mostly completing independent activities but we can get you set up just in case with a district device.





One more full week and then a extra day off, we got this!
So for this one I’m really confused on that one because if a student is higher what is the issue with starting them on the next skill because then at least they will be familiar with it. You can still teach the skills and steps but I don’t understand what’s wrong with getting them introduced to a new skill. 



Daily Summary 10/28/2020- 10/29-2020


Important Reminders:


-When we are practicing virtual learning please do not talk to the students or walk them through how to sign back into something. They need to be able to figure it out for themselves and walking them through it does nothing but teach them to be helpless and rely on us to always give them the answers.


-Please do not have the kids keep coloring sheets in their bins, it becomes a distraction to them, and they want to do that instead of their work.


-Please come to me with concerns or questions or suggestions please do not go to other staff members especially if it is regarding something we need for the classroom.

So when this summary was written the kids had only practiced virtual learning 2x . Remember me saying the kids in our class have learning disabilities. I’m guessing the teacher has forgotten this because it takes them longer to remember how to do things than most kids. Also she would say to the kids if you have a issue go to the goguardian chat and let me know you need help. Most of the kids in our room can’t spell well or read well so if they somehow managed to message her in the chat how would they be able to read what she wrote back to them? I asked her if we have text to speech for the go guardian chat so that way it could help them spell but also read her answer to them. Now if we had been practicing like every day and did it like 10x then yes I wouldn’t be helping them because by that time they should be able to log in and do what they need to without us but 2x no. Then there’s the issue of I don’t have the same things she does. I don’t have access to go guardian chat or even go guardian to monitor what they are on so I wouldn’t be able to help with anything. 
As for the coloring sheet those were going to be for a lockdown drill so the kids had something quiet to do so I figured it would save us time if they had it in their folder so then they could just pull it out and work it on while we were waiting for the drill to be done because of COVID they weren’t going to have us huddle together and hide in a corner. Guess I was wrong. 

The comment about going to other staff about things we need was because when the teacher was out my old teacher I worked with for 2 years was our sub and she was nice and got some headphones from the office so I had asked her if she could possibly get some more after hearing the teacher say that she paid for some headphones with her own money and the kids had already broken the ones she got for them. Honestly I would have told the kids to have their parents buy them some after they broke the first pair considering she wants them to be so independent. 

So this next part is a reply to this daily summary: “For the virtual learning the kids can’t reach out to me on go guardian chat like they can to you which is part of the problem. Also you have to realize that not all of them know how to use the go guardian chat that well. Does go guardian have the text to speech option for it? Because if not then students like Neveah have no way to tell you they are having problems. I watched Neveah sit there for a half a hour the other day because she had the weird login screen happen and she had no clue how to do the go guardian chat so she finally gave up and went to sleep.  I’m completely for them being independent especially when it comes to the virtual learning but we have to make sure everyone has the tools to make it successful. As for coloring sheets I was only passing them out so we didn’t have to worry about it and they would already have them in their folders for the drill. The last thing is concerning April. I understand you don’t care for her and I get it completely but it’s the empathy video the kids have been watching imagine how it feels to her when you are accusing her of cheating in front of everyone. I can promise you she was NOT cheating off of Adrian the other day. The first 2 problems she did completely by herself and she never once glanced in Adrian’s direction besides the fact the girl is blind as a bat without her glasses and Adrian’s screen was flat so how would she be able to see that far? She got confused when there was no ones and when you came over I think she started looking around because you make her nervous and same thing when she’s doing small group with you.”
her reply-

I really do not appreciate the tone of this email so I will not reply to it but rather you can come talk to me in the morning regarding these things because nothing in this email has anything to do with April or about her so please come talk to me in the morning.
my reply-
I don’t really think there’s anything else that needs to be discussed about it. I was just letting you know.



So after our first negative conversation I really don’t feel comfortable coming in to “talk” and my former teacher told me she didn’t think it’s a good idea to do a talk first thing in the morning because if it is a negative conversation then it would ruin my whole day which I agree on.  The teacher recently sent me a text message asking me to come in for a important chat first thing in the morning so the former teacher was like I wouldn’t. So she suggested that I ask if she could meet me with at lunch or afterschool. The teacher said that she couldn’t keep me from going out with the kids at recess even though she said it was going to be a quick 5 min convo and outside is well covered by lunch aides. Then she said for afterschool she had a meeting with the vice principal. I then asked why she couldn’t email  whatever it was and she was like it’s a in person conversation. I don’t want to do any in person conversations with her seeing as I’m pretty sure it’s going to be like our first conversation which didn’t go well. So now my union rep is involved .  I had a meeting with the principal a few weeks ago and she pretty much said she doesn’t want to be a referee between us and to act professionally. I’ve been acting way more professional than she has. The teacher won’t even speak to me. At least if she holds a door open for me I say thank you. So now the principal wants to have a meeting with me on Friday which I asked if my union rep could come to which she said she could so I guess I will update on Friday. I just want to be able to help do something. Like I’m not really allowed to help with anything. My old teachers would let me go over sight words with the kids and they would have me do small groups with a few kids but this teacher I literally sit and do nothing most of the day mainly because she won’t let me do anything. I’ve been a para for 7 years and I’ve never had a problem with a teacher except 1 besides this one. She has only been a actual teacher for going on 2 years and she’s younger than me so she thinks she knows everything. It drives me crazy. My former teacher was like you should bring up your concerns to the principal but seeing as she said she doesn’t want to referee I don’t think she cares about my side of things. Hoping something positive comes out of Friday but have a feeling it won’t.

Well it’s been quite a while. I will say for the most part things have gotten better with the teacher after we sat down and had a chat. There was a few issues this past week which I will talk about after I update about other things. So my xmas and New years didn’t go too bad . We didn’t really get together for Thanksgiving, Christmas or New Years because of COVID. We had to put our 16 year old dog down towards the end of January. I’m still getting over that. The first days after we put him to sleep we had ordered a pizza and we used to always give him our crusts I almost threw some on the floor and then thought to myself “oh wait Buck isn’t here anymore. Also the other day when it was really nice outside I was thinking it would be a great day to take Buck for a ride but he’s not here anymore. I can’t wait to get a house so I can get another dog. My husband said we won’t get another dog until we get a house. He is a veteran but somehow didn’t get his discharge papers from the army so we are trying to get those so we can start the process of trying to get a VA loan for a house. So other than that not much going on. I’m terrified to get the COVID vaccine because I have a lot of health conditions and have heard some pretty bad side effects from it. So this past week I got yelled at by my teacher because I switched a student’s med time from before lunch to after lunch because she was complaining about her stomach hurting  but didn’t tell the teacher so I will take the blame for the not telling part but she tried to say that it was my fault this student was acting out which is a lie because she doesn’t take meds until lunch time and this behavior issue was before lunch so whatever on that and it wasn’t the fact that I got yelled at it was the fact that the teacher did it in FRONT of the kids instead of pulling me aside. Then she made shirts for the kids and herself that said rockin in our crocs or something like that but she didn’t make me one. This one girl who supposedly doesn’t like me and to be honest I don’t care for her either was the one that said something about it. She was like why didn’t you make Ms. Michelle a shirt. The teacher’s reply I didn’t know what size she was. Really? You couldn’t have asked me or if she was too nervous to ask she could have asked the teacher that has known me for a few years to ask me. So part of the reason this student doesn’t like me is because she told me at lunch back in January that her mom gives her like half a pill of her brother’s medication. I was told to report it to DCFS. So the day I ended up reporting it to DCFS I was out sick and the day after I came back I was told by the teacher that she was very upset with me for calling and  the  student tried to tell me she was joking with me about it but either way I would have had to make the call. So I did what I had to do. This particular student never shuts up so the teacher can’t teach much when she’s there. It’s a hot mess and she drives me crazy and I let the teacher deal with her. Then something interesting I was told by my former teacher that she was going to a different school. The funny thing is I know a teacher that would be teaching in the same kind of room she would be at the school so I messaged her and asked her if she was leaving or if it was someone else. She told me another teacher was retiring and what the teacher’s name was so I gave her the teacher I work withs name and she was like that name doesn’t sound familar. So she said that there was a teacher who was accepted for the job but the teacher turned it down or something else happened so my question is if she isn’t going to the school she claimed where is she going? I’m hoping somewhere else so I won’t have to deal with her next year and the teacher I used to work is going back to be a full time teacher so hopefully we get to work together next year but it’s wait and see. So that’s about all I have to update about right now.
"
436,https://www.opendiary.com/m/torturedsoul_1/cant-wait-for-the-end-of-this-school-year-6002649/,2021-05-22,can’t wait for the end of this school year,"
So it has been hit and miss with the teacher. There’s some good days and some bad ones. She brought in pots for the kids and herself to paint them and put flowers in but of course I wasn’t thought of. Then the girl I’ve been talking about she’s very disrespectful to me. She has told me I’m not a teacher so she doesn’t have to listen to me, shut up talking to her. If the teacher asked me a opinion about something she would stop talking you are not part of this conversation. The teacher did nothing. She didn’t write her up she didn’t say we don’t say that just nothing. The teacher claimed she doesn’t want to write her up because she thinks this student gets verbally abused by her mom but if you don’t give her consequences for this kind of thing it’s going to keep happening. So I started out being nice to this student saying please when I ask her to stop doing something. Telling her thank you after she did something but nothing changed. So finally I am to the point where I don’t want to have anything to do with her. Why would I want to have  a conversation with someone who treats me like crap. Yes I get she is a kid but still that is not OK to treat someone who is there to help you like crap. So one day not too long ago we had a few students who were taking a state test on the computers so the rest of the kids were allowed to be on their chromebooks she for one yells my name across the room like 2 or 3 times so I ignored her because that’s not how you  get someone’s attention. If they needed help they were supposed to stay at their seat and raise their hand. So she comes over to me and asks me to help her and I said NO. The reason being was because she wanted help on a game and if we help them on this game it makes it harder for them and beause she was yelling my name across the room. So then she goes back to the teacher and was like “Ms. Michelle won’t help me”. “Can you help me?” The teacher told her the student was still taking their test and only had like 4 questions left and after she could help her. So the girl goes off on one of her meltdowns yellling that no one ever helps her and how she is going to go get the boss man which was a sub principal because our regular principal was out for the day. So she literally leaves the room and comes back a few minutes later with the sub principal talking about neither one of them will help me. So he says he will leave a note for the principal about it and then she comes over to me and says “now you are going to get fired” So I want to say a few days later I get a email from the regular principal that she needs to speak with me after school. So I go down there and she’s like what happened with so and so and I told her she’s very disrespectful to me says what I mentioned up above. So she tells me that this student went home and told their mom that I don’t help them, that I ignore them or if I do say something it’s very short. The not helping part isn’t true because she only asked me that one time but the rest is true because why would I want to have a conversation with someone who is so rude to me any other time. So then the principal starts talking about how she is going to have me take this student into 5th grade for their morning meeting or some other time to help build a relationship with her. I’m already thinking that isn’t going to work because she won’t listen to me and she wants to be in 5th grade. We are in a self contained classroom. So after I leave work that day the principal emailed me and the teacher and said she needed to have a meeting with us in the morning. So next morning I go in and she tells me that spoke with the student’s mom and that mom was still frustrated with the situation so I’m not allowed to speak with her or have any contact. That is fine with me. The only time I would be allowed is if she is a harm to herself or others. I was very happy with that. So fast forward to this Wednesday. My former teacher says she needs to talk to me about something and to try to come to  her room sometime in the day. She ends up stopping by our room and the teacher just happened to need to go to the bathroom so she comes over and whispers to me that the teacher is going to be gone the next 2 days and she wasn’t going to tell me or the kids about it. I was a little ticked off. I understand why she didn’t want to tell the kids because there are a few who might start having some issues because of it but she could have at least emailed me and let me know. So Thursday comes. I usually go down and help get the kids off the buses but since I knew there was going to be a sub I stayed in the room to make sure everything was ready. So the kids come in except for the one student. I figured maybe she had issues coming off the bus after she found out the teacher wasn’t going to be there so she was with the former teacher or she had went with a BIS(behavior person). So the rest of the kids come in and I hand out the morning worksheets they get every morning. I happen to look over and see that one of the girls has her mask off and has a upset/sad look on her face so I ask her what’s wrong she says that she is upset that the teacher isn’t there and starts to cry. I ask her if she would like to go take a break in the hallway and she says yes so I let her go sit in the hallway. Maybe 10 minutes after that someone is banging on the door. One of the students named Nevaeh who this student does not get along with is nice enough to open the door for her. She comes in and says to Nevaeh “get out of my way Nevaeh I’m already pissed.” grabs our hall pass and leaves back out the door. At this time I’m the only adult in the room because our sub is also our crossing guard so he was on his way to the room. So when he gets in the room he tells me that the girl that was supposed to be in the hallway and the other one are walking around the school so I call the social worker who answers and lets her know the situation with the girls wandering around the school so she says ok and gets off the phone maybe 3 or 4 minutes later my former teacher who is the in school suspension teacher calls me and asks me to have a student bring down their chromebooks and some work because the principal says they are staying in there for the next 2 days. I’m relieved because then I don’t have to deal with the one. So a few minutes after that I get a call from the principal. She says what happened with so-so so I say she came in and told another student get out of my way I’m already pissed and the principal kinda yelled at me and was like don’t say pissed you are in front of kids and that she grabbed the pass and left. Then she asked what happened with the other student so I told her what happened with her. She then says that they came to her and said that we had a verbal argument and were yelling at each other. I was baffled and very pissed. I told her that never happened but unfortunately I didn’t have another adult in the room to verify my story just the kids. So the day went on the rest of the kids were excellent. The next morning when I come in I notice that papers that were in the Friday bin are missing so I get to work making new ones before the kids come in. A little bit after the kids arrive I get a call from the principal asking me to come down. I had written her a email Thursday night clarifying a few things from the supposed “incident” from the day before. So I go to her office and the first thing she says is the girls didn’t bad mouth you. I’m thinking in my head they lied on me and said something happened that didn’t how is that not bad mouthing me. She says that the other girl’s mom called her and was upset on how I spoke to her daughter(not the one I already had issues with). I’m thinking I’m not understanding how she could have a problem with that because I wasn’t rude to her, I didn’t yell at her, I wasn’t arguing with her. So my mind is blown by this time. So the principal starts talking about the papers in the bins asking which ones we used and she said that the teacher came in that morning and there was no papers in the bins for Thursday or Friday. Well Thursday they were used and I didn’t touch the ones in the Friday bin. So she kind of seems to be accusing me of doing something with the papers. In the past before the teacher started doing the bins she was out for a week with no pnuemonia. She didn’t have any lesson plans made or a sub tub made up so I had worksheets at home that I brought in so the kids would have something to do and she wasn’t happy about it when she found out so I’m thinking she told the principal that I brought in my own worksheets because the principal started talking about we are supposed to be doing what was in the bins and she wanted to know what happened to the papers. I told her the papers were there when I left Thursday night. Then the principal says I have had the most drama out of your guys room and its not the kids. I’m thinking I’m not the one causing the drama. Between kids lying on me and the teacher maybe trying to set me up. I was thinking that the girl I had issues with to begin with told the other one to lie and say these things because she’s hoping I would get fired since she did say that to me in the past. The other girl has told me that she is afraid to stand up to this girl but still why would you do that when you know it’s wrong. So we have almost 2 weeks left in this school year I’m just going to do my best to avoid both of them so they can’t have a chance to lie on me. I feel so betrayed and upset by this. I just want this school year to be over with.

Today was our official last day of school. I had gotten a email last night from the principal saying she needed to see me this morning before the students got there. I had talked to another para and they said that the principal just wanted do a check out with me so I was like ok so I wasn’t super nervous going in. Let me give a little bit of back story so my class has 3,4, and 5th grades in one room. One of the students who is a 5th grader and wouldn’t be my student after today his mom friend requested me on FB Tuesday. So yesterday he had told the teacher that he tried to call me but I didn’t answer. Ok so today when I went in to see the principal she said that someone went on Let’s talk which is a form someone can fill out anymously or put their name and voice their concerns,questions, comments etc on and said that I had given a student my phone number which i shook my head no for and then she was like or friend request someone on fb and that HR was looking into so I wasn’t allowed to go in the room and that I needed to go see if the library para had anything for me to do. So my first thought was the stupid bitch teacher. So a little bit later the principal comes in and tells me that HR cleared me and that it was the student’s mom who reported me. Well that didn’t make sense to me because the student’s mom was the one that friend requested me so why would she do that and then go report me on let’s talk so I think the principal was just saying that so I didn’t know it was the teacher because after that she said that I should stay in the library for the rest of the day. So I didn’t get to say goodbye to my students which really made me upset. I messaged the mom to see what I could figure out. She told me that the principal called her and that she told the principal that her fb page was private so no one could friend request her and she had to friend request them and that she didn’t have a problem with her son being in contact with  me because her son was happy and would always come home and talk about me. I had written him a note and his mom just saying to her that she raised him right because he is so respectful and was always carrying my art box for me and would help me and talk with me and honestly he made my crappy days dealing with the teacher’s crap much better. So I texted the teacher and said this” I know what you did and that was bogus. good luck at your new school.” To which she wrote back “not sure what I did besides my job so idk what’s bogus. Think it’s pretty bogus you had the audacity to call me “that bitch” in a work place when I did nothing wrong. I hope you never treat/act the way you did  in my classroom with whoever in the future. Best of luck to you.” and my reply was”well let’s see you trying to get me fired is pretty fucking bogus and treating me like shit all year when I did nothing but be nice to you. Funny you were talking about bullying but you were the bully. I could have ratted your ass out so many times but I didn’t but you had no trouble throwing me under the bus. I hope you learn how to play well with others because the next para you have hopefully won’t be as nice as I was. Such a fucking hypocrite. Hope you learn  to grow up and act like a adult.  ”
I truly was more than nice to her. In the beginning of the year she would go the whole day without saying a word to me so how am I supposed to know what you want or want me to do with the students and every time I tried to help them she would tell me not to. She would write me daily summaries which I think might be in a different entry if I remember correctly but they were so stupid. She literally had them on their computers most of the day and our kids were in person. After I got my union rep involved because when I went to the principal she told me we were adults basically meaning to me that we should be able to fix our own problems things got somewhat better. We finally started doing small groups for a little bit of time in between all of the netflix movies. Then the disrespectful girl came into the picture and we didn’t even less work because she would constantly interrupt but instead of writing her up she never did. Then there was the disrespectful girl treating me like shit and the teacher not saying a word to her about how rude it was or writing her up. I’m just so glad she is going to a different school in another part of the state so I won’t have to deal with her next year. I’m hoping to get placed with the teacher I spent 2 years with at a previous school but we will see. Good news is me and the student are able to keep in touch with each other. His mom was all for it.

438,https://www.opendiary.com/m/torturedsoul_1/new-school-year-6-6049509/,2021-09-18,New School year,"
Our school year started on September 2nd and so far it is been awesome compared to last year. I get to work with the awesome teacher I got to work with a few years back and there is another para in the room as well. I was a little worried about the other para because last year she would get upset when I didn’t go down to help get the kids off the bus. So far this year we haven’t had any problems with each other. We only have 7 students as of right now. 3 are fifth graders and 4 are fourth graders. We go into the 4th grade classes for specials and recess and lunch. The paras have to go with for specials but we don’t have to go with the students at lunch/recess so that is nice. We do small groups for reading and math in our room and the kids aren’t on the computers very often at all and we aren’t watching netflix movies or doing addition for half the year. This teacher is friends with the other teacher and the teacher this year is  upset with the shitty teacher because her students that she had last year  they barely know anything and a big part was the fact that she didn’t teach much last year and it definitely shows and the even worse part is 2 of the students from last year are 5th graders this year which means we only have this year to get them close to their grade level before they go to middle school. The even more interesting thing is the shitty teacher works with ED students. ED stands for emotionally disturbed. She literally only has 2 students and according to my friend she also has a para but one of her students broke her foot. I hate to say it but maybe karma for how badly she treated me last year. Just so glad I get to work with a awesome teacher and she told me that I need to really go above and beyond to prove to the principal I’m not that person that the shitty teacher claimed and acted like I was last year so I’m trying my best. I definitely feel a lot happier this year. I’m going to be doing a weight loss program in October. It lasts 4 months and has 2 supplements I will be taking. I will find out more details when I go for the first appointment. I’m hopeful. We also got a family membership to the Y so hopefully I can lose some weight if I can find the motivation to go. So in my state there is a vaccine mandate for all school staff and unfortunately because I’m afraid my lyme will get worse I can’t do the vaccine so I have to start getting weekly tested but the funny thing is a email we got from our district said that supervisors and managers weren’t going to come get results from us but that we had to have them just in case.So that is kind of weird. My husband got his first one and is scheduled to get his second the day after his birthday and my son got both of his.  Also this is my son’s senior year of high school. Where did the time go? I can’t believe it. I’m hoping he does well this year. He has a job at a Dairy Queen in our town so that is awesome.
"
439,https://www.opendiary.com/m/torturedsoul_1/just-need-to-vent-9-6064740/,2021-11-10,just need to vent,"
So let’s see where do I begin? My awesome school year isn’t to be. I got put with a student that is from Korea and that no one knows anything about. The kid didn’t even go to a dr til he got here. He is in first grade and I believe he has cerebal palsy because he can only use one of his hands and he has a hard time walking and falls easily. He gets so stubborn sometimes. The teacher said she has never had a para in her room or been in this situation so it gets interesting. She barely talks to me but that’s because she has 27 other kids to deal with. I’m seriously considering transferring to a new school next year because I have this feeling I’m never going to get the opportunity to work with the awesome teacher again. I’m thinking of trying to get a library para position at one of the elementary schools. Then there’s my brother. He has mentally handicapped and has a autism like condition. He has lived in a group home for many years with the same company. They are getting tired of dealing with his crap. He threatens to kill the staff and he physically hurts them. I don’t blame the company for getting tired of it. Another issue is he knows how to manipulate them and get what he wants because of the threatening. So they are booting him out  and want to put him in  a statae institution. I just got a email today that he ran away from his house and the other day the nurse said that he hasn’t been taking his evening meds. I was thinking of letting him come home for thanksgiving but now that I have learned this info I don’t think I want to chance it. Then my son who is 17 treats me a taxi service. The funny thing is he said to me before “if you don’t want to do it just say No.” Well that is funny because when I do tell him no then he keeps bugging me until I say yes and then can’t understand why I have a attitude. Like today I haven’t eaten since 1130. I had to go to my weight loss appointment and take him to the dr. Then my mom called and was wondering if I could take her to the bank and to pay some bills. She doesn’t drive. So I do that and then my kid calls and asks if I can take his friends home. Then he calls me later and asks if I can take his friends to the store. I just want to eat and go to bed but now I have to wait to take his friends home. The other interesting part is my husband is at home already. Why can’t he take them ? you ask I couldn’t freaking tell you. I just need a break.

So the week before winter break I ended up getting COVID. I ended up in the hospital for 5 days. Thankfully I got out before Christmas but still felt like crap. When I was in the hospital I had a 80 year old roommate and she was something else. I didn’t get much sleep. She had a ring that someone in her family gave her and she was obsessed with the damn thing. The nurses put it in the case it came in and she would keep moving it all these other places and then ask the nurses where it was. They finally put it in a safe at the nurse’s station. Then she was bitching about her dentures which she only had 1 half of anyway. She asked for the bonding stuff to put it in and they gave her some. She put them in and then she wanted them back out so there was a nice CNA I think she was who was trying to help her take them out and I don’t know if she spit at the lady or what but the lady was like the heck with it. Then she was super messy. She literally had a buffet of sweets and she got it all over her, the bed, the floor. I felt bad for housekeeping. One time she spilled coffee or tea on the floor and didn’t tell anyone about it I happened to look down and noticed it and then when the nurse came I told her to be careful she didn’t fall.  At night she would purposely set off this alarm they had on the bed because she was a fall risk. So usually they would come in and tell her not to try to get out of bed, turn the alarm off and then leave and then she would yell as loud as she could that she needed to go to the bathroom. I tried everything. They had the foam ear plugs I tried those, still could hear her. I had my husband drop off headphones and I plugged them into my phone and played thunderstorm sounds I could STILL hear her. She talked nonstop and then the oxygen alarm would go off and she would be like “why is that going off?” I was tempted to say “if you shut up it wouldn’t keep going off” but I was nice. So a bit of TMI but when I was in the hospital I did not poop except the last day and it was a little bit. So when I got to go home I was severly constipated. It was horrible. When I was in the hospital they said that I was diabetic so they started me on metformin which you think would have helped with the constipation issue considering I was on 500mg 2x a day but nope. The metformin did make it so I didn’t sleep and had night sweats though. So my birthday was December 30th I felt like crap on that day so that sucked. Then I was on medical leave because I was still having side effects from COVID I tested negative but I still had a bad cough, shortness of breath and a fast heart rate so took a little extra time off work because I was supposed to go back on Jan. 3rd. I didn’t go back until Jan. like 20th. Reason being I got COVID a 2nd time but it wasn’t as bad as the first time. My husband and son also got it this time. I think I got it from either my son or husband. My husband had the bad cough but didn’t end up in the hospital. They were both vaccinated but didn’t get the booster yet. The first time I had it and ended up in the hospital they told me I had the delta strand and I believe the second time I got it it was the omnicron one. So my work said I could go back even though I said that was having symptoms thankfully the dr disagreed and told me to stay home to quarantine. I’m kind of scared to know how many people they sent back to work before they should have been sent back and I work in a school so that is even worse. So when I finally got back to work I found out I was not with the student from Korea anymore. Now I’m with a boy who is in 3rd grade. He barely works and tries to throw tantrums like he’s 2 to avoid doing work. I heard his mom does his homework so he’s always trying to take it home. Yea that’s not happening so now when he refuses to do it I just say “that’s fine we can stay in at recess and you can get it done then.” and I keep my word. He tries to say it’s too hard but the thing is I’m sitting right next to him trying to help him as he’s saying this and he tries to crumple up his paper and huff and puff. I’m so done with it. He also is in everyone’s business. He will call out other students and I’m like the only one you need to worry about is yourself. He tries to say other students pick fights with him or say things to him and he gets all upset and it’s like avoid those kids and ignore them. He constantly thinks everyone is looking at him and I keep telling him they are probably looking at something behind you I need to start saying they have a right to look wherever they want. So yea. Next year I’m really considering going to a different school and becoming a library para again. I don’t think I’m gonna get another opportunity to be in a self contained classroom and I can’t do a building para because they have you running all over the place with different kids and it’s hard enough for me walk around the building now. I gotta try to find some kind of job where I can maybe earn some extra income doing something from home because our wages aren’t cutting  it for bills. This time we got paid we didn’t have enough to get groceries. My son works at walmart and my husband decided to have  him and his friend that is living with us pay 100 dollars for rent/bills and my son says that this isn’t fair. I have told him before he needs to pay for his own personal items and he told me that it’s still our responsibility since he’s not 18 yet. My husband wants him to pay the money so he learns responsibility and I agree with my husband. I did a survey of sorts on fb and a lot of people were saying that we shouldn’t make him start paying until he’s 18 but we need the extra help with the bills and 100 a month isn’t a bad deal I don’t think. Thankfully for the groceries situation one of my former co workers who is a teacher was kind enough to send me some money on paypal so I could get some. I hate asking people for money. My mom is always trying to help me out and I feel bad because now she’s retired so her money is a little tighter than it used to be. She does get LINK so sometimes she will let me use it but I don’t like making a habit of it. So that’s my interesting update for now.

So at work we had a student who is in first grade who needs a para til they transfer him to the ED program. ED stands for emotional disorders. He stabbed another student with scissors and the other day he stomped on one of the paras that is with him foot. Well anyway since they needed someone with him all of us got our schedules messed up so they put me with a kindergartner who has autism. The problem with that is I was not trained to work with him and then I don’t know what his schedule is or what exactly he’s allowed or not allowed to do and I don’t want to mess up all the work others have done. Also last week he had some kind of illness because his nose was dripping snot and he had a bad cough so I didn’t want to be too close besides the fact that he shouldn’t have been at school if he was sick but now COVID symptoms are different I guess in our area. He kept trying to touch me and I was like keep your hands to yourself. I have to take my lanyard off when I’m with him because it has different pins on it and he likes to touch them. So I put a application in for a library para position somewhere else because I’m just done dealing with all of the nonsense. My title is for a self contained class but I’m being used as a building para and I don’t like that. I’m just done with this school. I need something new. My heart is torn because I love all my kiddos but I can’t keep doing this. Yesterday I had a stress test done. Thankfully they didn’t make me run on the treadmill but it looks like the test was ok but I will find out for sure on the 8th. I’m still losing weight which I’m happy about. I started at 365 and as of today I’m at 344 so that is great. My brother was put in a developmental center 2 hours away and is not in jail anymore so we will see how it goes. So far so good but he’s only been there for 2weeks on Friday. We are hoping to go down and visit him next Saturday. Also another reason I’m ready to move on is I feel like since I came back from COVID issues the usual people that talk to me don’t anymore. The lady that used to ride with me completely stopped riding with me which I understand but she doesn’t really talk to me anymore. I’ve texted her and she hasn’t replied. I just feel very alone and I just keep to myself. This is my IV which took 2 times of being poked and a ultrasound to place and they taped it to my arm hair. It hurt very bad taking  it off.

So I applied for a library position at another elementary school in our district and didn’t even get a chance to do a interview so I found out next year there is going to be 2 self contained classrooms at our school and that the new teacher is from another newer school and that she is very nice and really cares for her students so I’m trying to stick out the rest of this school year so I can possibly work with her next year. So lately I have had to call in a few times mostly for digestive issues which happens to me a LOT. The lady I mentioned in a previous entry who has been my friend for probably 5 years keeps assuming that I’m calling in because I don’t want to deal with the autistic student and that I’m not really sick. I don’t know why she thinks this because she knows I have a LOT of medical issues. I have hypothyroidism thanks to only having part of my thyroid, no gallbladder, sleep apnea, 3 different kinds of lyme disease, tendonitis in my heel,plantar facitis, high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity, hypersomia, blood clotting disorder, vertigo, my body doesn’t process fat well due to gallbladder or protein either and I have low stomach acid. It just hurts my feelings  that she would think that of me knowing all the stuff I have and she also has health conditions and I don’t go around assuming that she is “faking” being sick because honestly either way whether she really is sick or not that is not my business. She said that the she’s not the only para that thinks this too. I mean everyone is going to have a opinion and I’m pretty sure there is no persuading anyone and they are entitled to their opinion. The whole thing just bugs me. That’s why I stay to myself at work because I don’t want to deal with drama and another reason I try not to trust co workers because it just leads to drama and gossip. I have come to accept that I’m going to have to work with the autistic student and no matter how challenging it is I have to deal and I do. I do get frustrated but  everyone does at one time or another. So I guess it’s sticking to myself and only talking when I need to at work. The same lady thinks that I somehow cancelled the gift card I got for xmas. No matter how mad someone made me I wouldn’t do something like that besides the fact I don’t know how to do that and I don’t think gift cards can be returned. I made a comment about if I knew I could get disability I would just do that and be done with trying to work. My whole body is in pain every day from walking all over that building and I’m sure to a lot of people I’m just fat and lazy but that’s why I try not to judge anyone because you don’t know what they are dealing with. So I don’t know what else to do in this situation except just let people think what they want to think because if you try to defend yourself it makes you look guilty  and just keep to myself at work and just get through the rest of this school year. We have 47 days I think left in school. I just have to push through.

Hey everyone sorry for such a long time being away. I really need to work on that. So let’s see I applied for another library para position at a school where one of my friends is going to be a autism teacher and possibly the para who I was friends with as well. I thought I had completed a application back in June turns out I didn’t so I did that today. That might make sense on why the principal wasn’t calling me about the position so we will see. I also found out that the nice teacher who was going to be the other SCCC teacher left the district so no clue who the new is but I’m thinking they found someone because the position was not on the jobs section on the website but when I talked to my teacher friend who is the other SCCC teacher she told me she didn’t know which is really weird because she is good friends with the lady who is one of the upper people in the SPED dept. I just know that if they try to pull the crap they pulled last year with me trying to make a building para I’m out and going over to a different school where another teacher friend works in a PLUS room which is basically kids in wheelchairs and super low mentally kids but she’s a awesome teacher and I loved working with her. It would be across town but I don’t care. So I’m really hoping I get the library para position but if not and there is no teacher or the teacher is shitty I’m going to the school across town. I just got done working summer school and that actually wasn’t too bad . The para person I had issues with during the year worked there so that was interesting. She would talk to me some days and some days not but it’s whatever. The teacher I worked with was awesome and I was working with 1st graders. The teacher was from the school that the other teacher is from and there’s another teacher I worked with last summer who is also at that school so if I did go over there I would know some people so that’s good. I did a diet plan for almost a year and once 20 pounds. I’m still trying to lose more but it’s so hard. My husband still doesn’t understand that it’s not that I don’t want to exercise it’s literally that I’m so tired that I can’t work out but I have been trying to go for walks and take pics at some nature preserves in our area but with the gas prices and the limited amount of money we have during the summer it’s usually only once a week so that kind of sucks. My son is turning 18 on August 14th and he graduated high school in June so that is awesome. If I can figure out how to add pics I will try to post some of his graduation pics on here. He still drives me crazy with the complaining about everything and not helping fix the problem. He claims I’m depressed and that’s why I don’t want to exercise or really do anything but he doesn’t get that he’s part of my depression issue as well. I mean when you bitch about how disgusting the place you live in is and you don’t do anything to try to fix the issues it doesn’t help someone who already feels like shit about themselves and their life. Our apartment is honestly falling apart I’m not going to lie but we are trying to save up money for a down payment for a house but it takes time regardless unless we somehow win the lottery. He complains about everything and when I try to bring something up he could help with like if you see the trash overflowing take it out, the recycling full take it out, dirty dishes in the sink wash them, the stove or table dirty clean them his answer is they aren’t my messes I shouldn’t have to clean them well then tell the people whose mess it is to clean it. I do dishes ALL the time and most aren’t my dishes so I literally went on amazon and bought everyone a set of dishes and even colored silverware so no one has a excuse for not cleaning their dishes now. Other than that I just hang out at home and have been trying to organize things and make the apartment better. We now have some creatures living in the roof of our attic so that’s fun trying to keep the cats out of there. The door is broke so if we need to go in the attic you have to have one person go while another person makes sure the cats don’t get up there. So yea that’s been my life the past few months. We go back to school on September 1st. I also have a fb group for my photography so if anyone is interested let me know and I’ll friend you on fb and invite you.

So our first day of school is this coming Thursday. I have mixed emotions about everything. As of right now I’m going to be going back to the same school because the other principal never got back to me but I did apply for another library para position with a librarian I worked with so fingers crossed. It’s going to be a part time position though and sounds like it’s only going to be 16 hours a week and only like 3 days a week but that doesn’t sound too bad and I’ll be doing library stuff I like to do. I’m going to be in a SCCC room but just don’t know which one. I’m hoping that it is with the teacher I’ve known for quite a while because we work very well together and I heard that the other SCCC para isn’t coming back right away because of some health issues so I’m not sure who will be in the other room. The other room has a brand new teacher coming in and I’m very worried it’s going to be the Ms. Johnson issue all over again. The only good thing is we have a brand new principal too so hopefully if there is issues they will be dealt with. If it’s not I’m transferring to another elementary school in a PLUS room until I can get a library position. The autistic kindergartner is going to a different school so that’s good and the one I had last year is going to a charter school but I don’t think he will be there for long with all his issues because I heard charter schools don’t play around so we will see. I’m hoping the best for him but if no one is getting him help for his anger and depression issues I don’t think anything is going to change regardless of where he goes. I hope mom figures out stuff before he’s too far in a grade but too far behind. He really needs to be in a SCCC room but mom was against it. Some parents anger me with some of their choices like they don’t understand how much damage they do to their kids when they try to deny that there is a issue. I embraced that my child has a disability instead of trying to hide it but I also told him he needed to try to control himself too especially when he ran out of meds and I told him just because you are out of meds does not give you a excuse to act a fool in school. I just wish I would have known about IEP and 504 plans when he first was diagnosed because I feel like we could have given him more help especially with math and organization. So I will try to update on Thursday if I’m not exhausted. The good thing is we get the following Monday off for Labor day so that’s nice. Our bowling league started last week and we were gonna have a lesbian couple we knew be on a team with us but then one of their moms has to have surgery and they had to take care of her when that happens but the president of the league said she found a couple so hopefully it goes well. We don’t go back to bowl until the 17th. We had a guy last year but he showed for the first time and then we never saw him again so hopefully we don’t scare off these guys.

Today went pretty well. I really enjoy the teacher I work with. She has a son who also has ADHD. She had a lot of fun activities for the kids to do and we only had 3 students and we are supposed to have 6 total. 2 of them have behavior plans so that should get interesting but neither one came. So I’m thinking of sticking around for the school year and cancelling my application for the library para job. Hopefully the teacher stays for another school year after this one or I’m going to be so upset because it seems when I have a awesome teacher they leave me so fingers crossed. The only bad part was the buses for the afternoon were all messed up and it took a while to get the kids home which I hope the bus company called and let them know that their kids were going to be late getting home. We will see what tomorrow brings but I’m pooped and heading to bed very soon.

So it’s been interesting at work. The kids are getting comfortable so we are starting to see behaviors. One student puts his hand down his pants and claims that his privates itch but we think it’s just attention seeking/avoidance behavior, another one when he gets in trouble for whistling or making noises puts his head down on the desk or goes and stands in the corner, says he’s a bad kid, that he’s stupid. Another one who follows what others do whether it’s good or bad, 1 girl who is lazy and doesn’t like to do some things so she sits and cries. I’ve had a convo with her and told her she needs to communicate what’s going on instead of crying because we aren’t mind readers and if we don’t know what the problem is we can’t fix it. Another student who talks back actually we have a few that get attitude and talk back. My itching friend talks non stop and it’s very hard to get anything done because he will not be quiet. We just got a new student who does not listen. His avoidance is sleeping so when he doesn’t want to do something he will try to fall asleep so the teacher makes him stand up to keep him awake. He does not listen to directions and twice today he started crying. So with all that going on I was notified this morning that when a building para is out me, this other para who is pretty much doing what I did last year and another fellow named Mr.L were going to rotate if a para was out BUT there is another para in self-contained who is not being put in the rotation so me and the other para are going to have a conversation about that situation after school tomorrow because we don’t feel like it’s fair that we are part of this rotation but she doesn’t have to be. The other para made a good point if she is able to do her job in her classroom being a building para sub is the same thing except she would be in a different room and have to move around depending on who she was with. The other para has health issues and supposedly restrictions but she returned to the classroom so to me that is saying that she can do the duties of her job. The para that is going with me to talk to the principal literally said she feels like they are trying to push her out of that room and that’s how I felt last year as well. I hate to say this but it sounds like that’s why she was hired was to be like me last year and basically be a float but she told me she was not informed that she would be doing other things when she interviewed for the position and for me I finally got back into a actual classroom and I don’t feel like I should be pulled to go fill in for a building para. My position is instructional para not building para. That’s the whole reason I switched from being a building para because I didn’t want to have to go all over the place. I like being in one place. The teacher is wonderful and treats me as an equal. I just want to be able to do my job and with having to be shuffled around I don’t feel like I am. It’s very frustrating.  So I will try to update everyone about what happens tomorrow.

So we were able to move into a different room which was interesting. We still haven’t heard anything about the sub issue. Yesterday was a hot mess. The one who was itching would not be quiet yesterday and it was bothering the other kids. We had to call BIS for him in the morning because he was taking other students chromebooks and not giving them back. Then in the afternoon it was free for all. We got to go into the new room but we had the itchy friend and another kid having issues. We let the one kid go out in the pod and he was touching the computer that was out there, wandering in other rooms and just not doing what he was supposed to. They were taking turns being obnoxious so we had to call BIS again. Hopefully today is better. I’ll try to take a pic of our old room and a pic of the new one. I love the new room though but we will see how it goes. We are hopeful.

Last week I can’t remember which day I got pulled from my room to go sub. btw we found out that the other para doesn’t have to sub which is total BS. So anyway they put me in 2nd grade with a boy with autism and my old friend that I had last year. My friend from last year I just had to help him in the room, help open his breakfast items and make sure he was taking small bites. The other fellow I was supposed to make sure he wasn’t climbing on tables or shelves or running out of the room. My old  friend I had to take to the bathroom and recess and lunch as well so I was like well how am I supposed to take both to the bathroom, recess and lunch. The teacher told me I could just leave the autistic one with her for bathroom break. For recess they both got to come outside but I was told usually you had to have an admin out to get him back inside and my friend was a fall risk so I was with him obviously. So when it came close to time for them to go in I thankfully was given a radio and radioed in that I needed assistance getting the autistic one off the playground. Someone came out and got him and I don’t know where they went because I was trying to get my friend to come down from the playground and get in his wheelchair so he could go eat lunch. He finally came down. In between bathroom and recess I was in the room trying to keep monkey boy off of desks and shelves. It was not fun. At one point he started having a meltdown because I took his juice container away from him because he was literally slinging juice everywhere. He then proceeded to try to bite,hit and kick me which I was not having so I put him in a CPI hold for a few so he would calm down. The teacher was like you don’t have to put him in a hold and I told her I’m not getting hit, kicked and bit. I was not hurting him. I just put him in it to calm him down. I had stopped in my room to tell my teacher about my horrible day and she suggested pressure points to help calm which did kinda work for a little bit. Then in the afternoon I was stuck with a little kinder who doesn’t understand english or at least isn’t supposed but I kind of wonder because he has a sly smile he does sometimes when you say something to him. So I had to take him outside for recess which he did well but it was the lunch part that was the issue because he wanted to budge everyone and I told him he couldn’t do that so he sat on the floor and threw one of his shoes off. I told him to go get it and put it on. He did but then tried to budge again. Did the same thing. I was like oh boy this is not going to go well. He next threw his carton of milk thankfully not opened yet. Finally we got through the lunch line and he sat down to eat. I can’t remember what happened I think I tried to move his talker back and he had a meltdown and then took off running on me. I already knew where he was headed because he likes to run on the para in the morning. So I found him where I thought I would told him in a stern voice to go back to the lunchroom but instead of turning when he got near the lunchroom he just kept going so I was like great what am I supposed to do because I didn’t have a radio. I saw the family liasion lady and asked her and she said to go to the office and let them know. The office was not very far so I went in and told the secretaries and thankfully the principal was in his office and asked me which way he had went I pointed and he headed that direction. I started going back towards the lunchroom and saw that another staff had caught our friend. Then we were in the room and he wouldn’t sit on his spot . The first time the teacher picked him and put him back on his dot so the 2nd and 3rd times I picked him up and put him on his dot. He took off his shoes and socks as some kind of protest. I was like whatever works for you.  Thankfully after that I got put with a girl in 3rd grade who is autistic but I’ve been with her a few times before so it was super easy and then it was time to go. I wrote to the principal and the resource teacher and told them both I can’t do runners. I was in so much pain that day I was almost in tears. I’m very tempted to put in a accommodation so I don’t have to sub either. Then my teacher was trying to see if the other SCCC teacher would be willing to let the other para named Mrs. Navaro come in our room like they flip flop some days because some days we need 2 paras in our room for behaviors and supposedly the other teacher who I have known for like 5 years now said that’s her problem meaning my teacher but all they have been using Mrs. Navarro for in their room is to go with a student to specials and recess/lunch beause he’s socially awkward and they are afraid he might get in a fight with someone from the GEN ed room. They make her do everything and the other para doesn’t do much from what Mrs. Navarro has told me. Me and the other para don’t get along because she was trying to be in my business. It’s like mind your own. I’m a little upset to keep being pulled for building para issues when I’m  not a building para and we have enough behaviors in our own room to deal with. I’ve said this to the principal and he just said thanks for being a team player. He’s a good principal thought but it’s still frustrating. Today was great. We literally only had 4 students in our room and I was worried that they were going to try to get me to go take their student since Mrs. Navarro wasn’t here today. Thankfully they didn’t. Our 2 worst behaved kids decided to stay home today and I’m not complaining. `It felt nice being able to get through a lesson without disruptions like whistling, talking or walking out of the room. I didn’t have to deal with any fights in gym because of someone touching or saying something to someone. Hoping this week goes better. We will have to see. I gotta take a pic of our new room to show you guys what it looks like.

This week we are on break for Thanksgiving. This past week has been crazy. Me and the other para haven’t been pulled to sub for any of the building paras lately but they are continuing to pull her to go with the students in the other SCCC class which doesn’t make sense because there is a para in that room. That’s the one I was talking about previously who doesn’t have to be part of the sub rotation. I’m very grateful that our teacher is trying to include us in meetings and things like that. We just had a meeting this past week with the procedural coach and principal about trying to figure out a few things. They are trying to have the SCCC classes go together for specials but it would only be the SCCC classes but it would solve one of the problems of the other para not being with her class. Then the other para from the other class we found out is taking too long of a lunch and breaks. We have a student who has mental issues big time and they even tried to  like crisis line him but because he has private insurance instead of government insurance they weren’t able to admit him to the hospital. I think that shouldn’t matter. He told us that he hears voices in his head who tell him to harm other students and the other para. He ended up leaving school early on Friday because we had to clear the room twice because of him throwing things and not being safe. I’m just hoping that they get him some help. My brother had some issues where he is at. I guess he struck one of the staff and I tried to find out why he did it but he either didn’t want to tell me or couldn’t tell me so I had a chat with him about that because that is my main concern with him being able to return to a group home setting. He usually has issues with not getting his way and he’s so used to threatening things in order to get his way and I keep trying to tell him that is not how you get what you want. We are hoping to go visit him some time this week. We were going to go on wednesday but both me and the husband have doctor apointments. I have one because my left knee has been bothering me a LOT and keeps feeling like it’s trying to go out of place which is definitely not good. After our thanksgiving break we have 3 weeks until Christmas break. I can’t wait!!!! Hoping some of the things we want to implement in the room help with the chaos and gets some kind of order to things.

Let’s see where to start. Well unfortunately I did not get to go visit my brother because the orignial day we were going to go see him we got a call saying he tested positive for COVID so that was definitely a no go. Also we were supposed to go visit my father in law on Monday of last week but he also got COVID so yea glad we didn’t go for either because i’ve had COVID 3 times already and it sucks. The first time was close to this time last year and I ended up in the hospital for a week with COVID pnuemonia. So anyway the one student with mental issues ended up getting put with mom and taken from dad and then mom put him in a different school district so he’s not in our room or district anymore so it’s been better in our room but not where it should be because we still have 2 boys who have some problems. Not as bad as the other kid but still causes a disruption to the class and we just got a 3rd grade girl who has been at our school since it opened up but they just now decided to put her in self contained. She has already had a few meltdowns with us so we will see. As far as the specials situation we are going to be starting that next week BUT this week the other sccc room got 2 girls who are autistic. One is nonverbal mysteriously they haven’t been going to specials because supposedly they need noise cancelling headphones or at least that’s the excuse why the para is in the room and Ms. N and another building para have to cover specials. Interesting coincidence. Plus it’s illegal to keep those students out of specials and we have extra noise cancelling headphones in our resource room and I saw that one of them had headphones on the other day so next week we aren’t counting on the other para being in there for specials. As long as I’m not the only para in there I’m good. Also I’m crazy and told the assistant principal I would help with basketball but I don’t want to be a coach so we will see how that goes. My doctor’s appointment had some interesting news. I have arthritis in both of my knees but I also fractured my leg at some point in time and never knew it til now. So we have 1 week after this one and then it’s winter break. Can’t wait for it.
"
452,https://www.opendiary.com/m/torturedsoul_1/so-new-news-6165371/,2022-12-09,so new news,"
Ok so let me try to explain this whole situation. I work in a self contained class with kids who have developmental disabilities, learning disabilities, and possibly like autism. I’m a classroom para which means I help ALL of the students in our class when they need it. We have a second para in our room because of a lot of behaviors which we should not have in our room but we do. A classroom para is expected to go to specials with the students and sometimes lunch and recess. The other para was in my situation like last year. Last year we only had 1 self contained class so I was put in the other self contained class which already had a class para. There wasn’t really a use for me in there since there was very little behaviors so I was moved into a building para position which I have been a building para in the past and switched to being a self contained para so I wouldn’t have to go all over the building and just be in one place. So I truly know how she feels and I was seriously considering going to a different school and doing a different para position because I don’t understand why if I am self contained para I would be used as a building para. Like we have our own issues in self contained. So we got new schedules that are effective as of monday. My schedule I’m in our class all day. The other para’s schedule is she’s covering the para in the other room’s lunch and she’s upset about that because we don’t have the other para covering our lunch time and the teacher was never talked to about schdeduling breaks and lunches and I’m so confused on why she wasn’t talked to about it. So the other para is very upset about it and I don’t blame her and with a new student that is coming that has violent tendencies the teacher does not feel comfortable being left alone because when a para is out I have been being used as a building para as well. It’s very frustrating because our district is hurting for paras and teachers and then you get awesome people who bust their ass while others don’t do their job but yet nothing happens to the ones who don’t do their job except that the ones who do their job and beyond have to pick up the slack for the others. The other para is thinking of transferring and I can’t say I blame her one bit. I will definitely hate for her to leave but I understand her frustration and want her to be happy and not have to deal with the bullshit and stress. It’s just so sad that the ultimate ones who suffer are the kids we are supposed to be helping. Adults are playing these petty games and who does it hurt the kids we are supposed to be helping.  It makes me so sad but so mad at the same time. We have to do better. I’ll update on Monday.

I hope everyone had a wonderful, safe and healthy new year. This year was my 40th birthday and it honestly kinda sucked. I had planned to have a bowling birthday party and a lot of people said they were coming but surprise surprise nobody showed up except my family and a few of my son’s friends after they worked a 10 hour work day. One of my son’s other friends from his earlier childhood days came over and gave me a gift so that was cool and we got to catch up and I finally got to go visit my brother. We were supposed to go Thanksgiving week but he got COVID. I think next year for my birthday me and my husband are just going to go out of town but I don’t know where to go yet. One of my teacher friends sent me a royal carribean ad lol.  So tomorrow we are supposed to be getting a student that is possibly violent so that should be very interesting. I did reach out to a higher up in our SPED department about the issue of us getting multiple kids that have behavior issues or should be placed differently. I told him about how we are getting pulled to go do building para duties and supposedly building paras aren’t allowed to cover for us so why should we have to cover for them. I also wrote about the para getting a 45 minute lunch and 45 minute break even though according to our para contract we are only allowed a 30 minute lunch and 2 15 minute breaks and also how we have not been trained on assistive talking devices that 2 of our students have. So we will see what happens. I’m hoping something gets changed. Christmas wasn’t too exciting either but I was trying to make others happy but it still sucked that no one got me anything.
"
454,https://www.opendiary.com/m/torturedsoul_1/update-on-things-36-6172176/,2023-01-24,update on things,"
So my email that I wrote to the higher up in SPED got forwarded back to the principal who kind of reamed me about it in a nice way though. He basically said if I had a issue to come to him but we did and nothing happened. After that email though it seems like things have been moving at least for placement issues. We have one that is possibly getting placed into PLUS but it still might be a while and we had another student that should be in ED and it might be happening soon. He had a major freak out on his birthday. The other para in our room had told him and another student in our class that if he wanted to pass out his cupcakes that he brought in he would have to keep himself together and this was in the morning when the students first came in. Well then him and the same student were messing around and she reminded him and said no cupcakes but didn’t get to elaborate on it because he started walking around the room knocking things off student’s desks and circling around a student that he had knocked out their tooth previously and another student that he doesn’t get along with so the para and teacher took him out in the hallway and we had called for BIS/admin to come. So while they were out in the hallway waiting for BIS to come he started freaking out and when the BIS lady got there it got really bad and they ended up having to put him in a room which he destroyed. They called SASS which is a mental health crisis line in our area. The person on the SASS line was asking if we could keep him at the school for 2 hours and the teacher was like no so then they instructed someone to call 911. So his mom showed up and they had a police officer come too and he was escorted out of the school and to a local hospital for a psych evaluation which I believe they didn’t keep him but he got a 7 day suspension and just came back yesterday when me and the other para were both out and today my stomach was bothering me so I stayed home and the other para still had family in town so she’s not there either again. The other para feels guilty about the whole thing and I literally told her if it wouldn’t have been her that set him off it would have been me or the teacher. He also lied to his mom and a few others about what was even said and he’s known for lying and stealing. He is a sociopath in the making and that’s scary. So we have gotten 3 new students and we are supposed to be getting another one who is a 1st grader who sticks things in her ears til they bleed, eats everything, when she doesn’t get her way she is said to throw herself on the ground and scream, cry, hit and cuss. The other 2 who were supposed to be violent have actually not been too bad. The one came from a PLUS room and the first day he was in our room he was saying he hated himself and wanted to die. He literally tried to choke himself with his hand and was about to start banging his head on the wall but thankfully didn’t. He claims he’s tired all the time but to me it seems like a way to get out of work. He had a meltdown the other day because he wanted to bring his stuffed animal in the room but that particular day one of our other regulars was having a day and when the other one has a day he does evil stuff like touching other student’s stuff, taking it, breaking it so we told the other student that we didn’t want something to happen to it and he started saying he hated our class, our school, the principal and then started with the wanting to kill himself talk. So I was guarding the door because of the other kid and he sat near me on the floor. I told the teacher to maybe try to put on something Sonic related this boy stood up and laughed a evil laugh and then went over and sat on the carpet and started watching it. It was weird and a little scary. The other boy isn’t too bad. He’s had a day where he didn’t want to do stuff but he got it together and we got a new girl that is really low mental wise but does her work, doesn’t have meltdowns so that’s good.
Healthwise I have lost 20 pounds but may have gained some back but hoping to keep it off. I have been trying to eat better but as for exercise it’s tough right now because my knee has been really bothering me. The other para offered to work out with me but I told her I need to figure out the knee issue first but I’m willing to do it. I was just scheduled for a MRI this week but I need to actually schedule it soon. So hoping for good news on that when I go do it. The doctor thought I might have a blood clot because I have some gene that makes me more susceptible to blood clots so I had to go get a ultrasound of my leg and get blood work done. Thankfully I did not have one so that is good. I was supposed to go out to eat with one of my long time friends but unfortunately we weren’t able to get together yet but I really want to. So we will see what we can figure out . I was talking to my son yesterday while we were on a road trip to go figure out his account that he was supposed to get from his grandpa but that whole thing is making me upset because we were just told that he had to wait til he was 18 but we just found out that grandpa wants to wait til he’s 25 to give him his money. I just don’t understand why we weren’t told this earlier because my son had started to make plans with the money. Well anyway we were talking about friend issues because the friend he has living with us isn’t talking to him because another friend in their friend group they are friends with him again so I was talking about how most of the friends I have I don’t talk to like my best friend that I’ve known for quite a while she doesn’t talk to me anymore but she comes to my town to hang out with another one of her friends which pisses me off. Like she could at least say hey would you like to go out to eat and catch up every once in a while but nothing so I’m just like whatever at this point. Why waste my time on someone who doesn’t seem to give a shit about you.

455,https://www.opendiary.com/m/torturedsoul_1/finally-spring-break-6-6205619/,2023-03-24,finally spring break!!!!!,"
So this past week has been spring break for us and it’s been a true break. So before break we now have 10 students. The one finally got sent to ED program at a different school HALLEUJAH!!!! The other one got sent to PLUS but then we got 4 new students. One student witnessed his sister who was his guardian get murdered in front of him and then the bf who committed the crime tried to kill himself but didn’t succeed but he wasn’t fit to stand trial so I’m not sure what happened. His sister enrolled him in school at 3rd grade and then got killed a few weeks later. The family never got him any counseling so he has a hard time trusting people and literally will give the teacher a hug and then like 30 minutes later be calling her a ugly fat b*tch . We try to have empathy for him but it’s so hard some days beause he’s constantly walking around the room telling the other kids they are stupid or ugly or fat or to shut up and he doesn’t do very much work at all. The school has already had to call DCFS for some stuff going on and not sure what happened with the investigation. The other 3 kids aren’t too bad so that’s good. We are supposed to be getting our 1st grade friend when we get back from break so we will see how that goes. So over break we discovered that my teacher’s daughter started having seizures and actually stopped breathing. My teacher’s husband who is a detective had to perform CPR on her. They were able to bring her back and she was taken to one of our local hospitals but then transferred to a hospital in Madison. They found a tumor in her pelvis which was cutting off circulation to her kidneys so all the toxins were building up in her kidneys and brain. She said when they got to Madison her kidneys were functioning at >5%. For the past few weeks they thought that she was having migraines but it sounds like they weren’t migraines. So the last update my teacher said her daughter’s kidneys were functioning at 50% so that’s better but the tumor was cancer so she is going to have to do chemo treatments and that she won’t possibly be able to come home until April 3rd but it sounds like that depends on how well her kidneys are doing so she won’t be at school all next week and possibly longer than that. I feel so helpless and bad for her and her family. I just feel like I should be doing something but I’m not sure what. Me and the other para have told her if they need anything to let us know. So we will see what happens. I’m hoping for the best. I got to go visit my brother in Kankakee. He’s not doing too bad but the staff did say that they were having issues with him going to work. She said he only works 3 days a week and the other 2 days he does fun stuff. We asked why he wasn’t going to work and he claimed it was because he didn’t get paid well. I told him I don’t get paid well at my job but I still have to go if I want to make money. Plus the behavior lady said if he doesn’t go to the program that is on campus he can’t go to the other one that is off campus where he could make more money. So hopefully he will go to work. I finally found out what happened with the incident with the behavior lady. She told me that it was after their unit got bed bugs and they had to throw out his stuff and then he didn’t know where things were and I guess there was other issues going on in the unit so that caused him to do what he did. I’m still not happy with that but glad someone at least explained what happened. So not looking forward to going back to work on Monday because I’m not sure when we are getting our 1st grade friend and not sure how the kids spring breaks went which if it wasn’t good usually we have behaviors because of it. I will try to update if I have the energy.
"
456,https://www.opendiary.com/m/torturedsoul_1/im-updating-again-6212254/,2023-04-30,i’m updating again,"
Hey everyone,
So sorry for not updating but there’s been a LOT going on at school. So my teacher has still not come back yet and we honestly wouldn’t blame her if she decided to take the rest of the year off. Her daughter is going on her 3rd round of chemo. The tumor is shrinking and I believe her kidneys are getting better and she gets to go home 2 days out of the week. Our class made cards for her but we still haven’t been able to give them or send them to her. The other para in our room did a donation collection and had cards the staff could sign. I think the donation came up to like 130 so thats something. So while our teacher has been out we have the other SCCC teacher as a sub in our room because thankfully right now she has a student teacher but the issue is going to be when the student teacher is done and goes back to her class who will be in our room. I have been staying late and making packets of different worksheets for the kids to do. I got yelled at by the president of my husband’s union for working off the clock but someone has to do it and the other teacher has been kind enough to be doing our students IEP meetings while our teacher is out and she also took on some other IEP writing for other students not even in our school so she has a lot on her plate so I’m trying to help out. Then the lady was like you know that teacher is gonna be getting all the credit for your hard work. If she does she does I don’t care about the credit per say as long as someone recognizes that I’m trying to help out somewhere and I’m not just fat and lazy and just sit on my butt all day. I’ve been doing behavior notes for 2 of our students as well as figuring out what to put in packets. Then the new girl OMG. This girl is only in 1st grade and tries to steal EVERYTHING she can get her hands on. It’s ridculous. Like one of the first days she was here she was using the markers I gave her and writing on everything besides paper with them so I took the markers away. Girlfriend decided she was go into other student’s bins and take their markers. The good thing about labeling everyone’s supplies I guess. So I made some laminated sheets for her because she was drawing on her chromebook she was borrowing until they gave her a IPAD and purposely getting out of the app she was supposed to be on and when she got her IPAD she signed out of it and we can’t figure out how the login for her to sign in so we have her do the laminated sheets for her morning work so she will leave us alone which she doesn’t anyway. She talks non stop. I’ve told her a few times to be quiet and do her work. She had the nerve to say to me “leave me alone and another time told me I wasn’t her teacher so I told her ” well you are gonna be salty then when I bring in treats for the kids and you don’t get anything since you want me to leave you alone and you start begging and pleading to get whatever I bring it.” Then she changes her tune real quick and says “i’m sorry” which is meaningless because 5 minutes later she will say something or do something rude. So one of the days the other teacher that is subbing was at a meeting so I made a deal with the class that if they could get cleaned up in less than 5 minutes at the end of the day I would give out candy. They held up their end of the bargain so I passed out candy to everyone. I caught our friend sticking out her tongue and holding out her candy in another student’s face so I told her give me back the candy. She was all “im sorry.” I told her no give me the candy we don’t do that kind of thing to our other friends. So I had to wrestle her for the candy I got it back. She went out and got on her sunrise bus and then was refusing to put on her seatbelt. I got my stern voice and told her to put her on seatbelt so they could leave. She told me “NO.” I told her ” you don’t tell adults no NOW get on your seatbelt.” She was still refusing until the driver got on the radio and told dispatch that there was a student refusing to put on their seatbelt. That’s when she starts saying” OK,OK i’ll put on my belt.” She gets it on and a few minutes later the bus starts pulling away . That girl stuck up her middle finger at me. I was like ” oh hell no that girl just stuck up her middle finger at me. ” The other para and the teacher were like ” who?” I said her name and they started laughing at me and they were like we know it’s not funny but dang. So the next day I was not happy with our friend. I told her that I didn’t appreciate her sticking her middle finger up at me and I hoped she didn’t need help with anything because I wasn’t helping her and the sub teacher had her stay in for recess. So I had stepped out to go refill my water or go to the bathroom  and she tried to tell the sub teacher that the only reason she stuck up her middle finger was because I stuck up mine first. Like really you are gonna lie on me. Why in the world would I stick up my middle finger at her?  So yea she is something else and we have to keep constant supervision on her. The other friend who saw his sister killed has been having some issues too. He started out good with the sub teacher because he was in her room before he came to our room but lately he’s been refusing to do work and wandering like he was with our teacher before she went on leave. So he’s been getting written up for threats and throwing chairs and things like that.  So that is school.
 
Now on to my home life. My son and his ex friend Logan who also lives with us don’t talk to each other anymore and Logan checked himself into a mental hospital a few weeks ago and I have to go get him tomorrow and my son decided to wait til today to tell me he might need a ride home and I’m not sure how well that is going to go since my son hates Logan. The whole story is they have a mutual friend who was accused of hitting his girlfriend and Logan has PTSD from childhood things with his mom and dad with domestic violence so he’s not cool with the mutual friend because of that but I guess the girlfriend is crazy and lied about that but Logan still doesn’t want to be friends with the person and so he ghosted the whole friend circle including my son because they are friends with the mutual friend. My son wanted us to kick Logan out just because of that situation. Logan is quiet, cleans up after himself  and keeps to himself and also has no where else to go right now because he is trying to distance himself from his family because of the toxic issues. So my son thinks I’m taking Logan’s side because I don’t want to kick him out on the streets. I told my son this is why you need to make sure when you have a roommate that this kind of thing doesn’t happen so pick your roommates wisely. Plus I’m starting to think that Logan was having depression at that time so it might explain why he ghosted the friend group. Well anyway I was going to be picking Logan up from the hospital tomorrow afterschool  and then my son asked if I could go get him too and I was like that is going to be a very awkward car ride  if I have to have both of them in the car so I’m hoping one of his friends can bring him back because he is spending the night at the place tonight. So yea fingers crossed he gets a ride.

So that Monday when I was supposed to go get Logan he ended up having to stay longer because he told the staff that he had a gun and he was going to kill himself with it so they kept him longer. Turns out he did have a gun and thankfully it wasn’t loaded but there was a loaded magazine somewhere else. Let me back up a little bit. So when Logan had self admitted himself to the hospital in our town before he was transferred to the hospital out of town we were discussing what he wanted me to tell his dad about where he was because before he went into the hospital he stopped talking to his dad and was trying to distance himself from him. So Logan told me to lie to his dad and tell him he was out of town visiting some friends because he told me he doesn’t feel safe if his dad knows where he is. So fast forward to that Monday I find out from my husband that Logan’s dad has been blowing up his phone wondering where Logan is and why he hasn’t contacted him ect. I take over the conversation and start texting with his dad. I tell his dad that he went out of town to visit friends. He starts asking all these questions. What friends? What town? how did he get there? ect ect. I told him he didn’t give us details just said he was going out of town to visit friends. His dad came banging on our door about 9 at night. My husband had let him in and he went in Logan’s room and was looking through his things claiming since his clothes are there and his drug items that we are lying to him and he wants to know where his son is. Starts talking about he doesn’t know whether he’s gonna call the cops or “the club.” The club is the Hell’s Angels motorcycle gang. Well thankfully he called the cops and of course they showed up and were talking to him for a while and then they came to get our side of the story. I told the officers that Logan is scared of his dad knowing where he is and we gave the officers the name of the hospital and told them he was a adult and they said we have to tell dad where he is. This part didn’t make sense to me because Logan is an adult so all the officers had to say to dad was we checked his whereabouts and he’s safe but no the dumb ass officers told his dad exactly where he was at. So his dad for the next week continues to blow up my phone telling me that him and Logan were super close and all of a sudden Logan ghosted him and he doesn’t understand why. Keeps asking how long Logan has been in the hospital and a whole bunch of other questions. I tell him that his son asked me not to share any information with him and that his son is an adult so basically he has to wait til his son is ready to speak to him. Dad continues to constantly text messages and then he starts threatening me. At first I just let him vent but then one day he says I’m coming to your house and getting my son’s belongings and I was like no the fuck you aren’t. You come near my house I’m calling the cops for breaking and entering. He claims he’s gonna show up with the cops and steal Logan’s belongings. I called my son and said if the cops show up at the house to not let them and to call me and I would leave work if I had to. Thankfully no one showed up at our house and I went to the courthouse after work that day which was on the 10th and got a no stalking order because of his dad threatening me. I was granted the emergency order but problem is court is on Thursday the 25th and the dad STILL has not been served with the order. This whole time Logan has been in a mental health facility so I’m glad he hasn’t had to deal with his dad and he also has a no stalking order but we did not put down his address of where he is for obvious reasons. So I printed out all the threatening messages his dad sent to me and one his dad sent to my husband so hopefully that will be enough evidence to get the order extended for 2 years. Logan told me that after he gets out of his faciltiy that he was going to move into someone’s attic and he told me he was planning on going to court with me on Thursday but he might change his mind before then and if he does I told him that’s ok I would understand. So yea that’s been my exciting life the last few weeks.
