It’s still summer and I’m comletly bored out of my mind!  I have softball practice today, but practices are really boring.  I can’t wait til marching band starts. I miss my friends- (the other band geeks.)

Just testing out my diary’s colors to see if they work!  Anyway, softball tourniment this Saturday.  Rookie camp next Thursday and Friday.  Lance won’t be there so I can’t talk to him about Ashley.  Kimberly said she’s coming.  Don’t know whether to call Brett or not because he marched last year, but started really late in the year and I don’t think he got to march in a real show til regionals.  Well, if I don’t call, surely Carrie will know that he has to go.  Why did he have to be in my squad, anyway?  Ricky is in my squad.  Me and him are going to be in charge since we’re the L-Team memebers.  Gotta go, this is longer than I thought it was going to be.

Not too much going on.  The first football game is next Friday.  I’m really nurvous.  What if I screw up my solo really bad in front of all those people?  Anyway, I just have to think at least it’s not a contest.  Then at a contest I’ll think at least it’s not regionals.  Then at regionals I’ll think at least it’s not state.  And at state I’ll puke my guts out.  Oh, I wonder how Kimberly must feel.  She has a longer solo that’s more important-practically one whole song, and on and instrument she’s not used to.  
The other day Kyle did something that totally impressed me.  Tony, Bret, and Matt were all acting like idiots, while we were standing behind the backdrops.  They were yelling out volgure words just to make people laugh.  So, like the third time we went back there Kyle goes,  “Don’t even start this time, because I don’t want to hear it!”  I was so proud of him!  No other guy in the world would be mature enough to stop something like that.  Shows what kind of people band students are.  With the exception of Bret, Tony, and Matt.  Bret gotten better, though.  He’s still a major jerk, but he’s better.

Friday was our first football game.  My solo was awsome!  It actually sounded good even though I was about to puke.  About Chris- well, it turns out Jessica really is his girlfriend.  I thought I saw them at the football game but I’m not sure.  I know I saw Jessica and I saw the back of somebody’s head that looked like Chris, but later when I looked up in the stands I saw somebody who wasn’t Chris who was wearing the same blue shirt I had seen before.  Plus, I saw Chris the other day without Jessica in the morning which is usually where I see them together.  But now I haven’t seen either of them at all lately.  Well, gotta go.

Okay, let me go over the weeks events really fast then I’ll get to what this entry’s title means, besides, it sorta all ties together in some freaky and unique way.  Okay, first of all mom’s going to Chicago to see my cousin Chris perform.  She went to Nashville last night to meet with our realatives so they could all go together.  I can’t go (not that I’d want to see my idiot cousin) because the marching band is holding a public performance Saturday, which happens to be tommorrow.  So, anyway, my dad was going to take my mom this morning but we couldn’t get ahold of Adam (been trying for two days) so we all had to load up and go at 8:30 last night and didn’t get back til 1:00 in the morning.  On our way back we glanced over at Taco Bell and saw Adam’s jeep, so no big deal.  There is going to be a Co-Ed. tourn. tommorrow that the softball boosters are sponcering and I had to bring in two cases of Mountain Dew to school and look like and idiot.  First I took it to Mr. Skaggs and he told me to take it to Mrs. Allen, so I went to her room and the door was locked (it was early in the morning) so, I didn’t see her at all that day so I left the damn things in the band room.  This morning I had to turn in my softball bag and uniforms because the season’s over.  So,  I think I’m finally to the part where it all ties together in the best way possible.  Today after school I was having to stay to help paint pit carts and scafflting for the show tommorrow and after the bell rang after school I ran, grabbed the damn Mountain Dew boxes and ran to Mrs. Allen’s room and dropped them off.  Then, I started to head back to the band room when I saw Kimberly and Natashia walking down the hall.  I knew Natashia wasn’t staying and Kimberly was undecided, so……. (to be continued)

……so I asked Kimberly if she was staying and she said no, so I started back to the bandroom again and I saw Savannah and Ashley N. talking and asked Savannah if she was staying and she said yes. So, I walked behind them hoping they’d stop to talk to me and by the time we walked outside I realized I was being totally ignored and there was nothing I could do about it, so I headed back toward the bandroom again. When I got there there were two people standing there in the doorway holding the door open in my way (a total pet peeve) so, I tried to edge around the girl and said, “Exuse me,” to the guy. As I tried to edge around him he spun around and faced me. Chris. It was Chris. I paused a moment, then said, “Hey,” and started walking backwards into the bandroom. I guess I caught him by surprise because he just stared at me and didn’t answer for a second. When I finally realized he was going to ingore me I turned and started walking away, but he fianlly regained conciousness and said, “Well, hello. Nice bumping into you here.” He looked better than ever at that moment. He had on his student training badge and everything (senior). I smiled, “Yeah, you too.” Then I walked toward him and asked,” You haven’t seen my brother lately, have you?” He goes, “No, why?” “Because we’ve been looking for him for two days and we can’t find him,” I replied. “Well, see, I haven’t worked in forever and when I do he works night shift and I hardly see him.” He explained. “Oh,” I said lamely. “I’m sorry. I hope you find him, though,”he told me. “Thanks, anyway,” I said and that was it. The thing was I have never seen Chris act shy before and he was very shy for Chris Miller at that moment. Maybe it’s really not too late. At least now he knows I don’t hate him. Well, gotta go.  buh bye.

The band public performance, well, kinda sucked.  People kept falling because it had been pouring down rain.  Then, on the third song, the pit started playing before Jessica started counting off.  That was scary, but we eventually fixed it.  How?  I don’t know we just did.  I don’t think we’re going to be as good this year.  Maybe we are, but we have more patential then we are using.  People just don’t understand what we are about this year because half the band is full of stupid lazy freshman who don’t give a damn and it’s really starting to pis me off.  How can we show them how much fun it is to perform when they don’t ever perform, they just go out there like, “Let’s get this over with so I can go home and watch tv, eat pizza, and pass out.”

7,https://www.opendiary.com/m/mnmchick2004/respect-13-619045/,2001-09-12,Respect,"
You know that I have a lot of respect for Mr. Parker (my band director) and that I’ve always thought he was cool and always showed us the same amount of respect we show him.  Today he really said something that hurt my feelings.  When I got home today after band practice I started bawling I was so upset.  To anyone else it may sound like something stupid, but not if you knew Mr. Parker. The thing is he would never say something like what he said to me to anyone like Kyle, Lance, or Jessica or Ricky or somebody.  You see, when somebody’s acting stupid (usually a person who’s a normal goof off) he’ll call them on it, they’ll say sorry and he’ll say in a smart alecy way, “Yeah, so am I.”  Well, today Mr. Parker was going over some stuff with the brass and he said he wanted to work on me and Shannon’s solo.  We started and I accidently screwed up.  I hardly ever do something like that or slack off or goof around.  So, we stopped and I go,”I’m sorry.”  He turns to me and gives me and evil look and says,”Yeah, so am I.”  My mouth dropped open is surprised and I mumbled,”I really am sorry, I didn’t mean to.” But he just ignored me.  
I have never done anything to him except respect him and support him and I am never goofing off or slacking off and he hates me anyway.  I don’t understand why he hates me.  I hope it’s not like Mrs. Grubbs and he only hates me because I’m the fat ugly kid.  I just wish he would give me a reason.  I support him, defend him, and laugh at all of his corny jokes and all he can say is,”Yeah, so am I,” in a smart-ass way.  He would NEVER say that to Kyle or Lance of someone similar and that’s the main reason it made me mad.

Lately, I have noticed something about myself and other people that I thought was odd.  Sometimes I get so fed up that I have to tell somebody how I feel before I explode from keeping it to myself for too long, and usually it’s something about somebody else that nobody else wants to say.  I don’t want to talk about people, but sometimes it gets so unbearable that I can’t hold it in any longer.  So, anyway, I end up saying the truth but people thing I’m being insensitive even though deep down they know I’m right.  Yes, I’m the only one brave enough to speek the truth and because I’m the first one to state the facts it makes me insenitive.  At least I’m not living in a world of false kindness and pretending that I’m the sweetest person in the world, and at least I’m facing the true facts of what is going on around me and realizing and life is not a big fucking bowl of cherries and I’m sorry if seeing things the way they are makes me insenitive, so fuck all the damn sensitive people who’s world is one big fucking fake beautiful rainbow!

Well, I just thought I’d give you an update on what’s happening in marching band now. Let me just say that the strongest muscle in marching band is the heart. I saw that on an NFL commercial and I HAD to convert it to marching band. Anyway, our first contest, we were up against our rivals Barren County because they have an attitude problem, and we were also up against the regional champs last year- LaRue county. We got second place beating Barren and being a little over a point behind LaRue and a distinguished rating (this was all at Caverna.) The second contest was at Todd County and we had a lot of fun. On the way up there we were teasing this freshman dude named Derrik who likes Kimberly. Me, Jessica B, and Kimberly were saying things to him in Spanish since we take the class. I go,”Te gusta Kimbery?” Which means do you like Kimberly. He didn’t know what to say so Jessica goes,”Just say si!” He goes,”SI!” and we all burst out laughing. Jessica goes,”This is just like first grade, we’re all like,’say yes!'” We also kept saying no guapo which means not handsom. Nobody would tell him what it means, but Lance the jerk did later on. At the contest we won first place in our class and best color guard and a distinguished rating and we beat Hopkensville in our class, but somehow they got reserve grand champion (runner up overall) so we thought we had grand champion, but they announced some other band. Then Mr. Parker went to talk to them about it and they said something like we were tied, but they had something higher than us and we had something higher than them and whatever it was that we had higher didn’t count when it came to overall scoring of bands. So, another words, on the making sence scale of 1-10 it was a negative 500. So, we were extremly happy, but thourghly pissed. So, after the contest we went to hardes and had fun. I sat next to Lance and he ate half my food. But then something happened that completly rattled the whole band’s nereves. Daniel our show crew person/ Natashia’s cousin, came running in the door yelling,”Two people have been hit by a car!”

We didn’t know what to do and nobody would let us go see who it was so we all decided to go back to the bus. When we got on the bus we kept asking around and found out it was two of our members Lindsay and Lydia. Amanda H. was trying to expain what happened and annoying Lesily goes, “We don’t really want to hear it so stop talking about it.” Jessica and I went off and put our two cents in,” Yes, we do want to hear it because we care about them and we want to make sure they’re okay.” That’s one of those examples I was talking about people not wanting to heat the truth because they think ingorance is bliss and that can’t stand to hear the truth because they are living in a world of false kindness and everything has to be butterflies and rainbows. I spoke of this in a previous entry. Anyway, it turned out they were okay except for a few scrapes and bruises. Turned out the lady who hit them was looking in her back seat for a cd case and once she found out they were okay, she acted like she didn’t care and drove off. All the way back Jessica and I listened to Derrik complain about his love for Kimberly and how much he hated Lance. At one point I explained to Lance what was going on and he tried to get me and Kimberly to switch places so she could sit by Derrik and I could sit by Lance, but she didn’t fall for it. Now, on the the third contest. We had two in one day yesterday, one at Henerson and one at Apollo. We sucked ass at Henderson, but won every award in our class, beating Hopenkinsvill for real this time. We won best color guard, best percussion, best music, best visual, and first place, but no distinguished rating. At Apollo, we gave and awsome show, but got third place (the bands were better) and a distinguished rating. I can’t wait until next week.

We had a lot of fun at the contest Saturday.  First we had  to do a parade.  That was okay, but tiring.  We hate parades.  Afterwards, though, we ate at Mr. Gaties.  Our whole group sat at one table and let me tell you that’s not an easy task.  Lance had to sit at the end.  We all decided that we should vote somebody out of our group and Jessica B. goes, “I vote the Hulsman girl!” just joking around and me and Lance go,”YES!”  Jessica goes,”You guys are serious!”  Then we started making fun of what was on the tv.  On the way to the contest Kimberly and I were teaching Derrik spanish.  That was fun.  We had a great performance.  Kimberly and I got to call the band to attention during the award ceremony.  We got second place in our class and a distinguished rating.  On the way back me, Kimberly, Julia, and Derrik ate at Rally’s.  The line was so long that we only had ten minuets to eat.  On the bus I fell asleep holding the second place trophie.  But woke up when Mr. Parker had the judges tapes turned up too loud on the high part of Kimberly’s pennywhistle solo.

Saturday we had a contest at Butler County and we were up against Warren East, and Owensborrow.  Well, they were the bands in our class- there were other bands there too.  We practiced a little before the contest.  We had an L-team meeting after practice to talk about what was going on the rest of the day.  Mr. Parker was saying that we were going to eat before the contest and Jamie A. (guard captain) wasn’t listening and goes,”When are we eating?”  Mr. Parker goes, “Before.” and everyone reapeated it, and Mr. Gosset goes,”Uh, are we eating before?”  So, the L-team was going around to each other all day going,”We’er eating before.”  Everytime Mr. Parker or Mr. Gosset saw us they would say,”We’re eating before.”   
Anyway, when we got to McDonald’s we had to wait in line a long time.  There was a pay phone that Brady and Ricky were using to call 1800 numbers that spelled out volgure stuff.  Then I made sure to tell Kyle we were eating before.  Warren East showed up and were totally rude- giving us evil looks and telling Jamie B. (snare) that they wished we would break our legs so we couldn’t march. But we paid them back.  We got best percussion, best musical performance, first place in our class and Grand Champion (first place overall).  We gave and encore performance where we just stood in an arch and played the show.  While Kyle was playing his solo he did it one handed- it was so funny.  Afterwards Shannon called him a ham.  When we got back to town we drove around screaming out the windows.  It was so much fun.

I’m a junior.  It’s official because Mr. Parker (my band director) gave us a list of everyone’s name in the band and it said 11 next to my name so it’s offical.  Plus it said field cammander which is even sweeter.  I like the fact that the heading on my diary says I’m 17 even though I’m still only 16- but I will be in November.  It makes me feel special.  We had the bandroom clean-up day on Tuesday.  That was fun since I haven’t really done anything really productive all summer.  I have to make up a list of stretches for the band to do on a regular basis.  I also have to mark my scores and I have to have all this done by the 10th.  That’s when Mr. Parker schedualed our field cammander meeting.  He wants to do our stretches in time, but I used to like the stretches because it was a way to relax before rehersal and talk to your friends before you start working in the hot sun.  He said people just think of it as a big joke and don’t really stretch.  I guess that’s true.  But I just think the idea of timed stretches is kinda silly.  I mean in a way it’s a good idea, but it’s also kinda weird if ya think about it.
I wrote Travis a really long letter because I was bored and we hadn’t talked in a long time.  He wrote back that he had written me a really really long letter but his hotmail account wouldn’t let him send it for some reason or other I can’t remember.  So, he just told me a few things and said he was so mad cause that letter was quote,”dang long.”

Well, I just wasted an hour of my life.  I spent it editing and deleting a bunch of crap that I wrote when I was a stupid immature sophomore.  God, I was a moron.  Anyway, it’s amazing how you look back on something and your like, “Well, I was stupid and I’m not like that at all now.”  And then a year later you look at that person who had said that statement before and you’re like, “I was stupid to say that because I was a moron then, too!”
I’m trying to make it my life goal now to not look back and say that starting from this day on.  A year from now I’ll be like, “I was a moron for making a goal like that!”  I’m trying to be more mature.  Take things as they come, don’t get stressed of mad about things for no reason especially if they’re nothing really or if know I have no control over them.  I was blessed with a bad temper.  I also need to get over my laziness, cause I’ll admit sleeping is my favorite activity besides band.  I think I’m verging on being narcoleptic.  If any of you have ever seen that show Daria, I’m like Trent– eat, sleep, music.  During the summer I almost go completely vampire mode.  I need to lay out in the sun tomorrow and get a darker tan.  I’ve tried a few times, but it’s hard to stay out with a dog who hates heat and hates being outside all together and whines constantly and has the most annoying dog voice on the face of the planet.  Plus I’ve gotten to the point where one hour in the sun won’t even show any results whatsoever.  Well, gotta go.  It’s three in the morning.  I’m not really sleepy, but I figure I might as well pretend the time plays a factor in my life.

Anyway, it’s amazing how you look back on something and your like, “Well, I was stupid and I’m not like that at all now.”  And then a year later you look at that person who had said that statement before and you’re like, “I was stupid to say that because I was a moron then, too!”
I’m trying to make it my life goal now to not look back and say that starting from this day on.  A year from now I’ll be like, “I was a moron for making a goal like that!”  I’m trying to be more mature.  Take things as they come, don’t get stressed of mad about things for no reason especially if they’re nothing really or if know I have no control over them.  I was blessed with a bad temper.  I also need to get over my laziness, cause I’ll admit sleeping is my favorite activity besides band.  I think I’m verging on being narcoleptic.  If any of you have ever seen that show Daria, I’m like Trent– eat, sleep, music.  During the summer I almost go completely vampire mode.  I need to lay out in the sun tomorrow and get a darker tan.  I’ve tried a few times, but it’s hard to stay out with a dog who hates heat and hates being outside all together and whines constantly and has the most annoying dog voice on the face of the planet.  Plus I’ve gotten to the point where one hour in the sun won’t even show any results whatsoever.  Well, gotta go.  It’s three in the morning.  I’m not really sleepy, but I figure I might as well pretend the time plays a factor in my life.

what to call this entry.  So, anyway, it feels like a freakin freezer in here.  I had a migrane earlier and you know you get that tunnel vision.  I hate it.  I’m not sure what caused it, but I think it might have been sleep deprivation.  So, once it started I just fell asleep and slept for six hours and woke up with only a mild headache.  Usually when I get them I’m at school and there’s nothing I can do about it because my teachers are evil and don’t give a crap.  So, it was nice just to realize I had one and got to pass out.
So, anyway, I know I’m only a sixteen year old and that may seem young to some of you and some of the things I say may seem stupid or something an immature junior would say, but that’s because I am young and just trying to live the way I want and grow the way I want, I’m just learning, so just let me figure out how stupid I am on my own.  I don’t have to be reminded by any horrible notes, it’s pointless since I already know.  You may say I’m immature, well, yeah, I’m only sixteen.  It’s possible you may have been at sixteen too.  I’m just trying to be the best person I can be.

Well, today I have nothing to do, but tomorrow, I’m gonna go shopping for clothes, get my hair done, and get my permit (which I could’ve gotten SEVERAL months ago, but I was busy and didn’t really have any real motivation for a while)  Now, that I think about it, if I would’ve gotten my permit on my birthday I could’ve had my liscence by now.  I think I could’ve gotten it in April.  Oh, well.  This just means I’ll get my lisence in February which is the most boring, dark, depressing month of the year and it’ll give me something to look forward to that month.  I can’t help it.  I hate february.  It’s always so dark, cold, and wet and there’s no holidays to celebrate (like Christmas in December) to take your mind off of it and you end up feeling kinda depressed.  Not, horribly, but you know, knda, drab and bored with no sunshine and you’re still in school with several months to spare.
So, anyway… tomorrow is also the band cook out which should be fun and then my field cammander meeting with my director.  I saw him out in his yard the other day wearing the bright orange band shirt we always have to wear to contests.  He needs a life.  He’s such a big dork, but in a good way.  He’s also like a big kid, and he talks to his students like they’re his friends, not like their his obnoxious students he has to teach everyday.
Well, gotta go, it’s late.

Okay, a lot has happened since my last entry.  For a while I was too busy to make another entry, then I was too lazy, then I bought a journal just to write in not to type, but I haven’t gotten around to writing in that lately and I was bored and felt like typing so I decided to update my online journal.
Okay, let’s see.  I’ll start by explaining things that happened at band camp.  Okay, the rookie camp went well.  I think my career as drum major got off to a pretty good start.  But then band camp started and I was literally suffering from an anxiety crisis only to be cured by the least expected person–Lance.  Okay, Mr.  Parker had this former drum major from this awsome band North Hardin come in and help Lindsay and I.  She (Hana) was trying to teach us to conduct the way she was taught and I would have to say by her standards I’m pretty sure she thought Lindsay was better than me which made me feel bad because I’m Head Field Cammander.  We conducted the band a few times over the course of band camp and screwed up miserably each time.  Okay, it wasn’t that bad, but we had no idea what we were doing.  We were so confused cause Hana was telling us one thing and Mr. Parker was telling us another.  I also kept getting this bad vibe from Mr. Parker that he was starting to hate me.  He kept snapping at me.  Ann Marie noticed that too.  He kept snapping at her too.  So, I came home the first night from band camp and I was upset but trying to hide it (cause your not supposed to show your upset when your fc cause it brings the whole band down) and I kept trying to tell myself it would all be okay, but I felt so horrible like I was the worst field cammander in the world and I got online that night and Lance was on.  I was like, “Lance, I suck so bad!”  and I just let it all go.  And he was like, “That can’t be true.  What are you so horrible at?”  And he told me to list the things I thought I was so horrible at and I couldn’t really come up with much and he was like, “See?  Your just starting so give it sometime.”  So, for the rest of band camp I would come home and talk to Lance about everything that had happened that day and he would always make me feel better.  The one person I hadn’t been fond with my freshman year and I was never very close to most of my sophomore year and he was now becoming one of my best friends but it made me feel terrible because I can’t hardly see him anymore since he graduated.  Over the rest of the summer we talked almost everynight.  I kept trying to get him to come to band camp but he was afraid Mr. P. would get mad at him.  The last day we were going to a dci show and I told him he could come visit at lunch that day before we left and lunch came and went and he never showed up.  We got back at about 1:45 in the morning and I was walking to my car and I noticed some dude came up and started walking beside me and I was watching him out of the corner of my eye cause I thought he was just gonna pass me and he never did so I finally looked up and there was Lance!  He was like, “Hey, you look a little sleepy!”  We talked for a few minuets and I told him Tashia was around and he didn’t seem that interested, he usually is cause she’s a pretty good friend, but he was jsut like, yeah, and kept talkin to me.  I only got to talk to him for about ten minuets and I felt bad that I couldn’t talk to him that long.

So, I now have my new best friend Lance. Well, I have lots of best friend, well, actually I have four BEST friends, but several new friends I made at band camp this year. Of course my best friends are Lance, Natashia,Ann Marie, and Travis. Ashley is just plain annoying. I forgot to mention that Ann Marie and I are now Really good friends agian. It started at band camp. Both of us started talking about how we thought Mr. Parker hated us and then we started talking aobut how her and Donald broke up and how she wasn’t as enthusiastic about band camp cause she went to GSA and now we’re good friends. All the freshman LOVE me. They hate Lindsay. He He. Well, it’s cause I take the time to talk to them and I went out of my way to make friends with some of them and now they love me. Lindsay just flirts with all the guys and ignores everyone else. Seriously. I mean I like Lindsay. We’ve spent a lot of time together and we are now pretty good friends, but I’m just being honest. And it’s not exactly like it’s something easy to say to someone. And a bunch of people have come up to me and complained about the way Lindsay conducts. They say when they are on Linday’s side of the field they try to look at me anyway. So, Hana was making me feel bad when I was really better than Lindsay. Now I really feel like I’m an okay field cammander and that maybe I do deserve to be HEAD field cammander. I’m actually starting to enjoy it now, too. *smiles broadly*

 Okay. You know how I was saying how I thought Mr. Parker hated me during band camp? Well, okay. . . the last Thursday of band camp there was a back to school night that night right after band camp was over. So, Mr. P. told me and Lindsay to vacume the band room sometime during the day. Well, there never was a chance since there is always someone in the room. Actually alwasy A LOT of people in the room. After practice he asked me if we had done it and I told him we were gonna wait til after practice and he said we only had fifteen minuets. So Lincsay and I went searching for a vacume and we couldn’t find one that worked so we came back in the band room and Mr. G. was like, “FCS! Aren’t you all gonna vacume?” So, we got out the broom and started cleaning. Lindsay’s mom came in and was like, “We gotta go now. . . blah, blah. . .” And Lindsay started yelling, “I can’t! I have to clean up the band room!” Mr. P heard and was like, “You don’t HAVE to do anything.” Kyle and AMK overheard and were like, “Lindsay go home we’ll help Mallory.” but she refused. Lindsay’s mom kept complaining and finally stopped and Lindsay started crying while we were sweeping up everything. Mr. Parker came out of his office and he was like, “You know what? Just stop and come into my office for a sec.” He told us it was okay that we couldn’t do the vacume and that we shouldn’t feel like we’re bad fcs if we can’t do something like that and he thought we were doing a good job, depite anything he had done or said over the past two weeks. That was nice. Anyway, I gotta go. I’ve been typing to over an hour these last three entrys to get everything up to date (oh, byw we got our new band uniforms!!) and my dad asked me if I was writing some new Amerian Novel. See ya!

Okay, I was in a really good mood most of the day.  I felt really energetic.  I was excited to go to band practice cause I thought I was gonna have a lot of energy.  I get there and it’s pick on Mallory day for Mr. Parker.  I don’t know.  He just has these certain days where he picks on one person the whole day.  And it wouldn’t bother me too much if I were actually doing a lot of stuff wrong, but it was just picky things like he was trying to find something wrong with what I was doing and it was really making me mad.  I don’t know.  Perhaps I’m just too sensitive.  But I get the feeling that everyone would just like to call up Lance and Jessica right now and have them replace me and Lindsay as field cammanders.  And I don’t care if that’s the way they feel about it.  Whatever.  Just do it and get it over with cause I’m fed up with listening to how great they were and hearing people tell me what I’m doing wrong.  I’m just tired of hearing it even when I’m trying my best.  So, whatever.  They can go call Lance and Jess cause I’m tired of it.

Okay, I don’t think Travis likes me like that. And I’ve given it some thought and I guess it doesn’t really matter cause I’ve got band to concentrate on and I’ve got all my friends and I don’t really need him. Well, he’s a cool friend until he starts teasing me and then he gets mad at me when I tease him back. Now that’s very annoying. Grrrr. Anyway, before I throw a fit about the topic mentioned above I’m going to move on and say I’m reallllllllllllyyyyy nurvous. The marching band is giving a public performance tomorrow and being my first year as field cammander you might say I’m a little nurvous. Okay, see, the leadership team of the band went to this convention type thing last year where this guy, Dr. Tim talks about leadership. It was very cool, and very inspiring. And this guy was absolutely hilarious too. So, anyway, he was like, “So, how many of you in here are drum majors?” and I raised my hand and he goes, “What were you all thinking?! You have all this responibilty, you are the main leader, and yeah, like the band actually watches you!” I thought that was kinda funny and then he goes, “You all are just an ornament! Your just up there for show and to look pretty!” Mr. Parker thought that was funny and teased me about it. But I am really starting to like being Field cammander. But anyway. . . Lance is coming to tomorrow and possibly Kimberly. Lance wants me and Tash to come to the his play tomorrow, but I was like, “Lance, I would love to, but I’ve already spent thirty bucks on you!” and he said his dad was trying to get us free tickets! I was like, “Well, I think that’ll be the only way my parents will let me keep coming is if we get in free!” I was kidding of course. That was really sweet of his dad to do that. I also have to steal Lance’s old uniform from the uniform room and sneak it out to him tomorrow. Speaking of uniforms, of course I mentioned in a previous entry that the band had gotten their new uniforms. They are so cool looking. I liked the old ones, but when I saw these I was blown away. They are navy blue and white and they make us look taller and skinnier, which is what our band needs. Lindsay and I are wearing the same jacket except we get to wear the orange sash with the silver sequins on it and white pants and shoes instead of navy blue and black shoes. Anyway, I had to help the band parents while they fitted everyone and I had to help the band transfer the new uniforms to the old bags and give them numbers and give the freshman bags of seniors and people who quit (I hid Lance’s old bag, he he). It was very stressful and hot in that mildew smelling room. I was in there for several hours for the past three days (and I helped for two hours Thurs. while Lindsay sat in the band room flirting with the guys). It smells bad cause it rained all day last yeat at regionals and the uniforms never really smelled like roses after that. Speaking of rain I just heard thunder. oh, and the lights went out in the school Monday that was fun. Okay, I better go before this turns into a novel…again.

We were at practice Thursday.  We practice on Thursdays from 5:30 to 8:00 cause we get the football field and it’s cooler.  Anyway…we were on the football field and the band was standing in a set of our show and Mr. Parker was talking and I’m off in another world on my podium looking at the band and suddenly the sprinklers come on and start soaking half the band!  It was funny cause I got to see everyone’s reaction and watch them scream and run.  Ha ha.  It was very funny.  But I got my laugh and then had to calm everyone down and get them off the field.  He he.  It was quite funny.

They are navy blue and white and they make us look taller and skinnier, which is what our band needs. Lindsay and I are wearing the same jacket except we get to wear the orange sash with the silver sequins on it and white pants and shoes instead of navy blue and black shoes. Anyway, I had to help the band parents while they fitted everyone and I had to help the band transfer the new uniforms to the old bags and give them numbers and give the freshman bags of seniors and people who quit (I hid Lance’s old bag, he he). It was very stressful and hot in that mildew smelling room. I was in there for several hours for the past three days (and I helped for two hours Thurs. while Lindsay sat in the band room flirting with the guys). It smells bad cause it rained all day last yeat at regionals and the uniforms never really smelled like roses after that. Speaking of rain I just heard thunder. oh, and the lights went out in the school Monday that was fun. Okay, I better go before this turns into a novel…again.

We were at practice Thursday.  We practice on Thursdays from 5:30 to 8:00 cause we get the football field and it’s cooler.  Anyway…we were on the football field and the band was standing in a set of our show and Mr. Parker was talking and I’m off in another world on my podium looking at the band and suddenly the sprinklers come on and start soaking half the band!  It was funny cause I got to see everyone’s reaction and watch them scream and run.  Ha ha.  It was very funny.  But I got my laugh and then had to calm everyone down and get them off the field.  He he.  It was quite funny.

WHAT DO YOU THINK (WRITE WHAT YOU THINK OF THE FOLLOWING) 
98.Eminem: Well, he has some cool songs, but it seems like he needs some anger management classes.  I mean, when I saw his first video I thought he was a fun lovin guy, but as time went on he started to depress me.  I don’t have anything against him, I mean I do like most of the songs he does. 
99.Rap: I only like eminem’s songs.  Other stuff I consider crap instead of rap.  But that’s just my opinion.  Sorry, Tashia.
100.Teenagers: I love it right now.  But some people make teenagers out to be something that we’re not.  Not all of us are bad and have bad attitudes.  Adults seem to assume we have bad attitudes and they are automatically rude to us cause they think we’re gonna be. 
101.Smoking: Yuck. 
102.Death: Well, hmmm.  I dunno.  I’m just hoping it doesn’t come at me anytime soon.  Although it’s kinda mysterious.  I mean we don’t REALLY know 100% what happens after we die.

It’s not the best tastin stuff from what I’ve heard plus you get drunk.  I just don’t understand. *shakes head in bewilderment*

After all that fighting is over she’s talking to Giles and he’s using all these big words and she just looks at him and goes, “Fire bad, tree pretty.”  Absolutely hilarious.  Anyway, there was a bomb threat at our school last year and all the teachers were running around and made us all go in the gym and never told us what was going on til the end of the day.  But we were in the gym and we were goofin off cause we didn’t even know what was going on.
106.Murder: Bad.  Just kidding.  I wanna know what drives someone to do it and why they think they can live with that guilt.  Very interesting. 
107.Suicide: Well, the highest known reason is because they were looking for a way out.  And my health teacher showed us some survey that the biggest reason they wanted out was because of a break-up.  I wouldn’t get that desperate for some dumb guy. *scoffs*
108.Fear: Some scary stuff. lol.  I’m not even sure what my biggest fear is.  I think embarrassment cause it’s my least favorite emotion.  And what the heck…it seems to happen to me a lot!

Well, I will go in order of events.  My day started out bad.  But it did get better.  See Mr. Parker always says if your having a bad day, just stop, take a breath and say, “This is not going to be a bad day.”  And just change it to make it better.  
Anyway, I woke up at 7:00 got ready and left at about 7:30 to go to the high school for band practice.  I stopped and got a brownie and Mountain Dew.  I got there and wondered if we were gonna be on the football field or the asphalt cause I needed to know where the podiums were gonna go.  I went in the band room and read the board (it’s a traditon in our band) and it said Pit set up on football field and winds set up stretch formation on asphalt.  See, sometimes we just stretch on aspahlt and practice on football field so this wasn’t very clear to me if I needed to know where the podiums go.  So, Ashley went with me outside to find Mr. Parker of Mr. Gosset.  And just my luck it has to be Mr. Gosset.  I was like, “Where are we practicing.”  And he snapped, “It’s on the board, it always is.”  I was just bewildered and was like,”Well..I…….okay.”  and just stood there and he walked off.  He’s always so rude with me nowadays and giving me these evil looks and everybody just thought I was parinoid, but there it was, I had proof and a witness.  I was so upset.  I walked back in the bandroom trying not to cry but failing miseralbly.  I was wiping off my face when two freshman jumped me, Elizabeth and that annoying Lindsay girl and didn’t even realize I was upset.  They were like, “Mr. Parker said when you get here you have to give out all the windsuits to the new people and mark off their names and then put the sheet on his desk.”  I was like great.  So, I started doing that and was getting too many people crowded around me grabbing at stuff and having that Lindsay girl constantly asking if she should mark off the people.  Veterans that ordered new pants were mad cause we were only handing out freshman stuff and freshman mad cause they didn’t get what they ordered and two freshamn guys trying to mock me.  They were jsut trying to tease me, but I wasn’t in the mood to play along.  So, I was like, “Okay!  Everyone stop!  I will hand your stuff to you in an orderly fashion so just calm down.”  Then 5 minuets before practice I had to put the sheet on his desk.  Lindsay hadn’t takin any of the yard markers our or Dr. Beat.  I had to hunt down both cause nobody felt the need to put them in the place they usually go.  I got out on the asphalt with Ashley and set up the Dr. Beat and started Bawling.  Of course it only lasted two minuets cause I had to start practice.

43,https://www.opendiary.com/m/mnmchick2004/but-it-got-better-3041531/,2002-08-24,But It Got Better,"
So, I went out to the front of the stretch formation with Lindsay asking me what was wrong.  I didn’t tell her.  Anyway, we practiced for a while and it went okay.  I was starting to feel better.  So, anyway, our public performance was at 11:15 and we started changing at about 10 til 11:00.  After Linsay and I got changed we threw together some bow that looked like crap that we were supposed to do after the first and last song.  Then we warmed up on the football practice field and then the performance started.  Lance showed up of course.  That’s what made me so nervous cause I knew he was gonna be watching me.  Anyway, we performed the show twice which I don’t think we should’ve done cause everyone was dead tired.  Anyway, I think both of them went really well.  The seconde time we did it I had a mishap, though.  I have to run from back field to the podium on the 40 yardline.  The podium is made so that you can flip the thing you stand on up or down so that you can fold it up and carry it.  Well, I jumped up there when the band was silent on a certain part and it flipped up and I had to lean forward so I wouldn’t fall of and it banged really loud and the whole audience saw and gasped.  It was funny afterwards. I dunno if Mr. p or g saw it but I think everyone else did.  After that song LIndsay and I switch podiums and I tried to tell her it was messed up but I guess she didn’t hear cause she came to me after the show and said it was crooked through the last song.  Then a bunch of people came to me after the show and asked me about it.  Lance said he saw it.  I told him I hoped he wouldn’t.  He just laughed.  Then I saw him later that night which I will tell you aobut later.

Well, I will go in order of events.  My day started out bad.  But it did get better.  See Mr. Parker always says if your having a bad day, just stop, take a breath and say, “This is not going to be a bad day.”  And just change it to make it better.  
Anyway, I woke up at 7:00 got ready and left at about 7:30 to go to the high school for band practice.  I stopped and got a brownie and Mountain Dew.  I got there and wondered if we were gonna be on the football field or the asphalt cause I needed to know where the podiums were gonna go.  I went in the band room and read the board (it’s a traditon in our band) and it said Pit set up on football field and winds set up stretch formation on asphalt.  See, sometimes we just stretch on aspahlt and practice on football field so this wasn’t very clear to me if I needed to know where the podiums go.  So, Ashley went with me outside to find Mr. Parker of Mr. Gosset.  And just my luck it has to be Mr. Gosset.  I was like, “Where are we practicing.”  And he snapped, “It’s on the board, it always is.”  I was just bewildered and was like,”Well..I…….okay.”  and just stood there and he walked off.  He’s always so rude with me nowadays and giving me these evil looks and everybody just thought I was parinoid, but there it was, I had proof and a witness.  I was so upset.  I walked back in the bandroom trying not to cry but failing miseralbly.  I was wiping off my face when two freshman jumped me, Elizabeth and that annoying Lindsay girl and didn’t even realize I was upset.  They were like, “Mr. Parker said when you get here you have to give out all the windsuits to the new people and mark off their names and then put the sheet on his desk.”  I was like great.  So, I started doing that and was getting too many people crowded around me grabbing at stuff and having that Lindsay girl constantly asking if she should mark off the people.  Veterans that ordered new pants were mad cause we were only handing out freshman stuff and freshman mad cause they didn’t get what they ordered and two freshamn guys trying to mock me.  They were jsut trying to tease me, but I wasn’t in the mood to play along.  So, I was like, “Okay!  Everyone stop!  I will hand your stuff to you in an orderly fashion so just calm down.”  Then 5 minuets before practice I had to put the sheet on his desk.  Lindsay hadn’t takin any of the yard markers our or Dr. Beat.  I had to hunt down both cause nobody felt the need to put them in the place they usually go.  I got out on the asphalt with Ashley and set up the Dr. Beat and started Bawling.  Of course it only lasted two minuets cause I had to start practice.

When I say I think I’ve lost it, I don’t mean my mind.  I mean my confidence.  When I became field cammander I felt as if I had this new kind of confidence within me.  Now, lately people have been critizing me, teasing me and it’s all just piling up so that I can’t take it anymore and I feel I’ve lost that confidence I’ve had.  One of my teachers tried to accuse me of not doing my homework and tried to make me feel stupid.  Mr. Gosset hates me and was yelling at me during practice yesterday and kept trying to get Parker to start in on me too.  I was teasing Travis and said I was gonna tell everyone he got and F and he said he’d tell everyone I was stupid and ugly and nobody liked me.  Parker was talking about how Lindsay and I needed to work up the confidence to show more dynamics on a certain song.  I was thinking, “I don’t think I have any left after this week to do anything.”  Maybe I’m just being sensitive.  I dunno.  I jsut can’t take it anymore.
Anyway, don’t ya just hate it when people keep asking you stupid questions that they can eventually figure out themselves but they just ask you to ask you.  And they keep asking you these dumb questions to be silly or stupid and it’s not funny to you at all and ya just wish they’d shut-up?  I am not having a good week.  I wish everyone would leave me alone.  Why did I try our for field cammander?  Everbody just wishes I were Lance or Jessica.  Mr. Gosset probably wouldn’t hate me. I probably wouldn’t be critized so much.  I just want to crawl in a holw deep within the earth’s surface and never come out.

Okay, I think everything is gonna be okay.  Ann Marie said no to Kyle– I don’t mean that’s good or anything, but now I’m not stuck in between.  Well, I still am a little bit but not like before.  I mean, I’m glad I didn’t get so pulled in that they both got mad at me or anything.  I was sure she was gonna say yes, and I told Kyle I was pretty sure but not totally sure.  He came to me this morning and was like, “Well, no luck.”  and I told him I was sorry but he said it wasn’t a big deal, he didn’t mind.  Then Ann Marie came up to me and the first thing she said was, “You should date Kyle.”  and I was like, “WHAT?!”  She goes, “You two are just alike you’re perfect for each other.  She has said before that she thinks of us as the same person.  One day my contact fell out during practice and then later Kyle and Ann Marie got in the car and Kyle lost his and Ann Maire goes, “Again?  Oh, wait, that was Mallory.  Sorry, I think of you two as the same person.”  I dunno.  I wouldn’t mind but I don’t see it happening.  I’ve lost all hope.  But I’m just glad everything is okay for now.  I still haven’t seen Travis since Saturday, but I’ve had time to think and I really don’t think I like him like that anymore.  I dunno.  He can do whatever.  Maybe I never did, I just wanted someone to like because I didn’t think about him all the time like I usually do.  I didn’t look for him everywhere or get all that excited when I saw him.  I just think maybe I never really did.  I don’t now, that’s for sure.  Now the hard part is explaining to him why I was acting so weird Saturday, lol.  I could say I was high, but he knows I don’t do that kinda stuff.  I was high on life?  Nope, not very believable.  Hmmmm.  I could say I had other stuff on my mind and I was gonna tell him, but decided against it and it was really no big deal.  Then we can all go back to the way things were before.  I even believe that me thinking I liked him was kinda hurting our friendship.  I dunno.  Well, if that was it, it stops now.  I do kinda like Kyle but I dunno.  Ann Marie was like, “You gotta date him.” After the parade today and I was like, “I dunno. He doesn’t like me like that.”  She was like, “Sure he does.  If I talk him into it would you date him?”  I was like, “Well, yeah.”  And she laughed at me cause I did kinda answer that kinda right away like I didn’t have to think about it. Lol. Well, I gotta go.  I’m still tired from that lame (extremly hot) parade we had to march in.

Okay, I think everything is gonna be okay.  Ann Marie said no to Kyle– I don’t mean that’s good or anything, but now I’m not stuck in between.  Well, I still am a little bit but not like before.  I mean, I’m glad I didn’t get so pulled in that they both got mad at me or anything.  I was sure she was gonna say yes, and I told Kyle I was pretty sure but not totally sure.  He came to me this morning and was like, “Well, no luck.”  and I told him I was sorry but he said it wasn’t a big deal, he didn’t mind.  Then Ann Marie came up to me and the first thing she said was, “You should date Kyle.”  and I was like, “WHAT?!”  She goes, “You two are just alike you’re perfect for each other.  She has said before that she thinks of us as the same person.  One day my contact fell out during practice and then later Kyle and Ann Marie got in the car and Kyle lost his and Ann Maire goes, “Again?  Oh, wait, that was Mallory.  Sorry, I think of you two as the same person.”  I dunno.  I wouldn’t mind but I don’t see it happening.  I’ve lost all hope.  But I’m just glad everything is okay for now.  I still haven’t seen Travis since Saturday, but I’ve had time to think and I really don’t think I like him like that anymore.  I dunno.  He can do whatever.  Maybe I never did, I just wanted someone to like because I didn’t think about him all the time like I usually do.  I didn’t look for him everywhere or get all that excited when I saw him.  I just think maybe I never really did.  I don’t now, that’s for sure.  Now the hard part is explaining to him why I was acting so weird Saturday, lol.  I could say I was high, but he knows I don’t do that kinda stuff.  I was high on life?  Nope, not very believable.  Hmmmm.  I could say I had other stuff on my mind and I was gonna tell him, but decided against it and it was really no big deal.  Then we can all go back to the way things were before.  I even believe that me thinking I liked him was kinda hurting our friendship.  I dunno.  Well, if that was it, it stops now.  I do kinda like Kyle but I dunno.  Ann Marie was like, “You gotta date him.” After the parade today and I was like, “I dunno. He doesn’t like me like that.”  She was like, “Sure he does.  If I talk him into it would you date him?”  I was like, “Well, yeah.”  And she laughed at me cause I did kinda answer that kinda right away like I didn’t have to think about it. Lol. Well, I gotta go.  I’m still tired from that lame (extremly hot) parade we had to march in.

Well, I think everything is a whole lot better than they were a week ago.  Lol.  Only one person has truly pissed me off since then.  That was Ashley’s mom last night.  We were at Cavern’s Marching band contest and we had lined up to change from our uniforms to our wind suits after the performance.  We were in the changing area and she came up to me and was kissing my butt like none other and I thought that was rather odd because she is never very nice to me.  (I told Lance I don’t think she likes me very much and he laughed and was like, yeah, I don’t think she likes me either.)  I knew something had to be up.  Then she goes, “I wanna give you a tip just between the two of us.”  I was like, “Oh, shit.  She’s gonna piss me off.”  I couldn’t get away from her cause we were walking up the stairs.  I was trying to think of a way out.  Now that I think of it, I could’ve ran up the stairs because I don’t think she could really catch up.  Oh, well.  I’ll remember next time.  Anyway, she was like, “I was thinking you and Lindsay should fix the line up when we’re walking over here.  Ya, you like Lance and Jessica.”  Stupid bitch.  She don’t even know what she’s talking about.  She we’re supposed to walk in a line looking straight ahead, no talking when we walk anywhere at a contest.  If I remember correctly Lance and Jessica were never outspoken enough to “Correct” anyone or tell anyone to be quiet.  If anyone did it, it was Lance because he was in the back of the line to see people being stupid.  Lindsay and I are in the front of the line unable to see people.  And we can’t turn around because we’re supposed to look straight ahead.  The reason Lance was in the back is because he lead the “guy line” and guys are in the back.  If the stupid bitch can’t tell, Lindsay and I are both girls unable to walk in the back to see people.  Stupid bitch was just trying to find something wrong with what I do because her stupid daughter is too whiny and immature to do anything like be field cammander.  GRR.  I hate stupid people.  And perhaps I wouldn’t have been so pissed off and I might’ve tried to tolerate it if she hadn’t added the last part…,”Like Lance and Jessica.”  Bitch.  GRRRRRRR.  I hate her.  She needs a life anyway.  Anytime I say something to her or ask her a question it’s like I’ve insulted her and she always answers in a smart ass tone.  I’m very angry.  Anyway, we got second place in our class.  The scores were very low for the night.  We had a 75.5.  The highest score was an 84.  I had fun.  I wasn’t as nervous as I thought I was gonna be.  I forgot my salute at the end.  I’m supposed to turn around after the last song and salute.  I turned around and stood there for a few seconds thinking, “Now what am I supposed to do?”  and did some crappy salute really quick and left Lindsay in the dust.  Lol.  Before the show we had practiced that over and over.  It’s supposed to be an 8 count salute and I think my crappy one was like two.  Lol.  Opps.  That’s okay.  I hope they were just looking at me so it would look like I meant to do it.  If they saw both me and Lindsay they would know I messed up.  That’s okay though.  Lol.  And Lindsay was running down her podium after the second song and slipped on the last step, but caught herself.  Everytime we would run past each other she was like, “I Gotta pee!”  It was funny.  Well, gotta go.

Well, it has been a year since the terrorist acts on our county.  Today in Spanish we watched them read off the names of the people who had died.  Some idiot guys in our class were talking and laughing the whole time.  Then they started to send around a petition saying, “If you are not sad about this sign here.”  Idiots.  How stupid and insensitve can you be?  GRRRR.  Some people are soooooo dumb.  We had an assembly.  The band (ME!) played the Star-Spangled Banner.  Some people talked and we has some local police men and fire men come in.  There was lots of red, white, and blue today.  Lol.  Well, I gotta go.

Okay, I haven’t written in a really long time but I’ve been VERY busy.  And I did try to write one time but the stupid thing wouldn’t save what I had written.  So, anyway. . .Band stuff.  Okay, the second contest was at Todd County.  We were up against Cumberland, Caldwell, and Logan.  We got second to Logan.  We also got best percussion and a distinguished rating.  Then we went to Murray the next contest.  We got third in our class.  We beat E-town and Apollo.  Murray and Calloway beat us.  But we made it to Finals.  That was awsome.  Then yesterday we went to Hart County.  We got fourth cause we didn’t do a very good performance.  LaRue, E-town, and Anderson beat us.  We still beat Barren though.  I’m so upset though.  I wanted to beat E-town so bad again.  Now they are gonna think it’s just a fluke that we beat them before.  Grr.  Supposedly we’ve got a good chance of winning at Christian County this weekend, but Mr. Parker didn’t say who we were up against.  I’m only writing the placement at these contests for right now.  I’ll tell ya about the social stuff later cause I’m not feeling very good right now.  My eyes are watering for some reason and they won’t stop and I can’t see very well.  Lol.  And plus so much “social stuff” happened that I figure it should be a whole other entry.  Well, see ya.

Sometimes I feel: unsure of myself
In the morning I: make my self look way different than I do when I go to sleep.
I like to sleep: A LOT
If I could be doing anything right now I would be: with Adam
Money is: never really anything I think about
One thing I wish I had is: I don’t think I really know what I want at this point.
One thing I have that I wish I didn’t is: my love problem
All you need is: friends
All I need is: friends and band.  Lol
Love is: non-existant 
My body is: *shudders* no comment
If an angel flew into my window at night I would: ask why love doesn’t exist and why my best friend was taken away from me.
If a demon crashed into my window I would: make it pay for my damaged window… then stake it.  Like buffy the Vampire Slayer!
If I could see one person right now it would be: hmm.  probably Adam.
Something I want but I don’t really need is: Adam
Something I need but I don’t really want is: a life
I live for: band and friends
I dare you all to: accept that bad things are always gonna happen but stay a happy person because people will like you better than if you act depressed all the time.
I am afraid of: being alone. being rejected.  and I’m also afraid of what seems to be in my near future–ending up one of those lonely old ladies who lives in an apartment with a bunch of smelly cats.
It makes me angry when: PEOPLE DON’T MIND THEIR OWN BUISNESS AND SCREW WITH YOUR LIFE EVEN THOUGH IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THEM WHATSOEVER AND THEY JUST SCREW WITH YOU BECAUSE THEIR BORED AND HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO DO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I dream about: what’s going on in my life
I daydream about: being with a hot guy. lol

In the morning I: make my self look way different than I do when I go to sleep.

_____It isn’t a game. The consequences are real. The people are real. Stakes are high. Morale is low. Fatigue is setting in. The tactics must change, or both of us will be worse off before we met. ____When you have faced a trauma that leaves you dehumanized, the first post trauma stage is the loss of one’s sense of identity as whatever one would call a “normal” human being. The second stage is that period of numbness and detachment when the mind cannot seem to reconnect with the body as it walks through what has become a Kafkaesque reality. This period can last for just a few days, or up to a few years. Even years later, long after one has buried the past so deep that one has forgotten why one does the things one does, the past can affect one’s behavior. The third stage is usually long after the horror itself is over, but the nightmares don’t go away. Only when the nightmares stop can you return to what you were before: A human being. This is deep stuff.

We were supposed to get a three day weekend for Veteran’s Day.  But I’ve been sick all weekend so I couldn’t enjoy it.  I went to winter drumline practice today and I got a migrane in the middle of the rehearsal.  And stupid adam (my ex) kept pushing me and and shoving me and smackin into me and tripping me.  it was getting on my nerves.  everytime he would even look at me all my friends would shoot him dirty looks.  then adam was walking in the room and allison saw him and she turned to me and said kinda loud, “would you ever go back out with him if he asked you out again?” i said kinda loud, “NO!”  and then he smacked into me really hard.  then asked me if my head was feeling any better.  Oh, please.  Well, I gotta go practice my all-state music.  Bye!

Well, I’m I’ve been thinking a lot lately about a lot of different things so I’m just gonna write things as they come into my head even if they don’t make since.  First of all I think Arland is really hot.  But I was reading his online diary and he seems kinda disturbing.  Maybe not.  When I talked to him in person he seemes really nice but in his journal he uses lots of bad language.  I know, I’m a goody two shoes.  I told Natashia today that I like a lot of guys but they all have at least one quality that bugs me about them.  All of them except Kyle.  He’s so perfect.  He’s the perfect guy I’ve always pictured.  *sighs*  Why can’t he like me?  Oh well.  Okay, another thought.  This is actually kinda funny.  Just something that happened.  Me, Tashia, and Kimberly went to see the new Harry Potter movie.  There is this character called, “Moaning Myrtle” who is always crying and moaning and in one scene she was crying and saying something like, “Nobody cares about poor Myrtle!” and me and Tashia both turned to each other at the same time and go, “Ashley…”  HAHAHAHA.  How sad is that?  I’m gonna punch Ashley one of these days.  I had to give her a ride to the middle school the other day and my dad had to drive.  I told her not to talk about adam (my ex) and she gave me this really bitchy look and goes, “WHY?”  i got pissed and snapped, “Because my dad will get mad.”  i practically yelled it and retured the bitchy look.  It wasn’t like I was trying to be rude about it.  I was trying to be nice about it.  So, if the stupid bitch gives me another look like that for another reason I’m gonna end up bitch slapping her.  Then she went and told Tashia about what happened. Stupid bitch.  As if she didn’t think Tashia would tell me.  She must have a lot of time on her hands to be such a stupid bitch all the time.  I’m using the word bitch a lot tonight.  Ha ha.  She’s always saying she doesn’t have time to practice and she doesn’t have time to do her homework.  Well, what the hell is she doing?  Trying to think of more reasons to get mad at us all?  Thinking of how many ways she hates the world???  What a bitch.  haha.  Anyway.  Hmmmm.  I wonder if I have anything else to say.  Oh, I hate my spanish teacher mr. torres.  he had no brains what so ever.  he doesn’t know how to teach.  I haven’t learned anything in that class.  Second of all there was this guy at our school that died recently.  Nobody really knows for sure what happened yet.  But Mr. Torres comes in today and says it was because he overdosed.  But he doesn’t know that for sure.  what an ass-hole.  He’s a freakin teacher and he’s speading crap that’s probably not even true.  Moron.  People like that should not even be allowed to teach.  If he can get a job as a teacher, then God only knows what I can do.  Let’s see.  What else can I talk about???  I dunno.  Oh, Clay finally talked to me for the first time since Adam opened his big mouth and told him that I liked him.  He came up to me in the lunch line and hugged me and asked how i was doing.  Lol.  He’s hot.  hehe.  and really sweet.  Well, I’m gonna go.  Bye

Yeah, I’m bored.  I’m waiting for the new version of msn messenger to download.  Well, not much is going on.  I had an ear infection.  It hurts.  Hmm.  Mr. Gosset gave me a solo in the Christmas concert. Haha.  You bet Ashley loved that.  It’s only four measures long, but it’s still a solo.  I also might have another solo.  Me and Ash have to compete for that for Mr. Parker.  Mr. Gosset didn’t want to go through that crap so he just gave me the other one.  Haha.  Well, I should get both of them because I already beat Ashley at all-district symphonic band auditons.  I shouldn’t have to try to beat her again.  but oh well.  The basketball games are coming up very soon.  I believe the first game we play at is Dec. third.  I’m supposed to conduct half the games, and Lindsay is supposed to conduct the other half.

I didn’t even notice who was standing beside me and suddenly I felt someone grab me and give me this HUGE hug.  I didn’t even know who it was!  Finally they let go and I was it was Clay. Some people started laughing and some said, “awww.” It made me feel a whole lot better for some reason.  I don’t know what’s wrong with me.  I just feel like crying.  I don’t even know why.  This sucks.  GRRRRRRRRRRRR.  I’m chatting with Kyle right now (the perfect guy) and he’s just being Kyle but I just want to cry at everything he says.  I don’t know why.  He’s just being Kyle.

lots of random thoughts that I’m sure won’t make any sense to you all but it makes me feel better.
It got lost in all the Chaos.
Now I don’t think I’ll be able to find it again.
At least not for a while.
Maybe I don’t really feel like it right now.
Maybe I just don’t see the point and refuse to.
Does that make me a depressed person if I give up for one day?
Screw you if you think so.
You asked me a question and I gave you an answer.
So, don’t give me that damn look if you’re not gonna explain it.
Are you trying to tell me you think I should just give up and deny what I’m feeling whether or not I can help it?
Are you trying to tell me I’m not good enough for him all in one single damn look?
I would rather you say it then give me some smart ass look.
Then you..
I go to YOU for comforting because even the smallest word from you means everything to me.  
but you didn’t understand, and that hurts me more than anything.
you wanted to pretend to understand just so I would shut-up and you could brush me off and not have to deal with someone else’s problems. 
Well, unless they’re ann marie’s or jessica’s.  
I don’t know whether to smile cause you’re my friend or cry because you’re not more..
then YOU!
I hope you find the woman with the perfect figure if that’s really all you’re looking for.  
and I hope that’s all she has.
doesn’t matter that we’ve been friends forever, but you’ll marry the first slut that has the perfect figure.  screw you.
then You…
my best friend.
it doesn’t matter that I’m there when you’re around those two guys.
they’re so much fun.
and then you forget that you have responsibilites.
i know i can’t spell.
You’re gonna leave me in less than a year
I’m gonna miss you so much
you’ve known him all your life and met me three years ago and still don’t give me the time of day when he’s there.
you’ve shown me you care, but you’ve never said I was you’re best friend.
sometimes, people do need to hear it..
then YOu…
we were supposed to become good friends.
that’s the way it’s supposed to be when you work so hard together. 
but you’re too good for me 
or so you think so around all those guys
they make you look good don’t they?
well, they make me look like shit. 
the field commander who can’t get the guys.  
well, no one likes you except those three or four guys because everyone else thinks your a freakin ho
who’s everyone’s favorite field commander??
not you!
then you…
you were there for me when i needed you..
then it just slipped
oh i know you didn’t mean anything bad by it
but it came out that way
and when you say something like that you cant take it back because it’s a slip up of the truth.
i don’t hate you for it.
i know you love me as a friend.
the truth had to come out.  
it wasn’t your fault that it just happened to be you.
then you… 
you were also there for me when I needed you..
but is it just an act?
are you really my friend or are you just being nice?
it hurts not to see you anymore
yet you don’t seem to feel it like I do
you don’t miss me like I miss you.  
you make excuses not to come
you don’t undertand it hurts me and her.
If you only knew what you meant to me…
but you have no idea.
and I could tell you, but you still wouldn’t understand
because you’re a guy.
a simple, “oh.”  would be all that would come from you.
girls say all this stuff, “i miss you. you’re the greatest friend.” 
we expect,” I miss you too.  you a great friend too.”  
but from a guy all you’ll get is a simple, “oh, thanks.”
then YOU..
all I can say about you is you’re chock full of lies and an ego that fills the room so they’re no space or oxygen in it for other people but you and your give-it-up-to-anyone girlfriend. 
stupied sex freak.
I hope she gets pregnant.
and I hope it’s from the same person she cheated on you with before… who was it.. your uncle? cousin? same thing.
you’re both sick freaks with your matching shirts that say you love each other.
what? you need proof to show everyone so it makes your love seem more real?
and you…
all I can say is, I look up to you like another father
I thought you knew what was going on..
so why did you say what you said?
did you want to see my reaction like everyone else does when they get bored?
why did you spend the whole class time with him?
I know you shouldn’t judge your students when you find out some things they’ve done..
but he says things to you that burst his ego up more..
and when you spent all that time with him it made me feel jealous
because I’ve always wanted to be that close to you.  
I spent years trying to and all he has to do is taunt you with a simple, “yeah, you can’t play tuba..”
It really hurt me more than it should’ve
and back to you..
the perfect guy…
i’m wasting away in your perfection.
the way you look at me hurts me because I want you to look at me a different way.
I can wait forever but i’ll keep getting looks like I got today from her
why can’t you ignore what you see and look on the inside?
You claim to have a certain amount of maturity but you’re really like every other guy in your complete cluelessness.  
what kind of perfection is that?
clawing to the surface, pulling my head above the water, then being pushed back in.  then pulled back up by the ones I trust, then a few accidently let go.. can you really trust people?  Or am I lost in the dark water forever?
…It’s been lost in the chaos… and I don’t think I’ll be able to find it again… at least not for a while…
well, gotta go. it 2:15 in the morning. buh bye

the field commander who can’t get the guys.  
well, no one likes you except those three or four guys because everyone else thinks your a freakin ho
who’s everyone’s favorite field commander??
not you!
then you…
you were there for me when i needed you..
then it just slipped
oh i know you didn’t mean anything bad by it
but it came out that way
and when you say something like that you cant take it back because it’s a slip up of the truth.
i don’t hate you for it.
i know you love me as a friend.
the truth had to come out.  
it wasn’t your fault that it just happened to be you.
then you… 
you were also there for me when I needed you..
but is it just an act?
are you really my friend or are you just being nice?
it hurts not to see you anymore
yet you don’t seem to feel it like I do
you don’t miss me like I miss you.  
you make excuses not to come
you don’t undertand it hurts me and her.
If you only knew what you meant to me…
but you have no idea.
and I could tell you, but you still wouldn’t understand
because you’re a guy.
a simple, “oh.”  would be all that would come from you.
girls say all this stuff, “i miss you. you’re the greatest friend.” 
we expect,” I miss you too.  you a great friend too.”  
but from a guy all you’ll get is a simple, “oh, thanks.”
then YOU..
all I can say about you is you’re chock full of lies and an ego that fills the room so they’re no space or oxygen in it for other people but you and your give-it-up-to-anyone girlfriend. 
stupied sex freak.
I hope she gets pregnant.
and I hope it’s from the same person she cheated on you with before… who was it.. your uncle? cousin? same thing.
you’re both sick freaks with your matching shirts that say you love each other.
what? you need proof to show everyone so it makes your love seem more real?
and you…
all I can say is, I look up to you like another father
I thought you knew what was going on..
so why did you say what you said?
did you want to see my reaction like everyone else does when they get bored?
why did you spend the whole class time with him?
I know you shouldn’t judge your students when you find out some things they’ve done..
but he says things to you that burst his ego up more..
and when you spent all that time with him it made me feel jealous
because I’ve always wanted to be that close to you.  
I spent years trying to and all he has to do is taunt you with a simple, “yeah, you can’t play tuba..”
It really hurt me more than it should’ve
and back to you..
the perfect guy…
i’m wasting away in your perfection.
the way you look at me hurts me because I want you to look at me a different way.
I can wait forever but i’ll keep getting looks like I got today from her
why can’t you ignore what you see and look on the inside?
You claim to have a certain amount of maturity but you’re really like every other guy in your complete cluelessness.  
what kind of perfection is that?
clawing to the surface, pulling my head above the water, then being pushed back in.  then pulled back up by the ones I trust, then a few accidently let go.. can you really trust people?  Or am I lost in the dark water forever?
…It’s been lost in the chaos… and I don’t think I’ll be able to find it again… at least not for a while…
well, gotta go. it 2:15 in the morning. buh bye

Lol.  I love saying that.  People think I’m crazy when I say it.  I’m not sure why.  I’m just trying to be cheerful.  Well, I think I’m feeling better than I was a couple of days ago.  I was feeling pretty down.  I get that way in the winter a lot.  But also it was that time of the month.  Haha.  Isn’t that just great?  I’m also sure everyone wanted to know that.  Oh well.  I’m bored and I just wanted to write in my journal.  Lalalala.  Hmmm. Not much to say.  I sent that poem a wrote a few days ago to my friend Kati.  If ya wanna read it, it’s under the entry, “a few random thoughts.  probably won’t make sense.”  She loved it.  She said it was the only poem that’s ever made her cry.  Lol.  I’m not gonna let anyone else I know see it.  Mainly cause It’s about most of my best friends.  Haha.  I guess the people you love the most hurt you the most, don’t they?  Although I love Kati a lot (not like that) but she hasn’t really hurt me.  I guess cause I haven’t known her as long as all those other people.  I can’t believe that girl is a freshman.  She’s such a great person.  She’s very mature for her age.  She’s just like me.  It’s great.  Well, I’m gonna go.  Buh-bye.

Okay, there are two guys I like.  I don’t mean I just think they’re hot…I mean I really like them…they both have such great personalities.  Lol.  I can’t decide….although it’s not like I’m really given a choice.  I mean, it’s not like either one really like me back. There’s Travis and then there’s kyle.  I start to like one a lot…then he does something to make me mad…while the other one seems to step up and make me like him more…then HE makes me mad and the OTHER one steps up.  But right now, they’ve both made me fall for them.  It’s crazy.  But if I really think about it…if I had to make a choice, I’d probably choose Kyle.  *sigh*  I’ve liked Kyle for so long.  He hurt my feelings yesterday.  Okay, we were all getting ready to go march in the parade.  Jon knocked Kyle’s music off the stand on purpose for a laugh.  Then Jon, Adam, and Chris got kyle’s attention and kyle goes,”I don’t care as long as someone picks it up.”  see, kyle is the trumpet section leader and those three are pretty jealous of him so they bug him about it and pick out every mistake he makes.  So, none of them would pick it up.  Later on after the parade I knew none of them would do it, so I picked it up for him.  kyle and chris came up and kyle goes,”thanks chris.” and chris goes,”I didn’t do it.” and I go,”actaully, I did.” kyle just goes,”oh.” and turned back around.  It made me feel bad.  So, later on that night I got on messenger and made me screen name,”sometimes you do something for someone and they just don’t appreciate it.”  Then Kyle got on.  I tried to change my name before he saw it but he goes,”I do appreciate it when someone does something nice for me.  I just hate it when people do something stupid and don’t care.”  I was like,”i know.  but that wasn’t about you.”   of course I was lying but I didn’t want him to be mad at me.  he goes,”I didn’t really think so but just so you know.”  i go,”are you mad at me now?”  he goes,”NO!  NOt at all!  why?”  I go,”i dunno.  It just seemed that way.”  He goes,” well, I’m not at all.  I’m really sorry.”  then we talked about what idiots chris and his little gang are.  we talked a LONG time and finally I said,”I picked your music up because I knew they weren’t gonna do it.”  he goes,”well, I was hoping maybe one of them would realize they had some good left in them… but i guess not. Thank you.”  and I fell for him all over again. darn it. LOL.
And Travis has been so nice to me latey.  He told me he usually doesn’t say hi to anyone first on messenger, but he said hi to me the other day.. then yesterday for some reason he goes,”hi…gotta go.. be back later..bye.”  and when I was talking to him I told him I had to go take a nap and he goes,”NOOO!!  Will you be back later?”  i go,”well, of course.”  he goes,”good.”  and I usually tell him I love him, just to joke around and he always goes,”thanks..” and that’s all he says.  I even called him on it and said,”i’m just joking..and all you say is thanks..” but he never did anything different.  I told him that like two weeks ago.. then a few days ago he was down and calling himself a loser and I was trying to cheer him up and I go,”come on!  You’re not a loser!  I love ya!” he goes,”well, I love you too.”… i go,”wow… are you okay..you need to sit down…wait you probably already are.. you need some water?” he goes,”yeah..water would be good.” hehe. well, i’m gonna go. bye.

Okay, there are two guys I like.  I don’t mean I just think they’re hot…I mean I really like them…they both have such great personalities.  Lol.  I can’t decide….although it’s not like I’m really given a choice.  I mean, it’s not like either one really like me back. There’s Travis and then there’s kyle.  I start to like one a lot…then he does something to make me mad…while the other one seems to step up and make me like him more…then HE makes me mad and the OTHER one steps up.  But right now, they’ve both made me fall for them.  It’s crazy.  But if I really think about it…if I had to make a choice, I’d probably choose Kyle.  *sigh*  I’ve liked Kyle for so long.  He hurt my feelings yesterday.  Okay, we were all getting ready to go march in the parade.  Jon knocked Kyle’s music off the stand on purpose for a laugh.  Then Jon, Adam, and Chris got kyle’s attention and kyle goes,”I don’t care as long as someone picks it up.”  see, kyle is the trumpet section leader and those three are pretty jealous of him so they bug him about it and pick out every mistake he makes.  So, none of them would pick it up.  Later on after the parade I knew none of them would do it, so I picked it up for him.  kyle and chris came up and kyle goes,”thanks chris.” and chris goes,”I didn’t do it.” and I go,”actaully, I did.” kyle just goes,”oh.” and turned back around.  It made me feel bad.  So, later on that night I got on messenger and made me screen name,”sometimes you do something for someone and they just don’t appreciate it.”  Then Kyle got on.  I tried to change my name before he saw it but he goes,”I do appreciate it when someone does something nice for me.  I just hate it when people do something stupid and don’t care.”  I was like,”i know.  but that wasn’t about you.”   of course I was lying but I didn’t want him to be mad at me.  he goes,”I didn’t really think so but just so you know.”  i go,”are you mad at me now?”  he goes,”NO!  NOt at all!  why?”  I go,”i dunno.  It just seemed that way.”  He goes,” well, I’m not at all.  I’m really sorry.”  then we talked about what idiots chris and his little gang are.  we talked a LONG time and finally I said,”I picked your music up because I knew they weren’t gonna do it.”  he goes,”well, I was hoping maybe one of them would realize they had some good left in them… but i guess not. Thank you.”  and I fell for him all over again. darn it. LOL.
And Travis has been so nice to me latey.  He told me he usually doesn’t say hi to anyone first on messenger, but he said hi to me the other day.. then yesterday for some reason he goes,”hi…gotta go.. be back later..bye.”  and when I was talking to him I told him I had to go take a nap and he goes,”NOOO!!  Will you be back later?”  i go,”well, of course.”  he goes,”good.”  and I usually tell him I love him, just to joke around and he always goes,”thanks..” and that’s all he says.  I even called him on it and said,”i’m just joking..and all you say is thanks..” but he never did anything different.  I told him that like two weeks ago.. then a few days ago he was down and calling himself a loser and I was trying to cheer him up and I go,”come on!  You’re not a loser!  I love ya!” he goes,”well, I love you too.”… i go,”wow… are you okay..you need to sit down…wait you probably already are.. you need some water?” he goes,”yeah..water would be good.” hehe. well, i’m gonna go. bye.

We did secret santa in band and my secret santa told me who he was cause he forgot to get me something the first day.  and he could’ve really fooled me cause it was stetson(freshman trombone player) and I thought it was either blake or kyle.  I had Ricky.  He’s crazy.  but i love em. not like that. tee hee.  I just hate it when people tell me.  for the past three years we did it..i’ve basically figured it out because of people opening their big mouths.  The first day I gave Ricky his gift he found it.. then saw me standing like ten feet away and decided to harass me just for fun.  He goes,”YOU gave this to me didn’t you??”  i go,”yeah how’d u know?”  he goes,”really? i was just kidddin…”  apparently he just wanted to harass someone and I was right there…  He thought it was really funny.
I watched Scooby doo last night.  it was okay.  for some reason it just wasn’t what i expected.  hmmmm.  I guess when you watch the cartoon all your life you sorta have high expectations for the movie..*sighs* oh well.  Lalalala.  i’m waiting for travis to get online.  He’s an awesome person.  shew..and hot.  Well, i’m gonna go.  Buh bye

My friend Ann Marie invited me and Travis to a lock in last in for new years eve.  I think to get us hooked up or something.  Well, I thought Travis would hardly know anyone there and I would get to spend some time with him.  But ONe of TRavis’s friends started talking to me and said him and a few other people TRavis was good friends with was going to be there.  I figured well he’s just gonna ignore me cause I only know him and ann marie at this thing.  But then he said something really sweet to me yesterday before we went.  I’ll just copy and paste our conversation.  Travis’s name screen name is “Who am I you ask me, you know it’s bout that grammer.”  and mine of course is “Bandgeek”

That’s it.  But when we got to the lock in it was like he had never actually said that.  He hung with his friends and I had to hang with Ann Marie.  Anytime we’d talk I couldn’t think of much to say…and usually I can around him.  Usually it’s really easy to talk to him, but I just couldn’t.  I felt like such a boring person.  Although at midnight he comes up to me and pokes me and goes,”you’re the first person I touched in  2003.” Then he just looked at me then threw his arms around me in a HUGE hug.  Ann Marie kept telling me he was gonna kiss me at midnight. haha.  well, if he wanted to he couldn’t.  This thing was held at a church…they had adults there who were watching everyone like hawks.  They got on my nerves so bad… watching us like we were gonna whip out the drugs any minuet.  Well, gotta go.  Buh bye.

My friend Kyle is friends with this girl Alyssa…he talks to her on the internet and she finally came to visit a few days ago.  He is so obsessed.  I can’t have a conversation with him without hearing her name.  He’s saying she’s so incredible.  Well, I can’t help it that I can’t say much when he’s around because he intimidates me.  I’m always afraid I’ll say something stupid.  Ann Marie (his best friend) didn’t invite him to the lock in because she knew that would be all he would talk about.  I think he splashed on just a little too much obsession for dorks.  The girl has a boyfriend and lives miles away.  *rolls eyes*  he was telling me…”she’s wonderful…” “wait…that just sounded like i was love struck didn’t it?”  i go,”yes.”  he goes,”i’m not” i go,”sure. uh huh.”  Well, this has just been buggin me.  I’m not jealous, it’s just getting on my nerves since he talks about a girl I don’t even know. :p  I’ll admit I used to like him but then I realized I can’t even talk to this guy without getting extremly nervous…and I can’t joke around with him much…he’s so serious.

Okay, here’s my conversation with ann marie about Travis.
Bandgeek  says:
i went to the game last night.  i had fun 
snow angel says:
that’s cool
snow angel says:
did you just watch or play pep band?
Bandgeek  says:
i conducted.  mr. parker and mr. gossett weren’t there.  so it was just me….and Julie
snow angel says:
oh yikes
Bandgeek  says:
yeah.  travis was there too.  I conducted the banner and he was sitting in the bleachers right behind the band….and i looked up at him when i was conducting the banner and he wasn’t looking at the flag:D he smiled at me then i started kinda laughing 
snow angel says:
awwwwwwwww….
Bandgeek  says:
😀 (L)
snow angel says:
haha.
Bandgeek  says:
he basically followed me around everywhere last night.  that makes up for new years
snow angel says:
yeah. definitely
Bandgeek  says:
after the game he came in the bandroom to say bye to me.  i went to give him a high five but he grabbed my hand and pulled me into a hug.  then everyone started going..awww and making fun of us
snow angel says:
omigosh!!
snow angel says:
okay– before new years i told him not to lead you on.. i didn’t want you to get hurt… obviously if he is acting like this he really likes you
snow angel says:
he told me he was afraid of you leading him on—i was like.. trust me! if she acts like she likes you, she does
Bandgeek  says:
he said i was leading HIM on?????  does that mean he likes me???
snow angel says:
no.. he said he was afraid that you would
snow angel says:
but.. i think it means he likes you
Bandgeek  says:
i don’t understand.  you mean he was worried he was leading me on or worried that i was going to lead him on?  this is confusing
snow angel says:
that you would
Bandgeek  says:
awwwwww  i love him to death.
Bandgeek  says:
i wouldn’t do that
snow angel says:
i know
Bandgeek  says:
i really like him A LOT!
snow angel says:
i can tell!!
Bandgeek  says:
did he say that he liked me or hint around like that
anniepoo says:
well, truthfully he basically said he just liked you as a friend… but the way he is acting now– especially after what i told him- kind of shows that i think he really does like you now
Bandgeek  says:
😀
Bandgeek  says:
today we had winter drumline practice.  and edric came up to me and goes,”Travis says hey.”  he had seen travis at church and he knew edric was going to see me today.  lol.  
anniepoo says:

Bandgeek  says:

I just got this email:
Hey, 
Just figured that I would email and tell you that you are a wonderful person. I thought that you should at least know that someone thinks you are cool. You are the sunshine in my life. Sorry, but this is the only way I can tell you without getting embarrassed.

I don’t know who it is.  Travis then sent me a survey.  One of the questions was,”recent worry….” and he wrote,”am i going about this the right way?”  I dunno.  I’m probably just getting my hopes up because the letter doesn’t sound like something he would write.  I hate when people do stuff like that.  I hate playing stupid games like that.  GRRRRR..

Okay, here’s my conversation with ann marie about Travis.
Bandgeek  says:
i went to the game last night.  i had fun 
snow angel says:
that’s cool
snow angel says:
did you just watch or play pep band?
Bandgeek  says:
i conducted.  mr. parker and mr. gossett weren’t there.  so it was just me….and Julie
snow angel says:
oh yikes
Bandgeek  says:
yeah.  travis was there too.  I conducted the banner and he was sitting in the bleachers right behind the band….and i looked up at him when i was conducting the banner and he wasn’t looking at the flag:D he smiled at me then i started kinda laughing 
snow angel says:
awwwwwwwww….
Bandgeek  says:
😀 (L)
snow angel says:
haha.
Bandgeek  says:
he basically followed me around everywhere last night.  that makes up for new years
snow angel says:
yeah. definitely
Bandgeek  says:
after the game he came in the bandroom to say bye to me.  i went to give him a high five but he grabbed my hand and pulled me into a hug.  then everyone started going..awww and making fun of us
snow angel says:
omigosh!!
snow angel says:
okay– before new years i told him not to lead you on.. i didn’t want you to get hurt… obviously if he is acting like this he really likes you
snow angel says:
he told me he was afraid of you leading him on—i was like.. trust me! if she acts like she likes you, she does
Bandgeek  says:
he said i was leading HIM on?????  does that mean he likes me???
snow angel says:
no.. he said he was afraid that you would
snow angel says:
but.. i think it means he likes you
Bandgeek  says:
i don’t understand.  you mean he was worried he was leading me on or worried that i was going to lead him on?  this is confusing
snow angel says:
that you would
Bandgeek  says:
awwwwww  i love him to death.
Bandgeek  says:
i wouldn’t do that
snow angel says:
i know
Bandgeek  says:
i really like him A LOT!
snow angel says:
i can tell!!
Bandgeek  says:
did he say that he liked me or hint around like that
anniepoo says:
well, truthfully he basically said he just liked you as a friend… but the way he is acting now– especially after what i told him- kind of shows that i think he really does like you now
Bandgeek  says:
😀
Bandgeek  says:
today we had winter drumline practice.  and edric came up to me and goes,”Travis says hey.”  he had seen travis at church and he knew edric was going to see me today.  lol.  
anniepoo says:
awwwwwwwwwwwww.
Bandgeek  says:
okay.  i need to calm down.  i dont’ wanna get my hopes up
anniepoo says:
haha
anniepoo says:
just enjoy it!
I don’t know what to think….but i love Travis to death.  *grins*

I just got this email:
Hey, 
Just figured that I would email and tell you that you are a wonderful person. I thought that you should at least know that someone thinks you are cool. You are the sunshine in my life. Sorry, but this is the only way I can tell you without getting embarrassed.

Well i was just talking to Travis and i was telling him I was mad that the “secret admirer” had picked now to do that since i already like someone A LOT.  (of course i was talking about him.)  He didn’t respond to that message..so I wrote,”do you even care?”  then he goes,”was i outta my head or was i outta my mind.  how could I have been so blind?”  it’s from a song, but what the heck does that mean????  arrrrhhhhggggggg.  then i go,”i dunno.  how could you have been so blind?”  and he goes,”i dunno…” *sighs*  i’ve got it bad for him.  *bangs head against keyboard*

Travis is being very confusing lately.  Well, the past three days he met up with me in the morning and talked to me until the bell rang for first block.  Then the past two days he’s been walking with me to band class when his class is on the other side of the school…  Then we went to the games yesterday (double header).  That girl Chrystal that likes him came.  He almost comletely ignored her.  Everytime the band had a break he would get up and leave his friends and walk with me to the lobby..and it’s not like he talked to many other people when he went with me on those breaks…..  everytime i passed by he would get up without saying a word to his friends…one time his friend micheal called him back to ask him something and chrystal stared at me….giving me this evil look.  Then after it was over he walked with me to the band room and made his friends wait (cause he had to give them a ride home).  Ann Marie pulled him away from me and said,’you should ask mallory out.” he goes,”oh, she’s just my friend… i don’t like her like that..” ann marie goes,”well you’re certainly not acting likes she’s just you’re friend….” and he just looked at her and didn’t say anything.  Hmmm.  oh well.  i’m jsut really glad i’m good friends with him.

Here’s an update on what’s been happening with Travis.  Well, let’s see.  Monday my friend Sam kept saying that I went on a date with Travis when all we did was go to Hardees with a few other people.  Then we got to lunch that day and Travis was about to sit next to Andrew and Andrew says really loud…”Why don’t you go sit by Mallory since you always want to stand by her anyway??”  Travis goes,”Okay.” and sits next to me.  Then Andrew leaned over the table and goes,”hey, Mallory….I know something…” I go, “What?”  He goes, “But I can’t tell you…”  GRRR.  Then Sam kept threatening to tell Travis I liked him.  Later that night Travis asked Sam what he had been trying to tell him and Sam goes,”OH.  Me and Jade just assumed something and we were just teasing Mallory about it….” Travis goes, “What?”  Sam goes, “We just thought you liked Mallory.”  Travis goes, “Oh.  Alright.”  And didn’t say anything else.  At least he didn’t deny it…..but then again he didn’t say he liked me either.  Then today there was room at a table with my friends at lunch and I asked Travis if he wanted to sit at the “bandgeek” table or at his normal table because he didn’t really know my frined very well.  He said he would sit with me.  Then everyone at Andrew and Sam’s table kept talking and staring at us.  And Andrew kept coming over and whispering stuff to Travis.  I wish Andrew would mind his own buisness.  He gets on my nerves sooooo bad!  Gotta go.  buh bye.

YES!  Okay.  Today I got to lunch class and I sat down next to Travis.  Then he got up to go get something and Andrew goes,”Ask him to prom!!!!!”  I was like,”NO!!!!”  So then Travis came back and everyone started talking about prom.  And they kept naming girls for Travis to go with and it was making me mad.  So we got back in english class and we had to do something with partners so me and Travis were partners and we put our desks together.  After we did whatever it was we were supposed to do we started talking.  I was like, “so, who are you taking to prom?”  he goes, “i dunno.”  I go, “Well, do you wanna go as friends?”  he looked up at me and smiled and goes, “What do you think?”  I go,”umm…no?”  he goes,”NO?  you’ve turned me down and I haven’t even asked you yet?”  I just laughed.  Then he goes, “What if you get a date?”  I go, “I won’t.  Trust me.”  he goes, “what if I get a date?”  I go, “I dunno.”  he goes, “well, if neither one of us has dates we’ll go.”  i go,”okay!”
Then we were both supposed to go to the next game which is next Friday…which is Homecoming.  I got into english and I go,”Travis…i have bad news.  I can’t go to the game cause I have to go to honers band.  I’ll be gone three days.”  He goes,”NO!  You just gonna leave me like that?  Some friend!”  I go, “And no computer so I can’t even talk to you!!!”  he goes,”NO!!!!!!”  Then we were supposed to be reading or studying the book cause we were supposed to have a quiz in a few minuets because Mrs.  Blain had just gotten on to the class for talking…So Travis held up his book and kept pointing at it like he was talking about it to me but kept talkin about me leaving.  i go,”I could call you…” (pointing at the book)  i was kiddin of course then he goes,”really?  you’re not jokin? will you really?”  he jabbed his finger at the book.  I go,”um sure if ya want me to…” he goes…”sure!!!”  *sighs*  well gotta go bye!

134,https://www.opendiary.com/m/mnmchick2004/crush-survey-5-3041577/,2003-01-19,Crush Survey!,"
Yeah, I know I steal a lot of surveys from Shadow of the Dragon but I visit her diary like everyday so it’s bound to happen.  
1- Do you have a crush at the moment? Yes.
a) If so who? Travis
2- Do you know if he/she likes you back? I dunno.  He said I was his best friend.  Everyone thinks he does.  Then he told Ann Maire he was afraid I was gonna lead him on…..whatever that means.  He sends mixed signals.
3- What are some of the things that he/she has shown interest towards you? Well let’s see.  He asked me if I was going to just ignore him at the lock in and only hang out with ann marie..  then he didn’t deny it when sam said he thought travis liked me.  every basketball game he abandons his friends and walks with me when the band gets a break.  He walks with me to first block and to band class when his class is on the other side of the school. he talked to me for two hours on the phone…we may be going to prom together.  he made me call him on breaks during drumline practice….he wants me to call him when I leave for honers band…..but i’m probably totally wrong about this.  He’s probably just being a really cool friend.
4- Do your friends care for your current crush? yes.  they love him.  they think he’s funny.  some have called him hot…some have called him sexy…allsion said, “he seems like a nice boy.” haha
5- Have you told him/her that you have feelings for them? nope.  don’t plan on it either.  that’s his job. lol.
a) What was there reaction? N/A 
6- Why do you like your current crush? He’s so funny and sweet.  I’m never bored when I talk to him.  I LOVE hanging out with him.

Yeah, I know I steal a lot of surveys from Shadow of the Dragon but I visit her diary like everyday so it’s bound to happen.  
1- Do you have a crush at the moment? Yes.
a) If so who? Travis
2- Do you know if he/she likes you back? I dunno.  He said I was his best friend.  Everyone thinks he does.  Then he told Ann Maire he was afraid I was gonna lead him on…..whatever that means.  He sends mixed signals.
3- What are some of the things that he/she has shown interest towards you? Well let’s see.  He asked me if I was going to just ignore him at the lock in and only hang out with ann marie..  then he didn’t deny it when sam said he thought travis liked me.  every basketball game he abandons his friends and walks with me when the band gets a break.  He walks with me to first block and to band class when his class is on the other side of the school. he talked to me for two hours on the phone…we may be going to prom together.  he made me call him on breaks during drumline practice….he wants me to call him when I leave for honers band…..but i’m probably totally wrong about this.  He’s probably just being a really cool friend.
4- Do your friends care for your current crush? yes.  they love him.  they think he’s funny.  some have called him hot…some have called him sexy…allsion said, “he seems like a nice boy.” haha
5- Have you told him/her that you have feelings for them? nope.  don’t plan on it either.  that’s his job. lol.
a) What was there reaction? N/A 
6- Why do you like your current crush? He’s so funny and sweet.  I’m never bored when I talk to him.  I LOVE hanging out with him.  
7- Are you friends with any of his/her friends? yes.  sam, jade, brad…. 
8- Describe your current crush: he’s kinda short but taller than me.  brownish blondish hair.  hazel eyes.  the greatest smile.  the cutest laugh.  He’s 17 but looks a lot younger.

I was talking to Travis last night.  He just suddenly out of the blue goes, “I think I might go to Erika’s tomorrow.  I”m not sure.” Erika is the Columian Exchange student in our school.  He claims they’re just friends.  But she always has to touch him when she talks to him and flirts with him.  I swear that girl can’t keep her hands to herself.  Some people say, “Oh, maybe that’s just how they are in Columbia.”  Well, I don’t see her doing it to anybody else!  I wish she’d go back to Columbia.  Anyway.  I didn’t say anything to Travis for like fifteen minutes after that.  Then he goes, “Sorry, I’m not talking much.  There’s just a lot of emotion on this side of the world tonight.”  I was like “really? what’s wrong?”  and Travis told me once that he NEVER tells ANHYONE when something is wrong.  Not even his mother.  and he was like, “i can’t say.” So, I started BEGGING him.  I was like, “i’ll give you an alomond joy (his fav).  I’ll pay you!!!!!”  he’s like, “i can’t tell you now.  Maybe later.  It’s not that big of a deal.”  I go, “I just want you to believe you can trust me.”  He goes,”I do believe I can trust you.”  I WILL get this out of him.  It’s probably another bitch trying to get him.  Probably that stupid 8th grader Chrystal or Erika.  I’m tired of everyone being all over him.  I know he’s not my boyfriend or anything but I like him A LOT.  and I Love him as a friend.  I’m protecting him because I like him that way and also because he’s my best friend.  Gosh, this sucks.  Why did I have to fall for my best friend?  I was telling my friend Courtney that I keep all his emails even if they’re stupid.. just cause they’re from him.  She goes, “Gosh.  I’ve never liked someone that much to keep their emails.” Lol.  I’m such a moron.  Words of advice.  Don’t fall for your best friend.

Well, I believe everyone has made it clear there is no room for me anywhere.  Travis asked me if there was a game. I said the band wasn’t going he said then he probably wouldn’t go.  He said well then he might not go.  I said what if I go?  he goes, “then maybe.” then later he goes, “If Erika goes i’m going to go.”  I go, “well thanks i feel specail.  NOw I know where I stand.  Nevermind about the game then.” and he didn’t answer.  He got offline.  WEll at least now I know he doesn’t like me and I know where I stand…all by myself.  Nobody wants to be my best friend.  Well forget them. I don’t need anyone.  I don’t trust anyone.  Who cares?  I give up.  I quit.  Screw them all.  I don’t need anyone but myself.  I mean, where do I belong if there is no room for me?  Well, forget it….you won’t have to worry anymore.  It’s over.

I have decided something.  I have to change.  I saw a pic of myself in the newpaper…..and i am so fat and ugly.  I can’t stand it anymore.  I”m not THAT fat but it’s enough to bug me.  and I’m tired of it.  from now on….hardly any food…..just healthy stuff if any….no coke…..just water and gatorade.  lots of excersize.  cause if I were skinny and pretty i might’ve had travis by now.

I think maybe I was overreacting to Travis’s mood.  I think there was just something weird happening but now I think he’s ok.  I got back from all-district early and I knew the game was still going on so I went in the gym and looked for travis and he was in there.  we talked for a few minutes then i said i had to go to the bandroom and he came with me.  I would always joke that I would steal a pep band shirt for him since he was the band groupie so I snuck him into the uniform room and stole an extra one.  hehe.  then i went to use mr. parker’s phone and travis was still with me and mr. p goes, “hey are you courtin someone in here?”  I just laughed cause i thought he was gonna make travis leave.  But then Mr. Parker goes, “Are you a band groupie or something?”  and that’s mine and travis’s inside joke!  and i had NEVER mentioned it to mr. p.  that was so weird that he chose those exact words.  And I’m talking to his friend andrew right now.  I’ll paste the conversation.
Bandgeek  says:

I am bored so I thought I’d write.  Travis sent me a valentine’s day card through email.  It was funny.  It was this woman ranting about how much she hated valentines day.  I think cause I’ve told him how much I hate it.  Well, I was upset and when I read it, it made me feel better.  Why was I upset?  Well, for one thing Mr. Gossett likes Lindsay better than me.  All the guys like her better than me.  I feel like the “ugly” field commander.  Cause she’s so pretty and all the guys follow her around and I’m so ugly they hardly even look at me.  It makes me feel really bad.  And since marching season has been over nobody listens to me like they used to.  Now, at least I know they only liked me cause I was field commander.  Now, nobody hardly listens when I say anything.  And I’m gonna murder Ashley H.  She is so self-centered and spoiled.  She gets mad if you don’t listen to everything she says.  I mean, I know some people can’t always listen to everything I say and I understand that.  I was just mad that they only listened to me before just because I was field commander.  But she thinks everyone has to be thinking of her feelings all the time.  And everyone should do everything for her.  She’s so full of shit.  I wanna kick her ass.  I’m gonna beat in her ugly face one of these days.  I don’t think there’s anything that can hold me back now.  I can’t stand her.  I hate her so much.  I’m afraid if she does one more thing to pis me off I might just injure the little bitch.  Well, I gotta go. bye.

What the hell. I was starting to become really good friends with this guy Sam. And I didn’t think of it as more. He was tryin to hook me up with Travis and I was tryin to hook him up with this girl Jade. Well, we’re starting to become good friends. This afternoon I was stranded and he gave me a ride home. Then I get online and Ann Marie tells me he asked her to the movies. Then I got really mad for some reason and I don’t know why! It hurts like heck. I don’t know if it’s cause she always gets the guys and always goes on the dates with them and I am just starting to be comfortable talking to them.. or if it’s cause I like him… I don’t know. I”m so confused!!!!!! But it’s all I can think about.. I’m hardly even thinking about Travis. I don’t know. I”m so mad.

I was at Ann Marie’s house and her mom works on the board of education or something important like that so Ann Marie sort of has inside information.  She told me that Mr. Parker (my favorite teacher and band dirctor!) may be leaving hext year.  He’s got a wife and two kids now and he wants to spend more time with his family so he may just being teaching at the middle school instead of the high school!!!!  He can’t do that to me.. not when next year is my senior year!  Not when he has totally changed my life forever!!!  He can’t!!  It’s not fair.  Ann Marie said something like he wanted to spend more time with his family and he may not like it anymore.  How can he not like it anymore?  He always seemed so passionate about band and music.  And it also offends me in a way…for him saying he doesn’t like it anymore.  Ahhh.  I wanna cry.  This isn’t fair.

Well, I’ve written before that Mr. Parker (my band director) may be leaving.  Well some stuff has happened since then.  Okay.  The other day we were on a winter drumline trip and we were on the bus.  I was talking with my friends Allison, Adam, and Cody.  Mr. Gossett (co-director) came up and sat behind us.  Then Cody goes, “Is Mr. Parker leaving?”  Mr. G goes, “I can’t say you’re right and I can’t say you’re wrong. but you’re on the right track.  Let’s put it this way… if anyone is leaving the high school it’s because they have a wife and two kids now and their wife is wanting them home more.”  Then later that night i overheard mr. gossett telling one of the band parents it was true.  Then the other day a kid asked went up to mr. parker and asked him if he was leaving.  he said, “i’ll talk about these rumors about me after festival (which is tomorrow).”  Then at the band parents meeting Mr. parker told all the band parents to stop spreading rumors about him.  I was thinking well maybe he should tell mr. gossett that cause mr. g is the one telling the band parents!!!!!!  Probably cause he can’t wait to see mr. p leave so he can be head dirctor!!!!!!!!  HE’s so power hungry. and he’s always yelling at us and he’s so impaient.  next year is going to suck so bad!!!!!  His motto is, “i’m always right and you’re always wrong.”  GRRRRRRRR>

Then the other day a kid asked went up to mr. parker and asked him if he was leaving.  he said, “i’ll talk about these rumors about me after festival (which is tomorrow).”  Then at the band parents meeting Mr. parker told all the band parents to stop spreading rumors about him.  I was thinking well maybe he should tell mr. gossett that cause mr. g is the one telling the band parents!!!!!!  Probably cause he can’t wait to see mr. p leave so he can be head dirctor!!!!!!!!  HE’s so power hungry. and he’s always yelling at us and he’s so impaient.  next year is going to suck so bad!!!!!  His motto is, “i’m always right and you’re always wrong.”  GRRRRRRRR>

I am so out of it.  The band went to festival today.  That’s where we play for judges and they rate us on how good we are.  1 being the best and we got all 1’s on our pieces yay.  But I’m just not happy.  That was most likely the last festival I’m ever going to have with Mr. Parker.  I think he’s gonna talk to us about him leaving Monday.  I’m not sure but that’s my guess.  Today just made me really tired.  I feel like i’ve got weights on my arms or something.  Ann Maree and SAm are going to the movies and Ann Marie wants me and Travis to go with them.  So, as soon as Travis gets online i’m supposed to ask him if he wants to go.  He probably won’t want to go, though.  He’s just like that.  Never wants to do anything.  Oh well.  If he doesn’t want to go I’ll just stay home and sleep.. and cry.  I just feel like crying for some reason.  Well, I gotta go. Bye.

Well, I’m not exactly sure where to start… this has been one of the worst weeks of my life.  You know Murphy’s law.. “Anything that can go wrong, WILL go wrong.” Well, that was proved true this week.  Well Monday I got to english class and I asked Travis (my best friend/crush) if he wanted to go to the movies with me and sam and ann marie.  He said he couldn’t cause he liked some girl and it would be weird if he went out with me.  I told him that i wasn’t askin him cause I “liked” him (lie, i know).  He said he knew but it would still be weird.  I thought the girl he liked was Chrystal.. some 8th grader (me and him are juniors) but it turned out to be some sophomore.  I’ll get back to this in a minute.  OKay.. then later that day I went to band class.. and I just knew MR. Parker was going to tell us he was leavin. He looked so nervous.. and MR. Gossett was smiling his head off.  I wanted to punch mr. g in the face.  So, they told us to just sit down and not get our instruments out.  They gave us some announcements.. then Mr. Parker sat down and I knew it was it.  I felt so nervous and so sad.  He said, “I have something to read to you all because I didn’t think I could say something like this just off the top of my head.”  So, his speech started out with something saying he knew there were rumors going around.. then he went into stuff about all the memories he’d had.  Then he said, “I will NOT be returning to the high school next year.”  A lot of people were crying by this point.. He was even talkin and his voice was shakin and he kept having to stop to compose himself.  By the end of the speech he was crying.  Then he called the leadership team up to the office.  He was just telling us his reasons.. cause he has a family and he misses his kids.  I was cryin and he was too and he’s like, “i’m so sorry.. i”m just lookin at mallory (me) and i feel so sorry.”  So, the next day i wrote him a letter and downloaded a song for him.
Tuesday, I came home and got online and Travis annoucned he was going out with that girl.  She’s butt ugly and she thinks she knows everything.  And her teeth are so freakin crooked.  Her name is Amy.  I just don’t understand.  Me and him have so much in common.. we laugh and talk all the time.. and i’m not even as ugly as she is!! what is he thinking??  SO, i lost my prom date.  Travis was supposed to be it.. Amy’s parents won’t let her go and travis can’t go cause it’ll make her mad.  Ann Marie told Kyle he should ask me.. He said he’d think about it.  He had already asked a lot of other people.. including LIndsay (the other field commander).  Then last night he said he didn’t want to go with me cause it would be uncomfortable.  It wouldn’t have hurt as bad if he hadn’t of asked LIndsay and not me.  At least it’s official now.. I”m the ugly field commander who can’t get the guys.  And speaking of field commander… tryouts start in 2 weeks. Damn lindsay’s tryin out again and no one wants her to cause she sucks.. then my friend jessica suddenly gets the urge which means more competition.  This year it’s just mr. gossett judging and no mr. parker and mr. g LOVES lindsay more than me so she’ll probably get it just cause he likes her.  WEll, i’d better go. bye

Well, today was an okay day.  It was a better start than it was last week.  Last week was a week from hell.  It still kills me that I have to sit back and watch my best friend love someone else.  Me and Travis and Michael (his best friend besides me) and Melanie used to all stand outside the bandroom door and talk everyday before fourth block.  Now, Travis just walks with me until we find Michael then they both go back in the other direction to see Travis’s girlfriend.. then I stand in front of the bandroom door to wait for Melanie.  Me and Melanie were talking today how much we miss how it used to be.  🙁  So, we still stand out there cause we’re afraid of letting go.  Lol.  I”m a sad pathetic loser.  But oh well!!  
After school I was waiting outside and I saw Travis standing by his girlfriend.  She wasn’t talking to him.. she was talking to her friends.  He looked bored then he started looking around and he saw me and we both just stared at each other for a second… then he waved and i waved back.. wishing i was that girl beside him. :'(  This sucks so bad!!!!!  I mean, i know I’m prettier than her.. I know I’m nicer than her.. I’m definetly taller and skinnier.  I’ve known him longer and we have so much in common!!  I’ve known him for a year and a half and she’s known him for 2 months.  He said I was his best friend… so I just don’t understand!!!  My friend Jennifer said, “well sometimes it’s just really weird to date your best friend.” well crap i don’t care.  grrrrrr the beans!!!  Well, i gotta go.  buh bye!!!

My biggest fear about them is becoming dependent on them and if i stop using them i’ll just gain weight.  OH, well.  I wish I had something to talk about.  I don’t really.  Yesterday we had a drumline performance for the community.  It was fun.  Travis came.  So did lance.  I was talkin to Travis afterwards.. then i said i needed to go talk to Lance and he was like, “of course…”  he’s never liked lance.. just cause he thinks i like him.  He’s a strange boy.  Oh well.

Melanie wants me to write in my diary so I will.  I have nothing to do anyway.  Well, let’s see.. i don’t feel like writing about Travis cause that will spoil my good mood.  I’m going to Melanie’s house tomorrow!! YAY!!!!  Today was an okay day.  I thought it was going to be bad.  I just woke up with this strange feeling like today was going to suck.  Travis did kinda make me mad.. well he was mad about something and he finally told me but he said he didn’t tell me right away because he thought I wouldn’t care.  Okay i know I said I wouldn’t write about Travis but I guess I lied.  He said his girlfriend was mad at him because he gave away three pieces of her candy.  That frickin pisses me off.  If you have someone as awesome as TRavis then you shouldn’t get pissed over stupid shit. GRRRRR!!!!  Okay moving on…
I smashed my knuckles on a gong today.  I went to hit it with a mallet and my hand somehow got between the mallet and the gong and my knuckles were smashed and cut open and bleeding slightly.  (but that’s not my problem right melanie?);)
I wanna make this a happy entry. YAY for cool people like me!! lol JK. Yay for losers like me!! 😀  I’m crazy.  I’m high on diet pepsi.  Oh, for those of you who don’t know, I’ve lost 23 pounds. YAY.

I’m not even sure where to begin.  Everything has just pissed me off.  The fact that Lindsay is the “pretty” field commander.  She always has guys around her and I can’t even get my best friend to look at me that way.  GRR.  Mr. Gossett likes Lindsay and i know he hates me.  We started field commander training for next year.  I think it’s between me, lindsay, and melanie.  I think he might pick two.. i hope it’s me and melanie.. but he might pick lindsay just because she flirts with him all the time.  😐  I really wish Mr. Parker wasn’t leaving next year because he likes me more than lindsay.. but i don’t rub it in everyone’s faces.  The one of the director’s that actually likes me is leaving.  It really bothers me.  Then there’s another thing bothering me.  I”m trying to lose weight and i’ve lost about 25 pounds.  But i’ve gotten to the point where i’m like stuck at like 137-135.. and i can’t get any lower.  I’m so upset.  I’m so freakin fat i hate myself sometimes.  I wasn’t going to eat today.  I came home and my dad was like, “you didn’t eat supper…”  i go, “yeah i know.” he goes, “eat..i don’t want you to be anoerxic.”  so i had to eat one of those lean cuisine meals that’s only 270 calories.  Then i was exersizing on my exersize bike and i got done … then i stood up and i couldn’t really hold myself up very well so i just like fell in the floor and didn’t get up til i caught my breath.  I finally got up but it’s like every time i stand up it takes a lot out of me… it’s like i start to black out.. but don’t.  ARGG.  Well, I’m going to go.  Buh bye

I had a dream that I was yelling and nobody cared.  My cousin and my aunt that died a few years ago and my mom were sitting on a bed and talking and I was screaming that I hated everyone and nobody would listen to me.  I was throwing stuff and they still ignored me.  Then I dreamt that I kept looking in the mirror and I looked SOOOOOOOOO fat. It was awful.  I felt so horrible.  I felt so ugly.  Then I woke up and I looked fine and I was so relieved.  Shew.  That was scary.  Well, I’m going to go.  buh bye peoples.

I feel irritated right now. I’m tired of Travis playing his stupid games.  He doesn’t talk to me anymore.  Well, he does.. but not as much.  He talks to me a lot in real life but not online.  I kept asking him questions about how he was.  then he’d just give me one word answers and not ask me how i was.  So i go, “well, i’m going great in case you actually care.”  he’s like, “i do care…” grrrrr. bullshit.  
What else to rant about?  um.  OH.  I hate how people keep saying, “yeah the band’s going to be so much better next year with Mr. Gossett..” WEll, ya know what… Mr. Parker has done more and cares more about us.  I’m sorry but I like Mr. Parker way better.  When Mr. Parker annouced he was leaving everyone was sad.. now they’re like, “yeah we’re going to be better..” i mean, i’m not trying to dwell on it.. When marching season comes i’m not going to let it get me down, but people are acting like they don’t really care about him anymore. 🙁  
ANOTHER THING!!!!!! I LOVE FREAKIN TALKING TO MYSELF!!!!!!!!!!!! :'(  Someone just shoot me.  I’m tired of all this shit.  I miss the way things used to be.  Travis used to care about me.  He used to say hi to me first online, he used to hate to see me leave.  He used to hug me all the time.  He used to talk to me as much as he could.  What did i do wrong??  Why am I so screwed up?  I always manage to drive people away. I must’ve done something… cause i always do.  I’M SO SCREWED UP.  I don’t even know why i have friends in the first place.. I don’t deserve them.  And why am I field commander?? I”m a horrible leader!!  Everyone loves Lindsay.  WEll the guys do cause i’m so fat and ugly.  MR. Gossett loves her because i can’t string two words together when i’m around him.  What kind of leader is that? grrrrr grrrrrrrr grrrrrrrrrr.  
I really miss Travis.  I want things to be the way they were before.  He says i’m still his best friend but just doesn’t act the way he did.  well i need to go.  buh bye

Well, today was um.. a day.  lol.  I went to the Mexican Resturant with Kyle and Ann Marie.  I LOVE taco salads!! Whoo!  Then we went to the dollar store and we saw flip flops but didn’t like them very much and decided to go to wal-mart to find better ones. I bought some red ones like my friend Melanie’s and Ann Marie bought some blue ones.  We went around the store and played with all the bouncy balls and all the cool toys.  It was like we were little kids!! Whoo!  
I got online at about 8 and my friend Michael ims me first thing.  He’s like, “Travis is here!!” i’m like, “hi travis!!!!” but then you can tell when they are together because they start bashing me.. well it was like they tried but i started bashing them back because i didn’t feel like taking it and they just sorta stopped.  But then they told me that Brad, andrew, and Erika were there too!  Erika?? That kinda makes me feel really left out… I mean i always thought I was becoming part of the group.  Oh well.  Guess not.  It doesn’t matter to me anymore I’m just tired of it all.  I am making this more of a big deal than it is.  It really doesn’t bother me that much.

Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings. Watch it count down to the end of the day the clock ticks life away, it’s so unreal.  didn’t look out below watch the time go right out the window.  tried to hold on, didn’t even know, i wasted it all just to watch you go.  I kept every thing inside and even though i tried it all fell apart. what it meant to me will eventually be a memory of the time i tried so hard and go so far. but in the end it doesn’t even matter.  I had to fall to lose it all but in the end it doesn’t even matter.  one thing, I don’t know why, it doesn’t even matter how hard you try.  keep that in mind i designed this ryhme to remind myself how i tried so hard, inspite of the way you were mocking me, acting like i was part of your property, remembering all the times you fought with me, i’m surprised it got so far.  Things aren’t the way they were before.  You wouldn’t even recognize me anymore.  Not that you knew me back then but it all comes back to me in the end.
What is going on in the world that affects you the most? Why? >< i dunno. the war.  i know someone in the marines

It was like we were little kids!! Whoo!  
I got online at about 8 and my friend Michael ims me first thing.  He’s like, “Travis is here!!” i’m like, “hi travis!!!!” but then you can tell when they are together because they start bashing me.. well it was like they tried but i started bashing them back because i didn’t feel like taking it and they just sorta stopped.  But then they told me that Brad, andrew, and Erika were there too!  Erika?? That kinda makes me feel really left out… I mean i always thought I was becoming part of the group.  Oh well.  Guess not.  It doesn’t matter to me anymore I’m just tired of it all.  I am making this more of a big deal than it is.  It really doesn’t bother me that much.  Just something to write about. 😛  Well, I”m gonna go.  Buh bye.

Watch it count down to the end of the day the clock ticks life away, it’s so unreal.  didn’t look out below watch the time go right out the window.  tried to hold on, didn’t even know, i wasted it all just to watch you go.  I kept every thing inside and even though i tried it all fell apart. what it meant to me will eventually be a memory of the time i tried so hard and go so far. but in the end it doesn’t even matter.  I had to fall to lose it all but in the end it doesn’t even matter.  one thing, I don’t know why, it doesn’t even matter how hard you try.  keep that in mind i designed this ryhme to remind myself how i tried so hard, inspite of the way you were mocking me, acting like i was part of your property, remembering all the times you fought with me, i’m surprised it got so far.  Things aren’t the way they were before.  You wouldn’t even recognize me anymore.  Not that you knew me back then but it all comes back to me in the end.

I was just sitting here reading some people’s diaries and a thought just hit me.  How do these people fall in love so easily?  It drives me nuts.  I don’t know why.  And then some people are like 14 years old having sex.  I think well what else is there to do after you have sex with that person?  That’s like giving yourself away too early and then what are you going to do after that… if you’ve done something big like that already wouldn’t everything else seem boring?  Ug.  Don’t listen to me.  I am totally against love right now.  I simply don’t believe in it and find it a waste of time.  I’m sorry.  I shouldn’t just bash people who don’t have the same views as me.. people who believe in something I don’t.  Oh well.  gotta go.  that was my deep thought for the day.  buh bye.

Haha.  I just took a sip of my coke and choked on it. Tee hee.  I couldn’t think if a good title so I chose chokin on coke cause i’m a clumsy freak that can’t even swallow coke.  Just kiddin. 😀  Lala.  I’m bored. I stayed up til 2:30 talking to Melanie last night online.  I’m dead now.  I woke up at 1:30pm.  I felt like someone had beat me with a stick.  I’m starting to get a headache. Oh well.  I’ll be okay.  But now I weight 128!!!!!!  YAY!!!!!!  Yay for me!!!  I’m happy.  😀  That’s the lowest I’ve ever weighed since 6th grade.  In 8th grade i got down to like 135… then over the summer I ate everything in site and gained it all back and more so I was fat again when I came back to school as a freshman.  And I have remained fat since.. so much that I got up to a freakin 160.  So exactly two months ago I weighed 160… now it’s 128.  That’s freakin awesome!! AAAAAAAA I”m proud of myself.  I wanna weigh 115 though. Then I’ll stop.. but still not eat everything in site ya know???  WEll i’m gonna go.  buh bye

212,https://www.opendiary.com/m/mnmchick2004/haha-this-is-funny-2-3041617/,2003-04-11,Haha.  This is funny.,"
Are you tired of all those sissy, mushy “friendship” poems that always sound good but never actually come close to reality? Well, here is a series of promises that really speaks to true friendship!
1. When you are sad, …I will get you drunk (or gorge on chocolate) and help you plot revenge against the sorry bastard who made you sad.
2. When you are blue, …I’ll try to dislodge whatever is choking you.
3. When you smile, …I’ll know you finally got laid.
4. When you are scared, …I will rag you about it every chance I get.
5. When you are worried, …I will tell you horrible stories about how much worse it could be and to quit whining.
6. When you are confused, …I will use little words to explain.
7. When you are sick, …stay away from me until you’re well again. I don’t want whatever you have.
8. When you fall, …I will point and laugh at your clumsy ass. (and take pictures…ACEITUNO!)
This is my oath, …I pledge ’til the end. Why you may ask? Because you’re my friend!
Send this to ten of your closest friends and get depressed because you can only think of two, and one of them is not speaking to you right now anyway.
Remember: A friend will help you move. A really good friend will help you move a body.
Let me know if I ever need to bring a shovel.

4. When you are scared, …I will rag you about it every chance I get.
5. When you are worried, …I will tell you horrible stories about how much worse it could be and to quit whining.
6. When you are confused, …I will use little words to explain.
7. When you are sick, …stay away from me until you’re well again. I don’t want whatever you have.
8. When you fall, …I will point and laugh at your clumsy ass. (and take pictures…ACEITUNO!)
This is my oath, …I pledge ’til the end. Why you may ask? Because you’re my friend!
Send this to ten of your closest friends and get depressed because you can only think of two, and one of them is not speaking to you right now anyway.
Remember: A friend will help you move. A really good friend will help you move a body.
Let me know if I ever need to bring a shovel.

Dang.  I ate too much today.  Fist I had a lean pocket.. then a hot dog.. then three freakin m&m chocolate chip cookies!!!!!!!!  I’m eatin the third one right now. GRRRRRRRRR.  I shouldn’t have done that.  But I’ve been craving chocolate for so longggggg.  AAAAAAAAAHHHHHH.  Well, at least I’m down to 128.  I tried on a shirt today that I used to wear in third grade.  The size was youth large..and it actually fit.  I was like WOW.  Tee hee.  I can’t wait til I weigh 115. Whoo hoo.  Well, I gotta go.  buh bye.

I did this at a site.  I had to insert names and adjectives and nouns and stuff.
Love Story 
One perfect summer day at the beach you see the most skinny creature you have ever seen. Their name is Travis , and every move he makes just turns you on more and more. You nudge your best friend Melanie and say, “Wow, that has to be the most pretty body I have ever seen.” Suddenly, he looks in your direction and starts walking right towards you!!! he says, “I noticed you staring at me from over there. I just had to tell you, that I think you are so pink , and was wondering if you’d like to go to Florida with me and march ?” With a stupid smile on your face you say, ” YAY ” and go with them. When you finally get to Florida , he moves closer to you, and gives you the biggest kiss ever. The two of you are passionately kissing, when you feel a boy hit you on the back of the head. You open your eyes to find out it’s all a dream, but there is a note left next to your bed.
It reads: ” Travis is the love you’ve been waiting your whole life for. he will ask you out in 1 days or less, but only if you send this site to at least 10 people within the next few minutes. The more people you send it to, the sooner they will ask you out, and you both fall in love. Do not take this lightly, because if you simply ignore this, you will have bad luck in love for the next 1 years!”

Okay, I had a dream the other night that was so freaky… I dunno.. it just swtiched around so much and had lots of things that didn’t make sense.  So, I will tell ya about it.
Okay, I think it starts… we were on a drumline trip.  We were on the bus.  I remember I was sitting with someone.. I don’t remember who.. but our seat was next to a seat with three guys in it. Chris, Adam F. and Jimmy.  Adam F. was sitting in Jimmy’s lap.  Then I remember someone was sitting behind them.. and someone was whispering the word,”sex” over and over and Adam F. was getting mad because he knew they were making fun of him for having sex w/ Jennifer all the time.  Later on, we got off the bus and it was dark.  We were all going to play minature golf.  For some reason.. Me and Melanie were wearing dresses… prom dresses.  I was saying, “Maybe we should just put these up…” but Melanie kept saying, “no.. then we’ll have to fold them up and they’ll get wrinkled..” so we played golf in them.  Then for some reason a bunch of us were in a forest.. and my brother and someone else was chasing me.  I had a teddy bear in my hands.  I got caught up in some net.  They were trying to take my teddy bear.. but I wouldn’t let them.. so I ran off and I found a car and in the car I used a cell phone and called the police.. Then some of us were talking later on and they were saying, “yeah they were just joking around.. I can’t believe Mallory called the police.”  Then next thing I knew.. I was supposed to save the world from some mean girl.  Nick Carter from the backstrett boys was supposed to help me.  The girl challanged us to a four wheeler race.  We got to the race late and they started without us.  I told nick to just say go ahead and do it but he said he was giving up and I told him not to.. but he did anyway.  We were both sitting there watching the race.. and I said something like, “and I wanted to do so much more..” and he said, “me too..” and he meant he had wanted to kiss me or something.  Then we were back on the bus and we were on our way back home.  Clay called me back to sit with him.  He asked me out and I said yes.  Then when we got off the bus we were walking together, but then Adam M. came up and started talking to Clay and he ignored me. He ignored me for the next 2 days.  Then for some reason we were in a gym and Tony asked me out and I said yes even though I couldn’t remember if he was still going out with Kati or not.. Then we broke up.  Next thing I knew I was in the bandroom again, telling people I missed Clay.  Then Adam M. came up to me and said, “Clay wants to know if you’re still going out w/ him.”  I said I thought he didn’t like me anymore.  Clay started to explain.. but then I woke up. 🙁 oh well. lol.  confusing, huh?

I was watching TRL for the first time in years last night and this song came on.. I only heard a few of the lyrics but I liked it.. so I downloaded the song.  It’s called “Addicted” by Simple Plan.  It really describes how I feel about Travis.  Mel, you might be able to relate to this too.  The only bad thing is I asked Travis if he knew who the band was that did this song and when he told me he was like, “i know because Amy likes them.” i was like :|. GRRRRRR. OH well.  Here’s the song. Mel, you need to hear it!!
I heard you’re doing okay 
But I want you to know 
I’m a dick 
I’m addicted to you 
I can’t pretend I don’t care 
When you don’t think about me 
Do you think I deserve this? 
I tried to make you happy 
but you left anyway 
I’m trying to forget that 
I’m addicted to you 
But I want it and I need it 
I’m addicted to you 
Now it’s over 
Can’t forget what you said 
And I never wanna do this again

Since the day I met you 
And after all we’ve 
been though 
I’m still a dick

I’d run a thousand miles 
to get you 
Do you think I deserve this? 
I tried to make you happy 
I did all that I could 
Just to keep you 
But you left anyway 
How long will I be waiting? 
Until the end of time 
I don’t know why I’m still waiting 
I can’t make you mine 
Heartbreaker 
I’m addicted to you

I want taburculosis.  Edgar Allen Poe had taburculosis… he was so sick he couldn’t eat anything.  So he lost 30 pounds in 2 months.  Although, that’s about how much I lost in 2 moths.  They said it wasn’t healthy for him to do that.  Although he couldn’t help it.  He just couldn’t eat because he was so sick.  But if you just COULDN’T eat.. then it wouldn’t be so hard to lose that weight.  Because I’ve been sick enough that i could NOT eat.  Sharp pains in my stomache.. it was awful.. but just think if you had that for two months.  Yikes.  We learned this stuff in english class. My teacher was standing there saying how Poe lost 30 pounds in 2 months and how unhealthy he must of been because of it.. and I was sitting there thinking.. jeez.. that’s how much I lost.. hits a little too close to home, ya know?  Am I unhealthy then?  Oh well.
I haven’t eaten anything yet, today.  I don’t want to.  But I probably will.  grrrrr.  I still weigh 127.  I want to weigh 115 or 110.  yay.  I told my dad how much a weigh now… he goes, “no Schmidt has weighed 127 in years..” he meant the whole family is basically overweight.. well, I’m not anymore.  I’ve always been the skinniest one at our little Christmas get together.  Now, I’ll be EXTREMLY skinny. Lol.  
About the prom.. I don’t think Leroy wants to go with me.  He just doesn’t like he wants to.  He hasn’t said no, but he hasn’t talked to me or anything.. and today Kati was like, “Leroy, talk to her..” and he like yelled at her and told her to go away.  🙁  If he says no, I’m definitely not going.  This is the last straw.. If i don’t go, maybe me and Melanie can do something that night… a small pity party maybe? hmm. well gotta go.  buh bye

Anyway, I want to ask either Clay or Edric to the prom.  But Edric is more likely to say yes, than Clay.  I talk to Edric more, anyway.  But Clay is so freakin hot.  Shew.  Hahhaha.  Anyway.

Okay, let’s see. Today I had a presentation that I was dreading so bad.  I’m sooooooo glad it’s over.  I had nightmares last night I was so worried.  Usually it doesn’t bother me that bad.  But there is this stupid kid in my group who everyone makes fun of and I just knew the kid was going to embarrass me somehow.  Well, he did but not as bad as I thought.  He just talked for a LONG time. Like 20 minutes.  I was like 😐 And the kid can’t read very well which made it 5 times worse.  He kept saying, “how do you pronouce this?” and i would tell him and he would still say it wrong.  Oh well.  It wasn’t as bad as I thought.  AFterwards people were like that was so long and boring and the kid turned to me and goes, “mallory, i’m sorry it was so long…” and then he put his head down.  I felt bad for him.  
Okay, what else? Oh, I walked into earth and space science today and my friend Adam M. said, “I heard you’re going to the prom w/ Edric!!”  i was like, “um no.. i might ask him..” he goes, “That’s awesome.  Ed so awesome.  I’ll tell him to ask you if you want..”  I was like “sure!!”  then adam goes, “I can’t wait! He’s gonna be happy.  He’s never had a girlfriend or a date and he’s never asked anyone out before!!”  I was like, “well i don’t like him like that” he goes, “i know but still this is awesome!!”  Lol.  I love Adam.  He cracks me up.  Adam was going to talk to edric today but edric wasn’t there.  he went to a pearl jam concert last night so he just didn’t come to school. Darn it.  😛  Well, I’d better go.

Blah. Okay, first I came in today and my friend, Tiffany H. asked me what my prom dress looked like. I explained it to her and she’s like, “Crap… I think we have the same dress.” 😐 grrr. Okay, it wouldn’t bother me but we’re both going w/ the same group of people, and she’s prettier and skinnier than me, so more than likely she’ll look better in the dress. Later I went into earth and space science and I was talking to my friend Adam again. I told him and Lindsay that me and Tiff had the same dress. They thought it was hilarious. Adam was saying that he really wanted me to go w/ edric again. Lindsay was like, “are you going to go even if you do get to go w/ edric?” I was like, “I dunno..” she goes, “you’d better.” I was like, “well, let’s see, I’m going w/ 14 other people who all have dates except me… wouldn’t you feel kind of weird?” Then Adam goes, “well, if you can’t go w/ edric you should go w/ me!!!” i was like, “um you’re going w/ Tiffany…” he goes, “yeah.. but if you went w/ me… I would have TWO dates!! And that would be awesome!!!” I thought it was funny.  Anyway, I went to band later on that day and Edric was walking out of the room but Ann Marie stopped him and was like, “do you have a date to prom?” he’s like, “no.” she goes, “go w/ Mallory..” I’m standin right beside her and he goes, “NO, I DON’T WANT TO GO TO PROM!! I’M SORRY BUT I JUST DON’T WANT TO…” He’s like yelling this for everyone to hear.. geez. Basically making sure everyone knew I just got blown off. That was so freakin embarrassing. I don’t think that many people heard it. I know ann marie did and Kyle might have.. but geez. I don’t want to go. I REALLY don’t. It’s not the fact I don’t have a date, it’s the fact I’m going w/ 14 people who all do. Is that not embarrassing? People are like, “If I were you, would go anyway.” I”m like, “Well, you’re not me…and actually no, you wouldn’t, if you were put in my position..” grrrrrrr. Tis stupid!!!!!!!

Okay, to review… my friend Tiffany was going w/ my friend Adam… but Adam’s friend Jon didn’t want adam to go w/ tiffany because he doesn’t like her. So, last night Adam told Tiffany he couldn’t go to the prom w/ her cause Jon was mad. Earlier that day he had hinted to go w/ me. Okay, so today me, Kyle, and Ann Marie were talking and Ann Marie was like, “so is Adam going anyway?” Kyle was like, “he’d better not…” i was like ahhhhhhhhhh. Then I went to earth and space science. Me and Adam and Lindsay were talking about prom. Adam goes, “mallory, have you found a date yet?” i go, “nope.” he goes, “well, i don’t have one either… so we both don’t have dates….” i was like, “yeah.. this is true. ” then the subject was changed. but then the subject went back to prom and I was like, “I’m going to feel weird w/ 12 people who all have dates and then there’s me..” Adam goes, “you should go w/ me!!” i was like, “umm… i dunno..” he was like, “yeah.. but I have to check w/ Jon first to see of that is okay” he said it kinda like he was pissed. I would be too if someone was trying to run my life. I was like, “yeah i have to talk to tiffany about it cause she’s gonna kill me.” he goes, “okay.” So, I get to band class and ann maire’s like, “so, are you going w/ adam?” i was like, “well, he asked me…” she started telling me how i should be careful because he kinda dumped tiffany and he was being a jerk and reminded me of how tiffany might be hurt. I was like ahhhhhh stop!!!!! But it’s so freakin weird. Nobody understands how I feel. I’ve been a fat ugly loser all my life. and i’ve never had a date..grrrrrrrrrrrr. I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to hurt tiffany. okay, if she gets mad I won’t go w/ him. 🙁

Okay, to review… my friend Tiffany was going w/ my friend Adam… but Adam’s friend Jon didn’t want adam to go w/ tiffany because he doesn’t like her. So, last night Adam told Tiffany he couldn’t go to the prom w/ her cause Jon was mad. Earlier that day he had hinted to go w/ me. Okay, so today me, Kyle, and Ann Marie were talking and Ann Marie was like, “so is Adam going anyway?” Kyle was like, “he’d better not…” i was like ahhhhhhhhhh. Then I went to earth and space science. Me and Adam and Lindsay were talking about prom. Adam goes, “mallory, have you found a date yet?” i go, “nope.” he goes, “well, i don’t have one either… so we both don’t have dates….” i was like, “yeah.. this is true. ” then the subject was changed. but then the subject went back to prom and I was like, “I’m going to feel weird w/ 12 people who all have dates and then there’s me..” Adam goes, “you should go w/ me!!” i was like, “umm… i dunno..” he was like, “yeah.. but I have to check w/ Jon first to see of that is okay” he said it kinda like he was pissed.

Well, prom was yesterday. I’m really glad I went. Actually the prom itself was pretty darn boring.. but everything else was really fun, ironically enough. I had the most fun just hanging out w/ Adam. 🙂 He was sooooooooooo sweet. No guy has ever treated me as nice as him. I thought the most awkward thing was going to be riding in the car w/ him. But that was the best part!!! He was constantly asking if I was too cold or too hot… as soon as I got in the car he had the air conditioner on and he’s like, “oh crap! you’ve got to be cold in that dress!!” :):):):):) We had our pics made. That was awkward cause the guy made us hold hands. We were both laughing through the whole thing. Then we went to Rough River Lodge and we were there like 30 minutes early so we just cruised for a while… then we got there and all of our friends were there and Adam drove by them like he was just gonna leave. He drove around the parking lot for like 5 minutes cause we were all there early and he thought it was pretty pointless to get there so early. Then he parked like REALLY far away cause he thought it was funny. A few people parents were there and they kept taking all these pictures. It was driving me insane. AHHH. lol. We never played put put golf cause they were closed. Some of us played in the game room for a while.. then we left to go to the prom. Me and Adam like, talked the whole way there. He asked me about how I went out w/ adam flener. I told him I was hoping everyone had forgot about that. he asked why and i said because he’s gross and really ugly. lol. he said well we all make mistakes. He also kept asking if I liked anybody. At the time I just said no. Then we got to the prom and that was extemely boring!!!!!!! ahhhhhhhhh. okay, i don’t dance infront of people, that’s just not the kind of person I am and I can’t help it. And people are like you should dance. and they would ask me what was wrong and i was like, “NOTHING!! i just don’t dance. there’s nothing wrong w/ that.” Adam is the exact same way. So, we got really bored and left at 11:00. We went and picked up our proofs for our pics. Then we just drove around for another hour and talked. He said it was really boring but it had nothing to do w/ me. he said he just hates dances and he hates the setting of places like that. He said he doesn’t dance and you can’t even have a conversation w/ someone at places like that. I told him I was the exact same way. He kept askin if he had ruined my night and apologizing for being a jerk. He said he was just glad to finally get away from there and be w/ me just talking. He said he was glad he went w/ me instead of Tiffany because Tiffany wouldn’t have been as understanding of the fact he didn’t like the whole prom thing. Then he took me to where he wrecked his bike and hurt his wrist. We even got out of the car and he showed me the tire tracks and explained how it happened. We talked about how lindsay and nick were all over each other and then that got to the subject of how he thought lindsay sucked as a field commander and how much better i was than her. :):) HE said it made him sick how mr. gossett favors her over me. Then he asked me again if I liked anybody and I finally told him about Travis. Finally he was driving me home and we accidently passed my house… so he went to mr. parker’s house and parked in the driveway and just sat there for a minute. i was like, “he’s gonna come out here!!” he was like, “and we can say hi!!” lol. but finally we got to my house. and he was like, “are you sure you had a good time because you can tell me the truth.” he kept tellin me he felt like a jerk and all this stuff. I told him not to worry about it and i had a good time. then I had to get out of the car :(:( darnit. lol. OH well. I actually had an awesome time just being w/ him cause he was soooooo sweet. 😀

Hi. Well, let’s see. I made field commander again. yay. um… what else is new? Oh, well, the last entry I spent tellin how sweet Adam was… well, yes he’s sweet when you’re alone with him. At school he’s just… i dunno.. a different person. I can’t even talk to him now. All he says is stupid stuff that I used to think was funny, but now that I’ve seen the other side I just wish he would shut up. During earth and space science today I wanted to punch him in the face just cause he was being so fake for everyone. He even asked me Saturday, “do you think I act like an ass at school?” I said no because I hadn’t really thought about it.. but he kept saying yah i think i’m an ass and a jerk at school. GR. If you know then why don’t you change it? He also said he doesn’t really like his friends and thinks he should just drop them, but then he said that would take guts and he doesn’t have it. I’m so upset. Actually, I shouldn’t be. I should just get over it because I already knew that saturday night was too good to be true and I just knew he was going to act like an ass as soon as we got back to school monday. He was probably just being nice because he had to. 🙁 I hate my life. I wanna die right now.

Ya know, I should be happy. I just made field commander again, but there is something wrong.  I dunno. I just want this year to end, ya know? I got lectured again today. Well, last night Kati lectured me on how I was losing weight. But then today I was talking to Ann Marie, Lindsay, and Carrie. I was joking around and commenting on how my pants were falling off. Carrie goes, “cause you’re losing too much weight.” Then ann maire was like, “yeah i’m worried about that..” carrie goes, “i heard you weigh 124 now.” i was like yeah. she goes, “that’s not fair you suck.” then ann marie was like, “how many calories do you eat a day?” i tried to change the subject but she wouldn’t allow it. so i told her 400. Carrie was like, “okay.. you need to stop now because 124 is awesome and you don’t need to weigh any less.” Lindsay and Ann Marie was both like, “yeah you do..” I was like, “I still look really fat..” but they were like, “no you don’t!!!” all this crap. then we were leaving and ann marie was like, “Mallory, I’m really worried about you…” i’m like, “don’t be.. it’s not worth wasting your time..” she’s like, “yes it is..” but i said i would be okay. I wish everyone would stop saying I need to stop. Okay, do they realize people used to always call me ugly and fat all the time. I still can’t get a guy… so i wish everyone would shut up. They don’t know how I feel. Here were three girls who are really pretty and who could get guys telling me to stop losing weight.. well ya know, they don’t know what it’s like to not be able to get anyone so i feel they don’t have the right to tell me what to do. Ann Marie started lecturing me the other day about counting calories. It really ticked me off because she’s been extremely skinny all her life and was telling me i’m doing something bad. Well, she has NO idea how I feel because she gets hot guys all the time. It just ticks me off how all these people don’t even know how i feel and what i’ve been through and they tell me to stop.. well that makes me not want to even more.

Hey.  I was waiting for Melanie to get online cause I need somebody to talk to because she’s the only one who really understands me.  I was gonna talk to her before I wrote in my diary so I wouldn’t sound so depressed.  But it’s almost 10:00 and I can’t wait much longer.  There is something wrong with me.  I been feeling so down lately.. and no matter what I do.. there still seems to be something wrong.  I just wish I could hug someone right now and never let go.  I feel so alone and scared.  I think I’m feeling this way because I’m not eating.  The fact that it’s making me this way is starting to scare me.. because it’s not that I’m just depressed.. I’m actally trying to make myself feel better and trying to think happy thoughts.. but I still feel so horrible.  I don’t know what to do.  I want to cry but I’m scared to.  I just want somebody to talk to right now.  I need someone that understands.  I believe I’m crossing the line in my eating disorder and it’s really scaring me.  But I can’t stop now.  It’s too late to go back because I getting to where i can tell people my weight and not be ashamed.. I’ve gotten to where I weigh less than almost all of my friends.  I weighed 160 and I am now down to 123.  I can’t stop.  But it’s really starting to affect me.  All I’m getting now is concerned looks and lectures and people telling me to stop.  I can’t and I won’t.  But then again how can I stop feeling so down?  I need help.  I’m dead serious.  I need someone.. anyone that cares.. anyone that understands.  Nobody is online anymore that I can talk to, to keep my mind off this.  ahhhhh Melanie, please get online. PLEASE. 🙁

Well, I was so freakin depressed last week but everything is working out now.  I thought Adam was mad at me or something cause he wasn’t talking to me much.  So, I talked to him about it.  So, today he talked to me all through second block.  It was great.  Yay.  Well, Travis told me he might still like Chrystal since he broke up with Amy, but it doesn’t bother me.  I might still like him a little bit, but when he went out with Amy, that sorta helped me get over him a little.  And I know that if he does hook up with Crystal there is no way it can last because she is so much younger than him.  Plus, over the summer I’m going to lose a whole lot more weight and get tan and everything then come back and surprise everyone.  So, maybe one day, since I am Travis’s best “girl” friend he’ll wake up and see what he has.  When he told me about Chrystal I even tried to give him advice to help him because I’m such a good friend. 😀  He said he didn’t think she liked him anymore.  I told him that’s because when he went out with Amy she was trying to get over him because she figured she didn’t have a chance anymore, but now that they broke up she’ll start liking him again.  As I was telling him this I realized I was telling him what I went through… only replacing it in the form of Chrystal. lol.  oh well.  He can have her.  Right now I figure I don’t need any guy to be happy.  I just need to finish this year then start thinking about marching band and how I need to change somethings in my life.  I don’t need a guy at the end of the year.  
Oh, one bad thing did happen today!! GRR!! MELANIE I HATE YOU!! JK.  okay, Melanie’s xbf who i hate very much because he is so stupid asked me out today after school.  AHHH he is so annoying!!!! grr melanie!!! JK well i gotta go buh bye

Does nobody see relationships the way I do?  I don’t think anybody does.  All people think about is sex.  They only want to go out with people who are hot so they can screw them every night.  And people talk about how they are only 15 and 16 and are in love.  I am sorry but I don’t believe in that.  They also say they’ve fallen in love w/ their bf/gf within the time span of a few days or a few months.  How is that possible?  I don’t think I can fall in love w/ someone unless I’ve been with them for several months, maybe over a year.  Because who would stay in a relationship that long if they were just in it for the sex?  That’s how you know for sure they like you for who you are.  My friend Tashia claims she’s in love with my friend Lance.  Okay, he obvioulsy does not like her.  He avoids coming to see her.  He makes up excuses and lies.  The only reason she liked him is because he was hot.  If he were ugly and had the same personality I KNOW she would not claim she was in love with him.  It pisses me off.

Today was the last day of school.  Finally summer break has come and it’s time for some changes.  I’m going to lose more weight over the summer.  I now write down how much I eat and how many calories it has and how much I weigh everyday.  It sort of gives me motivation.  I now weigh 120 and I’m hoping to weigh like maybe 105 or 100 by the end of the summer.  Today the assistant principal who used to be my softball coach told me I was gettting to skinny and I needed to eat.  I’m glad people are finally starting to notice I’ve lost weight.  At the band concert the other night I had people’s mothers I knew come up to me and tell me how great I looked now. 🙂  Lydia’s mom complimented me.  Then my friend Allison’s mom told Allison to find out how much weight I had lost because I look so different now. Whoo!  Okay, another thing I’m going to do over the summer is get a tan, cause I’m freakin pale!!  I’m also going to try to get my lisence and my dad really wants me to get a job.  Next year I’m going to be super nice and try to keep my temper from flaring up like it tends to do.  Even if I’m talking to a dumb-ass I’ll try my hardest not to get too pissed.  Another thing… I don’t really cuss that much.  Just when I’m really really angry.  So, I’ll try not to do that and I’ll try not to type words like that out anymore.  I tend to do it a lot while talking to Melanie.  I think because I tell her everything and that sometimes leads to me getting mad about something and cussing about it.  I really need to take anger management classes or something.  No, it’s not that serious but I do get mad more often than most people do.  I don’t know why some things just REALLY get to me.  I think I got my temper from my dad.  Sometimes I get mad and I end up being a little mean and I really don’t mean to.  I like talking to people and making new friends and I hate more than anything to hurt someone’s feelings.  So, here comes a new Mallory. 🙂

Mostly in the last week.  I’m not sure why.  For a while I knew nobody wanted to be with me and I was used to it and it didn’t bother me so much because I knew I had to accept it.  But it’s really getting to me.  *watches clock tick as no one says a thing*  Dum de dum.  Maybe I’ll talk to myself.  Hi, Mallory. Hello.  OH WAIT!  Travis just said something to me!!!!!  Chrystal must be gone or something.  Nope, she’s still there… wonder what the occasion is…  Well, he’s saying something about Harry Potter.  Too bad it can’t be something like, “Mallory, you’ve been my best friend for a while.  I don’t want Chrystal!  I want you!!!!!!  I love you!!”  lol. yeah right.  I crack myself up.  lalalala.  Yay melanie is talking!! HI, MEL.  I LOVE YOU!!! LOL NOT IN A GAY WAY THOUGH.  I’m sooooooo bored.  I haven’t written a long entry in a while so I thought I would.  So, this is just going to be garbage.  OH, Travis has stopped talking again.  I don’t know why he even said anything in the first place.  He doesn’t have to be nice to me if he doesn’t really care about me.  It’s obvious he doesn’t give a shit about me.  Blah.  Okay, that was stupid.  I’m going overboard.  I’m saying stupid stuff cause I’m pissed.  Obviously, if he didn’t care he wouldn’t say anything.  He just doesn’t care the way I want him to.  He never will unless I suddenly became Chrystal.  I wish I was pretty like her.  That would be great.  I wonder what it’s like to be pretty and skinny and get lots of hot guys.

I love summer.  I mean it’s a chance to change.  It’s also a chance to get some sun. 🙂  But let me tell ya, when you’re not in school, there is NOTHING to talk about. Lol.  I guess in school there is the gossip of the day or something.  And you can say, “so and so did this today..” “did you see what so and so did/said?” Lol.  Can’t do that now!! Well, we helped Mr. Parker clean out his office today.  That was fun.  We had taco bell for lunch!! Whoo hoo!!!!  I’m really tired.  I hate getting up early but it was for a good cause. lol.  I wonder if I’ll ever see him again.  I hope so.  I hope I see him at contests or something even though he said he would try to stay in the backgroud.  
Anyway, there is nothing else new.  So, far on my goal to change, i’ve been doing a pretty good job.  I’m losing more weight, getting my teeth whiter, and I’ve been working on my tan.  I just need to get my hair done and get those green contacts.  🙂
I’m sitting here trying to think of what to say. I tried to change my diary colors.. but I dunno.. I’m just not satisfied with them.  I mean they’re okay.  I like them.. but i dunno.  Lol.  Well, I’m going to go for now.  Buh bye.

Anyway, there is nothing else new.  So, far on my goal to change, i’ve been doing a pretty good job.  I’m losing more weight, getting my teeth whiter, and I’ve been working on my tan.  I just need to get my hair done and get those green contacts.  🙂
I’m sitting here trying to think of what to say. I tried to change my diary colors.. but I dunno.. I’m just not satisfied with them.  I mean they’re okay.  I like them.. but i dunno.  Lol.  Well, I’m going to go for now.  Buh bye.

I wish I could just stop eating.  I’m tired of losing weight then gaining it back then having to lose it again and lose more.  I hate eating.  I hate food that tastes good.  I wish I was REALLY skinny.  I wish I was perfect.  From now on no food over 400 calories.  I wanna weigh 100 so bad. 🙁  Grr 17 more pounds to go.  Although I ate so much today I probably weigh 120 again. GRRR.  This is crap.  I hate food. I hate eating!!!!!!  screw calories screw fat!!! ah

I just feel like saying everything I am feeling right now.  First of all… Travis.  I really hate him sometimes.  I was reading some of his old emails and he really did act like he liked me at one point.  Now, he likes Chrystal and there is no room for me.  I’m not needed.  There is no use for me.  I don’t fit any where in this puzzle.  He doesn’t care if I talk to him.  He doesn’t care about anything I do.  Why am I still waiting for him.  There is no chance with him.  He’s with someone he really likes now and I am just standing here waiting for no reason.  I’m wasting my time thinking that he’ll ever want to be with me.  I hate him!!  But then again I don’t!!  How am I supposed to feel? What am I supposed to do?  How can I get over him when I’m supposed to be his best friend??  I have to listen to him tell me how great she is and the things they do together.  I have to help him with his problems w/ her.  How am I supposed to do this?  He only talks to me to tell me his problems and to tell me what he did w/ her.   🙁 Someone help me.  I want to stop liking him.. but part of me doesn’t.  Part of me wants to hate him part of me wants to love him.  I want to scream.  What’s so wrong w/ me??????? Why is it such a bad thing to be w/ me?  I really want to know.

I’m bored.  Nothing to do today but watch the rain.  It’s raining really hard.  But i like it.  Although, I didnt’ get to work on my tan today.  Oh well.  I weigh 116 now!! I”m happy.  It’s awesome.  I want to weigh 105 by band camp.  Then 100 by the time school starts. Lalalala.  After summer I’m stopping all this crap.  It’s really getting to me.  Me and mel had a huge break down last night and I can’t keep doing this and feeling like this.  I”m fine right now but I never want to feel the way I felt last night.  It’s a really horrible feeling and no one should have to deal with it. NO ONE.  Geez.  
Anyway, lalal. lol.  I sat outside today w/ my dog.  She’s not a very social dog.  She’s more of a loner.  She doesn’t like to be petted much.  but she came up and sat right next to me and let me pet her for like ten minutes.  I don’t know where that came from.  It was kinda weird.  I’m so bored I’m talking about my dog. hehehe. OH well.  That sounded so gay.  well i’m going to go.  buh bye.

I was kinda hoping to keep away from people until I lose more weight and dye my hair and get more tan.  I want them to see how much I’ve changed at the end of the summer.  Not that I didn’t want to do somthing fun w/ them.  Oh well.  Blah.  I talked to my mom about getting red in my hair.  She doesn’t think it’ll look good.  But i think it will.  It’s my hair anyway.  I think she’s going to let me do it though.  I’m more stubborn than her and I refused to hear the word no.  😀  hehe.   Anyway.  blah.  I’m so bored.

I don’t want to eat.  I ate 600 calories yesterday and I didn’t gain, but I didn’t lose.  I really thought I was going to weigh 115 today.  I have strict goals and not losing weight today leaves me 5 days to lose 5 pounds.  I want to be 110 by next Wednesday which is when I take my senior pictures.  Then the next band thing is that next Tuesday.  It’s a leadership team meeting and I want to be 108 by then.  If I can 105, but I don’t think I can do that.  If I don’t eat again but it’s too much trouble.  I want to be 105 by band camp.  I want to be 100 by then time school starts.  I just have to do this.  I HAVE to.  I WANT this so bad.  I want to come back and have people see how much I have changed and I want them to envy.  Wish they could do it.  Like I wished I could do it when Melanie did it.  GRR.  I am so determined not to eat today.  I really think I can do it.  I”m so serious.  I really think I can do it today.  I’m so pissed that I didn’t lose any weight since yesterday.  You have no idea how determined I am to do this today.  Geez.  I want this so bad.  Grrr.  It’s 1:00 and I’m not even hungry so that’s a good sign.  I know if I don’t eat I’ll just get down and it always gets me depressed, but I’ll just act like nothing is bothering me.  I’ll try to stay happy no matter what.  I HAVE to do this.

I guess he really doesn’t like me at all.  I”m not considered his friend I guess.  Oh well.  I don’t need anyone.  I have Melanie.  She’s my only good friend.  Screw everyone else.  They don’t know me. They don’t want to know me.  Screw them.  I do have other friends, but they’ll never know me that well… they’re too scared to know what i go through.  GRRr.  I ate more than usual today so that I’ll eat nothing tomorrow and lose a bunch of weight so I can trick my body.  I did excersize though.  I went running.  It hurt a lot. lol.  I’m still sore.  :S  
Melanie, what the heck are you doing??? you’re been set on “brb” for like an hour.  Geez.  I fee like i’m going to puke.  I hope i do.  I would feel so much better.  I went to wal-mart today.  I got some crest whitening gel stuff 😀 Maybe i can get my teeth whiter now!! yay!!  I talked to my parents and they are letting me get red streaks in my hair.  My dad is going to talk to some girl he works w/ and she’s going to do it.  I talked to my dad about getting my green contacts.  He said he’d try but my vision gets worse every year so we’ll have to go to the eye doctor first.  So, far, everything is looking up.  I mean, I said I wanted to get my teeth whiter, dye my hair, get green contacts, get a tan, and lose weight.  Well, everything is going good except the losing weight part.  I mean, i’ve lost like 4 pounds over the summer so far.  I’ve just lost so much already (44 pounds) that it’s getting harder.  My body wants to slow it down now.  For a while I was losing 2-3 pounds a day.  Now i lose a pound every few days.  I think I can do it… but I just have to be even stricter.  I’m eating nothing tomorrow.  YAY!  I really think I can do it 🙂 YAY. lol.  Well, I gotta go.  buh bye

Hey.  I wanted to write a normal diary entry.  One that wouldn’t be perfect proof to have me put into a psycho ward.  Lol.  Well, let’s see. I have a leadership team meeting tomorrow for band.  Wednesday I have to take my senior pictures.  Thursday I have some band thing.  I think I have to show up for the brass and woodwind sectionals to conduct them or something.  Mr. Gossett says that but I have a feeling he’ll end up just conducting them himself because me and lindsay only have a score for one of the songs we’re going to be doing.  So, it would be kinda pointless for us to conduct the band and not know what the crap we’re doing.  I know I’m not supposed to say this.  I’m really going to miss Mr. Parker.  I mean, I’m going to support Mr. Gossett, but last year he was totally mean to me all through marching season and Mr. Parker had to defend me sometimes while Mr. Gossett tried to defend Lindsay.  Now, I don’t have Mr. Parker to help me.  I’m kinda scared.  Lindsay is supposed to be Mr. Gossett’s teacher’s aid.  How fair is that to me? huh?  Yeah, who’s his favorite? Dang.  I just can’t talk to people as easily as Lindsay can.  I can’t make friends w/ Mr. Gossett like she can.  But I think.. i don’t really want to.  Because.. I just don’t agree w/ a lot of the things he does.  I was closer to Mr. Parker.  Geez.  Oh well.  I’ll just have to deal w/ it when it comes and be able to take it because I am a leader of the band.  Well, I’m going to go.  Buh bye.

I just don’t agree w/ a lot of the things he does.  I was closer to Mr. Parker.  Geez.  Oh well.  I’ll just have to deal w/ it when it comes and be able to take it because I am a leader of the band.  Well, I’m going to go.  Buh bye.

I hate living here.  I hate everyone in the house except my dog. I wanna move out and take my dog w/ esp. since i’m the only one who takes care of her.  Dang.  I told my mom to wake me up at 6:30.  Well, I wake up on my own.  I see her and I’m just laying there w/ my eyes open moving around.  Maybe she doesn’t f*ckin see that as a sign that I’m already awake.  So, she comes up and sticks her f*ckin hand in my face.  Geezus.  Why don’t you just wake me up like a normal person.  Oh, you can’t… you live in this f*cked up house.  Then I tell my dad I have a band thing today and he gets all pissed and starts yelling about how I couldn’t tell him earlier.  How can I, when all he does is f*ckin sit around all f*ckin day acting pissed at the world.  He’s still pissed at the dog for chewing his shoes.  He shouldn’t have left them where she could f*ckin get them.  It’s not her fault she’s a f*ckin dog and doesn’t know any better.  Geezus.  There are so many more important things going on in the world and he’s pissed cause the damn dog chews his damn shoes.  God, why don’t you grow up and quit acting like a f*ckin two year old.  I hate it here.  It’s 7:00 in the morning and I had to get on here and release my anger before I actually go see people at 8:00.  Gotta get it out of my system so I don’t go off on anyone who didn’t actually do anything.  Geezus.

I went to get the new Harry Potter book last night!  Me, Kimberly, and Melanie went.  First we went and ate at taco bell, then we went to the mall just to kill some time.  We saw some guy dressed as Harry POtter there and stalked him for a few minutes. hehe.  We then went to goody’s and barnes and noble just to look around.  We left kim in goody’s and went in barnes and noble. OMG it was scary!  Little harry potters running around everywhere.  My biggest fear was getting raped by harry potter.  They had activities there! one was “pin the scar on the harry potter!!” OMG that’s funny. lol  We lost kim for like 30 minutes and finally found her and was late for the movies so the one we wanted to watch (the hulk) was sold out.  So we watch Hollywood Homicide which made NO sense to me but it was still kinda funny… except for them showing the old dude gettin his thang on in every scene. dang! lol.  some couple had soem kids so they just got up and left. lol.  When the movie was over we went on to the book store. it was packed.  We didn’t have reservations so we had to wait a long time cause they were calling out ticket numbers and we had crappy ones.  So, we decided to get some brownie frappacinos and cookies.  WE camped out in an isle and read magazines and art books.  It was so fun.  But the frappacinos made us sooooo sick. They were so strong and rich. OMG it was horrible.  We finally got our books! YAY!  We were so sick we went to taco bell and ordered water.  We decided to cruise cause we didn’t want to go home.  WE started doing cirles around the mall parking lot.  We had to stop when we were feeling sick again. 😛  Mel and kimberly decided to take a ride in a shopping cart. lol.  they got in trouble. hehehehe!  These ugly guys kept drving by and trying to hit on us. but they were like bald and 40. ick.  It was like 2:30 when i got home. :S I’ve read up to chapter ten in my book so far. yay! well i gotta go. buh bye.

I’m going through another identity crisis.  I went through it last year at band camp and it’s happening again.  I just hate everything right now.  I don’t think I should talk to anyone right now or I mean bite their head off.  Where to start?  Well, the first day of band camp was yesterday.  At lunch time people kept freakin telling me to eat and crap.  Pissed me off.  I lost all this weight so maybe a guy would notice me.  But it didn’t work.  They still won’t even look at me.  I guess cause I’m still ugly.  I did all this shit for nothing.  I went through all this pain for abosolutely nothing.  Mr.  Gossett thinks I suck as field commander already.  I made one mistake today w/ the commands and he got pissed.  Excuse me I’m only human, can I make one fucking mistake?  Geezus.  After that he called me and lindsay over and said he was disappointed w/ the way we did our commanders and crap.  I only screwed up once.  Give me a break.  I just wanna cry right now.  I wanna hide in a hole and never come out.  I’m sure everyone thinks I’m freakin stupid now.  Kati came to me today and told me she’s going on a double date travis, chrystal, and this zac guy.  That pissed me off.  I don’t know that I’m really pissed at Kati, but dang.  She had to know that was going to hurt me and she even told me she didn’t really like zac.  I dunno.  Just the fact travis will be there w/ chrystal… and kati being there… grr i dunno.  I’m gonna go.  I”m getting even more pissed. bye.

Well, I’m feeling better today.  I guess I just have to accept the fact no guy will like me.  Oh well.  I’ll have to get used to being alone the rest of my life.  I can get used to it.  Anyway.  Band camp was a little better today.  We’re going to start setting the drill for our show tomorrow.  yay.  lol.  Our show should be really cool this year.  Mr. Gossett is pretty creative.  Shew.

I just found out Adam F. was in an accident.  He plays tuba in our band.  I went out w/ him last year.  Him and his dad were riding his dad’s motocycle.  Mel said they were hit by a semi truck or something.  His dad died.  This is horrible.  Adam is in the hospital.  Mel just told me he’s in surgery.  This sucks so bad.  The whole band is upset.  I hope he’s okay.  Mr. Gossett is taking it hard.  The guard has practice today and Carrie told me Mr. g had to tell them.  She said he had the straightest face ever.  She said a lot of people started bawling including her and Tiffany started throwing up.  Jen said she saw mr. g crying.  Carrie said he kept saying “i dunno what to do.” over and over.  I wonder if Mr. Parker knows.  I mean i know he’s not our band director anymore but he needs to know.  Him and Adam were pretty buddy buddy.  This sucks a** through a straw.  I know the whole band is taking this hard.  I wish someone who was at the fiddlin fest would get online.  I need to see if everyone is okay.  I need to know what’s going on.  I want to help so bad.  I feel so worthless just sitting here. Grr.  Ima go. Bye.

This is how I’m feeling right now about the whole Adam situation.  I feel like i’m starting to lose a little faith now.  I can’t help it.  After everything that’s happened. 🙁  I just want him to be okay.
Tired of being what you want me to be,
feeling so faithless, lost under the surface.
don’t know what you’re expecting of me
put under the pressure of walking in your shoes.
Every step that I take is another mistake to you.
I’ve become so numb, I can’t feel you there.
I’ve become so tired, so much more aware.
By becoming this all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you.
Can’t you see that you’re smothering me?
Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control.
Cause everything that you thought I would be
has fallen apart right in front of you.
Every step that I take is another mistake to you.
And every second I was is more that I can take.
I’ve become so numb, I can’t feel you there.
I’ve become so tired, so much more aware.
By becoming this all I want to do,
is be more like me and be less like you.
And I know I may end up failing too,
but I know you were just like me w/ someone disappointed in you.
I’ve become so numb, I can’t feel you there
I’ve become so tired, so much more aware.

I have so much on my mind.  Well an update on Adam.  Kati said he’s in critical condition and on life support.  Mel told me they finished his surgery.  His mom Tammy said things weren’t looking so good.  I just want him to be okay.  Please let him be okay.  This can’t happen. He can’t die.  Don’t let him die. Please.  You can’t do this to me.  I think Mr. Gossett is supposed to call today and tell us what we’re going to do.  We don’t know if we’re going to have band camp tomorrow.  If I were Mr. Gossett I wouldn’t know what to do right now.  This is so scary.  If Mr. g calls I’m going to offer to help w/ anything.  This is so horrible.  I wish it was all just a dream.

Today was a shity day.  It started out the whole band was in a bad mood.  I think evryone was just grumpy and tired from everything that had been going on.  Mr. Gossett was in a bad mood and we didn’t know why.  He called a meeting w/ the leadership team and he told us we need to be better leaders blah blah.  So, basically we were kinda pissed at him.  We didn’t know why the whole staff and mr. gossett were in such a bad mood.  After lunch me, melanie, and beth were putting a new trash bag in the trash can and mr. gossett came out there and he’s like “don’t worry about it just come in the band room..”  There was something weird about the way he said it.  It was almost scary.  We all went in the band room and sat down.  I was sitting w/ ann marie, mel, beth, and allison.  Mr. Merideth our consouler came in there and was standing by us and i didn’t know why he was in there.  I just thought he was going to talk to mr. gossett about something.  but then mr. gossett got our attention and he said “everyone sit up and get where you can see me please.” at this point I thought he was going to chew us out about how practice had been going.  but then he said w/ his voice breaking.. “we found out that.. adam is brain dead and he’s not going to make it after all.. he’s not going to live.”  omg.  there was just dead silence for like 2 minutes then so many people just broke down crying.  There was just straight crying for like 20 minutes.  Then Mr. Merideth started talking to us about what a strong band we were and how we could get through it.  People were bawling.  It was horrible.  Not just girls… guys.  That’s what absolutely killed me.  Adam M. looked like he wanted to hit something. I’m sure he was thinking something like fuck the world.  Jon n. was crying.  I remember looking at Lindsay laying her head on nick’s shoulder and bawling and she never cries.  Nick was just staring in shock.  Amanda H. was bawling and courtney was just sitting there biting her lip.  There were loud sobs coming from the colorguard.  At one point, Clay just suddenly jumped up.  He went over to Adam’s tuba which was laying out… he picked it up and at this point everyone started crying louder and harder.. he took the tuba apart and put it in it’s case and closed it.  He then walked back over to his seat and took his hat off and threw it down.  That was the most horrible moment.  Everyone just started crying harder and those who hadn’t been crying started to.  I remember Tiffany H. hadn’t been crying but when clay did that she burst into tears and leaned against carrie and carrie hugged her. I remember mr. g asking if anyone had any questions and nick asked if adam’s mouthpiece could be burried w/ him and nick’s voice was shaking so bad. So finally around 2:00 everyone started leaving.  Me, mel, and beth went to allison’s house because it was like less than a minute away from the school.  we went back to the bandroom at like four.  we went up to mr. g’s office and we all started talking and laughing and joking around.  Then.. Mr. Parker came.  OMg shew. I miss him so much.  He walked by me and he goes “wow ur lookin skinny.” :S shew.  this has been one long day. Why does adam have to die?? why?? it’s so unfair.  fuck this.  it is soooo fucking unfair. fuck everying.

I wish I could describe what I’m feeling.  But words cannot express the emotion i’m feeling.  He can’t die.  It’s bullshit.  Adam can’t die.  But he’s going to and there’s nothing I can do to stop it. IT’S FUCKING BULLSHIT!!!!!!! There were times when I was at allison’s house today… and we were all laughing and joking and just talking like normal..  I remember we were talking about the length of mel’s toes (cause she has some long butt toes) and just a random memory of adam popped in my head.  It keeps happening.  I was talking and these random memories of him kept popping in my had at random times.  It’s almost scary.  We were in mr. g’s office and i looked up at the band calender and stared at adam’s pic.  it was horrible.  I was going home today and they annouced his dad’s funeral on the radio.  We have an idea for our show now.  we are making props and we were going to put like big pics in them.. and one pic was going to be of a baby boy.. but mr. g said he’s going to put adam’s pic of when he was a baby.  that is such a great idea.  shew.

9. Did the characters look the way you imagined? i thought harry might be uglier but i’m glad he’s not.  um i thought hermione might be uglier.  I thought ron would be slimmer and taller.  hagrid and dumbledore are exactly the way i had imagined.
10. Who do you think will hook up? oh definitely ron and hermione.
11. Which character would you like to be killed? I wanted umbridge to die so bad but she didn’t grr her.  and damn that belatrix lastrange.  die damnit die.  grr her for killing sirius and torturing neville’s parents. and voldemort should die too. grrr.
12. Are you a Death Eater? no…. 
13. Which house would you be in? well, i’d want to be in gryiffindor.. but i’m afraid i’d get up there and the sorting hat would put me in hufflepuff or say something like “you don’t even deserve to be put in a house.”

16. Are you gonna cry after the 7th one (like me)? maybe… lol. that’s probably like 8490234824892304823804934290348098 years away though. 😛
17. Whos better: Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, or Prongs? I like them all except wormtail.. he should be on my list of people to die too.. 
18. Have you ever mumbled Latin spells under your breath at random occasions? not really.  me and travis were shouting spells at each other one night online though. then i did it to mel. hehe.
19. What kind of animal would you be if you were an animagi? hmm. i like dogs.. but how original is that??  um well it’s the magical world so i’d be a unicorn 🙂
20. If you were J.K. Rowling would you continue the series after book 7? I dunno.. you don’t want stuff like that to continue forever cause then u’d just be beating a dead horse.. it’s like a television seiries that starts to suck and they just keep making more episodes and dragging it out.

Lol. Sorry. I’ve been doing a lot of surveys lately.  They’re fun and I love being a smartass on them.  Plus nothing has really happened since band camp ended.  I talked to Lance last night.  He was at DCI.  He said he wanted to come over and talk to me and he said he started to head that way but we all started to leave.  Me and mel are going to go to his play saturday.  He hasn’t seen me in months so he might be a little shocked. lol.  He just saw my face last Friday.  I think J.R. (the 23 year old guy that hits on me online) is going to be there.  I might have to meet him.  i’m curious as to what he looks like. not to sound shallow or anything but i’m just curious. 😛 well i think ima go. buh bye.

I have a few friends in that class too. There isn’t anybody i hate in there. There are some people I don’t talk to that much but they’re all really nice anyway. Like if I ever had to be in a group w/ any of them I wouldn’t mind cause everyone in that class is so nice. Although right now we’re learning about the history of literature and omg that’s like the most boring part of english ever. grrr. lol. I love my lunch class. I have allison, ann marie, ashley h, jennifer R., stacey, and kati. red cid and jessica y. were sitting w/ us but then they moved. My last block is of course band. woo hoo.

Today was shitty.  Well, it was fine til band practice.  fuck.  I’m so fuckin pissed off.  Damn.  I hate band.  Well, i do right now.  It hasn’t been fun at all for me this year.  I hate it.  It’s not like it used to be.  I miss looking forward to practices now I just want it to end.  God.  Okay, I thought I was going to be conducting two of our three songs like I did last year.  And I had been conducting our ballad and our closer.  So, anyway, during practice everyone was split into sectionals and I was sitting there talking to red cid and Lindsay comes up and sits beside me.  She’s like “i wanna conduct suncatchers.” i’m like “why?” she’s like “cause.. you got to conduct the opener and the closer last year..” i was like “so?” she’s like “please..” i’m like “no.” and i said it like totally pissed off.. cause i was.  She looked at me for a second and then she’s like “come over here w/ me and talk…”  so we went off to the side away from everyone and sat down.  She’s like “I really want to conduct suncatchers.. i mean that’s the way we did it last year.. dont’ you see where I’m coming from?”  So, that’s when the straw snapped.  It was the way she said “don’t you see where I’m coming from??”  It was like I was finally getting to tell her what I’ve been holding in for a month.  I started totally going off.  I was like, “well ya know what.. you seem to do everything… you just take over whatever i’m doing and i’m left w/ nothing.  nobody even respects me anymore because of it.”  she’s like “i’m sorry.. i don’t mean to take over.. I don’t even realize I’m doing it.  I just wanna get things done cause i’m afraid mr. g’s going to get mad and we’ll get in trouble.”  I just stared at her getting more pissed off by the second.  I’m like “well it’s like i don’t even matter anymore.. there’s no point to me being here.”  she’s like “yes it does matter!!  I didn’t know i was doing this..” then she’s like “but don’t you see where I’m coming from about conducting that song?” i’m like “i dunno.. it doesn’t matter what i think.”  she’s like “yes it does!! i didn’t know what i was doing and I knew you weren’t happy.. you should talk to me.” at this point I was crying and I don’t even know why.  ann marie walked up and asked me what was wrong.  Then she wanted to be in the conversation and she wouldn’t go away til i started talking.  She thought i just didn’t want to tell her what was wrong but I just wanted to get things straight w/ lindsay first.  and she’s stood there for like 5 minutes and wouldn’t go away.  so me and lindsay got up and she followed us and lindsay’s like “just go ahead and tell me…” so i’m like, “okay, I just haven’t been getting and respect at all lately and I think it’s cause you just seem to take over everything.  and esp. the drumline doesn’t respect me because nick and zac are close to you.” she’s like “well you want me to beat them up?” i just laughed and said no.  finally ann marie walked off cause she finally realized what we were doing.  So we sat down again and I was like “look.. i know mr. gossett likes you more.. and don’t deny it.  i mean i’ll admit mr. parker was closer to me.” she’s like “yeah i know. i mean i noticed it last year.  but i tried to not let it bother me.”  I was like “yeah.. it’s just things don’t seem to be going my way at all this year.”  at this point mr. g told everyone to be on the field.  so we stood up and she’s like “well.. i want you to talk to me because i don’t want you to not have fun w/ this. because i didn’t have fun at all last year.  i don’t want it to be that way for you.” then she’s like “can i go ahead and conduct this song today and then we’ll talk about it later when we have time?” i was like “fine.” and she’s like “will you hate me if i do?” i’m like “no…” then she hugged me and ran off.  god.  grrr.  i just let people walk right over me.  i’ll always be the invisible girl that nobody pays attention to unless they need something i have. fuck.
The good side… i saw ryan today.  he came to band practice.  he saw me and he’s like “hey i have to shake ur hand.” lol.  i’m not sure why.. but he did. haha. 😛 he’s so hot.

Okay, I am so fucking pissed.  Okay, first there’s the thing w/ lindsay, then the fact i’ve been stuck at 110 forever.. there’s the thing where i get no respect nowadays.. and the whole thing where no guy will ever like me (let’s not forget the damn comment from alex).  There’s this guy that won’t fuckin leave me alone.  He talks to me online and suddenly he thinks he likes me just cause he talks to me online.  and i don’t even hardly say anything to him.  then when i’m already pissed and stressed out and upset he just now got on and i never say hi to him so he’s like “how come you never talk to me.” so i said “cause i don’t really ever say hi to anyone first online” which is true.. the only people i do say hi to are mel and travis cause their my best friends.  he’s like “uh-huh” then got offline.  he probably blocked me like i actually give a damn.  fuck, just leave me the fuck alone.  He thinks I should actually say hi to him… like we’ve actually got something goin on.  I don’t have to say hi to him. we’re not “invovled” and we’re not even friends damnit.  i don’t even know him!!!!!!!!! just leave me the fuck alone i’m pissed off enough as it is w/out some 23 year old guy bein a sensitve bitch. damn.

Okay, before I was talking about how me and lindsay were arguing about who should get to conduct which song.  Well, I was really upset about it so I went and talked to Mr. Gossett this morning.  He said he was wanting to have the two podiums like each on the two 40 yards lines so it would be equal.  But then he said he doesn’t think it’s going to be able to work out that way so we may end up having someone on center podium the whole time while the other one is on the 40 yard line.  He said if we have to have a center podium he wants me to do it, not lindsay.  Because I mean, I was head field commander last year and my score was higher on the auditions this year.  so yay!! i feel so much better and that made my day so much better. woo!!! lol.  well ima go.. bye

Well, nothing has really happened.  The band is playing at the new wal-mart opening Wednesday.  Oh joy.  The good thing is, Ryan said he’s going to be there.  yay for hot guys 😛 tee hee.  Um.  I think a bunch of us are going to pine knob saturday.  Red cid wants to go this time.  So, does Ann Marie.  We might just have to have some people just simply meets us there. :S i dunno.  Or mel could pick up some people if she is going.  I dunno.  Well, Kati is going out w/ clay.  I thought I told her I kinda liked him like a few weeks ago, but oh well.  I didn’t like him that much and it’s not like he would’ve ever like me anyway.  Melanie is fianlly going out w/ jimmy.  yay. well. all of my friends are hookin up.  isn’t it just grand? 😐 lol.  well, that apartment w/ the smelly cats is lookin brighter and brighter everyday.  well, ima go.  buh bye.

Lindsay’s mom got the material for our field commander outfits!! Lindsay said she’s going to have them done by the first football game which is next week!! I’m so exicted, it’s going to be awesome!! The material is soooooo pretty. We’re gonna look all sexy. lol. Just kiddin. I wanna wear our hair down this year. Last year we had to wear our hair in buns like the colorguard. But me and linds both have really long hair and it would be cool to let it down and have it curly. That would be so cute. 🙂 The guys at the football game can see me in my sexy outfit. Just kiddin. yeah right. *sighs* My love life is so completely hopeless at this point. Damn all my friends are hooked up and there’s just little Mallory standing by little ugly self. GRRRRR!!!!! There’s Jacob and Tara, Mel and Jimmy, Kati and Clay, Red cid is “talking” to Zan, lindsay and nick, chris and kara, Zac and Annah, and of course Travis and Chrystal. Damn people stop. lol. Stop w/ the raging hormones. It’s like all these guys are picking every girl except me. It’s like I don’t even exist. grrrrr

Clay broke up w/ kati.  Doesn’t that just suck butt through a straw?  He said he prefers to “be alone.”  I think he’s gay.  Seriously, i’m not trying to be mean, but he hasn’t had a girlfriend in a long time and a lot of girls think he’s hot and he knows it.  He went out w/ kati last year and again this year.  She has been like his only gf in high school.  He just doesn’t seem to want to get close to anyone.  So either he has this thing about commitment or he’s gay. If he’s gay it will prove my whole point of all the hot guys being taken or gay. grrr. lol.
Um what else is new? Carla had me try on the field commander outfit she had been working on.  I think she used lindsay as a model then made me try it on.  So all she has to do is hem up the bottom cause linds is taller and then make the pant smaller in the hips.  She also has to change some of the color patterns.  But I think it’s awesome it only took her one night to make that whole thing.  So I definitley think we’re going to have our outfits by the first football game.
We have a 4 hour practice tomorrow.  Yes, on a Saturday.  We got our whole show on the field last night now we just have to clean and put the props on w/ it.  That’s what we’ll be doing tomorrow.  Practice is from 8:00 til 12:00.  joy.  Well, the good thing is me and kati are going to see the play at pine knob.  Allison might go but we’re not sure.  I just know me and kati are going for sure and we’re eating at the dinner there before the show. yay.  Poor Kati.  She looked so upset when Clay broke up w/ her.  I saw him do it.  After the bell rang we were walking to the lobby and he pulled her off to the side and said “i need to talk to you.”  then he talked to her and then i saw him hug her and walk off.  grrr. lol. sorry, i just think it’s fucked up how guys treat me and my friends.  Well, they don’t really treat me any way at all.. they don’t even know i exist.  Damn i hate them all.  well ima go. buh bye.

Me, Kati, and Allison went to the play at Pine Knob last night.  I know it’s nothing wild like cruising town and making out w/ guys but we still had a lot of fun.  That was the most fun we’ve had at one of those plays.  I think cause we all just let ourselves go and act stupid.  we may be dorks that aren’t hot and can’t get guys but we have fun doing it.  we ate at the diner.  we ate a bunch of junk like chicken strips, fries, a banana split, jones cola, suckers, hot dogs and kati got some testament gum. lol.  twas fun.  we laughed through the whole play and sang all the songs.  it was the most fun i’ve had in a long time.  i love kati and allison.  they’re great.  me and kati have been getting so close lately.  I can tell her everything now.  we’re going through the same things too.  our personalities are a lot alike too.  it’s great.  she said she needed a best friend because she used to have jennifer but jennifer is too involved w/ derrick now.  I saw lance last night.  the cast of the play went out to meet us and lance was standing there and we were shaking everyone’s hands and I went to shake his hand and he took mine, but then pulled me towards him and hugged me.  it was sweet. lol.  well, ima go. bye.

It’s going to be awesome. we went last saturday and it was so much fun. i probably already mentioned it but i haven’t had that much fun w/ my friends in forever and i haven’t laughed that hard w/ anyone in forever. we were laughing so hard through the whole play and singing all the songs. in the first act there was a group of people sittin behind us but in the second act they moved.. i think cause we were so loud. lol!!!! it was grand.

Worked at the fair yesterday.  That sucked.  Twas hot, very hot!!  I had school, then band practice, then went to the fair and worked for two hours, got home at 8 and then did homework for an hour.  Too much to do.  I was going to go to the fair tonight to work but i’m so tired from yesterday that I needed to take the night off so i’ll just work tomorrow.. again after band practice. lol.  Friday we have a football game.  I’m excited because I get to wear my new fc outfit for the first time!! woo hoo!! la la la.  what is new? um.  jimmy is an asshole who broke up w/ mel.  he can kiss my ass and hers.  Kati is now going out w/ chris which in my opinion is the dumbest thing she could do.  besides go out w/ tony.  now that was dumb.  Kati thinks she is ugly and fat and all this stuff but i think she is soooooooooo pretty and skinny and she’s totally sweet.  I wish she wouldn’t settle for chris.  he’s a dumbass.  i mean i’m ugly and fat and i would never settle for chris. ick. lol.  well i think ima go.  buh bye

I’m excited because I get to wear my new fc outfit for the first time!! woo hoo!! la la la.  what is new? um.  jimmy is an asshole who broke up w/ mel.  he can kiss my ass and hers.  Kati is now going out w/ chris which in my opinion is the dumbest thing she could do.  besides go out w/ tony.  now that was dumb.  Kati thinks she is ugly and fat and all this stuff but i think she is soooooooooo pretty and skinny and she’s totally sweet.  I wish she wouldn’t settle for chris.  he’s a dumbass.  i mean i’m ugly and fat and i would never settle for chris. ick. lol.  well i think ima go.  buh bye

In english class we had to take five friends and then write our own version of the cantabury tales.  mine turned out pretty good and pretty funny so ima paste it in here.
It was a hot day, that Thursday afternoon
All of my friends and I gathered in the band room.
All wearing shorts and t-shirts for the hot weather,
Some carrying flutes as light as a feather.
We headed outside to march and play
It was just a normal marching band practice day.
We got outside and stood in our lines,
Everything seemed to be going just fine.
I stood on my podium conducting the band,
I listened to them as they watched my hands.
Although I tried and people thought I was the best,
My right hand flew out, when my left wanted to rest.
My co-field commander screamed when I stood quiet,
Im not a loud person, even when I try it.
I may stand on my podium that makes me seem tall,
But the podium does nothing for me when I fall.
Up the steps I have to run,
Yet falling on my face is never fun.
My friend, Travis, although not in band,
Stood nearby with his camera in hand.
He tugged at his huge pants, that he said made him look, coolie.
He hung around us so much he was considered the band groupie.
Yo, homie, he said, thinking he was ghetto,
The fact he thought he was black could not hide his ego.
He sang the lyrics to the latest rap song
As he plotted ways to kill me and my dog.
When I because excited and shouted, yay!
I heard threats of acid and piranhas muttered my way.
My other friend Kati was marching with her flute
She realized it wasnt a trumpet when she couldnt use the mute.
Her face grew red when she heard the comments,
The one time at band camp she heard often from her friends.
Though she played her flute quite well with talent,
She grew quite angry and grabbed the nearest drum mallet.
She hit herself in the head with it once, no, twice,
Stop, I said, That loud noise is not nice!
She threw the mallet down and pouted for a moment,
Go on, tell me I suck at drums!  I just know it!
Next was Ann Marie with her clarinet,
She knew she was the best, no doubt about it.
Ann Marie seemed perfect in every way,
She just got another test back, oh, wow, another A!
Although I knew better, Ann Marie wasnt perfect,
She sometimes made mistakes, but you never knew it.
She had her eye open for the perfect guy,
Which didnt really help her when she fell and poked her eye.
That wouldnt have happened, she said, If only
If only we had that hot field commander from Murray!
Now, on to my unique friend, Melanie.
Everyone else was hot, but she was still happy.
Woo hoo!  Yay for the sun! she would say,
While others grumbled and told her to go away.
Yay for band! she said, I love you guys!
Oh, my gosh, do you realize how many calories are in those fries?!
She was always counting calories and fat grams too,
When she saw fatty foods she didnt know what to do.
She eyed the hamburger in Traviss hand
Then said, Do you know how many calories are in that, my friend?
Last, but not least was my co- field commander Lindsay.
She was louder than I, though slightly more ditzy.
She waved her arms around just like me
Though we both worked hard, we were considered lazy.
She screamed and yelled, her face as red as her hair,
In her loud, high-pitched voice she yelled, Come on, guys!  Get there!
She stood on her podium slightly taller than me,
And eyed the hot drummer she seemed to fancy.
How did I know she was so love sick?
Well, just look at my papers covered in the words, Lindsay loves Nick.
So, the sun went down on the Thursday afternoon,
We were tired and knew just what to do.
We would go our separate ways for then,
But we knew wed see each other again.
Band practice was over and we were all so tired,
Time to go home and watch Lizzie McGuire.
After that, time for rest, not another peep,
Because, I would always seem to fall straight to sleep.

I’m bored. La la.  Um.  The labor day parade was yesterday.  I hate marching in parades. grr. lol.  um.  I was at the fair saturday and I was working w/ ann marie.  Lindsay’s dad Jamie walked in the booth and was like “ur losing too much weight you need to eat.” and he said it really loud and the whole booth just kinda got quiet and they were all looking at me.  It was kinda weird.  Hmm.  I was also walking outside after band practice today and ashely t. came running up and caught up w/ me.  She’s like “you really need to stop losing weight.  I’m serious.  ur like smaller than me now. stop.” :S hmm.  I dunno.  I kinda want to stop cause i know i’m skinny, but i dunno.  Everyone says i’m skinny and a few people say i’m pretty but then why can’t I get a guy?  oh well.  It just pisses me off and I don’t know what to do anymore.  
I get to paint my senior toga tomorrow.  I’m excited.  I’ve been waiting for four years to wear my toga!!! woo!!!!  
Our first marching band contest is this saturday.  Mr. G told us who we were up against.  He said we have a good chance at getting grand champion.  I hope.  Lindsay also said her mom is working really hard on getting the field commander outfits done.  I really hope she finishes them.  It’ll be awesome.  Well, i’m going to go.  buh bye.

The most interesting thing happened to me.  I think I just fell hard for someone.  I’m not in love w/ them, but oh my gosh… I want them so bad now.  The bell rang and we were all leaving the band room to go home.  I was walking in the hall and Clay walked up beside me.  I was like “hey clay.” he’s like “hello..” he said it like right away like he was expecting me to say hi anyway.  Then he’s like, “dang, I’m tired..”  then there was silence and he’s like, “um.. mallory.. you need to eat something…” i’m like, “what??” he’s like, “seriously.. you need to eat.”  he stopped and we stood there off to the side as everyone passed by we talked.  He’s like, “look, ur getting way too skinny.  and i know what you’re doing because I did it last year.”  I’m like “really?”  he’s like “yeah. seriously.  you need to eat because you’re just hurting yourself.”  Oh my god.  I had no idea anybody cared at all.  I was so sure nobody gave a crap what I was doing.  I totally fell for him at that moment.  I had no idea he had done this to himself last year.  I mean, i know he got skinnier but it wasn’t like he was too skinny.  Then he got buffer and it just made it look like he just worked out more.  All those times Ann Marie said stuff like “you and clay would get along great.. he’s always critizing what I eat and telling me how many calories is in it.”  I didn’t stop to think he had this problem.  Oh my god.  This is so weird.  I can’t believe someone actually cares.  I also wondered why he had been talking to me so much latley.  He goes out of his way to say hi to me and stuff.  Tis weird.  Gosh, i really fell for him.  The way he talked to me wasn’t like how most people talk to me.  Most people are like “stop.. ur too skinny..” and try to play it off like it’s a joke and laugh a little.  He just took me aside, looked me staight in the eyes and didn’t laugh.  He looked serious and worried.  It made me wanna cry.  I was about to.  It broke my heart and also made me fall for him. God.  shew.  Well ima go.  buh bye.  (mel, please don’t tell anyone.  I doubt clay wants the whole world to know.)

I talked to Clay again tonight.  We had homecoming and i had been wanting to talk to him but i was too shy.  but kati was like “you look all sexy and dressed up.. just go talk to him!!”  So i did.  i’m glad i did too.  He’s so sweet and so caring.  First I was like, “i thought abuot what you said.. and i’ll admit..” he cut me off, “you haven’t been eating, right?” i’m like “well yeah.” he goes, “yes.  I noticed.”  so i went on, “it really meant a lot to me that you just went out of ur way to talk to me.  so, he made me promise to start eating more.  I was like “okay.  i will.  I promise.”  he’s like “thank you so much.” and he pulled me into a hug.  Then I was like, “i really didn’t think anybody cared.” he goes, “believe me, plenty of people do.” awwwwwwwwww!!!  I wish he liked me… i mean.. in that way.  I could so fall in love w/ him.  He’s soooooo sweet.  He’s easy to talk to too.  I did kinda want to hug him.. and i was thinkin about doin it.. but he did it first.  he just pulled me towards him.. it was so sweet.  I can’t think or concentrate on anything else.  He’s all I can think about. *sigh*  I just wish he wanted a girlfriend and I wish I was good enough for him.  I wish i was pretty.  He seems to think that guard girl annah is pretty.  Good thing she’s going out w/ zac or i would think something was going on w/ her and clay.  I just wish for ONCE the guy I liked.. would actually like me back.  This is so much more than him actually being hot or anything.  He’s gone through what I have.  He’s so sweet and such a caring, genuine person.  He’s also really smart.  I couldn’t think of anyone else I would rather be with.  I would even pick him over travis if i had to. seriously.  because clay seems way more caring than travis. woo. well ima go.  got a big marching band contest tomorrow, guys!! wish me luck!! buh bye!!!

So, I tried that today and it kinda worked.. i mean more guys talked to me and I even feel really great about myself.  I’m eating more too and I don’t feel guilty.  The thing is, as long as you eat three meals a day and don’t snack, you won’t gain weight.  AND!! you’ll be happier and healthier and people won’t worry about you… people like CLAY!!!!! :D:D:D  I walked w/ him after band class.  I was walkin in the hall after school and he caught up w/ me.  We started talkin about normal stuff.. like how he has to ride the bus until he gets a parking pass for his car.  We walked together… just the two of us til we got to the lobby.  woo!!!!!  I feel great!!  I feel awesome!!  I just have to keep telling myself that I’m great and I’m hot! hehe.  i’m hot i’m sexy. lol i’m just kiddin.  but freal.. if you keep telling urself that it helps and makes you feel awesome.

Um, not too much happened today.  It’s harder to get better than I thought it would be.  The whole day I would find myself zoning out and asking myself whether I should eat or not today.  My scale is fucked up.  I got on it and it said, “126, 125, 118, 116, 115 124..” seriously.. I was just standing there and those numbers started flashing at me one after the other.  Now it’s not right so i won’t know what I weigh.  At practice I saw Clay talkin to Annah and it made me mad, but i know she’s going out w/ zac, but still.  I guess I know deep down there really is nothing between them.  But it made me debate on whether I should eat or not and I started to get down and I kept thinking, “don’t get down, stay confident, don’t let this bother you..” and then another part of me was saying “he will never like you.. unless you lose more weight.  don’t eat. don’t eat.” and everyone around me was eating brownies on a break and something was going “don’t eat. don’t eat.”  but i marched in there and grabbed me a brownie.  I was walkin and eatin it and clay saw me and he smiled and said “you’re eating!  good job.  it’s good for you.  i’m proud.”  That just totally made my day and i was happy again.  then after rehersal me and clay walked to the bandroom together. yay! :D:D lol.  well, my parents made dinner and didn’t save any for me.. so there’s nothing left.  Everybody’s eaten and i’ve got nothing.  I’ll have to find something.  Of course when i realized nothing was left I was like “i could just not eat anymore today..” but i’m about to go find something to eat right now.  This is harder than I expected.  dang. gotta go. buh bye

I guess I know deep down there really is nothing between them.  But it made me debate on whether I should eat or not and I started to get down and I kept thinking, “don’t get down, stay confident, don’t let this bother you..” and then another part of me was saying “he will never like you.. unless you lose more weight.  don’t eat. don’t eat.” and everyone around me was eating brownies on a break and something was going “don’t eat. don’t eat.”  but i marched in there and grabbed me a brownie.  I was walkin and eatin it and clay saw me and he smiled and said “you’re eating!  good job.  it’s good for you.  i’m proud.”  That just totally made my day and i was happy again.  then after rehersal me and clay walked to the bandroom together. yay! :D:D lol.  well, my parents made dinner and didn’t save any for me.. so there’s nothing left.  Everybody’s eaten and i’ve got nothing.  I’ll have to find something.  Of course when i realized nothing was left I was like “i could just not eat anymore today..” but i’m about to go find something to eat right now.  This is harder than I expected.  dang. gotta go. buh bye

I didn’t get a chance to talk to Clay today like I usually do.  If i don’t get to talk to him during the day he usually walks w/ me to the lobby in the afternoons and we hang out there until his bus comes.  but he had his car today so he went out to the student parking lot so i didn’t get to talk to him. 🙁 oh well.  Um.  This whole “getting better” thing… is so not as easy as I thought it would be.  Everytime i do eat i feel so guitly.  allison gave me her fries at lunch today and after i ate them i wanted to throw up so bad.  That was the closest i’ve ever come to convincing myself to throw up.  When I’m tryin to get better it almost seems worse. I don’t know what to do.  In band class I was just sittin there.. i could hear people laughing and bein happy around me.. and all i could think about was how fat i was and how i didn’t want to eat and how i wanted to throw up the damn french fries.  then i would look back at clay and think “don’t do it.  just eat.. for him.  you told him you were trying to get better.”  it’s hard to do this.  esp. when some colorguard bitch keeps throwin herself at him even though she already has a boyfriend. grr. actually, i don’t think there is anything w/ annah and clay.. but it still makes me mad.  i even talked to her a little today and she’s really nice.. but dang.  i can’t help it.  He’s so freakin perfect.  he’s not like travis.  travis was too controlling and felt he had to insult me sometiems to keep control.  but clay is sooo sweet. omg i want to be w/ him so bad.  I don’t want to be w/ anyone else but him.  I would give almost anything.  iwoudl gain freakin 10 pounds just to be w/ him!!!!!!!! grr. well ima go. buh bye

We got third place in our class last night.  our score was 73. something.  The judges said everything about us was great except our fundamentals.  Our fundamentals seem to be really horrible.  ick.  That should be easy to fix though.  Just people keeping their toes up and having good posture as they march.  Um, i’ve talked to clay a little more.  we got into a discussion about love. lol.  Somebody was saying something about fat people and i was like “i love fat people.” Clay was like “i love everybody.” i was like, “yeah i love everyone too.” allison goes, “do you love ur tuba, clay?” he’s like “I don’t love my tuba cause it’s an inanimate object and it can’t love me back.  That’s also why i don’t like animals, cause they can’t love me back.”  i was like, “you don’t know that.” allison’s like “yeah they may not know what love is but they could still feel it w/out knowing it.”  Clay was like, “i don’t think love is a feeling.”  I was like, “what do you think it is?”  he looked at me and goes, “i think it’s a way of life.” awww. lol.  Um.. what else.  oh later that night we all had to sit in the band room and he tried to sit by me.. but some damn show crew memeber sat down really fast.. she was almost sittin in my damn lap.. so he had to sit on the other side of her.  I don’t know why she felt the need to sit by me, when there were places behind me to sit and she hardly knows me.  I guess she thought it would be cool to sit by the field commander or something.  anyway, it pissed me off cause he was just about to sit by me!!!!!!!!! grr!  anyway, he was leaning over her talkin to me, anyway.  haha.  well ima go.  buh bye.

    The band went to Murray Friday and stayed the night.  It was soooooo much fun.  I don’t even know where to start.  We left at about 7:00am Friday morning.  When we got to Murray we had a 3 hour practice on their field while the Murray State band director helped out band.  I thought that would never end.  It was pure torture.  It was so hot and a lot of people got sunburned.  Woo.  Well, after practice we went back to the hotel to freshen up to go out to eat and shop.  Melanie did my make up.  i think it looked really cool.  I still looked ugly but.. a better ugly. lol.  We went out to eat after that and me, melanie, beth, lizabeth, allison, and ann marie all ate at the mexican resturant there.  We had an hour and a half to eat and shop but we spent basically the whole time in that resturant.  We were having so much fun and we kept ordering stuff.  It was sooo much fun.  We couldn’t stop laughing.  They had some freakin awesome virgin strawberry dacheris!! omgish they were so good, so i ended up ordering two.  twas great.  We only had like 10 minutes so me and lizabeth went to look in one of the shops while the others finished eating.  I ended up getting a shirt.  woooo. lol.  we got back on the bus and mr. gossett told us he was going to take us on a tour of murray to show us things he used to do when he was there.  That was hilarious.  He was trying to act like a tour guide.  When we got back to the hotel we all went up to him and gave him change.  it was Carla’s idea.  he was so shocked, but he was laughing so hard too.  He couldn’t hold all the change everyone was giving him so he had to stuff it in his pockets.  Some of us went back to our rooms.  Me and mel decided to walk around outside.  We saw some of our show crew girls talking to some guys while they were hanging out of the window of a bus.  So we walked over to talk to the guys.  They were pretty hot and really sweet.  One of them asked what room we were in so mel gave him the number.  They never actually came by or called though. 🙁 oh well.  while we were all hanging out ann marie came over and asked if we wanted to be in her movie she was making w/ allison’s camera she brought.  omgish taht was sooooooooooo much fun!!!!  We went to Allison’s room to make it.  It was our version of physco.  Lizabeth was some crazy girl… melanie was a mullet man.. allison worked the camera, ann marie was the director, victoria was the policeman and the controller of the lovealot phyco bear who turned out to be the killer, jana was some physco person i’m not sure.. i was a crazy old lady and various floating objects.  See, in every scene we had some kind of random floating object that someone would hold just to make it funny and see if anyone who watched it could spot it.  We also had a hersey’s chocolate bar as a prop in every scene.  Allison said I looked really scary.  Melanie had done my eye make up and in my scene i had my hair down and it’s really long and it was in my eyes and allison said it scared her. lol.  we did the end credits and we sang our show music as background music.  we had to go back to our rooms after that, thou, cause some bitch was complaining about the band. grrr.  When we went back to our room jen and april had some fight and jen ended up having a panic attack.  that was scary but she’s ok now.  Saturday we had to perform at 12:30.  That was the best performance I have ever been a part of.  I can hardly describe it.  The whole time I was smiling and laughing and about to cry.  After the first song i walk over to the podium and wait for linds to get done conducting and she gets down and i take her place… but she got down and she goes “i’m gonna cry.. ” and she threw herself at me and hugged me and the whole pit was laughing.  I got up on the podium and the whole pit was smiling and two of them were crying.  In the last song me and lindsay were screaming through the whole song it was so awesome. ahh. it was so great.  we ended up making finals!! we got ninth place over all so we beat one band in finals which is fine w/ me.  We even talked to some hot drum majors during awards. shew.  the whole trip was great except watching clay and kara together.  it wouldn’t bother me, but she’s so fuckin rude and ugly.  fuck her.  bitch.  grrrrrr.  the worst part was when we got back last night and clay and kara were leaning on each other.  i was about to cry.  i hate him and i hate that ugly bitch.  that can both kiss my ass. gr. well ima go. buh bye

    Yesterday we had a band contest.  We did pretty good.  We got best percussion, 1st place in our class, and reserve grand champion.  We aslo got our distinguished rating cause we scored an 86!! yay!  I got to sit next to Clay while we watched the host band perform.  That was fun. tee hee.  We were all talkin about something.. how he wears wife beaters all the time.  Jen was like “why do you wear them so much?” he’s like “cause.. i’m a wife beater…”  Jen’s like “can mallory be ur wife that u beat?”  he’s like “nah i wouldn’t do that to her.”  then he’s like “i beat cody…” (his brother) i was like “cody hates me…” he’s like “why?” i was like “i dunno he just told me he hates me.”  and clay goes, “well, then cody’s gay.” hehehe.  um let’s see what else happened.  oh this freshman guy alex is actin weird around me.  Last night we were leavin.. he’s like “i love you, mallory..” i’m like “um.. i love u too.” and he’s like “call me. oh wait u don’t have my number.” i was like “um .. yeah>”  he’s like “okay well i’ll talk to you later bye.” twas strange.  hmmm. well ima go.  buh bye.

Dang.  Anyway, Jon had to apologize and his speech was so awesome.  Cause he’s a good person and he really didn’t mean to do anything wrong.  you can tell he really cares about the band.  So we dedicated our performance to him.  hahaha.  take that mrs. likins.  at the end of mine and lindsay’s solute we shouted jon’s name. hahahaha.  How do you like dem apples?! hahahaha.  lol anyway.  All the seniors got to go out for awards and that was sooo awesome.  Even adam who is usually too cool to do anything was excited.  We got to do an encore performance when we won.  Ever since my freshman year we have won grand champion the contest before we go to regionals.  It’s so awesome.  
   What else has happened? um.  i went to ann marie’s thursday night.  That was a lot of fun.  it was me, lizabeth, allison, and melanie. woo.  when we all got there was just sat around the kitchen table talking and drinking hot chocolate w/ my scary music cd playing in the background.  that was fun.  we played cranium.  it’s a really cool game.  then mel had to leave.. and we watched physco after she left.  it’s a pretty good movie.  lala.  I think i get on ann marie’s and allison’s nerves.  I dunno.  Everytime i state my opinion on something they always disagree w/ whatever I say or tell me i’m wrong or something like that.  I think ima just learn to keep my mouth shut around them or something.  I dunno.  I just feel really dumb around them lately.  Oh well.  well ima go.  buh bye

   What else has happened? um.  i went to ann marie’s thursday night.  That was a lot of fun.  it was me, lizabeth, allison, and melanie. woo.  when we all got there was just sat around the kitchen table talking and drinking hot chocolate w/ my scary music cd playing in the background.  that was fun.  we played cranium.  it’s a really cool game.  then mel had to leave.. and we watched physco after she left.  it’s a pretty good movie.  lala.  I think i get on ann marie’s and allison’s nerves.  I dunno.  Everytime i state my opinion on something they always disagree w/ whatever I say or tell me i’m wrong or something like that.  I think ima just learn to keep my mouth shut around them or something.  I dunno.  I just feel really dumb around them lately.  Oh well.  well ima go.  buh bye

    At band practice I was walkin by ann marie and clay came up and clay didn’t see me and he was like “i’ll talk to ann marie.” and ann marie was like “and mallory..” he’s like “oh i didn’t see you there..” and ann marie was like “yeah let’s just have a conversation over her.” and he leaned against me and pretended he didn’t notice me there and was talkin to ann marie.  I was thinkin “wooo buddy he’s touching me… and he smells really really good.”  After practice i was walking behind him and we got to the door and he stopped and just let me go in before him.  It was sweet.  i want him so bad.  ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh.
    Me and Mel are supposed to go bowling and eat out tomorrow.  Maybe we can cruise town and look for hot guys or something.  That would be fun.  I mean it’s not like i’ve got clay already or anything.  I probably won’t even get him.  i dunno.  i do need to take my time w/ him thou.  i can’t come on too strong.  I really want a real relationship w/ him.  One that will last a long time.  After this week and maybe another week I’ll hint more towards liking him.  He may not have the slightest clue right now.  Well, I think I’m going to go.  buh bye babes. 😉

    Woo!!  The band went to regionals yesterday.  We got a distinguished rating (81.95) and we were in the top 8 bands so we’re going to state semi-finals!!!  We got 6th place over all.  I think there were like 18 bands there in all.  This was just for the west region.  They’re going to put both regions together in the semi-finals.  woo!  They were announcing the distinguised ratings first and they were announcing them in performance order.  We thought Apllo went on after us and they annoucned that apollo got a distinguished rating.  So, we thought we hadn’t got one.  Turns out apollo went on BEFORE us and they announced our name and me and linds were so shocked we screwed up our salute.  It was funny thou.  Then they announced that we made it to semi-finals and me and linds both started bawlin.  Mr. G got our attention to tell us something.. and he saw that we were crying and he started to himself… then he told us to go back to the band and keep them at attention til he got there. 😀  Then Lindsay turned to me and hugged me and we were crying harder.  It was so great.  I was so scared we didn’t make it.  We didnt’ have our best performance.  There was a tempo-tear in the the closer and I thought it might be my fault and if we didn’t make semis it would be all my fault.  I was upset about it after we got done performing but i wasn’t going to let myself cry.. but then the band changed and came back to the truck and I was talkin to ann marie and clay came up and hugged her and he goes, “ann marie, why are you so perfect?  you’re like the captain of the band.”  I tried to hold it back but i burst into tears.  i didn’t mean to but i made ann marie feel bad i think.  i couldn’t help it.  she was like “half of what clay says to me doesn’t mean anything.  it’s all fake.  he just says it to say it.”  still… i guess that i’m totally invisible to him and i’m not perfect or smart enough.  oh well.. there goes that dream.  I don’t need anyone anyway.  I knew i was never good enough for him.  The only good thing is lindsay came up and made me feel better.  me and her are a lot closer this year.  i told her about how i liked clay while the band was warming up.  i asked her what I should do and she said the best thing to do is to come out and say what i feel.  she told me that back during winterline she liked nick and didn’t know if he felt the same way.  then he tried to hold her hand on the bus and he didn’t ever say anything else about it for like 4 days and then she finally asked him what was going on and they ended up together.   But i don’t think i’ll tell clay i like him.  not after i know that i’m nothing to him and i’m not perfect.  geez.  I’ll just end up getting rejected just like i do everytime!!! fuckkk!!!!!!!!!  i guess i really am nothing.  I’m not smart.. i’m not good looking.. i’m nottalented at anything.  I’m not good at anything at all.  grr. 
    Well, later that night we went to long john silvers.  that was so much fun.  cody (clay’s bro) and adam d. were behind us in line actin dumb.  cody usually tells me he hates me just to joke around. (we tell each other we hate each other before every show for good luck.  Well, he came up and i was like “i hate u, cody..” but then he goes “wait! can i have hug?!” i was like “um sure..” so i thought he was just gonna barely hug me.. but he wraps his arms around me in this HUGE hug and like smashed my body and cracked a few bones. lol.  then he picked me up and just held me there for a few seconds. lol it was fun. 
    Jen stopped by my house today.  She came to get the costume i wore to her cousin’s party last year.  It doesn’t fit me anymore cause i lost all that weight.  she was worried it won’t fit her but i think it will.  We talked for a little bit about nothing.  I’m glad she’s ok cause she almost had another panic attack last night.. well she kinda had one.. but didn’t go into full on hyperventilation.  so it’s ok.  she wants me, mel, and april to be her brides maids at her and adam’s wedding next year.  that should be cool. 
    oh yeah, friday night I went to the haunted maze w/ red cid, allison, and jacob.  that was so much fun.  the people would pop out of the maze and try to scare us and we would just be like “hi, when’s ur birthday? what’s ur name” and we’d just talk to them.  even people w/ chain saws would turn them off and start talking to us.  we had like half the people in there following us just talkin to us.  jacob kept sayin “yea we’re in band..” and someone was like “what do u play?” red cid’s liek “sax!” and one guy was like “sax players always die first.” lol.  after the maze we went to wal-mart and ate at the mcdonalds.  we talked to edric and we saw amanda h. and courtney there. then we saw hot ryan.  he talked to me.  amazingly enough he came to the contest and he wno’t talk to me when his gf is around. hmm.  i think if he didn’t have a gf i would actually have a chance w/ him.  well i think that’s all i gotta say.  ima go.  buh bye.

    A lot has happened in the past couple of days.  Friday night was the football game and senior night.  It was fun because we performed half-time in Halloween costumes.  I was a slutty angel.  Lol. well it wasn’t that slutty, but still.  Everyone kept sayin I looked like a model from victoria’s secret. lol. about 5 guys told me I was hot.  :S yeah right. okay. thanks for lying. a bunch of girls were like “ur so cute!”  ashley t. who is a total bitch was like, “you look really pretty.”  Kyla said something like, “now only u could pull that off. you look so pretty!”  psh.  ryan b. came up to me and did a double take and goes, “that’s hot.. no you’re hot.”  lol okay.  The only bad thing is i got everyone’s attention except clay’s which makes it all worth nothing to me.  oh freaking well.
    Saturday we went to state semi-finals!  I think we performed really well.  I got to pull at yellow scarf thingy out of my sleeve at the end of the show.  it was fun.  we got 11th out of 16 and a distinguished rating!  tis awesome.  if you take out all the bands from the east and have just the bands from the west we would’ve been 4th overall!!!!!  after the award ceremony me and linds were standin there no the field w/ all the other field commanders and she jumps on me to hug me and we both fell to the ground laughing.  all the fcs around us just stared.  it was funny.  before the award ceremony i had to sit by lindsay and nick.  I was like “you guys aren’t even gonna talk to me…”  nick was like “i will.” so me and him were talkin the whole time right over lindsay.  she would say a couple of things but it was mainly me and him talking. woo.  he’s a lot nicer than i ever thought.  i’ve grown to like him.  he’s great.  me and linds are also a lot closer than last year.  I think it’s mainly cause i was so jealous of her last year.  she was pretty and skinny and I was fat and ugly and now we’re even. 🙂
    On the way back home me, mel, allison, lizabeth, and ann marie just talked to mr. gossett the whole time.  He’s so awesome.  we were talkin about how mel had been takin stackers and stuff and mr. g was like “for a while i was worried about both of u..” he meant me and mel.  after we got back mel told him she was getting rid of all of her pills and he said he was glad and that she could talk to him any time she needed anything and he hugged both of us.  tomorrow is his bday and we’re having a surprise party.  we’ll have mr. huffman call him out of class then while he’s gone we’re gonna set up everything and wait til he comes back.  i’m excited. lol.  
    i think i’m goin to rebecca’s party on halloween.  i’m not sure. only if jen goes, cause if not i’ll feel weird.  christine is beca’s friend and beca was gonna set her up w/ some guy at her party or something.  maybe there will be other hot guys there cause beca knows a lot of em.  or maybe i could steal the guy from christine. lol just kiddin.  i probably could but that would be mean. 😛 haha.  well i dunno what else to write. so ima go.  buh bye

     Not too much has happened.  i went to the movies friday w/ kyle, ann marie, and allison.  That was fun.  Kyle said he misses us more now cause we had so much fun.  Then afterwards we went to ann marie’s house so mine and allison’s parents could pick us up.  allison already left and kyle was waitin til i left.  we were talkin about college and someone said something about the fast food and i was like “i heard u gain weight ur first year..” kyle’s like “yeah about 15-20 pounds.” and i was like “i wouldn’t do that.” ann marie goes “i wouldn’t care..” and kyle looked at me and goes “gaining weight isn’t the end of the world.” psh yeah ok. 😛  i think that was the first he’s seen me in forever so he might’ve been hinting at something.  hmm.  anyway.. i went shopping saturday.  i got some new jeans.  but then i got home and my parents wouldn’t shut up about how i wear tight clothes and how i always have to have hip huggers and low rise stuff.. and my dad is always complainin about my make up.  they were makin me feel like a big slut.  jeezus.  grr! what did they think i was gonna do when i lost weight? wear a fricken trash bag? :@ grrrrrrrr!!  well i think ima go. buh bye.

    It’s been one long butt day.  I got to school early and so did adam m.  so we were both in the band room alone and we just sat there and talked for like 15 minutes.  it was the first real conversation i had had w/ him since prom.  it was great.  he was even acting like he did at prom.  🙂  um what else. clay borrowed my pencil again.. which reminds me he still has it.
    um.. i had to work on a presentation for forensic chem w/ dawn and michelle.  so we weren’t done during class.. so we went to the library afterschool.  we only got the inernet for an hour at the library so we went to hardees after we got our information so we could put it all together.  dawn and michelle work there so i got free food and a drink.  at one point we were all lookin out the window and these two black guys were passin by and they kept lookin in at us.. finally the motioned for us to go outside.. but michelle shook her head and motioned for them to come in.  so they did. lol!!  It was fun.  The guys came up and they were like “how are u ladies??” then one guy was about to sit next to michelle’s purse and he goes “oh wait.. i’m black.. i’d better not sit by ur purse or u’ll think i’m tryin to steal it!”  so they were talkin to us.. and they asked if we had boyfriends.  michelle said yes.. and dawn said she was talkin to a couple of people.. i said no.  the guys were like “so are you too busy for a bf or something?” i’m like “no, guys just don’t like me” they were both like “bull crap.. i don’t see anything wrong.. i’d date u.” then they asked how old we were and i said i’d be 18 in 4 days.. and they said they wanted to see me again and throw me a party.  they asked if i was doin anything friday and i told them me and some of my friends were goin out of town to celebrate.  those guys were from chicago.  then they asked us why we were there.. and we said we were workin on a presentation on marijuana for forensic chemistry and one guy was like “whoa! ask me i know everything!!” and he really did! he told us all this stuff… different names for it and crap.  the cuter guy said he didn’t do drugs and stuff.   hehe.  i dunno.  i didn’t want to hook up w/ either one of em cause i didn’t know them.. they were only in town for a week and one guy did drugs and i don’t want somenoe who’s into that crap.  then michelle’s bf brad came in and the guys left cause they didn’t want to make him mad.  now brad.. i never liked him .. but he hadn’t seen me since about this time last year when i was fat.. and me and dawn were about to leave and brad was gettin his food… so i went up there to get a refill on my diet coke.  brad turns around and goes “why are you gettin diet?” i was like “um.. because.. i dunno..” he goes “you really don’t need it..” then walked off.  Hmmm.  well it was an interesting experience.. shew. what a long butt day.  i think ima go.  buh bye.

    Does it sometimes seem like there’s just so much going on… that’s it’s so hard just to live one day?  I don’t know what to feel or how to act anymore.  I don’t know who to love… who to like… who to trust… who to believe.  It’s all so overwhelming.  First problem… last night was so awesome… i mean w/ travis.  damn it.  i can’t stand myself for letting myself feel this way.  The whole night i was trying to remind myself i liked clay.  then i found myself repeating in my mind “travis is just my friend.. just my friend.”  but by the end of the night.. when we were in the car alone together i felt so guilty cause i was wishing something would happen.. and wishing he didn’t have a gf!!!!! *cries*
    one the clay situation.. the only person he talks to is red cid.  he talks to her all the freakin time.  so i might just give up on him since i have nothin to say compared to red. so screw him.
    another thing.. i found out why clay was talking to red cid so much.. and annah.. and it’s freakin scary.  i’m not allowed to even tell anyone else… it’s so scary… and it makes me feel so overwhelmed.. red cid told me not to tell anyone so i guess i can’t.  It just makes me see things in a different way.. i don’t know.  but clay’s wanting to leave the country… that’s all i can say.
    another thing…i think there’s something wrong w/ my dad.  they found something in his heart.  i’m not even supposed to know about it.  i was upset cause i thought he didn’t care about my bday… so my mom told me.  and she told me i wasn’t supposed to know.  i don’t know.  everything is so scary right now.  i just feel so helpless.  i can’t even think anymore.. when i start to… my mind bounces from one problem to the next… and each one i can do nothing about.  so helpless.

    A lot has happened.. well kinda.  I had a long butt conversation w/ clay the other night.  he started off by askin if i was eating right and all this stuff.  he said he was worried about me.  then he said he felt responcible because i used to like him.  then i ended up admitting i liked him again.  he sort of pulled it out of me.  he said he cared about me a lot and then he said he had strange plans w/ his life.. (i’ll explain that in a minute) and he said he dosen’t think he has a place in his life for any girl.  but then he said “if i knew i had a place for someone i’d definitely consider you.”  so anyway.  i told him i didn’t want him to act weird around me now or ignore me.  i made him promise and he goes “that’s a promise i can definitely keep.”  so we’ve still kept talkin and stuff.  today i was in forensic chemistry and i was gettin my stuff out of my backpack and someone comes up and basically throws their body weight on me, catching me offguard (of course it was clay).. i start to kinda fall backwards and he pulls me towards him and hugs me and picks me up. lol.  it was fun.  hehe.  but then mel added him to her messenger.  he started tellin her how he was worried about me and he cared about me and didn’t want to see me hurt myself.  ahh.  i’m fallin for him. someone stop me, please. 🙁  
    Anyway, about his “strange plans”.. he thinks the world is going to end.. and all this stuff so he wants to go to isreal or something.  i can’t go into depth cause he doesn’t want me to tell anyone.  but mel was talkin about some book.. left behind about this guy who knows the world is going to end so he doesn’t want to start a relationship w/ any girl.. but he ends up falling in love w/ this girl anyway.  aww.  lol.  well  think ima go.  buh bye.

(i’ll explain that in a minute) and he said he dosen’t think he has a place in his life for any girl.  but then he said “if i knew i had a place for someone i’d definitely consider you.”  so anyway.  i told him i didn’t want him to act weird around me now or ignore me.  i made him promise and he goes “that’s a promise i can definitely keep.”  so we’ve still kept talkin and stuff.  today i was in forensic chemistry and i was gettin my stuff out of my backpack and someone comes up and basically throws their body weight on me, catching me offguard (of course it was clay).. i start to kinda fall backwards and he pulls me towards him and hugs me and picks me up. lol.  it was fun.  hehe.  but then mel added him to her messenger.  he started tellin her how he was worried about me and he cared about me and didn’t want to see me hurt myself.  ahh.  i’m fallin for him. someone stop me, please. 🙁  
    Anyway, about his “strange plans”.. he thinks the world is going to end.. and all this stuff so he wants to go to isreal or something.  i can’t go into depth cause he doesn’t want me to tell anyone.  but mel was talkin about some book.. left behind about this guy who knows the world is going to end so he doesn’t want to start a relationship w/ any girl.. but he ends up falling in love w/ this girl anyway.  aww.  lol.  well  think ima go.  buh bye.

    woo!  last night was fun.  me and mel went to etown to see the cat in the hat.  we went to the mall first just to look around.  but we were walkin and this guy comes up and stops me.. he’s like “hey, girl..” i’m like “um.. hey.”  the guy wasn’t ugly but he wasn’t like super super hot either.  he asked us our names and we told him and he’s like “melanie and mallory? nu uh..”  his name was brandon.   then he asked us how old we were and he didn’t believe me when i said i was 18.. he’s like “u don’t look 18.. ur too short.” 😐 so anyway we walked around the mall and talked a little.  finally we met up w/ his friends.. it was two guys and two fat ugly girls.  they were bein bitches and lookin at as like we were hos or somthing.  they were pretty rude.  geezus.  one girl was talkin to brandon and she’s like “i’m gonna just go home cause i’m not the one that needs to get laid tonight..” i’m thinkin “bitch back up..” lol. i can’t help it if i’m better lookin that u bitch. lol.  but he had to leave to take them somewhere and he said he’d call us.  so later he called on mel’s cell and asked if we wanted to go back to his house.. and we made up and excuse like we had to go out and eat then go to the movies cause we were starvin.  he said he’s just call later.. but mel turned off her cell phone.  i dunno.. something’s a little freaky when they ask u to go back to their house.  so we went and ate at taco bell. then we went to the theater and we were driving around the parking lot and brandon was there!! walkin around lookin for us. i’m like dude.. that’s weird!!  so we avoided him.. then we went in and watched the cat in the hat!! it was freakin hilarious!! i dunno if it should really be for little kids cause it has some dirty jokes in it.  in one part the cat was usin a ho for a garden and he’s like “u dirty ho!! i love u!!” lol.  gosh.  after the movie we went and cruised the wal-mart parking lot.  we saw some dude who had been sittin there forever.  so we talked to him.. and he had been waiting for some dude… so we talked to him for a little while.  he wasn’t really hot but it was something to do.  him and mel talked about cars and i had no idea what they were talkin bout so i just let them talk.  after that we went and got milkshakes at mcdonalds. yumm.  then we went home.  that’s about it. lol.    
    Another thing i have to add… i’m feeling a little guilty… clay was tellin me how worried he was about me and all this stuff.. and i’ve lost another pound.. i’m down to 107.  :S  gosh.  i’m so confused about things w/ him.  i don’t know what to do anymore.  well, i think ima go.  buh bye.

    I thought I had screwed things up w/ clay… like i thought i had scared him off when i talked to him friday, but i guess i didn’t.  after second block he walked w/ me in the hall and we talked a little.  i just told him about havin to get a root canal.  lol.  he thought it was kinda funny.  the thing is… it’s so different now.  because i’ve kinda given up on him and everyone else.  so, instead of feeling happy when i talk to him… i’m just sad because i can’t stand it.  now that i’ve given up it just hurts to talk to him.  after school we were walkin out of the band room and he was behind me and he started singin some song.. i dunno.. he was like “I LOVE YOU!!!” or something weird.. and i turned around and he smiled and he’s like “I know i sing bad, but it’s funny..” *sigh* this is just so fitting for my life.  of course someone awesome would consider me.. but of course he decides he can’t like me because of the apocalyps… yes.  this is so my life.  but i guess i’m glad he’s still my friend… but today… it was just offical that i’ve given up for good on everyone.  i’ve had this unofficial list of qualities for the perfect guy.. and he fits every single quality… he’s perfect.  now how can i possibly move on and tell myself to love someone who dosen’t meet those standards?  how can i just “settle” for someone now? i can’t.  so that’s why i’ve stopped looking.  given up.  i’d rather be alone then w/out him.  i’d rather be alone than w/ someone who wasn’t as good.  well, i think ima go.  my tooth hurts.  buh bye.

     Woo.. i’m so lazy and i always put off writin… so i have to write a butt load to catch up.  Let’s see… Saturday me and mel went to etown.  that was fun as heck.  we went to the mall first. we both bought shirts at pac sun woo!  we were walkin in the mall and we heard someone yelling “hey! hey!” so we both turned around and it was some black dude.  he started hittin on us.  askin our numbers and if we had bfs.  he looked like a pot head.. and so did his friends so when he asked if we had bfs i was like “i kinda do and i kinda don’t”… referring to clay. so mel gave him her number. lol!  i don’t think he’s called yet.  oh well.  we went to penn station later to get something to eat.  there was some guy workin there and he was so hilarious.  and he gave us back more change than he was supposed to just for the heck of it.  while we were eatin this girl walked up to us and was like “are you friends w/ jonathan?” i’m like “who the heck is jonathan?” she started laughin and she’s like “the guy who took ur orders.. he said he was friends w/ you all!” so anyway she said that he wanted us to come in the back.  so we followed the girl back there and she lead us to the back anad out the back door to a dark alley and i was like “oh dang.. a dark alley..” and mel goes “is he going to rape us?” but the jonathan guy and smoe girl were on the roof were holding a bag of water and threw it over the side and the back exploded when it hit the ground.  mel is like “u wanted us back there to see that??!” he was like “yeah..” lol!!!  shew it was weird as heck.  after we ate we went to the movie.  we watched elf.  that’s freakin goooooooooooood. 🙂 it’s hilarious and it made me happy. lol.  seriously everyone needs to watch that… u won’t be able to stop laughing. shew.  afterwards we went to christmas in the park.. it’s where they have all these christmas light displays.  we put the radio station to one that was playin all christams songs.  they started playin feliz navidad and we blasted it and sang it really loud. woo!!!! that was fun as heck!!!!!!! 
    ok wee.. i think i updated that pretty good.  anyway.. on to today.  my dad has something wrong w/ his heart so he had to go to a hospital out of town… and i wouldn’t have had a ride home.  so i used this to my advantage.  CLAY took me home :D:D:D:D hehehehe!  it was grand.  although cody was in the car w/ us.  at first i was like “where do you all want me to sit??” cody was like “i’ll sit in the back and u can sit up front w/ clay.” lol 😛 clay’s like “yeah u should sit up front.” woo.  so i thought it was going to be kinda awkward… but it wasn’t. we all talked the whole way.  mostly about how i should be driving and how i needed to retake my drivers test.  clay was like “don’t feel bad… i failed it the first time too..”  shew.. clay is soooo sweet..  he was talkin to me the whole time.. it was great. *sigh* i was gettin out of the car… and he was like oh wait.. and he handed me his copy of finding nemo so i could borrow. as i was leaving cody was liek “i hate u mallory!” clay’s like “shut up.” lol. woooooo i want that boy. :D!  lol sorry.  i think ima go.  i might go watch finding nemo.  buh bye.

     Woo.. i’m so lazy and i always put off writin… so i have to write a butt load to catch up.  Let’s see… Saturday me and mel went to etown.  that was fun as heck.  we went to the mall first. we both bought shirts at pac sun woo!  we were walkin in the mall and we heard someone yelling “hey! hey!” so we both turned around and it was some black dude.  he started hittin on us.  askin our numbers and if we had bfs.  he looked like a pot head.. and so did his friends so when he asked if we had bfs i was like “i kinda do and i kinda don’t”… referring to clay. so mel gave him her number. lol!  i don’t think he’s called yet.  oh well.  we went to penn station later to get something to eat.  there was some guy workin there and he was so hilarious.  and he gave us back more change than he was supposed to just for the heck of it.  while we were eatin this girl walked up to us and was like “are you friends w/ jonathan?” i’m like “who the heck is jonathan?” she started laughin and she’s like “the guy who took ur orders.. he said he was friends w/ you all!” so anyway she said that he wanted us to come in the back.  so we followed the girl back there and she lead us to the back anad out the back door to a dark alley and i was like “oh dang.. a dark alley..” and mel goes “is he going to rape us?” but the jonathan guy and smoe girl were on the roof were holding a bag of water and threw it over the side and the back exploded when it hit the ground.  mel is like “u wanted us back there to see that??!” he was like “yeah..” lol!!!  shew it was weird as heck.  after we ate we went to the movie.  we watched elf.  that’s freakin goooooooooooood. 🙂 it’s hilarious and it made me happy. lol.  seriously everyone needs to watch that… u won’t be able to stop laughing. shew.  afterwards we went to christmas in the park.. it’s where they have all these christmas light displays.  we put the radio station to one that was playin all christams songs.  they started playin feliz navidad and we blasted it and sang it really loud. woo!!!! that was fun as heck!!!!!!! 
    ok wee.. i think i updated that pretty good.  anyway.. on to today.  my dad has something wrong w/ his heart so he had to go to a hospital out of town… and i wouldn’t have had a ride home.  so i used this to my advantage.  CLAY took me home :D:D:D:D hehehehe!  it was grand.  although cody was in the car w/ us.  at first i was like “where do you all want me to sit??” cody was like “i’ll sit in the back and u can sit up front w/ clay.” lol 😛 clay’s like “yeah u should sit up front.” woo.  so i thought it was going to be kinda awkward… but it wasn’t. we all talked the whole way.  mostly about how i should be driving and how i needed to retake my drivers test.  clay was like “don’t feel bad… i failed it the first time too..”  shew.. clay is soooo sweet..  he was talkin to me the whole time.. it was great. *sigh* i was gettin out of the car… and he was like oh wait.. and he handed me his copy of finding nemo so i could borrow. as i was leaving cody was liek “i hate u mallory!” clay’s like “shut up.” lol. woooooo i want that boy. :D!  lol sorry.  i think ima go.  i might go watch finding nemo.  buh bye.

    I am so sick of everyone’s lies and everyone’s made up reasons.  If Clay didn’t want to be w/ me he should’ve just said so instead of lying to me.  He should’ve told me what was wrong w/ me too instead of me trying to guess now.  How did he lie u ask? look at this:
so i hope she stays away from any reinterest in me, because i won’t take her back
lol okay
but, i’m sorry, there’s not a place for anyone with me. Trust me, you’re better off without me
I mean, if i was looking for someone, i’d definitely consider you
yeah he said that to me.  he was talkin about kara when he was sayin he would never take her back. now look at what he had to say to me tonight:
and i’m going back out with kara
 
    So, yeah.  He lied.  All he had to say was he didn’t like me.  I’m tired of everyone lying to me just so they won’t feel like they hurt my feelings.  Travis had a bday party tonight and he made up some shitty reasons why he didn’t invite me and i told him to save him breathe and stop lying because i know he didn’t mean what he was saying.  fuck him.  fuck every single person in the whole damn world.  i can’t wait to fuckin die cause my life is fuckin shitty and worthless.  i am nothing.  i have no talent, i’m not smart, i’m not beautiful, i’m nothing. i have no one to love and no one that loves me.  i hate every single person in this world.

    went over to red cid’s house last night.  that was fun as heck.  dana was there.  we all went out and rented some movies and got a pizza.  we watched old school and waited for jacob to come over.  we all sat around and talked a lot… that was fun.  then we started playin monopoly then left in the middle of the game to watch bring it on.  jacob.. unsurprisingly knew all the cheers. lol!  we went back to finish our game of monopoly… but adam m. called red cid.  he kept gettin mad at her cause we were all talkin and laughin and he kept gettin pissed and tellin her to just talk to him and to leave us alone for like 30 minutes.  she’s like “i can’t that’s rude..”  she got pissed and threw the phone at me so i talked to him.  he told me something like “i’m thinkin about u and i have my pants off.” i’m like “well okay cool…”  he said the same thing to dana and jacob. 😐  then adam was gettin pissed again so red cid had to leave the room and talk to him.  we took red’s turns for her and we were stealin all her money. lol!  she only talked to him for like 10 minutes.  apparently he told her he went over to amy’s house that night…. and told her he was in love w/ annah.  he only does that sh*t to make her jealous.  ima kick his a** one of these days.  after monopoly we went to red cid’s room.  she read us some stuff from her diary.  we watched something on funnyjunk.com called “the history of the f-word.”  it was hilarious.  after that we watched 10 things i hate about u.  i watched all of it but red cid and dana fell asleep.  then dana woke up and we put in how to lose a guy in ten days.  i fell asleep during that cause i was bored and all jacob and dana were doin was takin pictures of each other over and over.  i woke up jacob had put greece on.  that was turned up super loud while i was tryin to sleep.  when i woke up the movie was over and jacob and dana were finally asleep.  whew.  me and red cid woke up at 12:30 and jacob and dana had already left.  some of red cid’s neices and her nephew had come over. omg.  sooooo annoying!! i thought iwas gonna die.  lol.  but it was really fun overall.  i came home and nobody really cared i was here except buffy.  gee… welcomed home by a dog.  i was pissed so i fell asleep and slept til 6:30. grr.  my family pisses me off so bad. :@  well i think ima go.  buh bye.

    I got online today and i saw travis on.  lately i felt like i’ve been buggin him so i didn’t say hi.  but he said hi to me first.  he was bein all talkative and cheerful.  then he told me he broke up w/ chrystal.  he said he might need some support later and he wanted me to be there for him if he needed it.

    okay i was in a good mood.  i can’t wait to move out of this house.  because all these people do is drag me down when i’m actually happy.  i can’t wait for college, dangit.  this is no family.  my friends are more like my family.  they actually show they care about me more than anyone else.  i hate this house.

    There was a great band room war. haha.  i shall explain.  see, i’ve been going in the band room every morning before the bell rings for school to start since my freshman year.  I kinda started a trend and more and more ppl started comin in the band room too.  so now about 20-30 ppl go in there every morning.  all we do is sit in there talking, doing homework, and practicing our instuments… you know productive stuff.  it’s a lot quieter than waiting in the commons or the damn lobby.  so we were in there on monday… or tuesday… i can’t remember.  and moudider.. the cop person who’s always at our school came in and was like get out.  we’re like “why?’ he’s like “just leave.” and he stood there w/ the door open until we left.  kati and chris asked mr. huffman (the principal) why we had to leave.  he said he didn’t know ppl had been hangin out there and that ppl are only allowed on the side of the school where the commons and lobby are.  even thou ppl have been goin to the band room forever.  how can u not know ppl are over there?  anyway… we were pissed.  that day we all decided to go to the bandroom in the morning and refuse to leave… but mr. huffman talked to mr. gossett before we could take action.  so the next morning they had moudider standing in that hallway not lettin ppl go in the band room.  so the 30 of us that usually go to the bandroom went to the lobby.  usually ppl in the lobby stand in there and talk.  but we all went in there and sat down in the front of the office door.  imagine about 100 ppl in that room standing up w/ the exception of 30 ppl sittin down in front of the office.  it was hilarious.  ppl stared at us and ppl in the office were gettin pissed.  but we refused to get up.  we were protesting.  it was funny.. the bell was about to ring and adam decker’s like… “okay time to get up.” all 30 of us stood up at the same time and just stood there and everyone was starin at us like we were weird.  so today we all wore our orange band shirts and sat in front of the office again protesting.  haha it worked.  we got our band room back.  haha goes to show.. don’t mess w/ band kids, danmit.  we get pissed.

    Let’s see… um there was a game Friday.  I made lindsay conduct it cause i didn’t want to.  Travis, Michael, and Jessica came.  Jessica is so dumb.  Travis always gets up and walks w/ me when we get a break during the game… and jessica followed him this time 😐 geez girl.  lol anyway.  um i had to take my ACT saturday.  the bad thing is i had to have an id to take it… and i lost my permit .. so i was lookin for it all friday night… and my dad was mad at me.  so i took my yearbook and showed it to them so i could take the test.  then last night my dad told me I couldn’t get online til i found my permit.  sooooo i spend all day lookin for it… cleanin my room and i finally found it at 10:00 last night. yay!  
    Um, michael has been talkin to me a whole lot more lately.  He ims me as soon as i get online everytime.  he’s a lot nicer when i talk to just him and not when he’s around travis.  travis is a lot nicer w/out michael around too.  me and travis had the same testing room when we took our act saturday.  the ppl gave us a break in the middle of the test and me and travis just sat in the room while everyone else left and talked for a few minutes.  after the test we met up w/ michael and we were all standin on the top floor of the building and we were lookin out the window at the snow and travis goes “this reminds me of harry, ron, and hermione at hogwarts lookin out at the snow…” lol.  i found out michael goes to church w/ my mom.  i got online later that night and michael imed me and he was like “you should go to church tomorrow.  i’ll be there :)”  then i got online today and he was like “you didn’t go to church. :(” hehe.  he’s fun.  i’m starin to like him a whole lot more now.  well i think ima go.  mel just signed in and ima talk to her. yay.  buh bye guys.

    I guess as each day passes this pain hurts a little less.  today was the first day i didn’t think about stacey and travis constantly … and i actually laughed and smiled.. and it wasn’t fake.  🙂  there was a guys basketball game tonight.  usually the games are soooo boring but this time it was sooooooo fun.  all the band ppl were dressed and painted in orange and blue.  adam d. won the cougar crazy award cause he was so dressed up and yellin so loud.  he’s so awesome.  i think because the band was so dressed up everyone got into it more.  we lost but by only three points and it was such a close game.  shew.  we were screaming the whole time.
    I’m going to etown tomorrow w/ melanie.  i’m really excited because i deserve to get out and have some fun after this week from hell.  i was thinkin of doin something w/ kati and stacey… but i think i need some time w/ just me and mel… and some time away from stacey.  we’re goin to the mall and steak and shake (cause they have awesome butt chili and milkshakes!!) and the movies.  dunno what we’re gonna see yet.  dad says i can stay out til midnight. usually it’s 11:00pm so yay!!
    i’ve been eating like a pig lately but ya know what???! i don’t care!!  i deserve to eat because i have a nice body and i shouldn’t want to loose more weight!! i mean i can wear sizes 3- 6 so i should be happy w/ that.  i just wanna grow my hair out and stuff and be all sexy.  i can’t wait til my hair grows out again.  u can do so much more w/ longer hair.  i can’t believe that girl screwd up my hair.  but it’s growing!  i got biotin and it’s makin it grow about an inch and a half every month!! yay!!  i can tell a difference.  just a few more inches and i can wear it down again and it won’t look so nasty.  well i think ima go.  buh bye!!

    Let’s see… where do I start?  Um, I went to Murray for quad state band on thursday and we came back last night at about 7:00.  It was only 7 of us.  me, allison, jamie, chris, adam d, jimmy, and stetson.  it was okay i guess.  I’ve learned that allison may be smart but she has no common sense.  She just wants to be popular as much as anyone else and she’ll hang out w/ whoever will let her.  She is so ignorant about ppl.  anyway.
    Mr. Gossett is so awesome.  I love hanging out w/ him.  He’s so funny.  he was telling us all the bad stuff he did in college.  then he saw some dude he used to know that he hated.  this dude was fat.  mr. g is like “dang he’s so rotund!  He just looks like a big eraser!!”  it was hilarious.
    All we had was fast food all weekend and it was making me sick.  yuckkk so much fat and greese.  so on the way back home mr. g made us stop at KFC.  I didn’t eat and mr. g came up to me and was like “ur not eating?” i’m like “nah..” he’s like “are you sure?  you should eat.  you’re not gonna get sick on me, are you?” i’m like “nah i’m fine.”  then he gave me this concerned look and he’s like “well…. okay but i get worried when ppl don’t eat.”  but ya know what??!  allison didn’t eat anything either and he didnt’ say anything to her. hmm.  
    I dont’ think i enjoyed myself as much as I could’ve on this trip.  i wish mel was there.  all i could think about was stacey and travis.  it consumes me now.  keeps making me wonder how i can fix myself… or what’s so terribly wrong w/ me.  I called mel and it made me feel 2039483884 times better.  i don’t know why.  i guess cause she’s one of the few ppl i can be myself around and talk to about anything.  well ima go.  buh bye.

    Okay i was almost done typing this entry when the electricity went off :(!!!!!!  omg!! now i have to type it all over again!!!!!!!!!! AHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Okay.  Kati’s just a downright bitch lately.  I’m sick of her shit.  Just because she has a boyfriend doesn’t mean she can treat all her friends like shit and expect them all to be there for her if her and chris ever break up.  Everyone agrees.  Especially Stacey.  Everytime i say something she just gives me this look like “why the fuck are you talkin to me?”  even if i compliment her she comes off w/ some smart ass remark.  i’ll be like “i like ur shirt:)” she’ll be like “WHAT ARE U TALKING ABOUT IT’S UGLY AND I’M FAT!!!”  or i’ll be like “Kati ur hair looks so cute today.” she’ll be like “NO IT LOOKS LIKE SHIT!!”  so today in the band room i saw someone out of the corner of my eye and i thought it was annah.  it turned out to be kati and i was like “oh i thought u were annah.” which is a compliment cause annah is so cute and pretty and skinny.  she’s like “I’M NOT ANNAH SHE’S SKINNY I’M NOT BLAH BLAH BLAH” and she just kept going on.  so then i was about to cry and i just kinda mumbled something to myself i think something like “i’ll just stop talkin now.”   ann marie’s like “what?” i’m like “nothin..” so she starts in on me w/ something like “ok only tell melanie not me like usual.”  so i just sighed cause i was about to cry.  so then i was like “wow in the time span of 30 seconds i now need to cry.” she’s like “well u always ingore me when melanie is around and tell her things u don’t tell me.”  she really doesn’t have the right to say that when everytiem i say something to her she looks at me like i’ve said somethign wrong or is always correcting me or being really defensive.  then SHE ignores ME around allison cause i’m not as smart as them… geez.  so i get into algebra about to cry and then i find out i’m failing that class so im takin the test and breaking down and wiping tears from my face and shit.  i get to political science and i’m like “not going to cry…” then travis comes up and he’s like “what’s wrong?” and it makes me wanna cry more when ppl ask me that i don’t know why…. so he keeps askin me and i start to cry and he’s like “u gotta tell me… u want me to scoot ur dest over to mine and bug u til u tell me?” but i couldn’t talk.  i just kinda sat there trying to calm down.  so then andrew comes in and he’s like “WHAT’S WRONG?? ARE YOU SICK??!”  so then andrew writes me a note asking what’s wrong and i tell him.  he told me that ann marie’s a drama queen and kati’s probably pmsing.  then travis asked me what was wrong again so i wrote to him telling him what was wrong.  then he’s like “well ann marie will just need to get over it cause u and mel are best friends.  as for kati… she’s probably constantly pmsing.”  i was like “well apparenlty she’s been pmsing since she’s been going out w/ chris.” and he started laughing.  so they made me feel a little better.  kinda weird when ur guy friends are the ones that care and not ur girl friends.  well i think ima go.  buh bye.

ARE YOU SICK??!”  so then andrew writes me a note asking what’s wrong and i tell him.  he told me that ann marie’s a drama queen and kati’s probably pmsing.  then travis asked me what was wrong again so i wrote to him telling him what was wrong.  then he’s like “well ann marie will just need to get over it cause u and mel are best friends.  as for kati… she’s probably constantly pmsing.”  i was like “well apparenlty she’s been pmsing since she’s been going out w/ chris.” and he started laughing.  so they made me feel a little better.  kinda weird when ur guy friends are the ones that care and not ur girl friends.  well i think ima go.  buh bye.

Everythings so blurry, and everyones so fake
And everybodys empty, and everything is so messed up
Preoccupied without you, I cannot live at all
my whole world surrounds you, I stumbled and I crawl

I’m not gonna change, you can’t make me! woah
Chorus:
ya dont ya dont ya dont ya dont
ya dont mean anything to me
ya dont ya dont ya dont ya dont
ya dont mean anything to me
your what i never wanna be
tell me, does it feel good to be like you?
and tell me, why should i waste my time with you?
cause maybe you always bring me down
and I’m sick of being pushed around.
I’m not gonna change, you can’t make me! woah
Chorus
i know you think you know me
you dont know anything
i know you wanna help me
i dont need anything
dont tell me where to go
I dont need you  to know
ya dont ya dont ya dont ya dont
ya dont mean anything to me (x4)
your what i never wanna be
you dont mean anything to me
your what i never wanna be!

Betrayal
 
In all the years that have rushed us by I never doubted you for a minute, But now there’s a different look in your eye Of fresh seeded hate buried deep within it, A look of ice to send shivers down my spine Shaking the feeling of mutual trust away A consequence of precious lost time And the sting of false words that you shouldn’t say. 
Betrayal… 
And now I wait for your final attack The curse of your words now to impale, The clichéd phrase of a stab in the back The blood running free with betrayal The kiss on the cheek with twisted tact Reveals your final Judas, your final Judas act, Betrayal, Judas, your final Judas act. 
I used to think you were someone different From the usual scum that acquaint my soul; But all the years long I’ve mis-spent Playing a doting friend in my finest role, But even now a kind word won’t pass your lips To heal the wounds and let us start again, And I live in fear of your poisoned mind And I wonder what I’ve done to deserve so much pain. 
Betrayal… 
And now I wait for your final attack The curse of your words now to impale, The clichéd phrase of a stab in the back The blood running free with betrayal The kiss on the cheek with twisted tact Reveals your final Judas, your final Judas act, Betrayal, Judas, your final Judas act. 
I have the sickest feeling driving in my mind Begging for release to spite you back But eternal damnation is all I ever find In the state of your friendship’s present lack. I used to think it was all in my head, The jealousy you coveted for your own depression But one look in your eye and enough is said Of the truth of your insane obsession. 
Betrayal… 
And now I wait for your final attack The curse of your words now to impale, The clichéd phrase of a stab in the back The blood running free with betrayal The kiss on the cheek with twisted tact Reveals your final Judas, your final Judas act, Betrayal, Judas, your final Judas act. 
 
Turn the knife a little moreWhat are friends for after all

    I think I realize now that this is something I need to let go.  By doing this it has made me feel a lot better.  Why should i worry about something I can’t fix or something I had no control over in the first place?  I should feel no guilt because I did nothing wrong.  Travis and Stacey are both my friends and I shouldn’t feel resentful towards them.  It’s only going to hurt my relationship w/ them and what’s that going to do?  Nothing.  It’s not going to fix things, it’s not going to change things to the way I want them to be.  I may be hurt sometimes and I might feel jealous but I’m not going to let it bother me.  I’m going to let them be happy.  By accepting this it will make me happier too.  This is my senior year.  Why should I let things like this get me down?  So, the day before prom i’m going to stacey and travis and telling them that i hope they have a great time. 🙂  and i’m going to have an awesome time w/ my best pal mel and get to know lacy more cause she’s a cool chick.  love you all lots…. mal 🙂

    Wow, i dunno where to start.  so much has happened over the weekend.  it’s crazy.  well saturday was prom.  i went over to ashley’s house about 1:00 so she could do my hair and make up.  she started on my hair and ann marie came over.  mel kept callin and we kept tryin to get our plans straight.  when ash was done w/ my hair i went to leave and i walked outside and it was pourin down rain.  my mom was drivin me back home and the rain was comin down so hard we couldn’t see the road.  it was really really scary.  i got home and finished gettin ready and mel came over w/ lacy.  we couldn’t take pics cause it was rainin so hard.  after that we went to bowling green to eat at this place called the iron skillet.  it was so nice and the food was really good.  we had a hot as heck waiter.  heck yeah.  after that we went to the mall and walked around.  ppl kept stoppin us and askin us where we were from and how nice we looked in our prom dresses.  it was still pourin rain outside so we got some shopping bags from jc pennys and put them over our heads so we wouldn’t mess up our hair.  we then went back to grayson county and of course that was the longest ride ever because of the rain.  we stopped at the bowlin alley so lacy could see if some guy was there.  some assholes were standin out front and they were bein so freakin gay sayin crap like “prom’s not here it’s at the high school.”  we started drivin off and me and mel flipped them off.  we then finally got to prom.  lacy filmed some of it w/ her video camera.  prom was ok.  i saw travis and stacey and it kinda bothered me.  we were about to leave and i was standin there by our fake eifle tower (our theme was one night in paris—courtesy of mel).  mel and lacy had gone to the bathroom and i was watchin some ppl dance.  i looked over and saw stacey sittin by herself and i couldn’t see travis anywhere.  i saw someone walkin towards me out of the corner of my eye.  i turned around and it was travis.  he stopped and motioned for me to follow him.  he lead me to the dance floor and there was some fast song on.  he was like “im abuot to leave..and i was gonna slow dance w/ ya but there’s not a slow song on… so we’ll pretend this is a slow song for the next minute and a half.”  we started dancin then the song finally switched to a slow song.  he had his hands on my hips and i guess he was used to dancin w/ stacey cause he was like “dang you’re really little….” hehe.  lol that sounds kinda mean that i said he was used to dancin w/ stacey.  after we danced i found mel and lacy and we left a few minutes after that.  we cruised town a little while and lacy went back to the bowlin alley to see her guy again.  we finally got back to mel’s house.  we put in “anger management” and popped pop corn and ate some snack cake things.  mel also made maceroni and cheese which was good as heck. hehe.  we then went to sleep after the movie was over.  i was so dang tired.  the next morning we all went to etown.  lacy was still filmin us w/ her video camera.  we went to the mall for a while.  then we went to some mexican resturant.  we got our food and decided to just get one thing and pay all together cause none of us had that much money. turned out we didn’t have enough to pay for our food.. it was only by a few cents i think… but we felt so bad!  the guy said it was ok he didn’t really care.  we got back to grayson and just cruised a while.  now i’m finally up to today!!  okay i’ve been sayin lacy’s brother michael is hot forever.  lacy came up to me today and she was like “my brother wants your number and he wants to take u out on a date.”  apparently he saw me on the tape when lacy was filmin us… so he saw me actin stupid i guess. lol and now he wants to take me out. yay.  he’s so hot and sweet and it makes me happy.  i gave him my number on teh back of some free movie thing.. so he can call me and rent a movie for free. 🙂 hehehe.  he’s supposed to call sometime.  yay!  travis is goin out w/ stacey now but i’m cool w/ it.  stacey is fun. yay. well ima go. bye!

    Michael hasn’t called yet.  Mel says not to worry cause he usually waits a few days to call.  It still kinda worries me.  Oh well.  I read rebecca’s diary today from when she was going out w/ him last year.  I did it to see why they broke up.  I think it was mostly because he liked her more than she liked him.  She didn’t write much about him and when she did it wasn’t anything that great whereas now she writes constantly about her boyfriend scott.  mel says he’s really really sweet.  and of course he’s hot and a nice dresser.  always good. hehe.  well i think ima go.  let’s hope michael calls soon. bye

    Michael hasn’t called yet.  Mel says not to worry cause he usually waits a few days to call.  It still kinda worries me.  Oh well.  I read rebecca’s diary today from when she was going out w/ him last year.  I did it to see why they broke up.  I think it was mostly because he liked her more than she liked him.  She didn’t write much about him and when she did it wasn’t anything that great whereas now she writes constantly about her boyfriend scott.  mel says he’s really really sweet.  and of course he’s hot and a nice dresser.  always good. hehe.  well i think ima go.  let’s hope michael calls soon. bye

    Yay i had so much fun today!!!! Me, Lacy, and Michael went on a road trip.  We went to cave city.  first we visited their grandma and their cousin kara.  we all went to bowling green and went to the mall then fazzoli’s.  after that kara, her little girl, their grandma and her grandson left and the three of us went to some place w/ rides and stuff.  i forgot the exact name of it.  something moutain… but anyway.  we rode in these go-carts and there was this guy there about me and lacy’s age working them.  he kept hittin on me and lacy.  he helped me buckle my seat belt and kinda went out of his way to touch me and stuff.  michael was kinda gettin irritated.  then we were walkin around and we didn’t know what else to do so we went back to talk to that guy.  michael was like “is there anything to do around here?”  the guy goes “you all could come skinny dipping.”  that pissed michael off alot.  it was soooooooo funny.  after we walked off michael’s like “im gonna kick his ass.”  later we were tryin to find our way home and we were supposed to go through mammouth cave.  there were a bunch of detours so we ended up gettin lost and we kept stoppin and askin for directions but ppl kept tellin us the wrong stuff and michael and lacy kept cussing at each other.  finally we found our way.  michael made lacy drive us the rest of the way home.  some dude was ridin on lacy’s butt so she kept drvin slower and slower and he’d go to pass and she’d speed up.  she’s like “i feel like i’m talkin to myself!!!!!!” cause michael had pulled me down in his lap.  so lacy slammed on the breaks and i accidently elbowed michael in a very wrong place.  he’s like “OWWW” and he kept sayin it over and over and lacy’s like “what? i didn’t do i tthat hard!!” he’s like “u don’t wanna know what just happened…”  i told her and me and lacy couldn’t stop laughing for like 30 minutes.  omg it was so much funnnnnnnn.  well i think ima go.  night.

    Today has been one long butt day.  It was the last day of school. yay.  i came in school today and i went up to adam flener and gave him an invitation to graduation.  he took it and just looked at me and i was like “u can come if u want…” and he didn’t say anything so i went and sat down w/ tiffany, kati, jen, chris, and derrick.  a few minutes later adam came up to me and asked if he could sit down.  he goes “thanks for the invitation.  i’m glad to know i at least have one friend.”  he started telling me of how he feels so left out now since his accident.  he says that no one wants to talk to him now and he doesn’t have any of the friends that he used to.  he said it got so bad yesterday he almost tried to kill himself.  he said at the band banquet he was expecting to get recognized and no one ever said anything.  then he told me he talked to mr. gossett about it and mr. g made him feel a little better.  i told him that everybody in the band cares so much about him, they just feel like they don’t know what to say to him.  i told him he could come talk to me or call me anytime he wanted.  later that day at lunch he came and sat w/ me.  he was saying stuff like “I miss you.”  i wasn’t sure if he meant that in a friendly way or more since we went out last year.  that’s when he noticed michael’s ring.  he thought it was mine and he was like “Oh i need to order mine sometime…” i was like “oh….well this isn’t mine it’s someone else’s….”  he just looked at me for a second and was like “oh…” then we were dismissed for lunch and he’s like “well…i’ll see ya later then…” and he walked off.  i can’t believe he had felt so lonely for so long.  but ppl really do care about him.  they just didn’t know what to say.  even i didn’t know what to say for a while.
    We also had graduation practice today.  It was long and tedious.  For some reason it wore the crap out of me.  we practied first and second block.  they let us stay in the gym for third block too.  some ppl were practicing senior skits and the microphones kept squeekin and stuff so i got a headache.  last block i found mel and she gave me my senior book because she had written a whole page in it.  i started reading it and i was about to cry!!!!!!  the skits were ok.  they were actually kinda funny and some of the things just didn’t make sense.  the slide show was wayyyy tooo long and boring. goodddd. lol.  afterwards i found mel and she was crying so it made me cry.  dumb girl. lol jk. i love u mel.  michael picked me up afterwards and he looked so freakin sexy today.  i wanted to jump on him. lol.  he took me back to his house and he’s like “i’ve gotta clean the kitchen before mom gets home.”  so he started cleaning it and let’s just say it took him longer to clean it than it should have. hehehe.  he kept stoppin to kiss me.  everytime he’d be like “now i really gotta get this done…” but he wouldn’t make a move to actually do it.. he’d keep kissin me. hehehe.  sorry mel, i know u don’t wanna hear this.  lacy came home and she had had her video camera w/ her all day so we watched it.  it’s  freakin hilarious some of the stuff that’s on there.  lol.  i couldn’t stay there long because michael had to go to traffic school tonight.  it made me sad.  lol.  he’s gonna be at his grandparents house tomorrow so i told him i’d walk over there and visit him.  he’s like “aww u’d do that for me, hunnay?” lol.  well i think ima go.  i love u mel. soooooooooooooooooooooooo much!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

    Today has been one long butt day.  It was the last day of school. yay.  i came in school today and i went up to adam flener and gave him an invitation to graduation.  he took it and just looked at me and i was like “u can come if u want…” and he didn’t say anything so i went and sat down w/ tiffany, kati, jen, chris, and derrick.  a few minutes later adam came up to me and asked if he could sit down.  he goes “thanks for the invitation.  i’m glad to know i at least have one friend.”  he started telling me of how he feels so left out now since his accident.  he says that no one wants to talk to him now and he doesn’t have any of the friends that he used to.  he said it got so bad yesterday he almost tried to kill himself.  he said at the band banquet he was expecting to get recognized and no one ever said anything.  then he told me he talked to mr. gossett about it and mr. g made him feel a little better.  i told him that everybody in the band cares so much about him, they just feel like they don’t know what to say to him.  i told him he could come talk to me or call me anytime he wanted.  later that day at lunch he came and sat w/ me.  he was saying stuff like “I miss you.”  i wasn’t sure if he meant that in a friendly way or more since we went out last year.  that’s when he noticed michael’s ring.  he thought it was mine and he was like “Oh i need to order mine sometime…” i was like “oh….well this isn’t mine it’s someone else’s….”  he just looked at me for a second and was like “oh…” then we were dismissed for lunch and he’s like “well…i’ll see ya later then…” and he walked off.  i can’t believe he had felt so lonely for so long.  but ppl really do care about him.  they just didn’t know what to say.  even i didn’t know what to say for a while.
    We also had graduation practice today.  It was long and tedious.  For some reason it wore the crap out of me.  we practied first and second block.  they let us stay in the gym for third block too.  some ppl were practicing senior skits and the microphones kept squeekin and stuff so i got a headache.  last block i found mel and she gave me my senior book because she had written a whole page in it.  i started reading it and i was about to cry!!!!!!  the skits were ok.  they were actually kinda funny and some of the things just didn’t make sense.  the slide show was wayyyy tooo long and boring. goodddd. lol.  afterwards i found mel and she was crying so it made me cry.  dumb girl. lol jk. i love u mel.  michael picked me up afterwards and he looked so freakin sexy today.  i wanted to jump on him. lol.  he took me back to his house and he’s like “i’ve gotta clean the kitchen before mom gets home.”  so he started cleaning it and let’s just say it took him longer to clean it than it should have. hehehe.  he kept stoppin to kiss me.  everytime he’d be like “now i really gotta get this done…” but he wouldn’t make a move to actually do it.. he’d keep kissin me. hehehe.  sorry mel, i know u don’t wanna hear this.  lacy came home and she had had her video camera w/ her all day so we watched it.  it’s  freakin hilarious some of the stuff that’s on there.  lol.  i couldn’t stay there long because michael had to go to traffic school tonight.  it made me sad.  lol.  he’s gonna be at his grandparents house tomorrow so i told him i’d walk over there and visit him.  he’s like “aww u’d do that for me, hunnay?” lol.  well i think ima go.  i love u mel. soooooooooooooooooooooooo much!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

    I’m going to get a job and get money and move out of this house as soon as I can.  They wonder why i spend so much time w/ lacy and michael.  well, even if i was actually home for once it’s not like they’d even talk to me anyway.  when they do talk to me it’s shit that doesn’t make sense or shit that pisses me off.  what’s point of staying home and dealing w/ that when i can go hang out w/ people who actually treat me good?  even when i wasn’t going out w/ michael… i would hang out w/ melanie every once in a while.  everytime i’d come home no one would say “hey! how are you??!!”  they’d ignore me.  never even acknowledge i just walked in the door.  made me wonder if they’d even notice if i came home late.  now they’d notice.  and it’s just because i’m w/ a guy.  and when i got home my dad was slammin shit and tellin me to move out of the way.  fuck him.  fuck everyone in this damn house.  i hate them all.  how can they possibly think i’d want to stay home to shit like this?  i hate it.  i hate them.  even when i’m home during the day no one talks to me.  then when i leave they wonder why i do.  it doesn’t make sense to me at all.  u never talk to me about anything real so how can u miss me?  i hate this house.  i’m moving out.

I had a very interesting day yesterday.  Michael and i decided to go out yesterday but he said he didn’t feel like going to his house like we usually do.  Mostly because when we do go there his mom and dad make him do shit like weedeat, clean house, laundry… yes while i’m there.  Then his little sister emily is always followin us around and lacy is always mean to him for no reason. lol… i love lacy and she’s really sweet to me and one of my good friends but she’s really mean to michael.  he’ll be like “hi, lacy!!: )” and she’s be like “fuck you.” and she won’t be jokin either.  then that starts a big argument where they both yell and cuss at each other for like 15 minutes.  so anyway.  his family was actually supposed to take their new boat out on the lake yesterday and they invited me to come… but then michael called me and was like “dad says we probably won’t go cause storms are headin this way.”  so we decided to do something else.  we decided to to the movies and see Harry Potter! we got there and parked his truck, then went in and bought the tickets… we came back out cause we still had an hour and a half before the movie started.  Michael tried to start his truck… but it wouldn’t start. 😐  he kept tryin and tryin and he kept messin w/ things in the hood but it still wouldn’t start.  that’s the third time in like 3 or 4 weeks his truck has been fucked up.  he kept punchin the dashboard of the car and cussin.  then he’s like “i’m sooooo sorry.  why does this always happen to me?  i’m sorry i have to put you through this, honey!!”  he kept apologizin over and over.  i was like “it’s not ur fault!”  he recently had to go to the doctor because his throat’s been buggin him and the doctor said it was stress and he needed to calm down.  so his throat started hurtin him again.  he was like “can i just drive this piece of shit off a cliff??!!” i’m like “no… because it won’t even start!!”  it was hilarious we couldnt’ stop laughin after i said that.  so we went in and called his parents.  they weren’t home so we left a message.  i was like “i bet they went to the lake..” he’s like “i’ll be pissed.. cause they said they wouldn’t..”  so we went ahead and watched the movie… which by the way is a REALLY good movie. 🙂  everyone needs to go see it!! yay harry potter!!  we came back out… truck still wouldn’t start.  called his parents again… still no one home… left another message.  we sat in his truck for like 2 hours and then i was like “doesn’t ur dad have a cell phone?”  he looked at me.. then started beatin his head on the steering wheel.  he’s like “yes…” so we went inside and called his home first and his mom answered.  she told him his dad was on the way to pick us up.  we had to sit there for another half hour.  his dad and lacy came and we still couldn’t figure out what was wrong w/ the truck.  so they took me home and left his truck sittin there.  so yea.. i had an interesting time. 
 

i love mel and red cid.

    I’m actually going to update.  I’ve tried a few times but then i’d just stop.  um, mel called lacy.. she hasn’t called me. oh well. i guess. 🙁
    I had an awesome conversation w/ travis last night and the night before.  both nights we stayed up talking til 2:00am.  He tells me how much he likes stacey and i tell him about michael.  we were both talkin about how we would make fun of other couples and now here we are.  we’re both in love. 🙂  he was like “it’s funny how we’ve kinda evolved together.” lol.  we started playin a game of truth or dare…w/out the dare.  we asked each other things we’ve done w/ our b/f or g/f and we had to answer truthfully.  let’s just say at the end of the convo travis was like “i hope to god nothing leaves this conversation box!!” i was like “u don’t have to worry. u can’t trust me.” he’s like “yeah i know. :)”  
    I went to nashville all day yesterday.  my aunt bought a new house and we had a party celebrating her new house, and my aunt patty and linda’s bdays, and my cousins bday, and me and chris’s gradtuation.  i got lots of money!!! so im goin shoppin w/ michael tomorrow.  i mentioned that i was goin shoppin and he’s like “oh.. can i take you??!” lol. he’s so sweet.  i didn’t get to see him or talk to him all day yesterday.  so him and his family came and picked me up today to go out on their boat.  i got in the car and michael hugged me and he kept starin at me and smilin. i waslike “what?” he’s liek “i’ll tell ya later.”  so later that night when he was takin me home he was like “i didn’t realize how much i really loved u til i saw u today. i couldn’t stop smiling.  i was so happy today because of you.  i’m always 1000 times happier when i’m around you.”  yay i love him so much.  he’s the one i’ve always looked for.  i’ve always wanted a guy who was so sweet (rare thing) and he’s definitlely NOT lacking in the looks department. he’s so sexyyyy.  he has a freakin awesome body.  great dresser. well i think ima go so i don’t bore anyone. byeeeeeee. i love u red cid.

    ahh let’s see.  the day before yesterday i went to michael’s… him, lacy, and his mom got into it.  me and michael got to his house around 4 (we passed lacy on the way) and i called mel and talked to her for like 10 minutes and then me and mike decided to go get a movie.  his mom had left him a message on the marker board to clean the house. he wrote “mom, this is mike, i don’t think so :)” i was like “aww..” he was like “im just kiddin.. i’ll clean it when we get back.” so we went to wal mart, got a movie, and got food. we came back and he’s like “we’ll finish watchin this movie and i’ll clean the house. keep in mind cleaning house is just cleaning up emily’s toys.  it’s rediculus… her toys are all over the living room and it’s the only thing that makes the house messy.  so lacy came home and saw the thing michael wrote and started yellin at him at how lazy he is.  he was like “i was gonna do it.. it’s just a joke..” but she kept yellin at him.  their mom came home so lacy started cleanin up the kitchen.. i think just to make michael look bad.  lacy’s like “LOOK AT WHAT HE WROTE, MOM!!” so lacy and michael started yellin at each other.  lacy would yell something and her mom wouldn’t say anything.. michael would yell back and their mom was like “stop michael…”  i swear everytime lacy said something their mom wouldn’t say a thing…  im not sayin lacy did something bad or anything.. im not tryin to make her look bad or anything.  so then michael’s like “come on, we’re leavin.” he left and spent the night at his grandparents house.  then he spent last night there, then he came to pick me up today. we went to his house and he wasn’t gonna bring up what happened the other night. but his mom did.. she kept goin on and on.. and tehy argued for a good 10 minutes.. maybe longer.  so he went downstairs, got a bag of clothes and told her he was stayin at his grandparents house for a long time.  it just makes me mad cause his dad comes home and bitches at him for not cleanin his room.. not weedeating.. not mowing or w/e.. and doesn’t say anything to emily or lacy about their rooms.. when emily’s toys are ALL OVER the living room and lacy’s room is messy.    his mom defends lacy and emily when their dad goes off on them but doesn’t defend michael.  it kills me.  but things are ok w/ michael and lacy now. we saw her in town and she stopped and talked to us and was all nice to michael again.  she had called her mom on her cell and her mom told her about the arguement and lacy was like “im sorry :(”  she’s being really sweet to me lately. i mean, she’s always been nice but her recently she’s been nicer.  i told her i had to work and she’s like ‘aww im sorry. i wish u didn’t have to. i love you.” lol.  but i am excited cause me, her, and mel are gonna hang out friday.  it shall be fun.  well, i believe im gonna go. bye!

When you work in certain places, such as restaurants, you tend to get customers of every shape, size, color, and intelligence level. Now, if you work at pizza hut you tend to get many customers who have a very low intelligence level. Not to mention, you end up having to WORK w/ these kinds of ppl too. Answering the phones at pizza hut is one of my most hated jobs. Its amazing how pissed off ppl can get over pizza its just food. Maybe treating us like shit just makes them feel better about themselves im not completely sure. I once had a very stupid woman call in a dine- in. She would have us go ahead and make it so it would be ready by the time she got there. The woman spouted off her complicated order. When she was done, I, of course proceeded to tell her her total. She was not happy. She asked me to read back her whole order and the prices of each thing. So I did. All the while this was happening the cooks had already started to make her order. She decides to make a completely different order w/ some coupons that she had. Since I am not a manager I do not have the ability to go back into the computer and void the order. I went ahead and took her other complicated order and in the end her total ended up being more than the first time but for some reason she seemed more satisfied. I finally got of the phone w/ this stupid bitch only to find that her first order had already been made and set out for me to serve. We ended up throwing away three perfectly good large pizzas. When the woman came in w/ her family I recognized them as ppl I had known before. I had been in band w/ her son in high school and he was a complete idiot. This explained the whole incident. Another night I came into pizza hut just to see my best friend/ coworker, Lora. She had taken a call from our driver, Tituss cousin. She had specifically asked if the order was for carry out or delivery. The man replied, Carry out. Well, about an hour later the order was still sitting there. We just knew the man was going to call and complain that his order hadnt been delivered yet. Our assistant manager, Stephanie, suggested Lora go ahead and call the guy back and see if that was the case. She did as directed and of course the man was angry. He asked if he should get some kind of discount. Lora, of course, had to ask a manager and replied, uhhang on. The man rudely replied, Uh, yeah. I think youd better check. Lora then handed the phone to Stephanie. She told the man he would be getting a discount and the order would be there in ten minutes. The man still wasnt happy and replied, And if its not? she replied it will be. And if its not? the man repeated. I promise it will be there. She assured him. Stephanie then proceeded to tell Titus his cousin was a prick and to take his pizza. Titus came back 20 minutes later saying his cousin told him he was completely nice and polite to the ladies on the phone. I was also told one night that one of hour waiters was having a very busy night and he was by himself so it was hard for him to wait on anyone really good. Some ass hole got angry, apparently not able to comprehend the fact that our waiter was extremely busy I guess the fact he was running around like crazy didnt tip him off at allbut anywayhe came up to the counter. There is a plaque w/ a number written on the wall so u can call to complain. Our main office has switched so the number is actually wrong. The angry man stood up there and wrote it down. Of course we let him. 🙂And just today I had a very stupid lady call. It was 10:00 in the morning a whole hour before we even openwhich is one of my biggest pet peeves cause Im tryin to get things done so we CAN open the freakin store. The woman called wanting the number off that plaque so she could complain. I said to her, The number has been taken down because it was wrong so I dont know it anyway would u like to speak to my manager and get another number you can call? I asked politely. No, I want the number up on the wall. The old bitch said. The number isnt up there anymore, so I dont really know it I explained calmly. Click. The old bitch hung up. Maybe she thought I was lying and didnt want to give it to her but if I were lying why would I offer to let her speak to a manager to get a different number? Stupid bitch. I not only answer phones at pizza hut, but I am also a waitresswhich is where I get most of my rude customers. We have a sign at the front of the store that says, Please wait to be seated. Its in plain view, its big, perfectly readable but for some reason this simple statement seems to baffle and confuse the hell out of ppl. I once had a man walk by, glance at it, walk up the counter and ask me, The sign says wait to be seatedshould I go ahead and sit down? 😐Ive also had ppl glance at it, walk by it, and seat themselves. Now if we see ppl sitting down were going to assume theyve already been waited on or theyre simply waiting for a carryout order theyve already placed. Ppl then get enraged when they have not been waited on. They seem to assume we are psychic and know they have sat down and where they have sat down at. Just today I had a man do this very thing. He walked by the sign and sat down. Myself and another waitress were busy w/ the lunchtime/buffet rush, running back and forth like crazy, trying to get everyones orders, and seating the ppl who were actually waiting at the sign. In a rush to get one customers drink a man called me to his table. I walked over calmly as he started talking, I would just like to know, am I completely invisible? I see you all running around these other tables and no one has even waited on me. The man just happens to have sat down at the booth CLOSEST to the sign. After working at pizza hut for a good sixth months, having dealt w/ stupid ppl like him for too long, and not caring if I got fired I replied, Did you wait to be seated? The man asked rudely, How am I to know to do that? I pointed to the sign not even 1 foot away and replied, The sign says to please wait to be seated. Of course, like everyone else, this simple statement seemed to confuse this man and he was left w/ no other rude comments except to say, Well I need a menu. Yeah, ass-hole. Thats what I thought. There is one lady that comes in about 2 or 3 times a week, that is every waitresss nightmare. When seeing this woman walking towards the door we all hide or argue over who has to wait on her. She is the dreaded Mrs. Day. The woman cant leave w/out making one complaint. Usually its either about the pasta salad we have on our salad bar, about the cinnamon sticks on our buffet, or if shes ordered her usual cheese lovers personal pan w/ onions and pepperoni on top, shell find something wrong w/ it. The one time I saw her complain about our pasta salad she said it looked awful. It looked perfectly fine to me except there was only about one serving left in the bowl. It probably looked awful to her because it wasnt enough to feed her fat ass. When she complained about the pasta salad to my friend Lora, she went in the back to find our back-up of it and to find that it smelled kinda funny and was probably too old to eat. She put it out on the salad bar anyway, and Mrs. Day finished off a good two bowls of that shit. When Mrs. Day orders buffet, instead of her usual personal pan, she will always complain about the cinnamon sticks. She will always ask her waitress how long they have been sitting out there (even though fresh ones are brought out every 20 minutes) and will tell the waitress to tell the cooks to put in fresh ones. Now, when she orders her personal pan cheese lovers w/ onions and pepperonis on top the bitch will throw a complete fit if all her pepperonis arent on top. She will refuse to eat it and make the cooks remake it for her just right. This bitch also always gets a cherry pepsi w/ her meal. If the glass even comes close to being half empty she will shake it at you like youre a dog and youre supposed to come. We recently had toilet out of order in the girls bathroom. Now, we are supposed to check and clean the bathrooms at least twice a day which none of us do. One of the toilets was out of order and we stuck a sign on it that said in big letters, OUT OF ORDER! but for some reason ppl kept using it. K So, you can imagine the outcome of this stuff was just piled up to the top of that toilet. It just baffles to me think of someone seeing that sign, seeing something else already sitting in the toilet and STILL using it!!! The smell was horrific. If u even came NEAR the bathrooms the smell would gag you. When mopping the bathrooms one day, Lora even just simply stuck her mop under the door of the for fear of getting too close. All of us refused to clean that toilet out so it sat there for a good week maybe longer. Finally we got one of our drivers to fix it. I know he had to take a plunger and stir that stuff around just to get it to move. Lora and I then took febreeze and sprayed the bathroom and around that area pretty good. That was the most we were gonna do when it came to cleaning the bathrooms. And even today, Ill confess thats STILL the most Ive ever done to them. Now, on to our main manager, Teresa. Theres only one word to completely sum up this woman. Bitch. I guess you could also say Old Bitch. Or I guess you could call her the avon-selling-cucumber-obsessed-somethings-always-wrong-w/-me- I-think-Im-skinny-I-cough-on-the-food-old-bitch. Everyone morning I come in and this woman starts telling me how bad her life is. Shell tell me what horrible thing her daughters done or what the doctors think she has this time. Then, after only paying me $2.13 an hour plus tips (then getting angry if I dont make tip average once in a while) she proceeds to try to get me to buy Avon from her. Telling me how great their make up is (Which looks horrible on her) or how cheap their jewelry is, or how amazing their shampoo is! At first, Ill admit I bought some of this stuff only to be disappointed(my own fault), but now I simply refuse. The shampoos okay, but Id rather let my hair go dirty than buy more stuff from her. Then she thinks shes extremely skinny. She told me she mysteriously lost 30 pounds by not trying a few years ago. Id say Im about a healthy size 6 this woman is shorter than me and weighs more than me and claims shes a size 3. She wears pants that are wayyy too tight for her and go up the crack of her ass. This woman will also pick the busiest days to be a complete bitch. Usually its on Sunday during buffet hours when the church ppl (who are surprisingly ruder than the normal ppl I get) come in to eat lunch. There will be three waitresses running around like crazy w/out time to do much anything and shell come stand right in front of the garbage can in our way eating a piece of pizza off the buffet. Shell then proceed to tell us something we need to do that is completely unnecessary and unimportant compared to the other things were trying to get done. Its usually that the cucumbers are running low and someone needs to fill them up. Then shell get pissed if you dont do it right away, then finally go do it herself which must be horribly tragic, cause it means she actually has to do something. And when shes actually cooking and actually helping ppl she has this nasty cough that shes had forever and she refuses to cover her mouth while making pizza so be warned. Over the past week, I have become very fed up w/ this job, the stupid ass customers, and the old bitch Teresa so I have been getting my own form of revenge, and getting ppl to help me in the process. It started Saturday morning. I found the next weeks schedule and found out I was having to work 6 days a week for the third week in a row I proceeded to break down in tears which no one cared except Lora then got my brilliant idea. Be as destructive as possible. We have these plastic thingys that we put the bills on for our tables I dont know exactly what the technical term is for them, so for now they are called plastic thingys. It started w/ one plastic thingy I dont like its made different than the other plastic thingys and it doesnt hold the bill/ticket good so I took it in the delivery room, broke it into about 20 pieces, and threw the damn thing away. Lora got another plastic thingy tried to break it but failed in her attempt and ended up just sliding it under the door to never be found again. We ended up doing a number of other destructive things that day. I hid a plant in the game room, put a stack of cups in there too. Stuck several things in the ice bin, such as, crayons, coffee cups, caddies, lemonsect. Lora stuck a whole bowl in the ice bin in our dining room. I then hid a few saltshakers in a few odd places, broke a few more things, hid a jar of vinegar from the top of the salad bar behind another game. I put a few odd things in the bathroom such as coat hangers, pitchers, more shakers. Lora stuck a shaker in the register, a coat hanger in the Pepsi cooler and a number of other destructive things. Weve done so many things since then, Ive already forgotten everything weve done. I got a couple of other ppl doing destructive stuff too. Theres a sign on the counterI mean there USED to be a sign on the counter that says, Wash your hands. Sing happy birthday three times to wash your hands properly. Thats gone now. I have NO idea where 🙂 And since Im so nice and sweet no one would ever know its me doing all these destructive things. In closing, dont work at pizza hut. Too many ass-holes it sucks dont get yourself into it.

K So, you can imagine the outcome of this stuff was just piled up to the top of that toilet. It just baffles to me think of someone seeing that sign, seeing something else already sitting in the toilet and STILL using it!!! The smell was horrific. If u even came NEAR the bathrooms the smell would gag you. When mopping the bathrooms one day, Lora even just simply stuck her mop under the door of the for fear of getting too close. All of us refused to clean that toilet out so it sat there for a good week maybe longer. Finally we got one of our drivers to fix it. I know he had to take a plunger and stir that stuff around just to get it to move. Lora and I then took febreeze and sprayed the bathroom and around that area pretty good. That was the most we were gonna do when it came to cleaning the bathrooms. And even today, Ill confess thats STILL the most Ive ever done to them. Now, on to our main manager, Teresa. Theres only one word to completely sum up this woman. Bitch. I guess you could also say Old Bitch. Or I guess you could call her the avon-selling-cucumber-obsessed-somethings-always-wrong-w/-me- I-think-Im-skinny-I-cough-on-the-food-old-bitch. Everyone morning I come in and this woman starts telling me how bad her life is. Shell tell me what horrible thing her daughters done or what the doctors think she has this time. Then, after only paying me $2.13 an hour plus tips (then getting angry if I dont make tip average once in a while) she proceeds to try to get me to buy Avon from her. Telling me how great their make up is (Which looks horrible on her) or how cheap their jewelry is, or how amazing their shampoo is! At first, Ill admit I bought some of this stuff only to be disappointed(my own fault), but now I simply refuse. The shampoos okay, but Id rather let my hair go dirty than buy more stuff from her. Then she thinks shes extremely skinny. She told me she mysteriously lost 30 pounds by not trying a few years ago. Id say Im about a healthy size 6 this woman is shorter than me and weighs more than me and claims shes a size 3. She wears pants that are wayyy too tight for her and go up the crack of her ass. This woman will also pick the busiest days to be a complete bitch. Usually its on Sunday during buffet hours when the church ppl (who are surprisingly ruder than the normal ppl I get) come in to eat lunch. There will be three waitresses running around like crazy w/out time to do much anything and shell come stand right in front of the garbage can in our way eating a piece of pizza off the buffet. Shell then proceed to tell us something we need to do that is completely unnecessary and unimportant compared to the other things were trying to get done. Its usually that the cucumbers are running low and someone needs to fill them up. Then shell get pissed if you dont do it right away, then finally go do it herself which must be horribly tragic, cause it means she actually has to do something. And when shes actually cooking and actually helping ppl she has this nasty cough that shes had forever and she refuses to cover her mouth while making pizza so be warned. Over the past week, I have become very fed up w/ this job, the stupid ass customers, and the old bitch Teresa so I have been getting my own form of revenge, and getting ppl to help me in the process. It started Saturday morning. I found the next weeks schedule and found out I was having to work 6 days a week for the third week in a row I proceeded to break down in tears which no one cared except Lora then got my brilliant idea. Be as destructive as possible. We have these plastic thingys that we put the bills on for our tables I dont know exactly what the technical term is for them, so for now they are called plastic thingys. It started w/ one plastic thingy I dont like its made different than the other plastic thingys and it doesnt hold the bill/ticket good so I took it in the delivery room, broke it into about 20 pieces, and threw the damn thing away. Lora got another plastic thingy tried to break it but failed in her attempt and ended up just sliding it under the door to never be found again. We ended up doing a number of other destructive things that day. I hid a plant in the game room, put a stack of cups in there too. Stuck several things in the ice bin, such as, crayons, coffee cups, caddies, lemonsect. Lora stuck a whole bowl in the ice bin in our dining room. I then hid a few saltshakers in a few odd places, broke a few more things, hid a jar of vinegar from the top of the salad bar behind another game. I put a few odd things in the bathroom such as coat hangers, pitchers, more shakers. Lora stuck a shaker in the register, a coat hanger in the Pepsi cooler and a number of other destructive things. Weve done so many things since then, Ive already forgotten everything weve done. I got a couple of other ppl doing destructive stuff too. Theres a sign on the counterI mean there USED to be a sign on the counter that says, Wash your hands. Sing happy birthday three times to wash your hands properly. Thats gone now. I have NO idea where 🙂 And since Im so nice and sweet no one would ever know its me doing all these destructive things. In closing, dont work at pizza hut. Too many ass-holes it sucks dont get yourself into it.

Last night was my last day at pizza hut!! yay!! it’s funny cause as soon as i put my two weeks notice in everyone else was like “fuck this!” and they put theirs in too.  everyone was like “if you’re leaving then i definitely have no reason to stay!!”  so angie, lora, elizabeth, joey, and linda are all quitting.  it’s hilarious.  i am NEVER EVER gonna be a waitress again.  that was shit.  i got paid 2.13 an hour plus tips to be treated like shit all day… wasn’t worth it at all.  and some ass holes don’t even tip no matter how nice u are to them.  the only good thing that came from that place was the ppl i met.  i have some new friends now and it’s awesome.  lora and i hang out every weekend now.  i went shopping w/ her the other day and spent like 200 bucks. eeek.  lol.  went out w/ michael saturday night.  went out to eat, he got us a hotel room. he had put rosepetals everywhere and got us some red whine. it was sweet. 🙂  well, i think ima go. just had to update a little bit. byeee.

    Ugh.  I can’t breathe.  I’m not sure what exactly I have, but I know i’m sick… i have been for 3 days and it only continues to get worse.  oh well.  i had an awesome weekend.  Saturday me, lora, and her sister sara went to bowlingreen.  we went to fazolli’s first cause i had a migrane and lora thought if i ate something i’d feel better… and i did.   Then we went to the mall parkinglot.  see i read somewhere that in that mall parking lot there is a parking space w/ a oil spot in the shape of the face.  it’s rumored if u leave your car there overnight some dead guy is supposed to appear in your car cause he died there or something like that.  we drove all around that mall looking for it but we couldn’t find it.  then i had heard of this iron bridge there in bowlingreen that’s haunted.  supposedly a girl eitehr jumped or just fell and drowned.  it’s rumored if u park on the bridge, and  put your car in neutral the ghost of the girl will put u the rest of the way across.  so we found the bridge… and lora put her  car and neutral… and the car started moving!!! it went all the way to the end of the bridge and stopped right where the bridge ended.  i was like “no way… the bridge is probably slanted or something..!”  but we checked and the bridge was perfectly straight!  we were even going over huge bumps and stuff!!!  we then went to a little skating rink… we realized we were the oldest ppl there.  every single person out there was little middle school kid.  so we drove around looking for some donuts cause we were craving them.  then we drove back to caneyville and lora and sara were showing me all these haunted houses and stuff.  one of the houses they showed me was of one their great great uncle or w/e hung himself in.  he hung himself in the attic and the house is so old it dosen’t have any power… but there was a light on up in the attic   we then went to her fiance’s (brent’s) house cause his family was celebrating his bday.  he had gotten a keg and was tryin to get drunk and stuff so it wasn’t that much fun… then we were craving pizza (it was midnight) so we drove to wal mart and got some frozen pizza.  then we just went to her house and ate it and fell asleep lol.  the next day i got to hang out w/ michael and his family.  we went to some cave in bowlingreen.  i can’t remember which one… then we just went out to eat and hung out at his house the rest of the night.
still fat of course… but i got a bunch of lean pockets, soup, and non fat pudding today!! so yay!  i ate 1,300 cals today but it feels like maybe that’s too much… i dunno… i eat like a normal person and i feel like a whale.  oh well. *sighs* well i gotta go. bye~

    I wanna be tiny again.  I will be.  I’m gonna start out by just making my first goal 114… cause i remember as soon as i hit 114 everyone started freakin out sayin how skinny i was. and that won’t be too hard cause it’s less than ten pounds.  it’s not like i’ve gained 40 or something.  i think i’ll post my weight everyday.  i seem to actually have more motivation when i write it down.  i don’t know what i am right now cause i haven’t weighed myself lately… been afraid to.  oh well.  i know i’ll get back down to what i was.  i believe i can.

    I remember walking w/ one of my friends one day in gym.  We were in 7th grade.  I remember this guy walked up to me… he was a huge jerk, his name was Andy.  He walked right up to me and yelled ""YOU’RE FAT!"" and all these guys around us all burst out laughing.  I remember after that…. sitting w/ my friend and just starting at her when i knew she wasn’t looking… comparing myself to her… realizing how much bigger i was than her.  seeing how skinny she was and how huge i was.  wanting to cry but knowing i had to wait til i got home.  i couldn’t do it in front of ppl.      I remember one day after school i was waiting for my dad to pick me up.  these two guys i didn’t even know approached me.  one said ""will you go out w/ my friend?"" i was like ""no…"" they started to walk off and he goes ""see, my friend likes ugly girls…""  i remember i had softball practice that afternoon.  my dad came and picked me up and i was silent the whole car ride… on the verge of tears.  my dad knew something was wrong.  as soon as i started to get out of the car he asked me what was going on.  i just lied and said i had a fight w/ one of my friends.
I remember our softball coach was saying how tubby ppl were slow at running.  about 5 minutes later he turned around and told me how slow i was.  i put two and two together.
   I remember one day in 8th grade our science teacher put us into groups.  there was me and another overweight girl, a pretty, skinny, popular girl (her name was tyra), and two skanky guys.  I remember one of the guys was like, ""man, there are no hot girls in our group except tyra!!"" and the other one was like ""yeah, i know it sucks.""  I remember tyra just laughed and looked away.  she was always so sweet but at that moment i hated her.  i remember thinking ""yeah you can laugh.  it’s so hilarious when he’s not saying bad things about you.  I wish i was the one laughing.""
    I remember one day in 7th grade, i was in the library, sitting w/ another overweight friend, and that same andy guy.  i’m not sure how that worked out cause he usually didn’t like to be seen w/ ppl like us.  I remember he turned around and said, ""You know, you all really need to lose some weight."" I remember i always ignored ppl when they said stuff because it was all i could do.  but my friend said ""so?"" the sad thing was she normally had so much more to say… and she was at a loss for words because of his horrible comment.  Well i hope he’s fucking happy now.  I’m not fat anymore.  i did lose weight.  i fucking starved myself because of fuckers like him.  i really hope he dies.  I hope he suffers in the process because i have so many bad memories of him.  It’s because of fuckers like him that girls get eating disorders.  I hope someone fucking dumps acid all over his body… slowly.  I don’t know where he’s at or what he’s doing right now… but i hope he’s having a horrible life.  i hope he’s gained 2304982 pounds and is so fat he can’t even get up.  i want him to know how it feels.  I want someone to make fun of him so he’ll know the pain i felt! i hate that fucker.

As weird as it sounds I find dieting physically impossible now.  I have gone from one extreme to the other.  How is it that I was starving myself and now I can’t go w/out food if my life depended on it?  What is wrong w/ me?  It scares me so much.  I don’t want to be fat.  Please don’t let me get fat.  I’m so scared.  I don’t want to be that way again.  I could eat 400 cals a day and i was fine.  now i don’t even wanna know how much i eat.  i can do it. i need to start counting calories again before i get out of control.  i refuse to gain weight.  i refuse.  maybe i’ll start eating 400 cals again.  i’ve got to force myself.  i’ve got to.

~Basics~
When did you first discover Harry Potter? my dad bought me the first book cause he heard they were banned in some places   
Book first or movie first? books.
Were you hooked instantly, or did it take awhile? Actually, I started reading the first book and the first chapter kinda bored me so i put the book down for several months… then i got so bored that i was like ""hey, i’ll actually try to read this.""  so i finished it, loved it, and went out and bought the rest.
Did you instantly fall in love w/ any specific character? i love harry and ron
Favorite… 
Professor: Professor Mcgonagall is pretty cool.. so is hagrid, even though he’s not that great of a teacher.
Marauder: Sirius 🙁
Gryffindor: That one is very hard.  i’m gonna say harry, ron, hermione, and ginny.  im sorry, i can’t pick.
Slytherin: I don’t like any of the slytherins, but malfoy would be the most interesting.
Hufflepuff: hmm… do we ever hear anything about any of the hufflepuffs.  none of them have really caught my attention.
Ravenclaw: Unfortunately im going to say luna cause she’s the only one i can think of right now besides cho chang. and cho chang is a drama queen.
Character overall: the four i mentioned earlier.
How long did it take you to read…
Book 1: about a week.
Book 2: a few days… can’t remember
Book 3: maybe a week… it’s been so long ago
Book 4: a few days
Book 5: 3 days
Book 6: 3 or 4 days.
If you were in Harry Potter…
What house would you be in? I hope i’d be in gryffindor… but knowing my luck i’d get put in hufflepuff.
What would your pet be? An owl
What would your wand be? i’d want it to have a unicorn hair as the root
Who would you date? harry or ron
What would your fav. subject be? hmmm not sure. i think all of them except arithmancy (sounds too hard) and muggle studies (cause i already know about muggles…) anything would be cool cause i’d be learning magic and i wouldn’t know much about stuff like that so it’d be something new
Other
How did you feel about you know who dying? It was very sad.  also pissed me off.  i hope the mother freaker snape chokes and dies now.
What are your views on the Dark Lord? well, call me crazy but i don’t think i like him…..

Book first or movie first? books.
Were you hooked instantly, or did it take awhile? Actually, I started reading the first book and the first chapter kinda bored me so i put the book down for several months… then i got so bored that i was like ""hey, i’ll actually try to read this.""  so i finished it, loved it, and went out and bought the rest.
Did you instantly fall in love w/ any specific character? i love harry and ron
Favorite… 
Professor: Professor Mcgonagall is pretty cool.. so is hagrid, even though he’s not that great of a teacher.

Gryffindor: That one is very hard.  i’m gonna say harry, ron, hermione, and ginny.  im sorry, i can’t pick.
Slytherin: I don’t like any of the slytherins, but malfoy would be the most interesting.
Hufflepuff: hmm… do we ever hear anything about any of the hufflepuffs.  none of them have really caught my attention.
Ravenclaw: Unfortunately im going to say luna cause she’s the only one i can think of right now besides cho chang. and cho chang is a drama queen.

Book 4: a few days
Book 5: 3 days

Other

i really need to lose some weight… fast.  none of my clothes have been fitting me lately… even stuff i’ve bought recently.  im so scared.  idont’ wanna be fat again.  well i feel like i weigh 160 pounds again.. that’s all i see is fat when i look in the mirror.  sometimes i avoid looking at it.  we have two huge mirrors in my bathroom.  sometimes when i change i step away from the mirror so i can’t look at myself.  so i can’t see all the fat on my body.  im feel so disgusting.  i’m gonna try so hard to eat 400 cals a day again.  it’s the ONLY thing that works.  i don’t care what ppl say about eating healthy and working out… that doesn’t work.  i’ve never seen anyone lose a bunch of weight doing that.  the only ppl i’ve seen lose a bunch of weight are ana ppl.  so im not gonna eat much… when i wanna eat.. i’ll just keep telling myself that i have to lose weight by halloween so i can wear a really cute costume… and if i want good food i’ll tell myself there me and lora are gonna get a bunch of good food for the party and i’ll eat it then.  that’s just what i need to keep telling myself.  i don’t need to eat much until then.  i don’t deserve to. i’m too fat… too disgusting.  i hate working w/ ashley.  she’s been really nice to me surprisingly.. she was a complete bitch in high school, but she’s changed a little bit.  but she’s so skinny.. and im so jealous… it just bugs me so bad when i work w/ her. although she’s the one that told me i looked disgusting when i lost all my weight and that i needed to eat about 10 hotdogs or something like that… anyway.  i’m gonna go. buh bye.

    I was feeling bored so i thought i’d write.  my throat is killing me.  i want to rip it out.  the only time it feels okay is if i take these nyquills pills my mom got me… but then i feel extremely sleepy and can’t move.  so it’s either… can’t move… or have my throat hurt so bad i want to choke and die. lol. can u tell im slightly bored?  i hate wal mart.  it’s a little better than pizza hut, i will say that.  but i do feel kinda loney there just cause i don’t like anyone i work w/.  at pizza hut i was friends w/ everyone, i just hated the customers.  now the customers are really friendly and the workers are bitches.  i guess they’re just bitter because they are 40 and still working at wal mart… and that’s the best they are ever going to get out of life.  im gonna go to school and get an awesome job… maybe be a psychologist making tons of money and know that i had better goals for myself than those ppl ever did.  blah.
    I’m excited cause me and lora are having a halloween party.  it’s gonnna be awesome.  i got my costume in the mail yesterday.  it’s half angel half devil.  it’s so cute. i tried it on and it looks okay on me… but if i lose a little more weight it will look even better.  i’ve been losing more weight cause i’ve been sick.  i heard somewhere that when you’re sick your body automatically burns more calories for some reason.. i can’t remember way.  plus my throat has been hurting so all i can eat is ice cream.  maybe my throat hurting like a bitch is a blessing in disguise.  i’ve lost 6 pounds so far on my diet.  i’ve got 14 more pounds to go to get to my halloween goal of 114.  i hope i can do it.  i know i will.  I WILL, dangit!  i have to look good.  well i guess im gonna go before i rip out my throat.  buh bye.

    I was feeling bored so i thought i’d write.  my throat is killing me.  i want to rip it out.  the only time it feels okay is if i take these nyquills pills my mom got me… but then i feel extremely sleepy and can’t move.  so it’s either… can’t move… or have my throat hurt so bad i want to choke and die. lol. can u tell im slightly bored?  i hate wal mart.  it’s a little better than pizza hut, i will say that.  but i do feel kinda loney there just cause i don’t like anyone i work w/.  at pizza hut i was friends w/ everyone, i just hated the customers.  now the customers are really friendly and the workers are bitches.  i guess they’re just bitter because they are 40 and still working at wal mart… and that’s the best they are ever going to get out of life.  im gonna go to school and get an awesome job… maybe be a psychologist making tons of money and know that i had better goals for myself than those ppl ever did.  blah.
    I’m excited cause me and lora are having a halloween party.  it’s gonnna be awesome.  i got my costume in the mail yesterday.  it’s half angel half devil.  it’s so cute. i tried it on and it looks okay on me… but if i lose a little more weight it will look even better.  i’ve been losing more weight cause i’ve been sick.  i heard somewhere that when you’re sick your body automatically burns more calories for some reason.. i can’t remember way.  plus my throat has been hurting so all i can eat is ice cream.  maybe my throat hurting like a bitch is a blessing in disguise.  i’ve lost 6 pounds so far on my diet.  i’ve got 14 more pounds to go to get to my halloween goal of 114.  i hope i can do it.  i know i will.  I WILL, dangit!  i have to look good.  well i guess im gonna go before i rip out my throat.  buh bye.

    One of my biggest pet peeves is girls telling me how much they haven’t eaten.  I mean girls who know nothing about eating disorders being all like ""gosh i haven’t eaten anything today!"" and you know they’re trying to brag.  or maybe them saying something like ""i never really eat that much."" ""i hardly ever eat."" bullshit.  if u never ate then u wouldn’t be standing in front of me and if u were… there wouldn’t be that much to u.  i remember one day when i still worked at pizza hut me and lora ate some carrots and strawberries for lunch.  i remember linda (one of the cooks, who happens to know me and her both have issues w/ food) saying something like ""i could never eat as much as you all did just now!"" that made me feel terrible. it was fucking carrots and strawberries! it wasn’t like we were eating those fuckin monster burgers from hardees! and what right has she got to say that when she weighs WAYYYY more than either of us do?!  our manager that worked there had apparently lost like 30 pounds before… but she’s still no where near skinny.  she’s bigger than me and lora, and i get the hint she also knows we have issues w/ food too.  she used to go around talking about how little she was…saying she was a size 3…(complete bullshit.) i know what a size 3 is and it’s definitely NOT her.  if i ate she would make comments like ""are u hungry? u must be full, now!"" fuck you! and she ate ALLL fucking day long!!! i hate that bitch.  okay. i made my peace. i had to get that out. now i feel better.

    I realized there is no possible way to lose weight the ""healthy way."" not for me, anyway, because my body is so fucked up at this point.  i ate like a normal person yesterday and then proceeded to exercise my ass off. i burned 1,050 cals on my exercise bike then did a little workout i normally do. did i lose any weight? hell no. i realized to actually lose any kind of weight i have to fuckin starve to death. plain and simple. i just have to accept this.

It is 4:13am and I can’t sleep? why? because im thinking of how freakin fat i am.  how crazy is that?  im tired of seeing skinny girls all the time, im tired of resenting them for it.  im tired of shooting them evil looks when i know no one is looking.  im tired of thinking i might actually be somewhere early…until i start trying to find something to where…then i just end up gettting there the same time i usually do or even later cause i was trying to find something that fucking fit me… something that didn’t make me look as fat.  i’m fatter than ppl i used to be skinnier than.  im a horrible, fat, disgusting pig.  im tired of being nice to ppl who walk all over me.  im tired of feeling stupid.  im tired of wishing i said something back to the person who said something terrible to me.  im tired of feeling ugly.  im tired of going to bed at night saying i’ll eat nothing or very little the next day and not going through w/ it at all when i wake up.  im tired of wondering if that friend i had was ever really my friend at all at one point.  the things she said behind my back… was she saying them the whole two years we were friends?  im tired of being embarrassed by how much i eat.  i don’t even know if how much i eat is normal…or too much.  how much does a normal person eat? well obviously im eating too much… or i wouldn’t have gained over fucking 20 pounds!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  im tired of being a fat, stupid, waste of space!!!!!!!!!!!!!

    I did pretty good eating-wise today.  I ate two lean pockets (560 cals) a lean cuisine meal (280), a piece of bread (60 cals), and a small piece of ice cream cake for my dad’s bday (400?).  not the greatest, but way better than what i have been eating.  im starting the ""pre-fast"" diet tomorrow.  i was gonna start today but i didn’t get a chance to buy the food for it.  im gonna buy the stuff tomorrow.  im definitely staying on this diet.  i know i am.  i am determined.  i KNOW i can lose this weight.  i am going to, dangit.  i have to considering none of my clothes fit me anymore.  i have to wear big coats and sweatshirts here lately since nothing fits me good.  i can do this. i know i can.  im going to update my weight everyday until i get down to 114.  then i’ll see if i wanna lose anymore weight.  i know that sounds like a weird number, but when i got down to 114 before everyone was suddenly like ""omg! you’re SO skinny!""  and as conceited as it sounds, i was.  i just didn’t see it at the time.  i really did look good.  i just wanna get down to that right now and then i’ll see how i feel when i get there.  so from now on everyday im going to update and my titles of my entries will be my weight for the day.  today i weighed 131.8 when i woke up.  hopefully tomorrow i will be lighter.  im starting this diet and im gonna try to stop drinking diet cokes.  they may not have calories but water is better for me.  i’ve also heard that even if something has like less than 5 calories in it, they can leagally put ""0 calories"" on the lable.  and i’ve heard that diet coke is actually like 2 or 3 cals.  i know that’s not much but maybe it adds up after a while.  cause i drink a lot of cokes during the day.  i’m going to buy this new exercise thing i saw at best buy, so that should help me out too.  i just need to look at this in a positive way instead of getting down on myself.  that just makes things worse.  im 17 pounds from my goal right now and that’s not really that much, if u think about it.  some ppl have more weight to lose and i should consider myself lucky.. i guess.  well i should go.  buh bye.

    I’m down one pound from yesterday! yay that’s good.  im making progress so far.  ever since i’ve started this diet… this is going to sound weird… but i don’t really think about food all the time.  well… it’s only been like two days… but im never really very hungry.  and even when i am… i still don’t wanna eat.  nothing sounds good and if it does… i know i can’t eat it so it doesn’t really matter to me.  it’s so weird.  im going to lose this weight.  i want to be able to wear cute clothes again.  i now remember that they don’t make cute clothes for fat ppl.  it’s sad, but it’s true.  i was watching some thing on msn.. this model dressed up in a fat suit and had a hidden camera to see ppl’s reactions.  so stupid bitch just walked up to her out of no where and just started screaming ""you’re fat! you’re fat!"" like six times in her face… for no reason.  it was terrible.  
    oh and i noticed a trend w/ certain ppl.  ppl that i used to be friends w/ at some point…ppl back in high school.. they are all so standoffish towards me now.  all of them except stacey.  she’s the only one that when i see her she actually talks to me like we’re still friends.  everyone else just kinda says hey and tries to get away as fast as they can… even though we were all like best friends at one point.  even ppl who used to tell me everything won’t tell me ANYTHING now.  goes to show as soon as u leave high school everyone forgets u.  oh and i love always being the one to call ppl… or always the one that makes plans.  if i didn’t try i don’t think anyone else would… well except mike. 🙂 he calls me at like 10:00am every morning and wakes my ass up.
    I hate stupid fuckers who stand in line at wal mart and talk on their fucking cell phones.  that’s fucking rude.  hang up the fucking phone for one second.  some stupid fucker came through my line talking on his fucking phone… and it wasn’t even important.  it was just like ‘hey… how’s it going? oh really! that’s cool.."" he hands me a fucking $100 bill for something that’s only 30 bucks and i’ve only got 5’s and 1’s in my drawer.  so naturally i have to get a loan from accounting which only takes like a minute… and i don’t mind doing it as long as the customer is nice to me.  but this stupid fucker is talking on his cell and won’t shut up for one second.. so it’s hard to communicate w/ him.  so i basically have to shout at him i had to get a fucking loan… i don’t even know if he understood me since he wouldn’t shut his fucking mouth.  ANYWAY… i call a csm over to watch my register while i get my loan.  i leave and get it and it only took like one minute…not even that.  i get back and he’s still fucking talking but he’s making hand movements at me to hurry up.  i turned around and gave him a fucking cold look that meant ""stop motioning at me or u won’t get your fucking money at all.""  he finally stops and i thrust his money at him and motion for him to get the hell away.  as soon as he left the nice woman behind him was like ""well he was rude! it’s so fucking rude to talk on your cell phone in places like this!!""  i liked this woman. 🙂
     I have come to the conclusion that this world is going to hell fast.  it seems to me that 90% of the ppl i meat nowadays are rude.  what are they thinking?  what makes a person want to be rude… or hurt someone else’s feelings on purpose?  i remember in mr. moudry’s class we had a debate on whether ppl were born evil or good.  at the time i said they were born good because i guess i had more faith in ppl back then or someone was feeding me lies or something.  now i’m going w/ the ladder.
       I set out only to write a paragraph about my diet… but this entry turned into a whole lot more.  i think i was just holding back some stuff i needed to say.  i feel better. 🙂

846,https://www.opendiary.com/m/mnmchick2004/anorexia-13-3041957/,2006-06-23,anorexia,"
I was reading something on this site: http://www.bodycage.com/warningb4.html that i found very interesting:
The Warning Signs Before The Warning Signs
I believe that before the actual onset of an eating disorder, there are warning signs that something is not right. The thought process has altered. Disposition begins to change, not drastically, but enough for others to notice that the person they love is changing. The signs will be different for everyone, but in the hope of making others aware of this, I want to share my own story to illustrate that there can be actual warning signs prior to the development and onset of the eating disordered behaviour.
 
            When I was twelve, and in my first year of secondary school, I was taken ill with the flu. I stayed home for a few days and on my return, I was still complaining of headaches and a tiredness that I could not seem to shake. This went on for most of the year, during which I was at home sick on and off and I continued to insist to both myself and my family, that I was still unwell. 
 
            I felt lethargic and had headaches and a cough and no amount of medication seemed to eradicate these symptoms. My parents became very worried that I may have a serious medical condition that the local GP could not identify, and after yet another visit to the GP, he suggested that I be taken to see a specialist.
 
            The specialist who conducted a number of tests informed us in no uncertain terms, that he could find absolutely nothing medically wrong with me. I felt both confused and embarrassed – I felt ill and had missed a lot of school, only to be told that there was nothing wrong with me? 
 
            My headaches continued, and I felt constantly weak. On some days I would ask my mother if I could stay at home because I didn’t feel well enough to attend school. I was in sick bay at school often, sometimes my mother would be called to collect me and it was always a relief to get in the car with her and know that the rest of the day I would be at home, where I felt safe and secure. Other times, the Sister would let me lie down for a few hours and then she would insist that I return to class, which I hated to hear because I knew it meant that my mother wouldn’t be called and I wouldn’t be going home. 
 
            My grades at school were good, and I always worked and studied hard regardless of feeling ill more often than was normal for a twelve year old. Being an over-achiever and a perfectionist, I took school very seriously, and placed a major importance on academic achievement. But the fact that I had constant headaches and a cough caused me to feel that something was not right. By the time I was in year 9 at school, I was still suffering from headaches from time to time but continued to work hard at school and push myself as much as possible. By the end of year 9, I was constantly hard on myself because I felt that nothing I did was good enough. No amount of recognition at my achievements from my parents could alter my ambition to exceed my best. This personality trait also lent itself to the development of my eating disorder. It takes an enormous amount of discipline and willpower to consistently apply yourself, as it does to starve yourself. 
 
            Around this time, I began experimenting with diets and became fascinated by the nutritional value of food. At the beginning of year 10, when I was fourteen, I began to cut out certain foods, and announced that I was becoming vegetarian. I developed a keen interest in exercise over and above sports practice, and began to exercise in my bedroom at night and in the morning. Then, I decided to cut out food all together. This was the beginning of my starvation diet. From here, anorexia took over my life for the next three years. 
 
 
            An eating disorder can develop over a long period of time before the sufferer actually begins to display extreme behavioral characteristics, such as starvation, or bingeing and then purging through vomiting or laxative abuse.

 
            In my case, I believe that my headaches and anxiety stemmed from an emotional need that was not identified, even by a specialist. As my physical symptoms were not indicative that there was anything seriously medically wrong with me, I was dismissed as a hypochondriac. If the specialist had stopped to think that there must be a reason for my constant display of ill health, it may have been identified that this was actually driven by an emotional and psychological imbalance. However, as my emotional need was not addressed, but left to fester, I believe this is why I went on to develop a full-blown eating disorder.
 
 Watch the ones you love closely – if you sense that they are having trouble coping with life or struggling through from day to day, reach out to them and get to the heart of the matter. You could be saving them from enduring the destructive path of anorexia or bulimia. 
 
As i was reading this i started thinking back to when this all started w/ me.  I remember before my junior year (when it all started) i knew i was fat, and of course it bothered me, but it never bothered me REALLY bad until my junior year.  it’s almost like it hit me like a ton of bricks that i was fat and it was disgusting.  My first boyfriend had just broken up w/ me and i knew it had to be because i was disgusting and that i could never get anybody really good… why? because i was ugly and fat.  that’s when the migranes started.  i had had migranes before but in that time period right before my anorexia, i remember i had several migranes for 3 or 4 days in a row… and they hurt worse than i had ever had them before.  and it wasn’t a month later that my anorexia developed.  anyway, i just found this very interesting, thought i’d let u all read it and see what ya thought.  gotta go.  buh bye.

I was reading something on this site: http://www.bodycage.com/warningb4.html that i found very interesting:
The Warning Signs Before The Warning Signs
I believe that before the actual onset of an eating disorder, there are warning signs that something is not right. The thought process has altered. Disposition begins to change, not drastically, but enough for others to notice that the person they love is changing. The signs will be different for everyone, but in the hope of making others aware of this, I want to share my own story to illustrate that there can be actual warning signs prior to the development and onset of the eating disordered behaviour.
 
            When I was twelve, and in my first year of secondary school, I was taken ill with the flu. I stayed home for a few days and on my return, I was still complaining of headaches and a tiredness that I could not seem to shake. This went on for most of the year, during which I was at home sick on and off and I continued to insist to both myself and my family, that I was still unwell. 
 
            I felt lethargic and had headaches and a cough and no amount of medication seemed to eradicate these symptoms. My parents became very worried that I may have a serious medical condition that the local GP could not identify, and after yet another visit to the GP, he suggested that I be taken to see a specialist.
 
            The specialist who conducted a number of tests informed us in no uncertain terms, that he could find absolutely nothing medically wrong with me. I felt both confused and embarrassed – I felt ill and had missed a lot of school, only to be told that there was nothing wrong with me? 
 
            My headaches continued, and I felt constantly weak. On some days I would ask my mother if I could stay at home because I didn’t feel well enough to attend school. I was in sick bay at school often, sometimes my mother would be called to collect me and it was always a relief to get in the car with her and know that the rest of the day I would be at home, where I felt safe and secure. Other times, the Sister would let me lie down for a few hours and then she would insist that I return to class, which I hated to hear because I knew it meant that my mother wouldn’t be called and I wouldn’t be going home. 
 
            My grades at school were good, and I always worked and studied hard regardless of feeling ill more often than was normal for a twelve year old. Being an over-achiever and a perfectionist, I took school very seriously, and placed a major importance on academic achievement. But the fact that I had constant headaches and a cough caused me to feel that something was not right. By the time I was in year 9 at school, I was still suffering from headaches from time to time but continued to work hard at school and push myself as much as possible. By the end of year 9, I was constantly hard on myself because I felt that nothing I did was good enough. No amount of recognition at my achievements from my parents could alter my ambition to exceed my best. This personality trait also lent itself to the development of my eating disorder. It takes an enormous amount of discipline and willpower to consistently apply yourself, as it does to starve yourself. 
 
            Around this time, I began experimenting with diets and became fascinated by the nutritional value of food. At the beginning of year 10, when I was fourteen, I began to cut out certain foods, and announced that I was becoming vegetarian. I developed a keen interest in exercise over and above sports practice, and began to exercise in my bedroom at night and in the morning. Then, I decided to cut out food all together. This was the beginning of my starvation diet. From here, anorexia took over my life for the next three years. 
 
 
            An eating disorder can develop over a long period of time before the sufferer actually begins to display extreme behavioral characteristics, such as starvation, or bingeing and then purging through vomiting or laxative abuse.

 
            In my case, I believe that my headaches and anxiety stemmed from an emotional need that was not identified, even by a specialist. As my physical symptoms were not indicative that there was anything seriously medically wrong with me, I was dismissed as a hypochondriac. If the specialist had stopped to think that there must be a reason for my constant display of ill health, it may have been identified that this was actually driven by an emotional and psychological imbalance. However, as my emotional need was not addressed, but left to fester, I believe this is why I went on to develop a full-blown eating disorder.
 
 Watch the ones you love closely – if you sense that they are having trouble coping with life or struggling through from day to day, reach out to them and get to the heart of the matter. You could be saving them from enduring the destructive path of anorexia or bulimia. 
 
As i was reading this i started thinking back to when this all started w/ me.  I remember before my junior year (when it all started) i knew i was fat, and of course it bothered me, but it never bothered me REALLY bad until my junior year.  it’s almost like it hit me like a ton of bricks that i was fat and it was disgusting.  My first boyfriend had just broken up w/ me and i knew it had to be because i was disgusting and that i could never get anybody really good… why? because i was ugly and fat.  that’s when the migranes started.  i had had migranes before but in that time period right before my anorexia, i remember i had several migranes for 3 or 4 days in a row… and they hurt worse than i had ever had them before.  and it wasn’t a month later that my anorexia developed.  anyway, i just found this very interesting, thought i’d let u all read it and see what ya thought.  gotta go.  buh bye.

Well since michael has been gone to the military I’ve easily lost 6 pounds.  That’s right.  Easily.  For the first time in forever it seems easy again.  I’m not exactly sure why either.  Well, I think it’s because I’m mostly to myself all day long and i get to relax, exercise, sleep as much as i want and only eat once a day.  I’m not gonna get a job until next month.  I’m trying to take this month for myself.  I’m trying to relax after all the chaos, i’m trying to cope w/ losing my dad… trying to cope w/ being w/out michael for a while… trying to get back to myself.  I think im gonna be okay.  I don’t like mike being gone but it’s a chance for me to change… for the better.  I need to figure out what i need to do w/ my life.  of course it’s w/ him, i just mean that i don’t know where i’m going right now.  i don’t know what career i’m going towards… or what i should do whlie im in school.  I’m taking this time to lose some weight and change my look and style also.  I’m really starting to miss my dad more and more.  Don’t they say it gets better w/ time?  Then why does it seem to be getting worse?  Why is it everytime something bad happens I automatically think ""I wish my dad were here.  he would know what to do.  things would be so much better if he were here.""  During the day I keep getting these images that flash through my mind of him being sick.  I keep picturing him in the hospital, him being sick at home.  There were nights he couldn’t even go 15 minutes w/out throwing up.  Those were the nights my mom had to take him to the hospital at 2 or 3 in the morning.  it’s not fair.  why does someone like him have to be taken away from this world?  There are so many other ppl that are so evil and such assholes, but they don’t have to go through what he did.  I’m not wishing a disease like cancer on anyone… but if it had to happen to someone why did it have to happen to such a good person?  I’m supposed to have faith and know he’s in a better place.  before he died he told me he’d still be around in some other way.  what did i expect?  i keep expecting to turn a corner in our house and perhaps catch a glimps of him in a the form of a spirit.  does that seem stupid?  i’ve always kinda believed in ghosts so i guess i almost hoped if i ever saw a ghost i wanted it to be him.  I thought maybe I might get to see him again but it’s been over two months and i haven’t experienced anything like that.  how do i know if he’s still around or still here?  ppl say you have to listen and pay attention to messages God may send us or ppl that have passed… but to tell you the truth I’ve never been very good at puzzles and figuring out hints.  so if someone wanted to tell me something from beyond it would have to be in big flashing letters because i’m not good at that kind of stuff.  The only thing i’ve experienced is nightmares almost every night of him still being sick.  I think i might be going crazy.
This song seems appropriate for right now:
What Hurts The Most 
I can take the rain on the roof of this empty houseThat don’t bother meI can take a few tears now and then and just let them outI’m not afraid to cry every once in a whileEven though going on with you gone still upsets meThere are days every now and again I pretend I’m okBut that’s not what gets me
What hurts the mostWas being so closeAnd having so much to sayAnd watching you walk awayAnd never knowingWhat could have beenAnd not seeing that loving youIs what I was tryin’ to do
It’s hard to deal with the pain of losing you everywhere I goBut I’m doin’ ItIt’s hard to force that smile when I see our old friends and I’m aloneStill HarderGetting up, getting dressed, livin’ with this regretBut I know if I could do it overI would trade give away all the words that I saved in my heartThat I left unspoken
What hurts the mostIs being so closeAnd having so much to sayAnd watching you walk awayAnd never knowingWhat could have beenAnd not seeing that loving youIs what I was trying to do
What hurts the mostIs being so closeAnd having so much to sayAnd watching you walk awayAnd never knowingWhat could have beenAnd not seeing that loving youIs what I was trying to do
Not seeing that loving youThat’s what I was trying to doOoohhh….

    I just wish more than anything these feelings would go away.  I don’t know how to deal w/ this sometimes.  Sometimes it doesn’t seem real that my dad is gone… other times it’s too fucking real to bear and I don’t know how to deal w/ it.  I don’t know what else to do but to cry and cry and I never want to stop.  Here is an update on what has happened lately.
    At the beginning of October Mike left to go to the military.  My mom had already left to live in nashville.  So, my brother and I had the house to ourselves for two months.  That was awesome… cause I just got to hang out w/ my brother and candiance a lot those two months.  Candiace (my brother’s ex-girlfriend who cheated on him like 10 years ago) has been cheating on her husband Brandon w/ my brother.  She would sneak over to our house when her husband was out and we’d all hang out and have fun.  Mike came back at the end of november on medical leave from the military, so it was me, mike, and adam living in the house.  It was gonna be that way until we got enough money to move out.  Well, it turns out that Brandon overheard a conversation my brother and Candiance were having on the phone one day and found out she’s cheating on him.  Candiance took her little boy and moved her shit in our house.  There’s this fucking dike chick that follows candiance around that always just invites herself over and when candiance and my brother aren’t paying attention to her, she goes and gets on MY computer that MY dad gave me w/out even asking.  She’s fucking rude and fucking stupid.   So Mike and I went to Mt. Washington and had to live w/ his parents, and his two sisters for a month until we got money to move out.  I work at subway (which actually isn’t that bad) now and we’ve got an apartment of our own here in Mt. Washington.  
I just miss so many things.  So many things are so different.  I’m like my dad… I don’t like change.
I miss my house.
I miss my brother.
I miss my mom.
I miss my dog, Buffy.
I miss friends, which I don’t seem to have anymore.
I miss hanging out w/ ppl…i miss having ppl WANT to hang out w/ me.
I miss my dog, Roscoe.
I miss my uncle Gary.
I miss being a little girl… in my house w/ my mom, my dad, my brother, and not having any worries.  just playing w/ my toys all day.
Most of all… I miss my dad.
In bad times, I tend to think of him more.  I start thinking, ""if only dad were here, he’d know what to do.""  or things would be so much better, so much easier, if he were just here to tell me what to do, to tell me how to deal.
I told my brother about my eating crap.  He said he already knew.  I think I have fucked up my body so bad.  I lost another 15 pounds in the past two months.  Now I’m starting to gain weight again.  I always lose a bunch for a while, then gain, then lose, then gain… something tells me this probably isn’t a good thing.  I’m probably doing some serious damage to my body.  One minute I’m starving, the next I’m binging.  There is NO in between w/ me.  Not anymore.
My mom is fixing up the house.  She went through my stuff and she told me ""we gave away all you size 3’s and 4’s because we know you can’t fit into those anymore…""  Thanks so FUCKING much.  When she says WE she means her and my aunt from nashville.  My family in nashville is so focused on my cousin chris and his singing career that they don’t care about anyone else.  When i first lost weight my dad was exicted to take me to nashville that year because he thought maybe they’d notice someone besides chris.  they didn’t say a damn word to me.  That fucking fag danced some little inappropriate gay dance at my dad’s funeral that was so fucking completely embarrassing.  The thing that pissed me off the most was my dad didn’t like that kid and he was up there dancing and SMILING his ass off in front of my dad’s coffin.  Afterwards, mike and i were talking to my aunt and uncle… mike said somethig about being active, that’s how he keeps weight off.  my uncle said, ""well maybe if you can get mallory to keep up w/ you, she could lose so weight.""  FUCK YOU!!!!!!!  FIne. I’ll fucking starve again!!!!!!!  IS THAT WHAT YOU FUCKING WANT?  my mom always makes little comments reminding me i’m not as small as i used to be.  I WANT TO STARVE TIL I’M 80 POUNDS.  I WANT TO DIE.  I WANT TO SEE MY DAD.  
Even though i still have mike… i’ve never felt this lonely before.  i thought i had lacy, but i’m pretty sure she only needs me when she needs a ride or something… or when she’s completely bored off her ass.  I have no one else.  I need my dad back.  Please…

LOVE this song. This is for my ex and anyone else’s that they feel deserve it
 
From All American Rejects, The’s new album,
When the World Comes Down)
I wake up every evening
With a big smile on my face
And it never feels out of place
And you’re still probably working
At a nine to five pace
I wonder how bad that taste
When you see my face 
Hope it Gives You Hell
Hope it gives you hell
When you walk my way
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell
Now where’s you picket fence love
And where’s that shiny car
And did it ever get you far
You never seemed so tense love
I’ve never seen you fall so hard
Do you know where you are
And the truth be told I miss you
And truth be told I’m lying
When you see my face 
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell
When you walk my way
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell
If you find a man that’s worth a damn and treats you well
Then he’s a fool you’re just as well
Hope it gives you hell
Tomorrow you’ll be thinking to yourself
Where’d it all go wrong?
But the list goes on and on
The truth be told I miss you
And truth be told I’m lying
When you see my face hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell
When you walk my way
Hope it gives you hell

Hope it gives you hell
If you find a man that’s worth a damn and treats you well
Then he’s a fool, you’re just as well
Hope it gives you hell
Now you’ll never see
What you’ve done to me
You can take back your memories
They’re no good to me
And here’s all your lies
You can look me in the eyes
With the sad, sad look
That you wear so well
When you see my face 
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell
When you walk my way
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell
If you find a man that’s worth a damn and treats you well
Then he’s a fool you’re just as well
Hope it gives you hell

Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell

Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell

And never tell
Then you’re the fool
I’m just as well
Hope it gives you hell
When you hear this song 
I hope that it will give you hell
You can sing along 
I hope that it puts you through hell

For Lacy, her mother, and mike
Song by Eminem
I don’t understand,
Why are you being so mean?(mean)
You’re a mean mean man(man)
[Chorus]
You are just jealous of me
Cuz you, you just can’t do what I do
So instead of just admitting it
You walk around and say
All kinds of really mean things
About me cuz you’re a meanie, a meanie
But it’s only cuz you’re
Just really jealous of me
Cuz I’m what you want to be
So you just look like an idiot
When you say these mean things
Cuz it’s too easy to see
You’re just a really big weenie, big weenie
[Verse 1]
Alright listen, I need you to focus
I need you to go dig deep in your mind, this is important
We are going to perform an experiment of some sorts
I’m going to have to ask you to bear with me for a moment
Now I need you to open your mind; your eyes close them (close them)
You are now about to be placed under my hypnosis (nosis)
For the next four and a half minutes
We are going to explore into your mind
To find out why you’re so fuckin’ jealous
Now why did they make Yoo-Hoo?
Giggety ga-ga goo-goo.
Psych, I’m kidding
I just wanted to see if you’re still listenin’
Ok, now I need your undivided attention
Sir I have a question
Why do I always sense this undeniable tension
From the moment that I enter into the room?
It gets all quiet and whispers
Whenever theres conversation, why am I always mentioned?
I’ve been dying to ask, it’s been itchin’ at me
Is it just because
[Chorus]
You are just jealous of me
Cuz you, you just can’t do what I do
So instead of just admitting it
You walk around and say
All kinds of really mean things
About me cuz you’re a big meanie, a weenie
But it’s only cuz you’re
Just really jealous of me
Cuz I’m what you want to be
So you just look like an idiot
When you say these mean things
Cuz it’s too easy to see
You’re really just a big weenie, big weenie
[Verse 2]
Alright now…aww shit I, I just fucked a line
I was going to say something extremely important
But I forgot who or what what it was, I fucked up
Psych, I’m kidding again you idiot, no I didn’t
That’s just what you wanted to hear from me
Is that I fucked up ain’t, it?
But I can bust one take without lookin’ at no paper
It doesn’t take a bunch of takes
For me to stand here in this booth all day
For me to say the truth, ok?
You’re droolin, you have tooth decay
Your mouth is open, you’re disgusting
What the fuck you eat for lunch
A bunch of sweets or something, what?
You munch a bunch of Crunch ‘N Munch?
Your tooth is rotten to the gum
Your breath stinks, wanna chew some gum?
Yes I do sir, what am I on?
You sir are on truth syrum
Marshall I’m so jealous of you
Please say you won’t tell nobody
I’d be so embarrassed, I’m just absolutely terrified
That someone’s gonna find out why I’m saying
All these terrible, evil and awful mean things
It’s my own insecurity!
[Chorus]
You are just jealous of me
Cuz you, you just can’t do what I do
So instead of just admitting it
You walk around and say
All kinds of really mean things
About me cuz you’re a meanie, a meanie
But it’s only cuz you’re
Just really jealous of me
Cuz I’m what you want to be
So you just look like an idiot
When you say these mean things
Cuz it’s too easy to see
You’re just a really big weenie, big weenie
[Verse 3]
Alright now we, we’re going to conduct
That experiment that we were talking about earlier
Just to see what a frog looks like when it takes two hits of ecstasy
Cuz that’s exactly what your eyes look like, want to check to see?
Here’s a mirror, notice the resemblence here?
Wait, let me put these sun glasses on
Now look in this mirror, how about now?
What do you have in common?
You’re both green with envy and look like idiots with sunglasses on ’em
You look like I sound like singing about weenies
Now take my weenie out of your mouth
This is between me and you, I know you’re not happy
I know you’d much rather see me lying in the corner of a room somewhere crying
Curled up in a ball tweeked out of my mind dying
There is no denying that my weenie is much bigger than yours is
Mine is like sticking a banana between two oranges
Why you even doing this to yourself, it’s pointless
Why do we have to keep on going through this, this is torturous
My point is this
That if you say mean things, weenie will shrink
Now I forgot what the chorus is, your just is…
[Chorus]
You are just jealous of me
Cuz you, you just can’t do what I do
So instead of just admitting it
You walk around and say
All kinds of really mean things
About me cuz you’re a meanie, a meanie
But it’s only cuz you’re
Just really jealous of me
Cuz I’m what you want to be
So you just look like an idiot
When you say these mean things

    All I ate yesterday was a turky sandwhich and a small chicken wrap. I excersied on this step climber thingy and lifted weight, did push-ups and sit-ups… and what happened? I fucking gained weight. How the fuck is that fair???!!!!!  As soon as the number popped up on the scale I started bawling.  It’s so frustrating, you have no idea.  I’m so sick of being fat and I tried so hard and starved and that’s what I get…I fucking gain weight.  There are girls at work that are soooo skinny and I see them eating bacon, ice cream, cake, chips, fast food for lunch every single day and they don’t gain a pound.  I asked one of them if she worked out and she said no… That’s not fucking fair at all. People like that get to eat whatever they want and not excercise at all and get to be skinny and beautiful and here I am starving and working my ass off and I get to be a big fat fucking cow!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I just want to cry. I’m so sad.

   Okay, I need to lose at least 20-30 pounds before Halloween.  I’d like to at least be 135 by October. It’s my favorite month and I really want to be able to wear cute fall clothes and feel good.  So if I’m 135 I’ll be able to fit in my good jeans again and wear cute sweaters and I think I can lose a few more pounds before Halloween to look hot in my costume.  Sometimes I don’t want to go out to stores or resturants because I’m afraid I’m going to see my ex or his sister or mom and they are going to see how much weight I’ve gained. If I was at my old weight or even lower and looked hot it wouldn’t matter as much to me.  What can they say? You’re a whore? You’re  a slut?  Oh well.. at least i’m not hugely fat like them.  The mom is like morbidly obese.  Lacy is as big as a house and she would always give me her old clothes because she couldn’t fit in them. I’m going to lose 2 pounds a week. That’s not that hard.  I think I can really do it this time.  I need to stop making excuses because I know I can do it… I’ve lose 50 poudns before why can’t I do it again?  I just feel miserable and fat and unhealthy at 152.  I was up to 158.  It’s time to make some changes and stop making excuses. I have to lose this weight. I WILL lose this weight, this time for good.

Lowest ever- 108

   Exact same as yesterday.  I ate a lean cuisine for lunch, some chicken alfredo, small salad, piece of bread for dinner.  Guess I ate a lot for dinner. Heaven forbid I should eat like a normal person. Today—- no lunch, lean cuisine for dinner. That’s it.  That’s the only way  I know how to lose weight—starve.  It’s the only thing that’s EVER worked for me. I’ve tried healthy eating, exercising….none of it works unless you starve and that’s a fact.  when I lose this weight I’m going to get dressed up, look hot and I""m going to kettle creek w/ my boyfriend where  lacy and her mom go a lot so they can see how hot I am and how fat they are.  They will be so jealous.  I can’t fucking wait.

     Yesterday I ate a lean cuisine for lunch, a small bowl of leftover chicken fettichini and a brownie and a half.  Only lost .02 pounds but that’s better than nothing.  Nothing much to say  today.  Just tired of being fat and not being cute.  I was going to the tanning bed but the one I was going to was auctioned off!!!!  I loved it because nobody was ever in there and I didn’t have to wait for a bed… which I guess explains why they were auctioned off.  Now I have to go to the ONLY other one in town that is always busy and I have to wait for a bed. It sucks, I hate it.  But if I don’t go, I’ll be pale…so.. I don’t know.  So far, I’ve only eaten a lean pocket and like 5 bites of salad w/out dressing.  I’m only gonna eat another lean pcket tonight and that’s it.  That will be only about 640 calories. 🙂  Tomorrow I won’t eat anything for lunch, I’ll just work out during lunch time and I’ll only eat a lean pocket for dinner, that will only be 280 calories. yay! 🙂 I’m really hoping to be 149 by the end of the week!!! Let’s cross our fingers!

   Still the same.  Yesterday  I ate a lean pocket for lunch—270 cals.  I ate another lean pocket for dinner 270 cals and one brownie… I don’t know how much the brownie was…? 400?? so that would be…940 calories. No wonder  I didn’t really lose any weight.  So at lunch I excercised and I only ate a piece of bread—70 calories.  I heard whole wheats make you feel full, that’s why I ate the bread.  I got a text from my friend Lora that lives in Florida saying she’s going to be coming to town on august 6th… I don’t want her to see me like this so I’ve got to lose this weight fast.  I look horrible.  Right now I don’t feel good at all. I’m so weak and tired.  I’m trying to remember how I got thru this last time. I guess I just didn’t care that I was hungry, I just didn’t want to be fat anymore.  I’m just trying to drink a lot of water to stay full. I don’t know how I’ll get my energy.  I can’t take the stackers that I have because they give me migranes and make me feel depressed.  I want to lose weight so I’ll look good on Halloween too.  I’m getting this slutty gangster outfit… yes i’ve already planned what I’m wearing because I’m having a party this year.  I’m realy excited, I LOVE Halloween.  I should’ve taken care of this weight issue several months ago so I wouldn’t be starving now.. so I deserve to feel this way..  I deserve to be weak and feel crappy from starving.  My goal is to be 149 by sunday morning. Hope it works out that way.

I hurt myself today 
To see if I still feel 
I focus on the pain 
The only thing that’s real 
The needle tears a hole 
The old familiar sting 
Try to kill it all away 
But I remember everything 
What have I become 
My sweetest friend 
Everyone I know 
goes away 
In the end 
And you could have it all 
My empire of dirt 
I will let you down 
I will make you hurt 
I wear this crown of thorns 
Upon my liar’s chair 
Full of broken thoughts 
I cannot repair 
Beneath the stains of time 
The feelings disappear 
You are someone else 
I am still right here 
What have I become 
My sweetest friend 
Everyone I know 
goes away 
In the end 
And you could have it all 
My empire of dirt 
I will let you down 
I will make you hurt 
If I could start again 
A million miles away 
I would keep myself 
I would find a way

I just realized…I’ve had this diary for 10 years.  I can’t believe that. It started the summer after my eigth grade year, I was like 14 I  think, I used to stay up til like 5am every night so I had plenty of time to play around. My brother said a good site to go to is bored.com so I went there and was scrolling through the sites and found open diary. I started the diary and didn’t even really think I’d make more than 10 entries. So weird. Now I’m 24 years old still.. now I def don’t write in it all the time, but I still come back and read other diaries and make the occasional entry. Anyway, there’s my thought for the day. Happy Thanksgiving.

    I feel like I will never feel better.  Ever.  Even in my attempts to make myself better or to feel better do not work.  There is always some reason to feel like shit.  The smallest things now set me off.  I even know I am being sensitive, yet these things still upset me.  I wish there was a day I could wake up and not feel sad or hopeless.  Or feel that facing the day is simply an obstacle I have to get through until I can simply go to sleep again.  I over analyze things people say even more than I ever did and take everything to heart.  What is wrong with me?  I’m taking my anti-depressants, and I thought I was feeling better, but now, I don’t think I am.  My life is so fucked up.  Not in the sense that it really is…but the way I look at it is.  What would be the difference in dying and living the way that I do now?  I don’t see much difference.   I simply exist, I don’t live.  I am here, but no more than that.  I feel dead inside.  I hardly feel any good feelings, and when I do, I feel like I don’t deserve them, or I feel that this feeling cannot last long because something is going to come along and make me sad again.  And it does…that thing is me.  I make me sad, and I can’t stop it.  What’s wrong with me?  Why must I have to feel like this every day of my life?  Is this what I deserve?  Did I do something terrible in a past life to deserve this never ending feeling?
 
-""I Killed someone, you see.  I killed the girl that used to be me.""
 
– Depression is feeling like you’ve lost something, but have no clue when or where you last had it.  Then, one day, you realize what you lost was yourself.
 
-People think depression is sadness.  People think depression is crying.  People think depression is dressing in black.  But people are wrong.  Depression is the constant feeling of being numb.  Being numb to emotions, being numb to life.  You wake up in the morning just to go back to bed again.  Days aren’t really days; they are just annoying obstacles that need to be faced.  And how do you face them?  Through medication, though drinking, through smoking, through drugs, through cutting.  When you’re depressed, you grasp onto anything that can get you through the day.  That’s what depression is, not sadness or tears, but the overwhelming sense of numbness and the desire for anything that can help you make it from one day to the next.
 
-""Depression is the most unpleasant thing I have ever experienced.  It is that absence of being able to envisage that you will ever be cheerful again.  The absence of hope, that very deadened, that is so very different from feeling sad.  Sad hurts, but it’s a healthy feeling.  It is a necessary thing to feel.  Depression is very different.""- JK Rowling

    I feel like I will never feel better.  Ever.  Even in my attempts to make myself better or to feel better do not work.  There is always some reason to feel like shit.  The smallest things now set me off.  I even know I am being sensitive, yet these things still upset me.  I wish there was a day I could wake up and not feel sad or hopeless.  Or feel that facing the day is simply an obstacle I have to get through until I can simply go to sleep again.  I over analyze things people say even more than I ever did and take everything to heart.  What is wrong with me?  I’m taking my anti-depressants, and I thought I was feeling better, but now, I don’t think I am.  My life is so fucked up.  Not in the sense that it really is…but the way I look at it is.  What would be the difference in dying and living the way that I do now?  I don’t see much difference.   I simply exist, I don’t live.  I am here, but no more than that.  I feel dead inside.  I hardly feel any good feelings, and when I do, I feel like I don’t deserve them, or I feel that this feeling cannot last long because something is going to come along and make me sad again.  And it does…that thing is me.  I make me sad, and I can’t stop it.  What’s wrong with me?  Why must I have to feel like this every day of my life?  Is this what I deserve?  Did I do something terrible in a past life to deserve this never ending feeling?
 
-""I Killed someone, you see.  I killed the girl that used to be me.""
 
– Depression is feeling like you’ve lost something, but have no clue when or where you last had it.  Then, one day, you realize what you lost was yourself.
 
-People think depression is sadness.  People think depression is crying.  People think depression is dressing in black.  But people are wrong.  Depression is the constant feeling of being numb.  Being numb to emotions, being numb to life.  You wake up in the morning just to go back to bed again.  Days aren’t really days; they are just annoying obstacles that need to be faced.  And how do you face them?  Through medication, though drinking, through smoking, through drugs, through cutting.  When you’re depressed, you grasp onto anything that can get you through the day.  That’s what depression is, not sadness or tears, but the overwhelming sense of numbness and the desire for anything that can help you make it from one day to the next.
 
-""Depression is the most unpleasant thing I have ever experienced.  It is that absence of being able to envisage that you will ever be cheerful again.  The absence of hope, that very deadened, that is so very different from feeling sad.  Sad hurts, but it’s a healthy feeling.  It is a necessary thing to feel.  Depression is very different.""- JK Rowling

I know what she thinks of me.  She thinks I don’t even have the capability to do to clean a damn house.  So many people have thought I won’t ever amount to anything.  She thinks I’m stupid, when I am clearly way smarter than her.  I can sense so much judgement about all the things I have done in the past.  She thinks I’m a loser with no sense of responsibility.  The thing is, I was living away from her for 7 years.  She made some comment like, “But you were drinking for 7 years…” No, bitch.  I was only drinking the last year and a half because I was being emotionally abused at work and at home.  So fuck you.  You have so much judgement when it comes to addiction, and you can’t even see you’re addicted to pain pills.  I only did the things I did because I wanted to feel something.  I knew something was wrong, that I shouldn’t feel the way I was feeling, and I was trying to make myself feel decent for at least 2 seconds.  So, fuck you.

I have been reading over some of my oldest entries from when I was in high school.  I cannot stop cringing.  I am hoping some of the poor grammar and spelling was simply because I was in a hurry when typing.  That’s the least of the cringiness, though.  I was so young, and naive.  It’s like I thought my life was some romantic comedy.  I believed in stuff.  How stupid of me.  Poor little Mallory was so hopeful back then.  If only she knew what was coming later on, she probably wouldn’t have been so hopeful, and would have enjoyed the only decent part of life while it lasted.
I remember back in 2013 when my ex and I broke up, he broke into my diary and was reading all my stuff.  He read an entry I wrote about him.  I just re-read it, and it’s pretty brutal, but truthful.  I’m glad he read it.  At first I felt guilty, but I don’t now.  I would have never had the guts to say those things to him, and even if I did, he wouldn’t have listened.  After he read it, it sounded like he actually kind of realized what a jerk he was.  Anyway, after he read a bunch of entries, I remember he said, “You have been depressed…. for years.  How have you felt like that for years?”   I remember thinking that I couldn’t remember everything I wrote about feeling depressed through the years.  I just went back and read a lot, and holy shit.  It’s so fucking obvious now, and I can’t believe it wasn’t back then.  I guess I always just thought everyone else felt the same way all the time, they were just better at hiding it.  It goes back 16 years ago.  It’s fucking awful and sad… and my parents couldn’t even piece it together.
Anyway, mom, Adam, and Alex are here today.  It also feels like spring, today, which I hate.  Softball used to always start in the spring, so now, every spring, when I feel that familiar warmth, I get this bad, sinking, foreboding feeling.  So many bad things have happened in the spring…. softball, my ex breaking up with me, and me getting drunk for the first time because if it, my other ex screaming at me in the car on the way to my mom’s house because I wouldn’t stop and get him more alcohol, even though he was already drunk.  The feeling is awful to me, because it was like I would think, “Wow, it’s spring, and it’s getting warmer!  I’m starting to get in a better mood because of the sunshine, the fresh air, and the ability to wear cooler clothes!!!”  Only to be completely stripped away of that feeling really quickly by something really bad happening.  That’s why I hate spring.  That’s why I get that anxiety every time I feel that odd warmth in the air.  It’s weird, I know.  It’s why I have grown to love the dark better.  I love shorter days.  I love cold, and snow, and rain.  You expect things like that to be harder to tolerate, so you’re not disappointed.  But, anyway, Monday, mom will be going back to Nashville, Alex will be back at his mom’s, Adam will be at Jerimy’s, and it’s supposed to get cold again that day.  I will be back to my normal routine of cold, comfortable solitude.

Ignore any poor grammar and punctuation, because I’m trying to get these thoughts out as fast as my mind is producing them….I have been going through all these old diary entries.  For the past several years, I have been making jokes about how much my life has sucked.  I do know it hasn’t been great, but there are others who have had it a lot worse.  While making these jokes, I would think, well, it has it really been that bad?  After reading all this old stuff, yes.  It has.  People did and said some really awful, shitty things to me.  My parents were shitty.  They said and did things that were just awful.  At the time, I knew it made me feel bad, but looking at it now… that shit was really fucked up.  Then straight out of high school I got with the first guy who showed any interest in me at all because I didn’t think I could do better, and my self-esteem apparently relied on the attention of ass-hole guys.  He treated me like shit.  He constantly insulted me, disrespected me AND my body…. then the next guy was awful too.  Did pretty much the same shit.  Then, some dude at work violated me despite my constant protests, and another used me.  Now, here I am.  Nothing has really gotten better, excpet all the ass-hole guys in my life are gone (thank goodness).  But looking back on all this… my life has never been good.  I’ve done some shitty things, but I realize it was in response to always trying to be a good person, then realizing that didn’t even matter, so I started rebelling.  That obviously didn’t make me feel any better, either.  But seriously… I think I actually deserve a moment in my life where I am happy… no matter how brief.  I have this dream of being a writer…. a really great, published writer.  I have always wanted it, but people throughout my life constantly told me how unrealistic that would be.  I don’t care anymore.  I want it more than anything.  I will keep trying until I can make it happen.  I think I deserve that much by now, don’t I?

Reading some of my old diary entries has really set off a chain reaction of emotions for me.  I thought I would just read them and cringe, and think, “Yeah, I was stupid.”  The thing is; it’s really fucking depressing.  What happened to me?  I used to care about things.  I used to want to do stuff and have fun.  I used to have friends.  I was always depressed, that much is obvious, but at least back them I had a little hope that things could get better for me.  I was well-rounded.  I was in band, and I had so many friends.  I was constantly doing things with them, going to their houses, talking to everyone, even guys.  Sadly, I had forgotten about some really awful things that people did to me, but even then . . . I’m kind of jealous of my old self.  I was young, decent looking, skinny, fun, motivated, passionate. . . Now, I’m nothing.  I’m this hallow shell of what I used to be.  I don’t feel much of anything anymore, except disappointment, depression, numbness, sadness, and a whole lot of fucking anger.  I’m so bitter.  I hate myself and I hate my life.  If I could go back and do it all again, I wouldn’t hesitate.  I wish I had done so many things differently.  I wish I wouldn’t have let people treat me like a pile of garbage my entire fucking life.  After being told you’re garbage for years, you start to believe it; and I do.  I am garbage.
 
**Edit**
Seriously finished reading everything from 16 years ago.  It’s fucking heartbreaking.  I was never fucking happy.  Ever.  Family, some friends, romantic interests all treated me like trash.

I feel gross.  I am gross.  How did I let myself get this way?
It’s been a long time, but I think I might kind of like someone, but it’s stupid, because I don’t actually know this person.  Not in real life.  I honestly just think that after reading all my old high school entries, I’m looking for something to make me feel like that again.  While I was a bit dramatic, at least I cared about stuff back then.  Things actually meant something to me.  Now, I really don’t care about anything.  If I’m not angry, I’m numb.  So I always cling to whatever thing comes along to make me feel something for a second.  This guy was in a FB group that I am in.  He saw me comment on something, and he said something back to me, then he sent me a friend request.  He’s really cute, plays guitar, he’s intelligent, funny, has the saw political, moral, religious views as I do.  We talk sometimes, but only when one of us occasionally comments on something we post…. which actually isn’t that often.  I feel stupid.  Like I said, it’s honestly something for me to cling to.   It’s not like anyone would be able to like me right now anyway.  I use my profile pic from like 5 years ago because I’ve gained a shit ton of weight and I look so fucking disgusting now.  I look at myself in the mirror, and I want to vomit.  I’m huge, old, and gross.  I feel like I want to claw off all my skin.  I can’t stand it.  I have decided I’m going back to ana.  I want to starve again.  I can’t do anything until I lose weight anyway.  It’s what has kept me from doing things I want to do and seeing friends, or meeting people.  I will never be happy until I’m skinny again because even if I try to do the things I want to do…. all I can think about is how fat I am.   I had a friend (my brother’s ex) who would always want to go out and do stuff together.  She would say things like “we should do this….it sounds like fun.”   She doesn’t see inside my head.  NOTHING is fun for me.   Anytime I go anywhere or do anything, I can NEVER enjoy it because the whole time I’m thinking about how fat and disgusting I am.   I hate myself.

It’s been a long time since I’ve written, but I thought about this diary randomly earlier in the week, and I read thorough a lot of my entries again.  Most of them are from high school.  I’ve had this diary since 2001, and now I feel like I’d like to keep writing in it.
I feel… hopeless.  That pretty much sums it up right there.  I feel like life is either miserable or boring.  I can’t think of too many happy moments that I’ve had in the my entire 36 years of existence.  Who knew when I started this diary, that I would still be coming back to it at 36?  I kind of miss high school.  At least then I had quite a few friends.  I seemed to have hope.  It’s very obvious I was trying to fight against severe depression that went undiagnosed for years.  Ever since I was in 1st grade, I knew there was something wrong with me, and I couldn’t understand it or figure it out, and the adults in my life failed miserably to help me.  They didn’t even try.  They just thought I was doing everything I was doing for attention or to get out of school.  Which, by the way, most kids dread going to school.  A lot of kids cry thinkin about it.  That right there says that there is something incredibly fucked up about the school system.  I think back, and I’m like… seriously… teachers wouldn’t let us go to the bathroom when we needed to??!  Like what is that?  Only 5 minutes between classes to get your shit and go through a huge fucking maze of a school?  Teachers that shouldn’t be teachers… I mean, I don’t like kids, but I also know that because of that, my profession definitely shouldn’t be a teacher.  Anyway, I digress.
I was saying I feel hopeless.  I remember in school they would tell the people who got picked on regularly that “it gets better.”  I’m here to tell you that it most certainly does not.  People don’t pick on me now.  But there are more other awful things in life that come along instead.  And I have realized that I tend to cling to whatever thing comes along, just to try to feel good… even if that thing or person is definitely not good for me.  I feel broken.  I feel like I don’t have the ability to make good choices anymore.  I keep making all the wrong ones.  They say you aren’t supposed to look outside yourself for happiness, but….
*Okay, I wrote a lot more than this, but for some reason OD didn’t save it, and now I’m fucking pissed.  I guess I’ll just sum it up in saying, I cling to whatever comes along.  I have had shitty boyfriends, and I still have one.  I was messing around with a coworker who didn’t want a relationship with me… used me until he found someone better who he really did want a relationship with.  It was the only thing I had left that I looked forward to, and now I don’t have that, and I feel hopeless and broken.  Essentially, reading over old diary entries has triggered me to starve myself again.  It’s the only thing I can control.  I’m hopeless and broken and sick of life.**

There is something seriously fucked up about me.  No matter how hard I try, I feel like I can’t fix it.  I chase people that don’t want me.  The people that do want me, are horrible human beings.  I know what I’m doing is fucked up and pathetic, but I can’t stop.  I keep thinking the NEXT time we interact, he’ll change his mind.  I also know that’s not true.  But I keep doing it.  Hoping to run into him.  When I do, I try to think of something clever to say every time, but I know it won’t help.  I know I can’t make someone want me.  I’m in so much pain all the time.  I really don’t know what to do.  I need help.  But I can’t get it.  Why can’t I stop thinking about him?  Why can’t I stop this obsession that is getting me no where?  It’s just painful.  He shouldn’t have even flirted with me in the first place.  He should have left me alone if he knew I wasn’t what he really wanted.  I hate him.  And yet, I don’t.  What is wrong with me>??

Still feel like I have nothing to look forward to.  I’ve had a shitty day.  Dropped our thingy that does the air controls in the lab and kind of broke it.  It can be fixed, but it’s a bitch to do.  I was also trying to do calibrations for the first time today, and I honestly thought I understood the way it was explained to me.. until I went to do it.. and I had no fucking clue what I was really doing.  I knocked over a cabinet.  Papers everywhere.  I did see Chris today.  He helped me try to find the piece I broke off the air control thingy.  Then I saw him in the hall later and we talked for a moment.  Nothing special.  Just chatting.  I thanked him for helping me.  He mentioned he was tired because he’s been working 15 hours for Christmas.  I didn’t say what I was thinking, which was, “Well, if you had a girlfriend that actually had a job and a car, she might be able to contribute financially… buy hey, as long as she’s pretty….”  But, that doesn’t help anyone… me thinking things like that.  Even if they’re true.  It did feel good to chat like we were kind of friends again though.  It made me feel a little better.  Hating him just makes me feel like shit.  It felt like a relief to feel a little friendlier towards him.  I don’t know why or how to explain it.
I’ve been trying to starve myself the past few days.  Lost 3 pounds.  But now after having such a shit day, all I want to do is go home and drink and blast music and eat my feelings.  If I do that, it’ll just fuck up all the work I’ve done through the week.  It’s not fair.  Everything even a little bit enjoyable has shit consequences.  It’s stupid.  So what do you look forward to?  I have no fucking clue.

I am so confused.  I don’t know if it’s me or him.  I don’t know if I’ve actually been the villain all along.  I don’t know what’s real or not anymore.  I don’t know if I’m just being too sensitive or I just have expectations that are too high for anybody, or too unrealistic.  After the discussion we had Saturday night, I felt like everything was my fault.  I feel like a horrible person.  But then I think back to things… and they just don’t seem right.  The things he says and the way he makes me feel…. it doesn’t feel right.  But again, I ask myself…is it just me?  Am I just too sensitive?   Am I the one that’s wrong?  It must be me.  because… no one else wants me.  And there’s a reason for that.  Too stupid.  Too fat.  Too ugly.  Too sensitive.  And maybe he’s just the only one that can put up with it?  Maybe all the things he points out that  I do wrong… are just me being really stupid.  He started yelling at me about pants.  He bought me 2 pairs of some pants, and I don’t know if they are in the dresser or closet.  And he asked me how can I not know.  That he spent a lot of money on them, that I should just know.  I said I’m too fat to fit in one pair, and the other pair I wear all the time.  I wasn’t sure where the other pair was and he got mad about that.  I said it’s just pants and he said he paid for that stuff, so I should know where it is and take better care of them.  I kept saying “I know they’re here, but I’m not sure where.  What do you want me to do?”  And he just kept saying I don’t get it.  And I kept trying to diffuse the situation.  I didn’t know what to do or how to stop him yelling at me… so then I just freaked out and started yelling too.  And it’s so weird.  Things seemed fine literally 20 mins before that… then it was like this huge mood swing.  And I keep thinking.. “This isn’t right.”  But them I question myself.  ‘Should I just care about this?  Am I just so stupid that I can’t handle figuring out where a pair of pants is, and he is justified in being angry?”  I don’t know.  Nothing makes sense to me anymore.  I don’t know if I’m just this really shitty, stupid person who never does anything right, and he should just get an award for being the only one to put up with me?  Or if things just shouldn’t be this way.  I don’t know.  I’m so confused and scared.  I’m scared of my own mind.  I feel like I can’t even trust myself anymore.   I mean… it has to be me, right?  That’s why no one else wants me.  Because they see who I am.  They see there is something very wrong with me.  They see that I’m too stupid to function.  That I’m too fat.  Too ugly.  Too weird.  They see it.  And he sees it, but he has to put up with it.  So it is me.  It has to be.  How do I fix myself?  I feel pain all the time.  I don’t want to live anymore because I’ve tried fixing myself, and I can’t do it.   So what’s the fucking point anymore?  I wish I were dead.

So many people at work get excited for these week-long shut-downs.  They get excited for the holidays.  I don’t.  It’s just me at home, lying in bed, watching tv, feeling painfully depressed all the time.  I miss the feeling I used to get at Christmas time.  Even though my parents were shitty, my dad was at least in a good mood around Christmas.  The only time he was in a good mood, but still.  They at least tried to me Christmas special.  The lights, music, going to see family.  The excitement, the fun.  I don’t have that anymore.  I have dread.  Foreboding.  Even if I go visit my mom, that house is so depressing.  No one cleans it anymore.  It’s borderline a hoarder house.  A kid has taken over my room… and trashed it.  My stuff is thrown around and missing and fucked up.  My mom hears voices that don’t exist sometimes.  It’s just a sad feeling.   How did I get this way?  I am never happy.  I never have been.  I never will be.

It’s funny to go back and read some of my old entries from high school.  It’s always been apparent that I’ve been depressed, but the tone of my entries is completely different than what it is now.  My old entries are at least hopeful.  And naïve.  I thought things were hard, but I knew they had to get better.  It’s sad, really.  Things don’t get better.  Life is just shitty, and then we die.  That’s all.  I can’t believe how naïve I was.  There is no hope or silver lining.
I’m feeling completely hopeless today.  People can tell.  Heather asked me if I was okay, I just said yeah.  Bruno came in to get me to sign some documents and asked if I was okay.  I almost started crying, so he hugged me, then he brought me candy and talked to me in the break room for a while.  Then I saw Chris.  He was pulling a dolly full of cheese through the hall.  He said hi, and I just waved.  He asked if I was okay.  I said I was fine.  He asked if I was sure, and I said, “Does it matter?”  I mean really?  Why does he care?  We’re not even friends anymore.  As soon as he got his perfect girlfriend, he stopped messaging me.  He just said, “Yeah, you’re a person too.”  I just said, “Not a very good one.”  Then he said something like “it’ll get better.  I know everyone says that all the time.  They say it to me.”  I was like “Yeah, sure.”  Like really?  You’re part of the source of my pain.  And what in your life is so bad?  You’ve got a GF and a house.  You’ve got family and friends.  You saw what everyone else sees about me.  That there’s something wrong with me.  You hurt me, then unfriended me on Facebook, for whatever reason, even though I was still nice to you.  So why ask if I’m okay if you really, ultimately don’t care?

I don’t really know what to say.  I feel stuck.  I was going to save my money, so I could leave, but he keeps blowing it.  He is the one who blew through $1500 of my savings.  He says we need to learn to save better.  WE?  Um.  No.  You.  I would have so much money.  I know how to save.  I’ve done it many times before while making a lot less than I do now.  And everyone says they want to help me, but they don’t really… they don’t want to be inconvenienced.   It makes them feel better to say they want to help me, but still not actually do anything.  I just don’t know what to do.  I can’t do this anymore.  I don’t even feel like myself anymore.  All the passive aggressive comments… I feel guilty for everything, even if something isn’t my fault.  I always feel like I’m doing something wrong.  And I think back to all the times I dismissed shitty behavior, thinking maybe I was over reacting.  But I wasn’t.  The truth is, I knew it wasn’t okay, but I didn’t want to admit to myself that once again, I got myself into a relationship with another toxic person.  I was thinking about it all last night.  And I felt rage.  I remember when his old roommate would say stuff about me when I wasn’t there… things that sounded like he liked me or was attracted to me, or whatever.  And he would tell me these things in an accusatory manner… as if I had done something to provoke these comments.  Like the fact this guy liked me was my fault somehow.  I barely talked to this dude, and when I did was I just nice and polite.  And one day he said something like “the dude keeps asking where you’re going every time you leave.”  And it made me feel like he thought I was  cheating on him with this dude… somehow?  Like how would that even happen?  They live together?  But I felt guilty for some reason.  I felt like I had done something wrong.  And he even questioned me a few minutes later, like “Why are you so jumpy now?’  Like… because you made me feel like I”m cheating and I’m not, and I don’t know how to convince you otherwise, and now I feel like I HAVE done something wrong, and I haven’t.  And he got mad at me and started yelling at me because the dude said “looks like you lost weight,” and I was so taken aback, that all I could think to say was “Um, thanks…”   He yelled at me  for like an hour for that.  He said I should have told the dude off or yell at him for hitting on me.  But i am so afraid of confrontation that I don’t yell at anybody.  And I told him that and I told him, I just didn’t know what to say because it was just so unexpected, and he said, “Do you really not think about anything you say before you say it?”  I think back to that, and I feel enraged.  I think back to all the shitty things he’s said to me.  How stupid he makes me feel.  How I am afraid to walk in the kitchen at the same time as him because he gets mad about it because it’s a little kitchen.  I was trying to make the bed and he literally stood there looking pissed off because I was in his way.  All these little things… make me feel terrible all the time.  And sometimes I think maybe I’m too sensitive, but honestly, I’ve never had anyone talk to me the way he has.  I’ve had 2 exes that would say shit like this occasionally and the 2nd one even had anger issues and was a really shitty person, but I at least didn’t always feel like a piece of shit.  And neither of them had so many anal rules about how to do… basically everything… where everything should go, how I need to do things.  I couldn’t even cook a fucking burrito the other night without him telling me I’m doing it wrong.  I can’t do it anymore.  I feel suffocated.  And I feel like nothing I do is ever right.  I have to walk on eggshells with everything I do.   It’s like this whole control thing, with what I wear, what I do, what purse or wallet I even use.  My whole life people have been trying to control me, and I’m so fucking sick of it.
When I was a kid, it was my parents, mostly my dad.  Wasn’t even allowed to date.  Wasn’t allowed to talk to boys on the phone.  Even when I was 18-20 years old, I had a fucking curfew.  I was 18, and asking permission to stay at my 1st boyfriend’s house (with his whole family there), and I got screamed at.  At 18, I lost a bunch of weight and started wearing cuter clothes, including skirts and got slut-shamed for it.  He said dude would be looking at me.  So fucking what?  At the time,  I thought this was not okay, but I dealt with it, but the older I’ve gotten, I realize how fucked up it really was.  Sexist.  Over-bearing.  Controlling.  He fucked me up, then wondered why I was the way I was.  Then I got married at 20, and he tried to control me too.  Things I wore.  Things I did.  Same with the next boyfriend, but not as bad.  He was just always drunk and mean and screaming nonsense.  Starting fights and drama out of nowhere, then saying I was the one who was dramatic.  Then I moved back in with mom, and she tried to control me.  Always wanted to know where I was and what I was doing.  Why was I in my room by myself for so long?  And I was 28-32 years old then.  And now I’m with this dude.  I just want people to let me do what I fucking want to do and leave me the fuck alone.  So sick of being controlled.
I realize how awful the grammar and sentence structure was in this entry.  I’m usually much better, but I was just trying to get all my thoughts out.  When I started this entry, I didn’t think I would have much to say, but it just all started coming out.

Do you ever have one of those days when you feel like everyone is just looking at you weird?  I don’t know.  A few people I usually interact with just brushed me off or gave me weird looks… one even completely ignored me when I said hi.  I already feel invisible a good deal of the time.  When someone ignores me, if pisses me off.  I even went to look in the mirror in the bathroom to make sure my hair didn’t look crazy, or that I had all my clothes on.  Everything seemed fine to me… *shrugs*
Last night I was supposed to get off at 10.  Cheris didn’t come in and everyone thought she was supposed to.  Apparently she told our boss she couldn’t come in, but she misunderstood, so we didn’t have anyone for 3rd shift to come in until 1am.  So I had to stay until 1am until BP came in.  Then I had to drive 45 minutes home just to eat and sleep, then come back.  I slept okay until Dexter woke me up.  She laid his fat body on my chest and meowed until I got up… to WATCH him eat.  Then he wanted to sit and look out the window, so I had to pull the curtains and blinds up, then tried to go back to sleep with the sun blasting on my face.  Now I’m just so tired.  I did sleep about 7 hours, but feel rundown.  People at work keep getting covid, and I wonder if I’m next.  The sad thing is, if I get it, the worst thing I’m concerned about is the fact my BF would be mad.  He would say it was my fault I got it, and I wasn’t careful enough and then it would be my fault when he got it.  THAT is the only thing that concerns me about getting it.  I could fight through sickness, but being blamed for being sick is what I’m tired of dealing with.  I’m blamed for everything.  I do nothing right.  I’m just so tired of it all.  It’s exhausting walking on eggshells all the time.    He would probably even jump to the conclusion I cheated on him with some dude that had covid.  That is how his mind works.  It would not surprise me.  I’m so fucking tired.

I feel like life is always either miserable or boring.  I keep hoping there will be one day I wake up and something amazing happens to me.  I keep hoping to go to work, and something so good happens that I actually feel excitement or joy… things I haven’t felt in a very long time.  Maybe not even since I was a kid.  I had one thing that I looked forward to everyday… and it was a person.  That’s incredibly unhealthy, I know.  But it was all I had.  And now he’s gone and I have nothing.  I feel so empty.  So joyless.  Nothing to look forward to anymore.   I think the last time I felt good was when Chris told me I was his best friend.  Then literally a week later  he crushed my heart, and now we’re not even friends anymore.  I don’t know what else to say.  I’m just tired of feeling shitty… both physically and mentally.  I wish something good would happen to me.

I don’t know what to say.  All I know is I feel so completely hopeless and stuck.  Everything feels pointless.  I feel no joy.  Everything is hard or miserable, or just plain boring.   Is this all life is?  That’s all I’ve experienced in my 36 years… so what’s the point?  How do I keep going at this point?  I don’t understand.  I hate my parents for brining me into this world.  It’s awful and painful, and nothing more than that.  I’m so fucking depressed.  I have nothing to look forward to anymore.

I feel so tired and sluggish today.  I think it’s because I don’t have my meds.  I feel really depressed too.  So yeah, that makes sense.  I called a guy that rents houses and apartments and he said he should have some stuff ready at the beginning of March.  That would be awesome.  I could finally leave him and be free.  After this, I am never going to be in another relationship ever again.  I don’t want to be stuck like this ever again.  It’s awful and exhausting.  I’m so sick of him.  It’s like taking care of a giant child.  I don’t want kids.  I never did and it feels like I keep having to take care of adults who act like them.  I’m fucking sick of it.
All day I have been wanting C though.  I know we would never work out.  I don’t want a relationship and he has kids and he’s kind of a selfish jerk.  But I guess I just want the physical part back.  Bad.  I just want it really bad today.  I sound like a slut, I know.  I don’t care.  I’m done caring about much of anything.  Life is miserable.  So what if I want a little fun every once in a while?  I can’t wait to be free.

Okay, so there’s a dude at work who annoys the fuck out of me.  And I seem to be the only one that’s noticed how annoying he is?  So I have to vent here.  I can’t stand his voice.  He asks the same dumb questions almost every day.  I had to tell him how to calibrate a ph meter like 10 times already and it’s pretty much the simplest thing we do.  I’ve told him countless times he doesn’t have to check a packaging box until the EVEN hours and he keeps grabbing one as soon as he gets here on an odd hour, which throws off the rest of the night.  He asked me about reading the incubator thermometer about 5 times.  He tries to correct me when I’m explaining something to him.  I can’t stand his face or his voice.  I guess that makes me a bitch, but oh well.  I’m not mean to him, but I can’t stand being in the same room as him for very long.  And why am I the only one that he irritates?  No one else has mentioned anything about it.  Oh well.  I haven’t said anything either.  I was waiting for someone else to.  It’s driving me nuts.  I want to bitch about it, but no one else seems to see it.  I thought i was going to get to leave at 9 tonight, but instead I realized Elizabeth isn’t coming in tonight, so I gotta stay with him until Cheris gets here.  Ugh.  Okay, vent time over.

So I kept thinking about what happened the other night when I messaged C.  How the fuck did his GF see the message?  I messaged him while he was at work so that wouldn’t happen.  And it wasn’t even a bad message.  I just said if he needed to talk, I’m still his friend.  That’s it.  And she saw it somehow, and it pissed her off.  That’s what he said anyway.  I asked him how she saw it, and he didn’t give me a straight answer.  Is she monitoring his FB?  Because he also “unfriended” me even though we’re still friends.  And he was the one who kept coming to talk to me last Thursday.  So this chick is monitoring his messages and doesn’t even want me and him to be friends.   Yeah, that’s a healthy relationship right there.  I can’t be friends with someone because their girlfriend is insecure.  He and I were best friends before they got together.  And now we barely speak.  And he’s not happy.  He told me as much last week.  I just miss our friendship.

Relationships are such bullshit to me.  I’ve never met anyone that’s every truly happy in their relationship.  And we all have this unrealistic version of them in our heads.  Movies and TV shows show how amazing they could be… but they are never that.  I’ve never had any guy treat me anything like the dudes on TV treat their girlfriends… not even close.  I’ve never had a man say anything heartfelt like that to me.  No nice notes, gifts… or even real interest in my life or who I am as a person.  No grand romantic gestures.  No amazing kisses.  It’s all bullshit.  Oh, Happy Valentines day, BTW.  haha.

I started gaining weight again when I got with N.  I kept trying to keep it under control (something I’ve dealt with my whole life) and I tried to keep it down, but it kept getting more and more impossible.  I know what I can and can’t eat.  I have to have controlled meals or I will gain weight.  I kept telling him that, but he keeps buying junk, so I keep gaining weight.  I don’t have control when he buys pizzas 2-3 times a week, or tacos.  All kinds of junk.  And he makes comments about my weight too.  I tell him I can’t eat all the junk he can.  He’s never had a problem with weight, so he doesn’t care.  He doesn’t care to try to keep from buying those foods, but he does care that I’m fat.  Constant comments about my weight.  I’ve gained about 40 pounds.  Before that when I met him, I looked fine.  I was slightly overweight,  but I still looked good.  And I had just lost a bunch and was still losing… until I fucking met him.  And I know I looked good, but from the moment he met me he made comments about me being thick or having fat fingers, fat arms.  My arms have always have excess fat, even when I was 110 pounds, the weight just likes to settle there.  People way bigger than me have better arms than I do.  I guess that’s just the way my body is.  Anyway, he makes comments that he knows make me feel bad.  He’ll say things like “I can eat whatever I want and not get fat.”  He says that a lot.  Like he’s bragging about it and making me feel bad that I can’t do that.  He talks about how big I am, how I can’t fit into anything anymore.  I was talking about how I feel bad now… I don’t want to go out anymore because I don’t like people looking at how fat I am.  He said, “Well someone could make fun of me for being too skinny…”  I was like “That’s not even a real problem.”  Nobody really makes fun of others for being too skinny.  If they do, they don’t really mean it.  They are actually jealous when they make comments like that.  But if they make fun of you for being too fat, they aren’t jealous, they are disgusted.  I also mentioned I could start going to the gym, but then he said he wouldn’t like that because dudes hit on girls when they go to the gym.
I know I can lose weight, but I just can’t with him around.  He doesn’t like that I’m fat, but won’t help me by keeping shit-food away from me.  I’ve lost weight several times before.  I always do so much better when I’m not in a relationship.  And I don’t want to be with him any more anyway.  I can’t wait to be free again.  I feel so out of control.  If I could just get rid of him, I’d have a sense of relief and control back.  I feel like I can’t do it.  It all feels impossible.
He’s so selfish too.  A few weeks ago my mom was having another bout of hearing voices.  She hasn’t officially been diagnosed with schizophrenia.  They just gave some vague diagnosis.  But anyway, I was trying to talk to him about it and he just wanted to talk about himself.  It’s like the subject bored him.  I was saying she’s got mental health problems, ect. and he’s like “Well, I could have a break down too from being in the house so much..”  I was thinking, “what kind of mental gymnastics do you have to do to turn the subject of someone hearing voices onto you?”  Like how?”  I tried to talk to him about it again the next day.  I started explaining what was going on and he literally just stared at me and didn’t say anything.  I was like “You have nothing to say?”  He just shrugged and went back to cleaning or whatever the fuck he was doing.   If you’re in a relationship, you should be able to talk to your partner about any problems you might be going through.  I don’t do that with him.  Anytime I try, he turns the subject on himself or doesn’t even respond to what I’m saying.  I was trying to tell him about a situation at work and he literally just stared at his phone and didn’t respond to me.  I just got up and walked away.  I never get any comfort or advice from him.  Anytime I do try to talk about myself, he talks over me or cuts me of like I never even said anything.  He will go on for hours about himself, but if I try to say one thing about myself he doesn’t really listen or acknowledge I even said anything.  People like to feel heard.  I don’t feel heard or seen at all.  I stopped trying to talk to him about anything anymore.  Now all our conversations are just him rambling about himself for hours and me just nodding and saying “Yeah.  Cool.  Yeah,.  Sure.  Great.”  That’s all I say anymore.  I feel like a fucking robot.  I hate him.

18. If you could change your name what would it be?  I don’t know.  I hated my name when I was a kid because no one else had it.  Now that ‘s the reason why I like it.  But it’s not sexy or anything.  It’s just kinda cute.  But for some reason people are so dumb, they always get it wrong and call me Melanie or Valorie.  It pisses me off.
19. Have you ever thought you were going to die?   Yeah.  When  I went off a small cliff in my first car.  Also, I’m pretty sure someone was trying to run me off the road last night.  Don’t know why, but I thought I was about to die.

29. Something that most people don’t know about you?   Something I don’t want to say.

15. Name one thing you will never understand about the opposite sex?
It seems that most women want a lot of the same thing… for a guy to be like the guys in movies… with the grand romantic gestures…someone who actually listens and treats them like a best friend.  So why don’t any of them actually act like that?

I am so fucking sick of him.  I hate his stupid voice, his face, the way he looks at me.  I hate the way he talks to me… so condescending.  I hate that I feel like I can’t do anything right.  Everything I do, he criticizes.  I can’t even cook a fucking burrito in the microwave without him telling me I’m doing it wrong.  When I’m around him, I feel stupid.  I feel ugly.  I feel fat.  I can’t remember the last time he complimented me.  I want to leave.  I have no where to go.  And I keep trying to find a place and no one will call me back.  I have enough money saved for a deposit and just a little more.  If it weren’t for getting my taxes back, I wouldn’t have that.  I keep trying to save more, but he keep sucking me dry.   I would have so much money, if it wasn’t for him.  I would have more self-esteem.  I would be able to concentrate on myself.   He makes me feel terrible about myself.  I can’t wait to leave.  I keep  thinking of all the little things I can do if I leave.  I can save money.  I can lose weight easier.  I can watch as much tv as  I want.  I can write whenever I want.  I can listen to whatever music I want as loud as I want.  I can light candles again.  He never lets me use my candles.  I can play on my phone without feeling like I’m doing something wrong.  Every time I pick up my phone, he asks me what I’m doing… which means, “are you texting someone other guy?”  I COULD text other guys…guy friends.  He got mad at me for texting an old friend who messages ME first to tell me his mother died.  I told him that and he still got mad and yelled at me saying I shouldn’t be friends with a dude.  And only hours before he said something like he was better friends with girls than guys.  How FUCKING hypocritical!!!  I can take a shower without worrying if it’s too hot.  I can actually shave in the shower without worrying about him being pissed for me taking too long of a shower.  I can wear what I want.  I can use whatever purse or wallet I want.  I could go to the gym if I want… he said I shouldn’t because guys hit on girls at the gym (yet continues to make comments on my weight).  I can put things wherever I want.  I can drop things and run into stuff and not feel like I’m annoying him.  I could laugh at myself again for doing those things.  I can be me again.  I don’t feel like myself anymore.  I feel physically and emotionally sick.  It’s making me sick.  I don’t feel like me.  I miss me.  I miss laughing and having fun.  He’s either mean or boring.  The things he talks about constantly… credit scores, cars, cleaning… um… that’s about it.  Oh… himself.  Anytime I try to speak he just talks over me like I’m not even saying anything.  I don’t feel seen or heard.  I feel used.  I’m so tired.  I’m so sick of it.
The other day I was watching Parks and Rec.  There’s a couple on there that I love… Leslie and Ben.  Ben is so sweet (but of course, he’s a fictional character).  Anyway, there was an episode where Leslie wants to take a break from her campaigning because she’s been working so hard, so she goes to a bar with a couple of friends and has a few drinks and she gets kind of drunk.  Ben calls her and tells her that he got her a spot on a talk show last minute.  She’s like oh crap, I’m drunk, but doesn’t tell him.  She goes on the talk show drunk and kind of fucks things up and of course everyone realizes she’s drunk.  So as I’m watching, I’m thinking, “Oh, man.  Ben’s going to be so pissed at her.  He’s probably going to  yell at her, make her feel like shit, and they might fight.”  And he didn’t.  He was fine.  He realized she got drunk and he was okay with it.  He didn’t get mad.  And I started crying.  Because if  I had done that, every single boyfriend I’d ever had would have made me feel like complete shit.  And I was crying because I was jealous of a fictional character and how good her boyfriend treats her.  It wasn’t even supposed to be a sad episode, but I was just sobbing.
I feel like sobbing now.  I just want to leave.  I want to be by myself.  I want to be me again.  I want to be happy, or at least content.  I’m so fucking sick of this.

I’m done.  I’m done letting him and anyone else treat me like garbage.  I’m tired of people talking down to me like I’m an idiot because I look like a little girl.  The way people (men) talk to me lately is pushing me past the breaking point.  I am done being treated like this.  I am done being talked down to.  I am done taking it.  I am done being someone’s “2nd option” when their first option isn’t acting how they want.  I am done being someone’s dirty little secret.  I am done feeling like I am not enough or not good enough.  I am done being scared to speak up or take up for myself.  I am done feeling like I’m stupid.  I am done feeling like I’m doing something wrong when I’m not.  I’m sick of it.  I am not that scared little girl anymore.  I don’t deserve all the mistreatment I’ve had (mostly from men) my entire fucking life.  It’s not right and it’s not okay.  I’m fucking furious thinking about all the things I’ve let people do and say to me just because  I was scared of confrontation… all because my father taught me to be seen and not heard.  I’m fucking over it.

I’ve been trying to stay positive despite shittiness because I’ve been told if I just keep thinking that way things will work themselves out.  All of my pessimistic thinking in the past never helped, so I figured, okay let’s give it a try.  Just more shittiness.  I feel like I have nothing to look forward to, and any attempt to try to fix things, or make things better is just a complete fucking failure every fucking time.  I am stuck.  I feel like I will be stuck forever.  I just wish things would change.  I wish that I could wake up one day and have everything I want.  I can’t keep waking up to the same shit every single fucking day.  I can’t stand it anymore.  I hate my life.

When I get away from him and move into my new apartment or house, I’m going to celebrate by doing a bunch of things that would normally piss him off.  I’m going to light all my fucking candles.  I’m going to order a Papa John’s pizza (that he thinks is too expensive) and I’m going to get a bunch of fucking weird toppings, lightly cooked, with light fucking sauce.  I’m going to get super drunk and blast music and dance.  I’m going to make a huge fucking mess and throw clothes every where.  Just because I fucking can.  I’m going to message every guy I know just because I can.  I’m going to make all kinds of noise, banging shit, dropping shit.  I might even max out a fucking credit card just because I can.  Fuck him.

Feeling really down today.  Again.  I feel stuck.  I’ve been desperately trying to look for an apartment or house to rent so I can get away from him, and I am having no luck.  Sometimes I’ll find something, apply for it, then check in and they’re like, “We already rented it to someone else.”  Fuck me in the ass with a rake.  I feel stuck forever.  I don’t know what to do anymore.  It all feels hopeless.  And so many people SAY they want to help, but they don’t.  They don’t want to be inconvenienced, so they just say they want to help to make themselves feel better about not actually helping.  No one has even offered for me to stay with them until I find something.  I guess that’s a selfish thing to say.  I shouldn’t expect that.  Other people have their own lives and it shouldn’t be disrupted by some depressed girl being emotionally abused by her boyfriend.
And now I’ve started thinking… if I do get away from him… what if I’m still just as miserable and hopeless?  Because what is there to look forward to anyway?  Nothing really.  Life is so miserable.  I don’t understand the point of any of it.  This morning he asked me what was wrong and I couldn’t stop myself from saying, “I’m awake.  That’s what’s wrong.  Oh… and I’m alive.  That’s another thing wrong.”  I couldn’t help it.  It’s what I feel most of the time.  Every day is the same.  Either boring or miserable.  It’s never going to get better.  I remember all that bullshit people used to say in school when I got bullied.  “It gets better.”  No, it fucking doesn’t.  It just becomes a new kind of miserable.

I may have found an apartment.  I would have been super excited a few weeks ago.  Lately he has actually been decent to me, so now I’m wondering… has it all been in my head?  Maybe I’M the jerk.  Maybe I’ve been looking at things wrong?  Am I remembering everything right?  If I leave while he’s being nice, I’ll feel like a jerk.  I keep waiting for him to start acting like an ass-hole so I’ll feel justified, but he hasn’t.  Why doesn’t he act like an ass-hole when I kind of want him to?  I don’t know.  If I leave while he’s being nice, will I feel like I’ve made a mistake?  I just don’t feel it anymore.  After all the things he’s said and done, it feels like no matter how nice he is now, I’ve already lost any feelings I had for him.  It’s too late.  Now I don’t know what to do.  I’m really depressed today.  Conflicted.  Am I doing the right thing?  If I leave… what if I’m still not happy?  Will I ever be happy?  I never have been, so why would things change now?  I don’t know what to do.

997,https://www.opendiary.com/m/mnmchick2004/reminder-151-6104123/,2022-03-29,Reminder.,"
I wrote this in another diary a few months ago, but I want to save it here.  I want to remind myself why I need to leave:
 
8/21/21
I don’t even know where to begin.  I never get to write anymore.  I don’t feel like I can.  I’m not sure if I have enough privacy, if I could even write anything down without it being read.  I don’t know.  I feel stuck.  Trapped.  I hate him.  I hate everything about him.  There are so many rules.  So many ways that things are supposed to be done, that I can’t remember them all and he makes me feel stupid and guilty anytime I forget one.  Any normal person can’t deal with this many rules.  He’s racist and sexist.  He’s hateful and judgmental.  He’s rude to anyone and everyone.  He has zero empathy for anyone.  He loses his shit if someone in a restaurant fucks up his food… like a little kid.  And he calls them stupid.  And if the employees at Wal-Mart are trying to stock shit, he’s rude to them.  He treats these people in these kinds of jobs like shit, like he’s better than them.  And yet, I guarantee they make more fucking money than him right now.   At least they went out and got a job.  He makes excuses why he can’t.  He says it’s impossible.  Really?  I got a job.  He has no real response to that.  Adam just got a job.  He won’t go to the place that he told me to go.  No reason really.  He just doesn’t want to.  More excuses.  He won’t try to get a job, and yet complains about being in the apartment all the time.  He complains about everything.  And he will go on and on for 30 mins to an hour about whatever has recently pissed him off.  Most people, if you ask them what is wrong, they at least appreciate that you care enough to ask.  He gets irrationally angry and lashes out.  It doesn’t make sense.  He is so fucking mean.  I have only met one other person as mean as him, and it’s my last ex.  He is materialistic.  Freaks out if his precious items are scratched or dented, or whatever the fuck.  Obsessive about cleaning and germs.  He has no sense of humor.  He rarely laughs or finds anything funny, and when he does, it’s stuff that doesn’t make sense… and he polices when I laugh.  If I find something funny, it’s like he gets mad and asks “Why are you laughing?  Why is that funny?”  Fuck you.  It reminds me of angry Michael.  Anytime I’d start to get excited or happy about something, he would start listing reasons why what I was excited for was stupid and make me feel like shit, so I learned to never get excited about anything.  Now I learn to never laugh at anything.
I used to always try to watch the shows he did, but he would NEVER even try after like a couple months of pretending to kinda be a decent person, he stopped.  Every time I try to watch something, instead of TRYING to be interested, he just walks out of the room, but would force me to watch boring shit.
He’s a hypochondriac who thinks he has covid just because he gets hot and gets headaches.  That’s called summer.   It’s like trying to take care of a giant child, but the child thinks it’s smarter than you.  So a teenager, I guess.  He never grew up.   He’s also one of the most boring people I’ve ever met.  When he’s not being a selfish ass-hole, he’s extremely boring.  Even when he drinks or smokes, he’s still the same mean, boring person.  Most people get nicer, or even meaner, or more fun or talkative, or anything.  He’s just the same boring, selfish ass-hole.  He will talk for hours about credit scores, how the air conditioner works (because I’m a moron), fixing what’s wrong with my car, golf, blackjack or poker… and I can’t even really think of anything else because that’s pretty much that only range of topics that he discusses.  He talks about how great he is at blackjack but he almost always loses…my money at that.  Then the other night, when I was actually trying to be nice and talk about something from work, he kept making this annoyed face like he didn’t want to hear it, like he was bored and tired of me talking, when I probably had only been speaking for a 30 seconds to a minute.  Like, bitch really?  I listen to you talk for an hour one morning about how you didn’t get your hashbrowns at McDonald’s and you can listen to me actually talk about something kinda interesting?   I hate all the passive aggressive comments any time I do something “wrong.”  I hate the looks I get when I’m doing something “wrong” and he hasn’t said anything yet, but he’s about to.  He puts his glasses in random spots and gets pissed off when someone touches them, like I should have just known they were there.  HE does the typical gaslighting shit where if he says something rude and I get upset, I’m “too sensitive.”  That’s something people say when they don’t want to take responsibility for hurting someone, so they make it the other person’s fault.  He thinks he never does anything wrong.  He never apologizes.  I always somehow end up apologizing even thought I’m not the one who did anything wrong.  I’m the one who reacts to the bullshit, then gets told I’m too sensiti9ve so it’s my fault.  He forgot his mask before going to Walmart one time and made it MY fault, like I should just have extras in my car, and also he just got up so I should have reminded him.  I even said, “So this is my fault?” and he said “yeah.”  and then when I said it again later, he said, “I don’t know where you get that from, you twist my words. I never say anything is your fault.”  you LITERALLY just did!   And sometimes it’s not actually spoken, it’s implied in a condescending, passive aggressive comment.  He’s such a horrible, terrible person.  I hate him.  I want to get away, but I don’t know where to go.
Then I had Chris.  I had hope.  He asked me to move in with him.  It was HIS idea.  And we were getting closer.  He started texting me all the time, just to talk.  Then he told me I’m his best friend.  Then literally a couple days later I could tell something had changed.  He went from seeming excited about me moving in, and saying he really wanted me there so we could split the bills and stuff… then a couple days later, he’s saying stuff like, “Well, if you don’t want to move in, you don’t have to.”  And I wasn’t even talking about that.  Then again, I said I was going to try to move my stuff in and he’s suddenly like, “No rush… you don’t have to.”   Then BOOM.  Tells me he’s seeing someone and I can move in if I need to but we can’t “do anything”.  Then the conversation went to him saying, “So I guess you’re not going to move in now?”  I didn’t say that, but I just said, “I can tell you don’t want me to now, so I guess I won’t.”  How can things change that quickly?  I was SO close.  I had a way out.  And it’s like it was taken from me at the last minute.  It’s like some cruel fucked up god was watching like, “HAHA bitch!  Try again!”  I can’t go to mom’s.  There is now a kid in my room, which has been trashed by another kid, because people are too fucking lazy to actually watch or take care of their kids.  Who cares if they fuck up someone else’s stuff, as long as they don’t actually have to be responsible for this life that they popped out of their vagina.  Also the floors are fucked up.  Mom says that Spock has been getting out somehow and I can’t risk that with Dexter.  He’s the only thing I love.   I need to find a place to live.  And Chris had referred me to some guy that helped him get his house, but I’ve messaged this guy, and he only responded to me once, and he is flat out ignoring me now.  Won’t respond, won’t help me.  I’ve thought about going to Chris again and seeing if he can talk to this guy, or maybe if he would let me stay with him until I find somewhere else, but I can’t do that.  I don’t have the guts to talk to him again.  We went from texting almost every day to nothing.  Absolutely nothing.  And he doesn’t care.  He doesn’t care that this person who was his “best friend” and someone he was intimate with is fucking drowning and hopeless.  He doesn’t give me a second thought.  Hasn’t even tried to check on me.  Nothing.  Fucking nothing.  It was the same with Troy.  We go from talking every day, saying I’m his best friend…to absolutely nothing… and he didn’t care.  How do people do that?  Lora even did it.  Best friends… then nothing at all.  Can’t get a fucking response at all.  I don’t know what I did to her.  I don’t understand.
Anyway, this happened before with Chris.  He got with Julie and I was upset.  But at the time, I was able to start to feel a little bit better after a few weeks.  I was able to tell myself, he got with her because she was single and I had a boyfriend.  I was able to lie to myself that maybe I should just try to concentrate on the relationship I was in, and maybe if I could try, things would be okay, and maybe I was just over-reacting to the way things were.  And I could also tell myself, “fuck it.  At least I have drinking to look forward to.  I can deal.”  I know.  Fucked up, but it was what helped me start to move on a little.  And it was like as soon as I started to feel a little better and let go of the whole situation, he came back around.  I remember the day.  That day he was so… almost obsessed with me.  He was flirting with me the entire day.  He even said something like “Why don’t you just leave your boyfriend?”  I said I had no where to go and he said, “I guess I’ll just be waiting for you forever.”  When I brought that up in a later conversation, he said he was just joking.  And same goes for when he once told me I was the only reason he came into work that day.  When I brought that up later, he said it was because he was so stressed, I was an escape and he just said that in the moment.  Anyway,  he came back around.  And now it’s harder that he’s left me because I don’t have those same comforting lies that I had before.  I can’t say it’s because I have a boyfriend and this other girl didn’t because he admitted he just didn’t want to be with me.  There’s obviously something wrong with me.  And I can’t lie to myself and say maybe if I try harder the relationship I’m in now will work out, because it won’t.  I’m done.  I don’t want to be treated like this anymore.  And I can’t drink much anymore because every time I do, I gain like 5 pounds overnight and I’m already getting bigger and bigger again, so I have to lay off it for a while until I can get my weight under control again.  So I have nothing.  It’s harder because I have no lies to comfort me now.   And it’s hard to get to sleep.  I used to go to sleep thinking about him… about all the things he said and did to me that day… how special he made me feel, and our possible future together… even if it was just living together being friends. Pathetic, unhealthy, obsessive.  And now I only have bad thoughts every night before going to sleep about all the ways in which my life is fucked up and everything is hopeless.  I don’t know what to do anymore.  I even tried to distract myself with other people.  Jason was a one time thing.  I assume it’s because he saw how fat I am without the strangely flattering work clothes, and how ugly I am without a mask.  He rarely talks to me now.  Yesterday was the first time he willingly came up to me to talk to me… and it was only because he wanted something.  Dakota… I don’t know what the fuck happened there.  He stopped responding to me, stood me up 3 times, and now he’s not even at work.  Chase… we had one conversation about how we liked each other, and now he acts like it never happened.  Hasn’t talked to me since then.  I’m so pathetic.  And why is it that any guy that I am ACTUALLY interested in…someone that actually seems smart, nice, or interesting… is never interested in me back?  I always just settle for the dudes that I know like me, and they turn out to be weirdos or dumb or fucking mean.  Why did my life turn out to be so shitty?  Why has it ALWAYS been shitty with no good ending in sight?  And I know I shouldn’t need anyone else to validate me, but I do.  I hate myself with a fiery passion and my parents sucked and now I’m fucked up and need constant validation from external sources.  And I can’t get it.  So I’m just severely depressed and hopeless.  I don’t know where to go from here.  No idea.  I’ve tried to come up with something and all I came up with is… find a place to myself and I can’t even seem to get help doing that.  So I’m fucked.

Have any of you ever been scared to break up with someone?  I know he won’t physically hurt me, or anything like that.  It’s just… I can’t pull the trigger.  I’m scared.  I don’t know why exactly.  I guess I hate to hurt anyone, even though he has hurt me a lot.  He’s actually been a lot nicer lately, but it’s like it’s too late.  I’ve lost any feelings I could have had after everything he’s said and done.  I can’t get myself to do it.  I’ve even found another place to live and everything.  I’ve gone to look at the apartment and I like it.  I just have to call the lady and tell her I like the place and want to sign the lease and give her a deposit, but I know once I do all that, there’s no going back.  It’s done, and I have to do it.  It’s like I’m paralyzed.  I know what I have to do, but I can’t do it.  I’ve never been able to stand hurting people, even if they’ve treated me shitty.  I don’t even know how to start the conversation.   I hate shit like this.  So fucking much.  It’s bad that I want him to break up with me instead.  It’s really bad that I wish I could catch him cheating and I would be justified in just ending it and walking away.  Why does this have to be so hard?

So I was going to move out this weekend, but he blew the rest of what money I would have had left if I paid my deposit and 1st month’s rent.  So I decided to try to move out next weekend.  Texted the landlord if it would be okay if I waited one more week, and she never responded.  So I don’t know if that means yes, or fuck you.  So I may have lost my apartment.  I’m not sure.  I hate when people just flat out don’t respond.  At least if you are displeased with me tell me to fuck off so I’m not wondering…
I also just couldn’t do it.  I couldn’t tell him.  I don’t think I’ll ever be able to honestly.  I say I’ll try to move out next weekend, but I won’t have the guts.  I know myself.  I’m a fuck up and a chicken shit.  My feelings don’t matter.  I’ll just pretend and be miserable the rest of my life.  Seems easier at this point.  I’m so fucking depressed and disappointed in myself and in life.  I hate myself.  I’m such a chicken shit.  And maybe I’m the villain.  Maybe I’m the piece of shit in this relationship.  I’m fucking hopeless.

I finally got up the guts and put down the deposit today.  That means there’s no going back now.  Now is the hard part; telling him I can’t do it anymore.  I just want to be by myself.  I dread the conversation.  I hate hurting anyone.  I know it’s right though.  More and more often these days, even though he’s being nicer than usual, I see all the little ways in which we are not compatible.  I’m trying to look at it in a more logical and loving perspective.  For a while I was fed up with how shitty he had treated me and I was super angry.  And now I have come to terms with the fact it can’t work out and I feel bad.  I look at it in a more compassionate way in which I think, “we’re just not compatible” instead of “he is a narcissistic  monster.”  He has been nicer, but it’s to the point it doesn’t matter anymore.  Too much has been said and done.  I look at all the things I love to do, all the shows I love to watch, all the things I find funny, and he doesn’t like any of that stuff.  No one is ever going to have all the same interests as someone else, but you need to have something in common besides… eating.  I laugh at things and he asks me why I’m laughing because that’s not funny.  I make jokes that other people laugh at, but when I say the same thing in front of him, I get no reaction.  The man has no sense of humor.  I’m bored.  I don’t feel smart, or funny, or beautiful.  I can’t remember the last time he told me I was pretty or even remotely attractive.  I get comments about my weight and things about myself I need to change, but that’s about it.  I like to actually talk about important things… deep things.  Things that make me feel.  He doesn’t.  The only things we’ve ever talked about are um… credit scores, what needs to be bought at the grocery, the things that need to be fixed on my car… lots of topics about him… golf, poker… he gets disinterested anytime I try to talk about myself, so I just gave up on that a long time ago.  Then he asks why I don’t say anything.  Why would I?  You’re not interested.
I still can’t forget the times I’ve tried to talk to him about my mom’s issues when she started hearing voices and he turned the conversation around to himself… somehow… because talking about her didn’t interest him.   For some reason he tries to say things about my brother that make him appear like a bad person, even though he’s only been around my brother a handful of times… and only talked to him for about 5 minutes each time.  He’s made his mind up that my brother’s girlfriend is lazy and doesn’t even love my brother… even though he’s never met her.  She has MS.  She can’t exactly get around a whole lot now.   And anytime I go to help my mother go to the doctor, it’s like he gets mad.  He said something about how she was inconveniencing me.  My relationship with my mother has been rocky, so it’s not like me to defend her a whole lot… but I did that time.  The woman didn’t have a ride and needed to go to the doctor.  I helped her.  It’s what family does.  And I realized if I was defending my mother (a rarity), then this just wasn’t right.
There are other instances where he was plain cruel to me.  Just terrible.  He made me take his cat to the vet (even though I had to work that day and he works from home).  I paid for it (because he doesn’t make shit for money).  So I signed the papers with my name because I  didn’t think it was legal to forge his.  When I got back he started yelling at me because that cat was in my name now… and I  can’t even remember what was so bad about that.  Anyway, he yelled at me for like an hour about it.  I started crying and then he got mad at me for crying…. told me it was making him uncomfortable.  I was so tired and I hadn’t slept much since I had to get up early and take the cat to the vet.  Then I had to go to work after all the non-sleeping and crying.  It was so awful.  I don’t want to think about it anymore.  He ended up taking that kitten back (I had bought the cat for him) because it was too playful (it’s a fucking kitten).  It would scratch stuff occasionally (not anymore than any other cat) and he was worried about all his precious belongings.  That’s a whole other experienced I can’t even think about.  Because I remember the kitten had hurt itself (got its paw caught on something) and it was crying out and I was tryi9ng to get him to come over and help, and instead, he started yelling at me and the kitten that he was trying to cook and couldn’t deal with all that.  Wouldn’t help.  Just asked me why I couldn’t figure out what’s going on and started yelling.  Thinking about all that makes me fucking angry now.  Fucking ass-hole.  Now I don’t feel so bad about leaving.  So, it’s time.  I can’t do it anymore.  I have to suck it up, and just do it.

I’m writing again.  Twice in one day.  The last entry I meant to talk about how I was excited to be by myself, but it turned into something completely different.  Anyway, I can’t wait to do whatever I want, eat whatever I want, talk to whoever I want.  I can play on my phone without feeling like I’m doing something wrong.  I will be able to lose weight again.  I can watch whatever I want, listen to whatever I want.  I can light all the fucking candles I want.  I can make as many messes as I want.  I think I’ll just run through the apartment throwing clothes everywhere just because I fucking can.  My cat doesn’t ever scratch anything except scratchers that I buy him (I don’t know how I got so lucky that he just knows…) but I might encourage him to fuck something up just because I know it would have pissed off the douche-copter, and I honestly don’t even fucking care.  I can have friends over.  We can actually laugh and drink and talk about things I like to talk about.  We can go to the bar only several FEET from my apartment.  We can listen to music I love.  And sorry it it’s TMI, but I can invite someone over just to fuck if I want to.  I can text my friend Cheris if I want to.  She’s one of my best friends at work, and she’s also a lesbian.  He found out she liked chicks and I could tell he didn’t like it.  He said, “Don’t you think it’s weird she’s one of your best friends and she likes girls?”  Like he thought I would end up cheating on him with Cheris.  I said, “First of all, I’m not into chicks, second of all, she’s engaged to a beautiful girl that she’s crazy in love with.  So, no.  I see nothing ‘weird’ about it.”  But since then, I keep the texting to her to a minimum.  Well, I keep texting to anyone to a minimum because he thinks I’m texting some guy if I just pick up the phone to text my mother.
I will be able to celebrate my birthday and holidays the way I want to.  I wanted to go out with friends for my birthday last year, but when I mentioned it to him, I couldn’t tell he didn’t want me to go.  So on my birthday he made me get my own food and then slept the rest of the day (I was fine with that.)  I sat on the couch getting drunk by myself.
I haven’t gotten to do anything for Halloween the past few years.  I kept suggesting we go to a haunted house, but he never would.  I can celebrate Christmas.  I’m not religious and neither is he, but I asked him if we could at least go see pretty lights and he said he didn’t want to.  I want to have my own Christmas tree.  The past few boyfriends I’ve had have this big thing against fake looking trees.  Like, I want a white tree with red ornaments and lights, but they always want a green tree.  I want to invite people over to celebrate with me.
I want to get another cat too.  A friend for Dexter.  And I don’t give a shit if it tears anything up.  I really don’t give a fuck.
I can decorate my entire apartment however I want.  I think I’ll go for a creepy/gothic look in the apartment.  Lots of black and red.  Skulls.  Just creepy.  It’s going to be awesome.  Sad thing is, at first I won’t even have any furniture.  I think I’m going to be sleeping on a pile of blankets for the first couple weeks.  Maybe.  I miss being myself.  I miss it so much.  I’m usually better at writing… and making things funny.  But I’ve felt like I’ve lost my sense of humor.  I’ve lost part of me.  I hope I can get it back.

I’m feeling pretty anxious today and I can’t shake the feeling.  On the way to work, I hit a pothole, then a few minutes later, it sounded like there was something rattling under the hood of my car.  Not good.  Didn’t have time to figure out what it was before I had to walk into work… not that I would be able to… I know nothing about cars.  This is not a good time to have anything go wrong with it.  I just paid a deposit and 1st month’s rent on an apartment.  I don’t need to pay thousands to get a car fixed. 😑
I know what I have to do this weekend.  I know I HAVE to and I will, but I don’t like it.  I’m anxious about it.  I’d say maybe I should just get it over with…but then I’d have to spend the next few days with him being upset or trying to convince me to change my mind, because I have to work, and I won’t have time to move out until Sunday.  I guess I just wish I could skip the next few days and not have to break up with him, and just magically be moved into my new apartment without having to have the difficult conversation.  Although I know it’s definitely the right thing to do, I also know myself.  Once it’s done, I’ll start questioning myself on whether I did the right thing.  I’m just scared right now.

Do you ever look at everything in your life and think, “what’s the fucking point?”  I get up, get ready, go to work, come home, watch tv, eat, sleep…repeat.  When the weekends come, I don’t feel like doing anything except binging on food, alcohol and tv.  Nothing else really seems to matter to me, except my cat.  Other than that, I feel like everything is pointless.  I’m working for what?  I think maybe I always need a goal to work towards, otherwise, I’m bored.  I finally got the job I wanted, and now that I got it, I’m like, “Now what?”  I do love writing.  I’ve got this whole book series in my head that I want to write.  I’ve written the first book, but I’ve felt like I haven’t had the time or energy to work on the rest.  It feels pointless.
I don’t ever have fun.  I don’t get to hang out with friends.  I don’t go anywhere or do anything.  And I know most people are like, “Okay, there’s your solution… go do those things!”  I can’t.  I am with someone who I think doesn’t like for me to go out with friends.  He says he’s not like that, but I’ve mentioned going out with friends before and he’s like “Do what you want, I’m not controlling…” but the tone doesn’t feel that way.  You say you’re not controlling, but why do you ask me what I’m doing every time I pick up my phone, or get a text or a phone call?  If I actually did go out with my friends, would there be consequences?  Maybe I’m wrong.  And no, I can’t get away.  I’ve already tried that, and I was unsuccessful because I felt too terrible leaving and I felt horrible anxiety being alone just for those few hours.  So, no.  I can’t.  I’m stuck.  Forever.  If I did want to leave, I have no where to go and no money.  So, that’s that.  That’s life.  Life is either miserable or boring.  I’ve never felt much joy.  Ever.  All these TV shows and movies romanticize so many things in life… like love and friendships, travel… all this stuff seems like it would be amazing, but it’s not.  Not really.  I don’t know why we’re even here.  It’s horrible and awful most of the time.  I don’t understand why I was even forced into this stupid world by my shitty parents.  It’s all fucking pointless.

Okay, so I used to use this diary back in high school about a thousand years ago, and I would write about everything that happened in my day.  Lately, I have just been writing about all my depressed feelings.  It’s not really much entertainment-wise.  Maybe I’ll try to do the whole “everything I did today” thing.
I work at a factory for a popular brand of cheese.  I started as a temp in the laboratory.  It’s something I just randomly decided to apply for because my brother worked there.  Once I started working there, I realized I loved it.  I loved being in the lab.  The work was easy for me, and I loved everyone I worked with.  Unfortunately, they were only supposed to keep me 3 months, but I did such a good job, they kept making excuses to supervisors to keep me for another 6 months… until they couldn’t find any more excuses.  They decided they didn’t need a temp anymore and I had to change jobs.  It was around the starting of covid, so they shoved me into a job where I had to walk around the building sanitizing doorknobs, tables, etc..  It was fucking awful.  The most boring job I’ve ever had in my entire fucking life.  I did that for about 2 months until I finally got an interview to be hired on full time.  I ended up working in packaging- throwing cheese in boxes and palletizing for hours and hours.  Not so bad, but I got burnt out very quickly.  Finally a full time job came open in the lab and I was able to apply again.  I got the job.  Then a lead position opened up and I got 2nd shift lab lead position.  Now here I am.
I explain this because some funny shit happens at this place all the time.  I love MOST of the people here.  There are rarely any ass-holes.  But they are all a little silly, kind of dumb, and it’s a very conservative area (I am very liberal, so I keep my opinions to myself).  It’s also in the country, so there are a lot of country bumpkins that work there.  I’ve also had almost every dude in the building hit on me in some form or fashion.  I am 36 years old, and I’ve had a wide range of dudes from 18 years old to 40ish-50ish hit on me.  Some of them even have girlfriends or are married.  So if anybody wondered if they should still have faith in the male gender… don’t.  lol.  I’m kidding… kind of.
So, if I’m going to be talking about everything that happens in my day, it will usually involve work, so there is some background info for ya.  I’m not going to name the exact place because I’m going to be talking about some weird shit that goes on there, so it’s best not to incriminate anyone or any company.  One of the weirdest things that happens there on occasion, is somebody shits all over the bathroom.  This is not an exaggeration.  I walked in one time, walked by the first stall, did a double-take and just stood and stared.  Shit was everywhere.  It was wiped all over the toilet seat, all over the back of the toilet, on the walls and door of the stall, on the toilet paper holder.  I slowly walked back out to find a janitor.  The sad thing is, this happens about once over 4-5 months.  I’m guessing it’s one person?  A serial-shitter, perhaps?  I have no idea who would do it, or why.  It has to be done on purpose.  I understand the concept of explosive diarrhea, but I just don’t understand how it could end up on the walls.  It wasn’t near the cheese or anything, so don’t worry about that.  We have it set up so you physically can’t go into the production area without washing/sanitizing your hands.  It’s a machine that won’t let you pass until you stick your hands in and clean them.  It also cleans your shoes.
That’s all for this entry.  I’ll start trying to do a run-down of my day.  I know nobody really cares, but I went back to read my entries from high school, and it was actually pretty fun for me to remember those mundane things.  So if anything, years from now, I can read back on this weird shit again and laugh.

I do love my job.  The people there are fucking characters.  We have two sides of the building that make 2 different types of cheese.  One side makes a fondue type cheese, and the other side makes a more solid type cheese.  As mentioned in my last entry, I won’t name the actual brands because I don’t want to incriminate anyone or the company.  It’s just best to play it safe.  I always joke that both sides are made of completely different people.  The fondue side seems to be comprised of older folks.  That side of the building seems to be cleaner.  The bathrooms, break rooms, and locker rooms are even bigger and cleaner.  Anytime I go into their breakroom, they are usually pretty chill and polite.  The other side of the building is made up of younger people around 18 years- lower 30s.  These people are fucked up.  In a good way.  lol.  They are a fucking mess.  They throw their uniforms fucking everywhere in the locker rooms.  That side of the building is usually where the serial-shitter strikes (usually, not always).  They got big mouths and they curse more (not that I’m one to judge).  They are just grosser over-all.  When I switched jobs last year I had to go from the fondue side to the other, and I used to always joke it was like going from first class on the Titanic to 3rd class with the rat shit.  Either way, you know that mother fucker is going to sink, though.
I’ve had dudes from both sides of the building hit on me, but in different ways.  On the fondue side, they are usually more conservative in their approach.  They usually tell me I have pretty eyes.  One of them even bought me a drink from the canteen in the break room.  On the other side of the building, I’ve had much more ballsy attempts.  One man asked if I wanted to have a three-some with him and his wife.  I politely declined.  I asked one guy why he was staring at me one day, and without hesitation he said, “Because I want to fuck you.  That’s why.”  Just straight forward.  Got to admire they courage, I suppose.  One day I had to sit in their breakroom while waiting for a meeting.  While I was in there, one guy came in complaining his balls were sweaty and sticking to his leg (people were eating, but didn’t seem to care).  A lady beside me burped with the conviction of a 400 pound man.  My cousin (he works there too) was complaining of a stomach ache and farted a couple of times.  Another guy came up and offered me something in a box.  I opened it and came face to face (head?) with a large penis-shaped chocolate.  You know, it was about the size of one of those chocolate bunnies they made us sell in middle school for marching band.  One girl screamed and walked away when she saw it.  I told the guy I’d seen bigger.  He seemed impressed.  That’s also the day I told everyone in there, “This side is so much different than fondue.  I go in their breakroom and they are talking about fishing and baking cakes.  I come in here, and you people are talking about balls and offering me penis-chocolate.”  They all laughed like they were pleased with themselves.
Just today I went outside to talk to our janitor lady about something.  A guy on a forklift came up honking his horn, and cat-calling at me.  I’ve only talked to this guy a couple times, but he was like, “Heyyyy, girl.  There’s my girl!”  I looked around to make sure it was me he was talking to.  I guess he could have been talking to the janitor, but I thought he was looking at me.  She was like, “Are you okay?”  He just giggled and said gleefully, “I forgot to take my medication!”  Fantastic.  That’s exactly the kind of person you want cruising around on heavy-machinery.  LOL.  I’ve got to get back to work now, though.  More to come!

I feel like a giant pile of gorilla shit.  It feels like a 600 pound man is sitting on my head.  I think I have sinus problems or pressure, or whatever the fuck you want to call it.  I also feel sluggish.  I ran out of my depression medication and it usually helps with energy and appetite.  So right now I feel like I want to eat until my stomach explodes, then sleep until I die.  My medication was delivered a few hours ago at my apartment, but I’m at work right now.  I can take it when I get home, but for now, I shall suffer in miserable silence.  Okay, maybe not silence.  I’ll complain about it. . . a lot.

1013,https://www.opendiary.com/m/mnmchick2004/defeated-81-6111160/,2022-05-03,Defeated.,"
I can’t wait for this day to be over.  So, there’s this cute stray cat that’s been hanging out around my apartment.  He’s so sweet.  It has something wrong with its eye, and it’s been sneezing, sounds like it can hardly breathe.  I called the animal control/care place and explained the situation to them, and they said to bring him and they would take care of him.  The place is kind of on my way to work, but also kind of out of the way.  So I got up 30 mins early to take him.  We get him in the carrier (which made me feel terrible).  I wish you could explain to animals that what you are doing is going to help them… but anyway.  I head that way.  I get there and they lady says she won’t take him (after only looking at him for 20 seconds).  She says it’s an upper respiratory infection and will go away on its own.  I know I’m not a vet or a doctor, however, my cat has had upper respiratory infections… in fact he gets one usually about once a year.  It goes away within a few days.  5 tops.  This cat has been sick for several weeks, and this shit hasn’t gone away.  Then she said there’s nothing they can do for his eye, he was just born with it like that… which again, not sure I believe because it honestly feels like she just wants me to go away and doesn’t want to help.  The whole situation is baffling considering the person who I talked to on the phone said they WOULD help.  I was pissed.  If I had to take this cat back to my apartment, I was going to have to go 30 mins back the other way, then drive to work.  I definitely would have been late.  I called N and told him about the situation.  Luckily he called some other places and he found one that would actually take him and help him, so he met me halfway back, took the cat, then took it to the place.  I was still almost late to work.
I feel like I can’t wait for every day to be over.  Life just feels so… stupid.  I  guess that’s a lame word to really describe the magnitude of my feelings.  I’m just… bored.  With life.  I don’t feel joy.  I very rarely ever have.  What’s the point of all this?  I don’t really know.  I don’t have anything to really look forward to.  I also wonder what other people look forward to.  A lot of people that work here seem to look forward to spending time with family, kids, ect.  I’m not that kind of person.  I don’t have kids and I most certainly don’t want any.  What’s left of my family is my mother, who is hard to deal with, and my brother, who has his own life.  He doesn’t really seem to care much about me lately.  He has a kid and a girlfriend.  A lot of people consider themselves “family people.”  I don’t.  I guess my parents were so shitty to me when I was a child, I just don’t like to talk about or think about family.  My cat is my family.  I’d do pretty much anything for that sweet baby.  I’d jump in front of a fucking train for him.
There are so many things I wish I could do, but I don’t think I can.  It’s all unrealistic.  Everything is so romanticized anyway, so even if I do something… it never turns out the way I planned.  I never feel the way I thought I would feel.  It’s all kind of a huge let down.  I don’t know.  I guess I’m just feeling depressed.  Again.  Ugh.  I’m sick of feeling like this.  Unfortunately, I’ve felt like this since I was about 7 years old.  Severe depression and anxiety in first grade that went undiagnosed until I was about 27 years old.  Instead of seeing it for what it was, my parents thought I was just trying to get out of school, or trying to get attention.  It wasn’t that.  I just remember feeling so scared all the time and I didn’t know why or how to articulate it as a child.  I just knew that it was making my parents and teachers mad, so I decided to pretend not to feel that way.  All the other kids didn’t seem to have that problem, so I decided I would try to act like a normal kid so I could stop making adults mad.  I don’t know about that whole nature vs nurture thing… I don’t know if a chemical imbalance I’ve always had, or a side effect of shitty parents (maybe both?).  My dad was a strict ass-hole and my mother was just not a smart person.  She’s also very close-minded, conservative.  Nothing like myself. Anyway, I’ve just always felt shitty.  I’ve always imagined things would get better.  I’ve always dreamed that life could be much better than it really is.  It’s not.  What a fucking disappointment.  I guess I’m just tired of everything.  I don’t know.  I’m… defeated.  Done.

I don’t really know what to write, but sometimes I start and find myself talking about something…  I started taking a higher dose of my depression meds.  It’s not an SSRI.  Those tend to make me gain weight and act like a completely different person.  Mine is bupropion xl.  I’m up to 300 mg.  Is that the highest?  I’m not sure.  I’ll have to look it up.  I don’t usually have a lot of side effects.  I’ve had a lot of dry mouth, that’s kind of annoying.  It also seems to reduce my appetite quite a bit.  That’s good because I really need to lose the weight I gained in in the last couple of years.  My weight is always up and down.  It’s so frustrating.  I’ve been as little as 108 pounds and as big as 214.  It’s a constant struggle, and I honestly wish I had been blessed with being skinny and never having to worry about gaining weight.  I wish I could eat whatever the fuck I want and stay skinny.  It pisses me off.  I wish I never had to think about weight ever again.  If only it could be that easy.  Right now I’m much bigger than I want.  Not my biggest, but big enough.  And I’m only 5′ 1 and a half.  It sucks.  And I fucking love food.  Damnit.  For a few years I had an eating disorder.  Well, I’ve actually had it on and off since I was 17 years old.  That’s 20 years, holy shit.  Anytime I do lose weight, it’s usually because I starve myself.  I can’t seem to do it normally.  There are many times I wish I had it back.  I miss it, as sick as it sounds.  And sometimes I do go back.  Maybe that’s what I can do.  I’ve been looking for a goal, or some meaning out of life… something to look forward to.  That’s fucked up.  I’m so fucked up.  Why am I even a person on this planet with a mind so fucked up?

My depression is bad today.  It’s the kind that makes me not want to do anything at all.  It reminds me of when it was at my worst… I worked in a really toxic workplace.  It was an office with the worst boss I’ve ever had in my entire life.  I was in a very emotionally abusive relationship and a lot of other things going on.  I remember sitting at my computer and just staring at the screen for hours doing nothing some days.  Like, I was so depressed, I physically could not get myself to do anything.  It’s not like that right now, but it feels like it could be heading in that direction.
I am 36 years old and life is a huge fucking disappointment.  This is not what I thought it would be.  As dramatic as it sounds, I wish I could fucking sue my parents for forcing me into this world.  Some people should not be parents, and they are in that group.
Saturday I talked with someone… someone who I thought cared about me, but it turns out, they didn’t ever really care about me as much as I thought.  They used to make me feel special, but they gave me some brutally honest confessions that made me realize that I was NEVER special at all.  I was just someone they used…with a lot of other someones.  That’s a kick in the vagina.  When you already feel worthless inside and have horrible self-esteem… then that one thing you thought made you a little special turns out to not be what you thought it was… it will send you spiraling even deeper into hopelessness.  I keep asking myself everyday what is the point of all this?  I still can’t find the answer.
I feel bad physically and emotionally.  I keep gaining weight because I keep eating to make myself feel better.  It’s out of control and I feel like I can’t stop.  Right now I feel like I can barely breathe in the pants I’m wearing.  It’s uncomfortable and humiliating.  Something needs to change because I can’t keep feeling like this.
Humiliation.  That’s the key emotion I am feeling right now.  I am humiliated that someone made me feel special when it was all a big fucking lie.  I feel like a joke.  An absolute fucking humiliation.

1018,https://www.opendiary.com/m/mnmchick2004/sick-2187-6113825/,2022-05-16,Sick,"
Last Thursday I started feeling really bad.  I started getting a headache, but the different kind I normally have.  Usually my headaches are specific to a certain area of my head.  This one was all over, and I knew it was my “sick” headache.  Then started feeling weird body aches and chills and started feeling nauseous.  I went home and took my temp and it was 100.5.  I took some excedrine and that lowered the fever for a while, but it came back.  When I woke up, I told N I was sick, but he was just like “Oh,” and he didn’t even look up from his phone and kept scrolling.  I later mentioned I shouldn’t go to work, but he was like, “I feel bad everyday, but I still do stuff.”  He doesn’t have an actual job.   It’s some online stuff that doesn’t even make much money at all.
But anyway, he was like, “I feel hot and get headaches too, but I still go out to the store and stuff even if I don’t want to.  I’m pretty sure I have fevers all the time.”  I asked him if he ever takes his temp, and he said, “I don’t need to, I know it’s a fever.”  He’s a hypochondriac to some extent and won’t admit it.  If he is even mildly uncomfortable or inconvenienced, the world ends.   When we all had to start wearing masks everywhere because of covid, he would go in a store and start complaining how he couldn’t breathe, then leave me in there and walk out.  I wear masks at work all day every day.  I don’t complain because I know it’s something I have to do.  You also get used to breathing in one, if you aren’t too busy being a baby about it.
Anyway, so he was dismissing me being sick and saying he goes places while feeling bad.  Um, you go to the store.  I have to get up, take a shower, get dressed, drive 45 fucking minutes to work, work physically for 8 hours, then drive back home 45 minutes.  That’s different than taking a 20 minute trip to the store, which I wouldn’t expect him to do if I truly believed he was actually sick.  But anytime I do feel bad, I am dismissed.  Like I’m not really sick and my pain couldn’t possibly be as bad as his.  I even said, “Maybe I should take one of our at-home covid tests, just to be safe because I don’t want to get anyone else sick if I go in.”  He was like, “I really don’t think you need to do that.  It doesn’t seem necessary.”  WTF?
And I rarely call in to work.  Like, I’ve called in twice in the 3 years I’ve worked at this place and once was because I couldn’t drive 45 minutes in the snow and ice in my tiny VW beetle with shitty tires, and the 2nd time is because I was with my mom when she went to the hospital, so when I mention calling in, it’s not thought about lightly.  Anytime I DO mention calling in, he gets mad for some reason, and says I shouldn’t do it.  There was even a day, it was snowing so fucking hard, but I left anyway, started my long journey…. the roads were terrible and I was only going about 20 mph, then my work called while I was on the road and told me they called everything off and I could go back home.  So I turned around and headed back home.  When I got back, it was like he was so pissed off for some reason.  He was like, “So I spent that time cleaning the snow and ice off  your car for no reason?”  I said, “I didn’t ask you to, I could have done it, no big deal.”  And he went on and one for an hour about how stupid it was that my work called everything off.  I couldn’t understand why he was so mad I didn’t go to work.  It’s not like we’re hurting for money.  I make pretty decent even though he makes almost nothing.
So, last Friday when I was sick and mentioned calling in, and he dismissed me, I just went in anyway.  I felt like the walking dead.  I was so nauseous, I had to keep sitting down, so I didn’t throw up.  Every time I sat down, I would feel better, but if I had to get up and walk around, I felt terrible.  I was so relieved when I finally got home Friday night and just went to bed.  I feel better now, except a bit of a lingering headache.
Sometimes I really fucking hate him.

I’ve been feeling really bad physically.  I was sick last Friday and I thought I had gotten better, but headaches and a persistent cough are lingering.  Also a general feeling of weakness and fatigue.  Part of me wonders if it’s because I was sick, or if it’s physical symptoms of my depression as I start to feel more and more hopeless that life is worth anything.  I just always feel shitty.
Every day I hope something good will break up the monotony.  Blah.  A miracle.  I don’t believe in miracles, but when you’re as low as I feel, you start to hope for the impossible.  36 years of misery on earth, with very little joy is enough to make anyone depressed.
I don’t feel like doing anything.  I can’t concentrate on much.  I have to push my body to keep going.
But what’s the point?

I have to drive 45 minutes to work everyday.  Now, I’m not the greatest driver, I’ll even admit that, but what the fuck is wrong with some people?  I hate doing this drive everyday simply because of other people.  At least once a week on the interstate I come across someone going just little bit slower than me, so I get in the lane to pass them, then they speed up.  So now I’m going slower than them…okay fine, I’ll just go back in the slow lane.  Then they slow down again, so I try to go to pass them, and they speed up… AGAIN.  I encounter someone like this at least once a week and I’m so FUCKING tired of it.  Why do people do that?  I don’t understand.  Does nobody use cruise control anymore?  I’m just so fucking sick of it.  It just slows me down, because I could slow down to go way slower than them so I don’t catch up to them anymore, but I really don’t want to do that.  I don’t want to go any faster because I don’t feel like getting a ticket… so I’m just stuck by some ass-hole constantly speeding up and slowing down.  GRRRRRR.  Sorry for the rant.  I’m just sick of it!!

I’ve been really angry lately.  Even the smallest things piss me off.  I don’t take it out on anyone.  It’s more internal.  If I’m alone, I’m constantly cursing about one thing or another.  F bombs constantly fly out of my mouth.  My day always starts out the same: interacting with a non-affectionate and non-empathetic person as soon as I get up.  Showering and getting ready while my cat meows the whole time, making me feel guilty for leaving.  Spending 45 minutes driving to work in shitty traffic, and now horrible construction and shitty drivers.  I get to work and it’s usually ok.  It is the best job I’ve ever had.  I like everyone in the lab and the job is easy for me.  It’s just that… cheese quality isn’t exactly a passion for me.  So I make it through everyday to get off work, drive another 45 minutes back home, which isn’t near as bad at night.  So many less drivers on the road.  Then I come home to the same non-affectionate, non-empathetic person, I eat, watch TV for a few hours, cuddle/play with my cat, then sleep.  Then get up and do it all over again.  Is this really what life is about?  Is this all there is?

I had another fever last night and my coughing started again.  What is this?  I was sick almost 2 weeks ago, was feeling better, then it’s like the symptoms started again last night?  It’s concerning, honestly.  I know it’s a bit dramatic to say, but years ago my dad started having random fevers with no known cause, and it turned out to be cancer.  Yeah, I know.  Anytime someone gets sick, they google their symptoms and think they have cancer.  But it does scare me that I was better, and now I’m having the same symptoms again.  N was, of course, not helpful.  This time I knew better than to ask for help or expect any kind of sympathy.  I just toughed it out and cried a little by myself in bed until I started feeling good enough to fall asleep.
You ever meet someone really stupid and they think they are smart?  Like, they think they know everything, more than you?  But you KNOW without a shadow of a doubt that you are smarter than them, but you also know there’s no way to convince them of it?  That’s N.  I’m fucking sick of him.  I should have stayed at the apartment by myself.  Now I’m stuck again.  I just felt bad and thought, he knows I’m not happy, so maybe he’ll at least try to fix things.  Nope.  Still no effort or affection.  And now I can’t save money because he keeps blowing it.  I am stuck forever.
I am honestly tired of feeling this way.  I know if anybody does actually read my diary on a consistent basis, it is all the same.  Me being depressed, bitching about how I see no joy in life, and how I hate my BF.  I don’t want to feel like this anymore.  I’ve never been happy my whole life.  I’m tired of feeling shitty physically and emotionally.  I wish things would actually go my way and I could get the things I truly wanted.  A part of me also hopes whatever is making me sick will just take me.  I can just die and finally be free of this misery.

I wish it were easy to just pack up and move to another country.  I really want to move to England.  America is getting to be too “handmaid’s tale” for me.  And now we got people shooting little kids (not that it’s a new thing).  I hate it here.  I am so ashamed to live here.  I want to pack up and start my life over again.  This shit is not what I wanted.  I didn’t even ask to be born, let alone in this shit-fest of a situation.  I am truly disappointed in humanity.
I am also considering just being single for the rest of my life, like… if I could get rid of N… I would never date a man again.  I am tired of being controlled and talked down to.  I’m just done with it all.  I’m tired of the bare minimum.  If that’s all I get, I can fucking take care of myself and my cat and be much happier.  Fuck, I’ll just fill a house with cats and live it up.  The other day at work, I was talking and laughing with Cheris and Bruno, and I thought, “I never laugh like this with N.  I never even say the things I just said because I have to censor myself.  This is not right at all.”
I don’t know.  I’m just so tired of this life.  There has to be more.  I keep saying that.  People are always like, “everything happens for a reason” and “things will get better” or “you’ll find your purpose.”  How am I supposed to believe that?  I’ve already seen family members die unhappy, never having found their “purpose” or “happiness.”  What if I die soon?  What if something happens to me?  I’ll just have lived this shitty life for no reason because my parents thought they “had” to have kids??  It makes no sense.  None of it.

I hit an all-time low this weekend depression-wise.  I’ve been trying to make the best of things, and yesterday I woke up and went to talk to N, and he started complaining about stupid shit.  Then he said something racist and I thought, “This is not who I thought I was with.”  When I first met him, I thought he was a nice person.  I thought maybe he had the same values as me.  It turns out I’m with a racist, sexist jerk.  No affection.  I don’t ever feel beautiful or smart or anything.  After the conversation, I just felt my mind shut-down completely.  I’ve tried so hard my whole life to make things better with no luck.  And I’m stuck here.  I can’t leave because I have no where to go and I can’t save money because he keeps blowing it.  So I am stuck.  I have officially given up on trying to make things better.  This is my life.  This is just all that it is.  I accept that now.  I have been depressed my entire life and I have accepted that after 36 years of trying to feel better, I’m too tired.  I’m done trying.  This is just the way I am always going to feel.  I know this now and I accept it.
And I started thinking about all the people in my life.  They all just talk to me when they need something or when I can do something for them.  No one truly cares about me.  People constantly use me all the time.  I feel like trash.  I feel easily discarded.  I’ve never truly felt loved or cared for.  I’ve felt like a burden.  I always felt disposable.  My best friend didn’t message me for 2 years, until she needed a job at the place I worked.  Then suddenly she started talking to me again.  She said she had just been depressed and anxious and dealing with stuff, which I get…I’ve been too depressed to respond to a text… but I did eventually get back to someone and it didn’t take me TWO YEARS.  And now that the job didn’t work out, she won’t respond to me anymore.  My brother doesn’t give a crap, he’s too consumed with his GF.  Ever since he got with her, she’s always been his first priority, even over his son.  I was hurting so badly a few years ago and anytime I tried to talk to him, his advice was dismissive at best.  He had other shit to worry about… her.
My BF sucks.  Any guy I’ve ever been truly interested in and I thought I could love, never felt the same way about me.  But they sure as hell didn’t mind using me when it was convenient.   Any relationship I’ve been in… I’ve honestly settled because I didn’t think I could do better, and they just got me treated like shit, emotionally and sexually abused.   There is no such thing as that big, beautiful love people talk about in movies and TV.  It’s not real.  At least not for me.  I’ve been so delusional thinking it exists.  So fucking stupid.
My parents shouldn’t have been parents.  I was a burden to them.  Emotionally abused and neglected.  Had to soothe myself if I was ever upset or dealing with anything.  I didn’t have anyone to go to.  I spent most of my years in my childhood just writing down all my problems and emotions in diaries so I’d feel a little bit better.  It was like pretending I was talking to a friend that actually cared.
I’m just done.  I’m done trying and hoping.  I can’t do any of this anymore.  I don’t want to.  I can’t.

I am really sick of people using me.  I give so much and receive little to nothing in return.  I feel so degraded and disgusting.  I keep letting someone take and take from me.  How can he not see that he takes and gives me absolutely nothing?  How does he think it’s okay?  Every time I’m mad and try to tell him how not okay it is, he is always able to smooth-talk his way out of it.  Why do I let him do these things to me?  How does he keep getting away with so much?  There is something seriously wrong with me.

The other day, I was talking to my boss, Heather, and she was telling me how her dad was sick and she found out unexpectedly, and she was driving to see him.  She said she called her friend (another one of our bosses), Taylor, and told him what was going on and not to be worried.  She said Taylor started telling her to pull over, he would come with her, or send his husband to go with her if she needed.  He was just generally very concerned for her well-being and wanted to be there for her.  She told me all that and I said without thinking, “Aw, I wish I had a friend like that.”  And I realized after I said it how sad of a statement it was.
It’s true.  I honestly feel like I don’t have anyone that would be there for me like that.  I used to, but my “best friend” only texts me once every 2 years apparently.  That’s not an exaggeration.   She literally went 2 years without responding to me.  When she finally texted me, she was apologizing saying she had been depressed and had anxiety. . . which I get, but then she started saying she applied for a job where I work.  We texted for a few weeks while she was waiting to hear back.  Finally, for reasons I don’t want to get into right now, she didn’t get the job.  And now she won’t respond to me again.  Awesome.  I want to text, “Okay, great talking to ya.  Talk to ya again in 2 more years!”
I was also watching Grey’s Anatomy the other night, and there’s an episode where Alex gets Meredith in trouble and gets her fired.  Christina (her best friend) finds out, and literally starts trying to physically fight him.  I almost started crying, because I know nobody has ever felt that strongly about me.  Nobody cares enough about me to fight somebody.  That sounds kind of fucked up.  I’m not condoning physical violence, I’m just saying . . . I’ve wanted to physically fight someone who wronged a person I cared about, I just didn’t do it, obviously.  No one feels that strongly about me.  No one cares to lose me.  No one fights for me.  I could literally disappear and no one would care to try to find me.  I’m just. . . convenient.  Easy.  Just there.  A back up.  A second choice.  I am no one’s first choice, and it fucking hurts.

It feels like the universe hates me.  The world feels like a terrible place where I’m constantly just waiting for bad things to happen.  I wish I didn’t feel like this.  It’s a really fucking scary feeling.  I can’t tell anyone because I have no one to talk to anymore.  I hate my life. . . and myself.

So our apartment has been taken over by new owners.  That means that they want us to sign a new lease.  They are raising the rent by $150 and they say we can’t have pets (even though we paid the last landlord a pet deposit).  We have an appointment to go talk to them tomorrow morning.  I won’t sign a lease that says no pets.  N says if they won’t let Dexter stay there that I can take Dexter to my mom’s.  Um.  No.  He asked if I wanted to be there if my cat wasn’t there.  I said no.  He asked if I would really pick a cat over him.  I didn’t respond, I changed the subject.  I won’t answer that outright until I have to.  IF they won’t let us keep Dexter, then yes, I WILL choose my cat over a selfish dick-head.  My cat has never yelled at me or treated me like shit.  So it’s pretty much a no-brainer here.  How he thinks it’s even really a real choice for me is beyond delusional.
I accidently knocked his laptop to the floor the other day.  I was leaving to go to work and I left my phone in the apartment.  I realized this once I got to the car.  I ran back inside, and it was so dark in the apartment after being out in the sun, I couldn’t see.  I was trying to be careful, but I still ran into the laptop stand and knocked it over.  I put it back, then grabbed my phone, and ran out the door because I was going to be late for work.  Later than night he yelled about me for about an hour and a half about knocking it over.  There wasn’t even anything wrong with it.  I didn’t break it, it works fine.  I didn’t do it on purpose, but he compared it to me hitting his car and driving off or something.  I said that was such a stretch, and I told him he’s materialistic because he cares more about objects than anyone else’s feelings.  So he just yelled at me forever until I started crying, then he called me a teenager for crying.  He said I shouldn’t cry because I’m an adult.  I called him out for gaslighting.  I said it’s perfectly normal for an adult to cry if they are being treated like shit, and calling me crazy or a child is gaslighting.  Anyway, after all that I don’t see how he could possibly think it’s even a close race between him and my cat.  It never has been, but definitely not now.
So, there’s this girl I used to work with and she’s moving in with her boyfriend.  She asked if I wanted to take over her lease at her apartment.  I told her I probably will.  I will let her know for sure after tomorrow’s meeting with the new greedy-fuck landlords.  And her apartment is really nice AND they allow pets.  If things go how I think they’re going to go, shit is pretty much about to blow up and I’m going to be living in this chick’s apartment with Dexter and leaving this ass-fuck douche-bag by himself.  I’m sick of him and I’m sick of being treated like garbage.  I’m so fucking over all this.  I fucking hate him.

Cats are so fucking funny.  Even when they are being ass-holes, they are still funny.  My cat tried to wake me up an hour earlier than I needed to this morning.  I tried to ignore him, hoping he’d give up, but Dexter is an adorable, persistent ass-hole.  He was literally tapping my shoulder with his paw.  I finally got up and followed him.  He was literally looking back at me as he walked to make sure I was following him.  He took me to his food bowl, which was already so full it was OVERFLOWING.  I was like, “Dexter.  There is food already there.”  He just looked at it, then looked at me expectantly.  He doesn’t like to eat what’s already there.  He likes it fresh from the bag.  So I poured like 5 little kitty kibbles on top, and he was satisfied.  He went to chomp-town on it.  I went right back to bed, hoping for another 45 minutes of sleep.  Nope.  Less than 5 minutes later, he’s back.  He starts just walking all over me.  Tried to ignore it.  He tried to lay on my side, unsuccessfully, and he fell off.  He did finally give up, but he ended up flopping his fat body on one of my feet, then began to groom himself so aggressively, he was shaking me and the whole bed.  I gave up on sleep and just laid there, letting him shake me, and listening to the gross sounds of him licking himself.  Even though I was irritated, I couldn’t help but still be amused.  I love that adorable bastard.
So, in other news, my mom has started hearing voices again.  It happens about every 3-6 months.  They never gave her an official diagnosis.  It seems no one wants to try hard enough to figure out what it is.  They said it’s not schizophrenia.  I suggested dementia and I’ve even heard that depressive episodes can be so bad that people have hallucinations and hear things.  She also had a very traumatic childhood because her father was an emotionally, physically, sexually abusive fuck-wad.  I’d like to piss on that mother-fucker’s grave.  He not only ruined her life, but all of her sisters’ and her mother’s lives.  And it’s a trickle-down effect, as well.  Because she was so fucked up, she couldn’t be a decent parent to me.  She was never present.  Always sleeping, depressed, and she never got a great education, so she’s not the smartest person.  She had boundary and control issues.  So I can only get along with her when I DON’T have to spend more than a few hours with her.
Anyway, she takes meds for the voices, but sometimes she doesn’t.  My brother seems to think she actually IS taking her meds right, she’s just reached a certain point where she’s just really fucked up right now.  I don’t know what to do.  We’ve sent her places that help her for a few days, she gets better for just a little while, then it starts all over again.  As insensitive as it sounds, it’s always something with her.  Even before all the voices, she would have some sort of mysterious ailment every few months when she wasn’t getting enough attention.  She’d go to the emergency room, only to be told there was nothing wrong.  I’m just so tired of everything.  It’s all so exhausting.
I really need to start writing again.  I wrote my first book and posted it on inkitt.  It’s gotten a lot of reads and I’ve had a few requests for the 2nd book.  I’ve started on it, but I got kind of stuck.  I’ve got this whole 7 book series planned out, but I’ve just been so depressed, it hasn’t been a priority.  I really need to try.  I miss writing and being excited about my work.

I keep thinking… what if I just went home tonight, and just started packing all my shit then just left him?  I keep picturing it in my mind.  I’ve been trying to put up with it all.  But it’s getting to the point where I know one day he is going to say or do something, and I am just going to calmly get up and starting throwing all my shit in bags and boxes, take my cat, and just leave.  The only place I’d have to go would be mom’s… even though there is literally no room.   I guess I’d just have to sleep in the floor or something until I saved enough money to get my own place.  It’s getting bad.  I was trying to go to sleep last night and all I could think about was how much I fucking hate him.  It’s heading that way… I think it’s probably going to happen soon.  I’m going to get so fucking sick of being treated so terribly that I won’t even be able to stop my body from just reacting.  I’m so fucking depressed and angry.  I hate life.  I hate everything.

My mental health is pretty much in the depths of hell right now.  I keep asking myself what is the point?  I can’t find many reasons to keep going.  I don’t want to do this anymore.  The only reason I haven’t just taken myself out is my cat.  That is the ONLY reason.  No one else seems to really care about me.  I don’t have a best friend anymore.  All other friends have their own lives and I can’t even hang out with them because I’m afraid my douche-bag BF would get mad at me  for going to see them.  I’m trying to figure out why I would need to stay on this earth.  I just can’t do it anymore.  And I fucking HATE when people say, “It gets better…” Because it DOESN’T!!!  People have been telling me that since I was a child with shitty parents and was being bullied in school.  I am 36 years old.  I’d say if it was going to get better, I would have figured out a fucking way by now.  I have never been happy.  I have been miserable my entire fucking life and I am SICK of it.  I just can’t do it anymore.  And I’m so lonely.  Nobody fucking cares how much I am hurting.  Nobody cares that I would do so much for so many people who do literally NOTHING for me.  I’m tired of giving and giving and getting nothing in return.  I’m tired of doing things for people who treat me like trash.  I can’t do it anymore.  I just can’t.

I know I haven’t written much in a while.  I guess I just got tired of writing the same thing over and over. . . complaining about my depression, my BF.  I think I’ll try to write about other things.  I don’t really know what to say.  There’s so much I could get into, but I don’t even know where to start.
I was thinking about something last night.  It’s about the way I think.  I don’t know if anyone else has this problem, but most of the time, I always feel like I’m doing something wrong.  No matter what it is, even if I do really know I’m doing something right, I still feel like I’m doing it wrong.  The most basic tasks, I constantly question myself, “Am I doing this wrong?  Is there a better way I’m supposed to be doing it?”  At work I feel that way all the time.  Everything I do, I keep telling myself, “I think I’m doing this wrong.”  Even if I’m really not.  I found out that way of thinking comes from the way you were treated in childhood.  I always felt like I was doing something wrong.  I had to walk on eggshells around my dad.  He was always yelling at me for thing smallest things.  He would yell at me for not knowing something that children just don’t know yet.  He would say something like, “You’re not supposed to do that!”  Or “You’re supposed to do it this way!”  And there was no way I could have known  it until he told me.  So now everything I do, I feel like I’m wrong.  I’m not sure if I really explained all that right.  Hahah!  You see??!!   So basically, I feel like this is something seriously wrong with me that I don’t know how to fix.  And now I’m with someone who treats me the same way. . . pointing out all the things I do wrong (or the things I don’t do the way he does it).  It’s exhausting.
I can’t remember all the rules and shit that I’m supposed to do for everything in our apartment.  There is a certain way I’m supposed to shower.  You know I haven’t been able to shave my legs in months because I can’t take a shower long enough to do it.  He gets pissed about water usage, I guess, and hot showers making the apartment hot, but I’m the one who fucking pays for it.  I say if I want to pay to take a longer shower, I should be able to do it.  I could shave my legs later when I’m not taking a shower, I guess, but by that time, I’m too exhausted, and it doesn’t fucking matter anymore.  There’s a certain way to walk around stuff, a certain place to put stuff, there’s a certain way to close the door, and a certain lock I’m supposed to use. . . and fuck me if I accidently break something or knock something over. . . then I’m just irresponsible and I need to learn to watch where I’m going and what I’m doing.  Why can’t I just be more careful?  Why am I so clumsy?  Why do I make noise and drop things while he’s trying to sleep?!  I don’t mean to, but it doesn’t matter.
Fuck, I need a drink.

The beginning of my day is always the worst and most exhausting.  Waking up is a bitch.  Every morning I get up and I am disappointed I didn’t just die in my sleep, but of course, I accept my fate and move on.  I have to get up and shower.  Showering takes so much fucking energy out of me.  I like hot showers,  but douche-bag gets pissy when I take one because he says it makes the apartment hot.  If he’s ever even slightly uncomfortable, it’s the end of the world.  I’m not sure if I’ve ever met a bigger baby.  I take that back. . . both my other exes were giant babies, as well.  Anyway. . .
I have to get dressed, which takes a lot of energy.  I hate doing it because I’ve gained so much weight since I’ve been with him, that I feel disgusting.  I have to poke myself in both eyeballs just to get my contacts in.  Brushing my teeth feels tedious and I’ve always thought toothpaste is disgusting.  I then have to put on make-up, because if I didn’t, I’m pretty sure I could be mistaken for a short, fat man.  Putting it on feels tedious, as well.  All while I’m doing this, I’m trying to calm a cat that keeps meowing and rubbing against me, because he knows every time I take a shower, I’m about to leave for 10-12 hours.  It makes me feel awful, and I just want to stay home all day and cuddle that sweet baby.
I then have to get in the hot car, which the AC only barely works in this scorching heat lately… and I have to drive 45 minutes to work.  Now, I know I’m not a great driver, but I wonder what the actual fuck other people are thinking.  I feel like people do things on purpose just to piss me off.   I’ve already mentioned it in another entry, but at least once or twice a week, I encounter a person on the freeway that won’t use their cruise control.  I see I’m going faster than them, so I go to pass them, then they speed up suddenly.   So I’m like, “Okay, fine.  I’ll just drive behind you, no big deal.”  Then they slow down again.  I try to go to pass them again and they fucking speed up AGAIN!  It’s like they are purposefully fucking with me.  I’m just trying to get to work, and they are slowing me down.  Why do people do this?  Seriously?  Does nobody know what cruise control is anymore?  I just don’t understand it…
Then I get to work.  We have a huge parking lot, and because I work at an odd shift, people from both 1st and 2nd shift are already there, and I have to always park in the back. . .  in fucking Narnia and walk a whole fucking journey and cross the street to get to the building.  I have to walk through the building to get to the locker room where I have to change into my work uniform, which, like I said, changing clothes is exhausting for me too, especially when it’s hot.  Once all that’s done, I can finally start my day, which is usually fine… most of the time.
I’m just bitching.  I don’t know why I’m writing this.  It’s 1st world problems.  I have much bigger issues to deal with, but I’m tired of writing about how depressed I am and how much my BF is a tool-bag.  Don’t even get me started on my shitty country and it’s hatred toward women and other minorities, because I get fucking furious every time I think about it.  I used to be able to talk about such things with my best friend,  but she’s too busy not answering any of my messages to talk about it.  Anyway, I guess that’s it.

So, I was thinking about some things the other night. . . about some of the friends I had in high school, and the way they treated me and made me feel.  There are two in particular that I was thinking about. . .
One friend’s name was Ann Marie.  We had been friends since middle school. . . kind of.  She was one of those girls who was insanely smart.  Book smart.  So talented.  We both played clarinet in the band, and she was so good.  She was always first chair, no one could ever beat her.  Well, I did the first couple of years. . . we went back and forth, but I eventually lost a whole lot of interest in it and stopped practicing as much, so she blew past me in skill.  She was what was considered to be a really good person.  And I truly believe she had the best intentions and wanted to be/thought  she was a great person.  She tried to talk to everyone, was religious, never cursed, ect.  The thing is, looking back on things now. . . she didn’t treat me that great.  I wasn’t innocent either.  I was obviously a little jealous of her smarts and talent,  but not to the point where it could hurt our friendship too much.  I mean, yeah, I occasionally said some stupid shit about her being so perfect. I understand that’s shitty, and I know I shouldn’t have acted that way.   But, I pretty much accepted I just wasn’t as smart as her, and that was just the way it was, there was nothing I could do about it.   I didn’t realize it then, but there was one thing I was better at. . .  treating people with kindness and respect.  Having empathy.  Talking to people much nicer.  The thing is, when she did say rude things to people, she honestly didn’t think she was being rude.  She was smart, but I don’t think she was good at teaching people the things she knew.
She was also very judgmental about a lot of things.  If you didn’t do things a certain way, and if you didn’t fit in this perfect little box, she would bring up whatever it was, and make you feel bad about it.  There was one point in our relationship when she would tear apart EVERYTHING I said.  She would find SOMETHING wrong with everything that came out of my mouth.  She would try to correct me so much, it was hurting my self-esteem when I was already depressed.  I even remember one day I went to school, and I was like, “I’m just not going to talk at all today.  Maybe if I don’t talk at all, she can’t find something wrong with anything I say.  She won’t be able to hurt my feelings.”  Then she called me out and started saying I wasn’t talking because I just wanted attention from people.  I started crying.  She always used to always say things like, “Why are you so depressing?  Why are you always sad?”  Like, bitch, I wasn’t raised the way you were.  My family sucks.  Yours must treat you like a fucking queen if your self-esteem is so high that you can be happy all the time.
Things got a little better after that year, but I remember our senior year, I had starved myself and lost a bunch of weight, so I was just as skinny as her.  And she started lecturing me almost every day about eating.  Then I remember I started listening to Linkin Park, and she told me she was worried  about me because I was listening to such depressing music.  WTF?
I haven’t talked to Ann Marie in years, but last time I looked on Facebook, she was married and had a kid or 2.  I guarantee she’s still the same judgmental person.  If she knew half the shit I’ve done, she’d tell me I’m a bad person who went down a bad path.  Maybe not in those words, but that would be the gist of it.
I had another friend. . . a guy- Travis.  I had a major crush on him for years, and back then I thought he was a good person.  Looking back on things now, he treated me so poorly.  And not even in an outright way that I or anyone else would be able to catch it back then, but in such subtle, shitty ways, that I see now and wish I could go back and punch him in the face.  Like Ann Marie, was a church-goer, a person who didn’t curse, and he seemed to talk to everyone.  Most guys didn’t talk to me because I wasn’t very attractive, so the fact that he talked to me and told me his was my friend. . . that is what made me think he was a good guy/person.
I actually wrote about him and Ann Marie in this diary years ago.  I went back and read some of the stuff and I realize how shitty this guy treated me.  He knew I liked him.  KNEW it.  And he knew he didn’t feel the same way,  but he kept doing things to keep me around to boost his ego.  He would also say shitty things to me every once in a while just to put me down.   At one point he did act like he liked me the same way, only to completely change overnight, then start dating some girl he barely even knew.  Then at one point, after introducing him to some of my new friends, he asked one of those friends to prom after me and him agreed to go if we couldn’t find anyone else.  He knew it would hurt me.  And she knew how much I had liked him for so many years, but she didn’t care.  She said yes.  When I was understandably upset, they both gaslit me.  Him not as much as her.  She threw a fit and said she shouldn’t have to deal with me anymore.  I never even said anything bad to her, I was just visibly upset and could barely go without crying one night when we were at a basketball game, so she got mad at me and told Travis I was the bad guy and gaslit the fuck out of me, making me feel bad for feeling bad.  I fucking hate her now.  Yeah, I know that was years ago, just high school, but I wish I had stood up for myself more and could see how fucked up it was the way they treated me.
Anyway, a few years ago I saw on Facebook that he’s a Trump supporter now.  It makes no sense to me.  He read the Harry Potter books  (we were both huge fans, it’s how we got to be friends in the first place) and sees no fucking connection?  A lot of his posts are judgmental, conservative shit.  He completely missed the point of those books, that’s obvious.  Then I remember at the end of 2016 when everyone was posting about what a bad year it had been, he posted something like a pic of a calendar, in some smartass way of saying it was just a year, not bad.  Basically making it seem like everyone else was being dramatic and emotional. . . completely invalidating everyone else’s experiences.  And that’s the way it felt with him, if you got emotional, you were being dramatic.  He never said that, that’s the way it felt.  Like everyone else’s experiences were completely invalid if they actually felt emotions.  Again, he grew up in a decent family, so he didn’t understand how other people felt.
The person I am now. . . non-religious, liberal, feminist. . . these two “friends” would judge the fuck out of me now.  And I’m okay with that.  I used to think these were good people, and they’re not really.  The way they treat others and they’re lack of empathy is not okay.  I used to see myself as less-than those people, like I wasn’t good enough, smart enough, pretty enough.  It turns out, I’m glad I turned out the way I am and not like them.
I’m not exactly sure where I was going with all this. . . just thoughts.  It’s like looking at me life in a completely different way than the way I experienced it back then.

I don’t know what’s wrong with me.  For the past 3 months or so, I keep getting these random fevers accompanied by severe chills and body aches.  Sunday the body aches were so bad, I was crying.  It hurt just to sit.  I kept alternating between standing and sitting, rocking back and forth.  Last night I got chills so bad, I was shaking violently and couldn’t stop.  Of course N doesn’t ever care.  He always just says, “oh,” when I tell him I’m feeling any of these things, then he walks away.  No offer to help.  No sign of empathy.  Am I expecting too much?  Do I expect too much from people?  Is it selfish to want some kind of comfort.  A little over a month ago when I asked if he even cared he just said, “What am I supposed to do about it?”  And got mad.  I mean, I guess he’s right, there’s nothing he can do about it, but I just always thought your partner was supposed to at least comfort you… maybe even hold you when you’re shivering?  Maybe try to bring you water?  Meds?  I guess I’ve just always wanted too much from people.
But I’m scared.  I don’t know what it is and I’m afraid to know.  He doesn’t think I should go to the doctor.  I honestly think he doesn’t take me seriously at all.  Like he doesn’t believe I really feel that bad when these things happen to me.  We had a couple of covid tests, but they are suddenly missing?  I don’t know if he hid them or just moved them.  I can’t find them.  I was going to take one the last time I got a fever, but he said it was unnecessary to waste them like that…?
I feel so lonely.  All these movies and TV shows lied to us about how love is.  Men don’t really do those romantic things for us.  They don’t comfort us, or take us seriously.   They aren’t emotionally supportive.  I’ve never had anyone be that way to me.  Shit like that isn’t real.    Honestly, I wish he’d just go away.  I wish he would find someone else and leave me alone, because I would feel happier without him.  He makes me anxious and depressed.
It’s hard to explain, but as soon as I walk in the door of that apartment, I immediately feel like a different person.  I feel dumber, fatter, uglier that I did all day at work.  I don’t feel beautiful.  I don’t feel loved.  I feel disgusting.  I feel stupid.  I wish I had never been born.  I wish I were dead.

I’ve written this in a blog of mine once, but I wanted to write it here, as well.  There’s been this quote lingering in my head all weekend.  It’s from Legally Blonde.  Through the first part of the movie, Elle has been trying to get back with her ex-boyfriend, and has been doing everything she can to impress him, including going to Harvard law school.  But there is a moment halfway through when she’s talking to him and you can just see the realization on her face and she says, “I’m never going to be good enough for you, am I?”  Oof.  That parts hits me hard.  I think maybe we’ve all felt like that.  There is that one person you’d do anything for, or maybe you’ve done so much for them and it just doesn’t seem to affect them.
A few months ago CM came back to me.  Sort of.  Only for physical stuff.  And I know I’m foolish.  I kept thinking, him coming back meant SOMETHING.  Like I must mean SOMETHING to him.  But Saturday, the way he treated me, and the way he talked to me… it was like I was nothing, an afterthought.  And I just think about all the things I’ve done for him.  I’ve given him so much, and received nothing in return.  I have helped him through break-ups, listened to him talk about other girls because he was upset, I’ve defended him when other people talked about him behind his back, I’ve even let him borrow money when he needed food and gas.  He never even paid it back.  I never expected him to, but at the time he was so adamant about paying it back, but he never did.  I’ve given him my body and things I just can’t get back, and he barely thinks about me.  So yes, that quote keeps going through my mind over and over, and I’m on the edge of a meltdown.  I am NEVER going to be good enough for him.  EVER.  No matter what I do or say, I’m just not good enough.  And my heart is fucking broken.

I’m not quite sure where to start.  Well, Saturday I had another fever, chills, body aches.  When I told N, he was like, “Oh.  Well, anyway, I can’t decide what I want to eat.”  😑  I honestly hadn’t really expected a different reaction.  By now his selfishness doesn’t really surprise me anymore.  So, he was going on for like 30 minutes about how he couldn’t decide what to eat and how he’s tired of all the places we usually get food from.  Then he started saying how all the fast food workers are stupid and they don’t care.  I was like, “Should they care?  They get treated like shit everyday.  I wouldn’t care either.”  He’s always saying shit about people in fast food jobs and retail.  He’s has the stereotypical Karen judgement against them.  Which to me, makes no sense.  At least those people HAVE jobs.  He works from home doing computer stuff, but the term “work” is used loosely here.  He doesn’t really do much, and he certainly doesn’t make very much at all.  These fast food and retail workers that he constantly degrades make more money than he does.  Anytime I’ve mentioned him getting a job, he said he refused to work at those places.  I was thinking, “Why?  Because you know people would treat you the way you treat them?”  He couldn’t hold a job.  He throws a fit anytime he’s even slighly uncomfortable.  There’s no way he could handle being “too hot” or being sore or having anyone talk to him in a way he thinks is insulting.  He gets defensive if I ask him even the simplest questions.  I once asked him if he needed a napkin while we were eating pizza and he got pissed at me and was like “I ALREADY GOT ONE.”  It wasn’t me being passive aggressive and saying he needed one because he was sloppy.   He had already sat down and I was still getting my pizza, so I was being nice and asking if he needed one while I was up….
ANYWAY.  He was going on and on and he said, “If nothing sounds good, I just starve.”  He says this all the time.  Like I’m supposed to feel bad for him?  I don’t.  I just said, “Okay.”  And I turned over to try to go to sleep because I felt shitty.  He said he was going out for smokes anyway and he kept saying if I wanted something he would still get it, but he would just starve.  I guess he expects a reaction from me, but I just don’t care anymore.  I don’t give a fuck if he starves and dies.  But I kept trying to say, “I’m not hungry.”  But he kept talking over me.  I said it like 4 times.  He always does this.  Any conversation we have usually consists of him man-splaining something to me, and if I try to contribute to the conversation at all, he just interrupts or talks right over me.
Finally he stopped talking long enough and asked me again if I wanted anything.  I said, “I’m not hungry.  I’m nauseous.”  Because I was sick and still had a fever.  He was like, “Why are you nauseous?  Is it because you at a whole bunch of tacos last night?”  I would like to add here, that he loves to make these little passive aggressive comments about my weight and how much I eat, and how skinny he is and how big I am.  I was like, “I didn’t eat a bunch, I ate 3.”  He said, “Well, I only ate 2 and they filled me up.”  Again, the passive aggressive, I must eat so much so that’s why I’m so fat, I guess.  Is 3 tacos too much?  I hadn’t eaten anything else all day because I’ve been trying to starve myself to lose weight, but is 3 tacos still too much? He snacks all day and gets no exercise.  I’m on my feet all day, running around, AND starving.
I responded, “I’m sick.  I have a fever.  That’s why I’m nauseous.”  He didn’t really say anything else, just said he was going to go get smokes and he’d get food later, but it would probably be raining and he would have to go out in the rain.  Boo fucking hoo.  Fucking melt in the god damn rain, why don’t you?
Sunday I felt better.  But I had to sit through an hour and a half of him man-splaining credit scores to me for the 100th fucking time.  And he repeats himself several times in every conversation, but if I ever say something that I’ve told him before, but I couldn’t remember that I had already told him (because I can’t fucking keep up with every fucking conversation I have with every single person I know.) he gets mad and says, “YOU ALREADY TOLD ME.”   But he can fucking repeat himself 80 times in a conversation… maybe because I’m the owner of a vagina, so I must be dumber and need him to repeat things to me so I can understand.
Then he said he was thinking about getting some new jeans for me, which, cool, thanks I guess.  But then he kept making these comments, like “It’s SOOOO hard to find your size.  It’s so big and you’re so short…”  Then he measured a pair I already have.  He said something like, “Well, these used to be a size X (I’m not putting my size here, it’s embarrassing), but you’ve stretched them out like 3 inches.  You’ve stretched out all your jeans a lot.  So I would have to get a much bigger size.  I have plenty of jeans, they fit me just perfect.”
And if I’m being perfectly honest, I blame him for me gaining weight.   Yes, I know…I need to take some accountability, and I do.   I’m a fucking fat ass that can’t control myself, but every time I get in a relationship, I get depressed and eat more.   And when I try to get him to buy healthier things, he just buys junk.   Or I’ll plan to eat a salad or lean cuisine when I get home and he gets a pizza or fucking McDonald’s.
So basically this weekend we have established he doesn’t care or take me seriously if I’m sick AND I’m a big, fat fatty.  My life is fucking awesome.

I get emails from Louisville Halloween.  They give updates on what haunted houses there will be during September and October.  I fucking love Halloween.  I usually get really excited during this time of year.  But I was looking at the pictures in the email of people having fun, and I just felt sad.  I know I can’t do those things.  I can’t go out with friends, because my BF would think I was cheating or something.  I can’t go with him because there is no way I’d be able to STAND going with him.  Anytime we go anywhere or do anything, he makes things miserable and unenjoyable.  He’ll start bitching about something, or complaining.  And if he’s not doing that, he’s just not a fun person.  He has no sense of humor either.  If we did end up going, I’d probably throw him in front of someone with a chainsaw in hopes it was actually real.  What a hopeless,  miserable feeling.

So N has a camera set up outside our apartment.  He says it’s for security.  He’s always telling me stupid things neighbors are doing, and he caught our neighbors grandkids supposedly throwing rocks at cars.  I don’t know if that’s true, because he tends to exaggerate and over-react to certain things.  And anything to do with his stupid car, he just loses his shit.  So he got in an argument with our neighbor or whatever and now he doesn’t like her.  So anyway, I walked outside yesterday to go to work and that neighbor was sitting on the steps watching her dog play.  The lady has always been nice to me, she’s just obviously got some problems.  So I said hi and chatted with her about her dog for a minute, then I went to work.  So when I get home later that night, he didn’t say outright that he watched the camera and saw me talking to her, but he started randomly talking about her, and then said how we shouldn’t talk to her and she’s an enemy.  WTF?  This lady is weird, but pretty much harmless.  Honestly, I feel bad for her.  Her son fucking punched her in the face one night.  Anyway, I just find it creepy that he watches the camera and watches what I do every time I leave the apartment.  It’s not the first time he’s done it.  We used to have this neighbor, and older guy, maybe in his 60s or 70s.  He would talk to both of us a lot, but sometimes the guy would be sitting outside chilling when I came home from work.  The guy would say hi and we would chat for just a few seconds.  Well, N had apparently been watching the camera and he was like, “You don’t need to be talking to anyone out there at night.”  I’m like, “It’s just Kenny, we only said hi for a second.” But it obviously bothered him.   It’s okay for him to chat with the older lady right below us though.  He will go in her apartment and talk to her and her husband, and he will sometimes go buy things for them, and that’s fine.  That doesn’t bother me.  But I guarantee, if I were down there doing the same things, he would think I was trying to fuck the old guy.  Fucking double-standards.  I wish he would fuck the old woman and move in with them, and leave me the fuck alone to be honest.
Yesterday he was acting like a fucking baby again about something stupid.  I asked if he wanted Mexican food (he usually goes to get it).  He said yes, but he didn’t feel like going anywhere.  I was like, “Oh, okay then.”   About 20 minutes later he comes in the bedroom and says if he orders it would I go get it.  I said I didn’t feel like going anywhere either.  I was fine to just eat something at home.  He walked away.  Then after about 10 more minutes he came back and he said, “Well, I guess I’ll go, but I really didn’t want to go anywhere, but I know you really want Mexican.”  I was like, “I’m really okay, I can eat something here.”  He’s like “No, I’ve already got it in my head I’m supposed to go somewhere now even though I really didn’t want to.”  So he tried to call he Mexican place to place the order and he couldn’t get through because they were so busy.  So he started bitching about how big of a pain in the ass it was, and now he was going to have to wait for his food and be in there with a bunch of people.  I tried to tell him again that I could eat something at home, but he wouldn’t have it.  He just wanted to bitch and complain and kept making passive aggressive comments about having to go out even though he just woke up like an hour ago.  Um, I’m sorry… is life hard for you now that you have to go somewhere within an hour of waking up?  Because I do that 5 days a week… because I actually fucking work.  I didn’t say that.  Didn’t feel like arguing.  I just let him bitch for another 30 minutes and just sat there, not saying anything.  Not giving him the attention he wanted (you know, like a child).  He finally left  to get the food and I just started crying because I’m so fucking sick of the simplest things turning into a huge dramatic mess.  How can someone act like that and think it’s okay?  Especially knowing everything I’ve done for him?   It’s the fucking audacity… Like I pay for everything, I’ve kept him from getting evicted when we first met (by giving plasma and giving him what little money I had at the time).  I pay rent now.  I pay his car payment and insurance.  I pay for food, smokes, fucking EVERYTHING and you have the fucking audacity to talk to me like garbage?!!  How does that fucking make sense?  How can someone act like that and not see how fucked up their actions are??
I was watching this guy on YouTube talking about covert narcissists.  I have suspected for sometime that he might be one, but of course, you just don’t want to diagnose everyone with something.  But the guy was like, “You want to know the ultimate test to find out?  Tell them no.  About anything.  Politely and nicely just tell them no and see how they react.”  So I guess yesterday when I said No, I didn’t want to go pick up the food, that was the test and he failed.
I wish I had somewhere to go.  I don’t.  I need a good place for me and my cat to go, but there isn’t anywhere.  I don’t know what to do.  I can’t save money because he keeps blowing it.  I’m so fucking sick of it.  It feels like I’m in jail.  Like I’m suffocating.  I want to go to my friend’s wedding in a couple weeks, but I can’t.  I know he wouldn’t want me to because he’d think they would be guys there trying to hit on me.  And I wouldn’t dare bring him.  He’s boring and rude to other people.  And he would be complaining the whole time.  He really wouldn’t want to go anyway.
Why do people act nice in the beginning of a relationship, then suddenly turn into Mr. Fucking Hyde?  Why do they do that?  It also means, they know what they’re doing, at least in some way.  Because they were able to be nice at the beginning, but now they fucking can’t?  If you’re an ass-hole, you should just show you’re an ass-hole from the beginning so we know to stay away from you.  Fuck.  I hate life.  I hate people.  I hate him.

I will never be in a relationship with a man ever again.  Once I am able to get out of this trap I’m in now, I’m not doing this again.  I’ve been hearing other women’s stories and reading other women’s diaries on here, and it is all so heartbreaking.  These women get in relationships with people they think are good/loving men, and they pretend to be that way for the first 3-6 months, then BAM.  Completely different person. . . someone that is not emotionally supportive/available, someone that makes you feel bad about yourself, someone that turned cruel.  And before someone says, “Not ALL men!”  I get it, okay?  I’m sure there is a handful of men that are alright, but not from what I’ve seen.  All the stories I’ve heard, even from women that I know. . .  I’ve never come across a woman that’s in a long-term relationship that is happy.  It’s fucking scary.  I’m not subjecting myself to it ever again.  And neither should any other woman.  It’s a trap.  There are studies that show that single, childless women are the happiest, and that’s what I’m going to do.  Other studies show married men are happiest. . . because the women are taking care of them like their mothers, and allowing the men to emotionally and/or physically abuse them.
I’ve seen angry men on TikTok saying shit like, “When a woman focuses on her career instead of a family, she ends up alone, with $100,000 in her bank account, and a couple of cats.  That’s just sad.”  Um, no.  That doesn’t sound sad to me.  That sounds like a fucking dream come true!!  Stop trying to threaten us with a good time.  LOL.  Okay, I’m done ranting for now.  I just want to be alone with my cats and happy and peaceful.  I’ve always been so much more peaceful without a man in my life.

I went to my friend Cheris’s wedding last Friday.  I took the day off because I knew I was going to have to go shopping to find something to wear.  I’ve gained so much weight, I knew I didn’t have anything that fit.  So I went to some clothing store in town and I spent 2 hours in there trying to find something that didn’t look completely ridiculous on me.  It’s been a while since I’ve seen myself in a full-length mirror, so when I tired on that first dress, my jaw literally dropped.  I looked so fucking disgusting.  I knew I looked bad, but I didn’t realize how truly terrible.  I felt so disgusted.  I couldn’t find anything that looked okay.  I finally just settled for a pair of black pants that were way too long because I’m so short, and a blue shirt, but you could see how fat my arms and stomach were.  It was just the best I could do at that point.
So when I got to her house, not many people were there yet, so it was just really awkward.  I wasn’t allowed to go in the house because her finance doesn’t like people in there.  She’s anal about cleanliness.  She’s really sweet, so it’s not like she was being mean or anything, that’s just how she is.  But it was just a few random people standing around awkwardly while Cheris and Kayla got ready.  I started drinking to take the edge off my social anxiety.  More and more people arrived and once most people were there, I remember just sitting there and realizing how fucking different I was from all those people.  It made me miss my best friend, Lora (who won’t respond to any of my messages).  If she were there with me, we’d be sneaking shots, and laughing, and having a great time.  There were older ladies there looking at me all judgmental because I had a bottle in my hand, but didn’t look twice at the dudes with the beers.  After the ceremony some of us even talked about doing karaoke, and I heard one lady say, “We don’t need to hear drunks who think they can sing…”  I was like damn.  It’s a fucking party.
I ran into one girl I went to school with.  She was there with her husband who apparently works at the plant with me.  I watched the two of them interact, and I could just see the look on her face every time he spoke, she was not happy.  I talked to a few other couples too, who were obviously not very happy either.  I met a guy that works in maintenance 3rd shift, who says he’s married to a girl in packaging, and he was just saying all this shit about her most of the night about how good things were when they first got together, and now she’s mean.  All of it just goes to prove my theory that I have never met a couple that has been together for a long time that is actually happy.
On Saturday I worked.  Saw CM again.  He asked if I was still with the douche, I said yes.  I asked if he was still with Hailey and he said yes.  He was telling me how they try to keep working on things.  He asked me if me and my douche try to work on stuff and I just said no.  He thinks there’s nothing to work on.  If someone doesn’t see a problem with their behavior, they don’t think there’s a reason to change.  And I’m way past the point of caring anymore to work on anything.  I remember Friday night was telling the maintenance guy and Elizabeth that I didn’t understand how he couldn’t see that we’re not a good match.  How does he not see it’s not a good relationship?  They both told me because he’s getting everything he needs from the relationship and I’m not.  That’s why he doesn’t see it.  Which is very wise.  Makes complete sense, I guess.
On Sunday, I woke up, hoping to have a good day relaxing, and when N came in the room, he told me he got pizza, but I didn’t hear him very well because I was half asleep.  I said, “You got pizza, or you’re going to get it?”  And he like yelled at me “I GOT IT ALREADY!”  I just looked at him like WTF?  So I said, “I was just asking…” and he just walked away.  I decided not to get up after that even though I’d already slept 13 hours.  I just laid in bed for another hour crying.  I know, you’re probably like, “All he did was yell something stupid, why were you crying?”  Because I’m fucking sick of it.  It’s not just one thing, it’s all the little things added up over time.  It’s not knowing what I could say or do that sets him off to yell at me like that.  I don’t get it.  It’s constantly walking on eggshells, never knowing what the reaction is going to be to the simplest fucking things.
So he came to bed and I got up because I didn’t want to be fucking near him.  After he got up later, I was in a little better mood, so I was trying to be nice again.  He was having some conversation about computer stuff and I was telling him my brother knew some stuff.  I didn’t remember exactly what was said, but he snapped at me again a few more times, so I just stopped talking.  I just laid in bed, silent, watching TV the rest of the night.  Anytime he spoke to me, I just gave him one-word answers.  He was like, “What’s wrong with you?”  I just said nothing.  Because it doesn’t fucking matter.  I could explain, but he wouldn’t understand.  He sees nothing wrong with what he does.
I’m so fucking sick of feeling this way.  I’m so sad and depressed all the time.  I’m physically sick.  I’ve been coughing for months.  I feel shitty all the time.  I wish I could die most of the time.

I’m feeling really irritated.  Last Friday Chase came to me and said “I heard you fucked Chris, is that true?”  I asked who he had heard it from and he wouldn’t tell me, but he said Chris is the one who told the other person.  When I saw Chris today, I brought it up to him and he was rude with me.  He was like, “So?  Basically everyone knows now.”  I’m like, “So that means you keep telling people?”  He just shrugged me off, like I was just bothering him.  Fucking ass-hole.  Men are jerks.  He told me not to tell anyone when it first started, and I didn’t.  But now he thinks it’s okay to go around telling everybody without any regard for my feelings at all?  And when I bring it up, he gaslights me and acts like I’m making a big deal over nothing, and makes me feel like shit for even talking to him in public.  I know he might not have wanted to be seen talking to me because his GF’s sister and mother work on first shift with him, but honestly, I don’t give a fuck.  I’m sick of being someone’s dirty little secret… but only secret when it’s convenient for him.  When he can brag to his buddies, it’s fucking different I guess.  Fucking ass-hole.

Why can’t I just leave?!  I feel miserable every day.  I hate the way he talks to me and makes me feel.  I hate his stupid face and stupid voice.  I’m getting angrier and angrier every single day, and I can’t make myself get up and leave!  Why?  What is wrong with me?!!  Because all his insults and the things that he says are thinly veiled.  Like they don’t sound like outright insults, but they are passive aggressive comments that have subtext to them.  So if I call it out he can be like “I didn’t say that… what are you talking about?”  I know as soon as he does start one of his tantrums and starts yelling I’ll have a good excuse to leave, but he hasn’t done that lately, but also because I stopped defending myself and just let the hits keep coming.  I don’t know.  I’m so angry and miserable and depressed.  I wish he would just go away.  I WISH he was cheating.

So I turned 37 on Monday.   I took a couple days off.   I’m back at work today and I’m feel really down in the dumps.  I’m 37 and I don’t have much to show for it.   I’m not happy.   I’m miserable and depressed 99% of the time.   Is this what life really is?  I just work, eat, and sleep?  This is really all it is?   What’s the fucking point?  I don’t get it.  Why was I brought in this world?   I don’t understand.   And I know how shallow it sounds, but it’s like no one cared it was my birthday.   Made me feel really shitty.  If they don’t care about me on that one day, then it seems like that really don’t give a shit about me any other day.
I’m just really depressed.   I should not be this old and unhappy.

I fucking hate him.
So I went to my brother’s and mom’s for Thanksgiving.  A couple of days before, I told N I was going.  He didn’t say anything, he just walked away.  So I was just like, “Okay…”  The next day I came home from work and I told him again, “I guess I’m going to mom’s and Adam’s tomorrow for Thanksgiving for a couple hours if that’s cool.”  He just said, “It’s whatever you want to do.”  I told him he could come too, but he didn’t even respond.  He never comes.  We’ve been together 3 years and he doesn’t go to my family stuff.  He says he feels weird around people he doesn’t know.  Plus I’ve told him how dirty and hoarder- like their house is, and he’s so anal about cleanliness that he’d shit his pants as soon as he walked in.  So the next day… Thanksgiving I got up and started to get ready.  He was asleep.  When he finally got up, he seemed fine and he was like, “So you about to go over there?”  I was like, “Yeah, just finishing up getting ready.”   So I finished getting ready and left.  It takes about 45 minutes to get to mom’s.  Literally 5 minutes down the road and I get a flat tire, so I pulled into an empty parking lot of Rural King.  I texted my brother I was going to be late- flat tire.  I then called N and he didn’t answer.  I texted him too that I had a flat tire.  Then I started going through my glove box to make sure I had that tool to get the lug nut thingys off my tires if it needed to be changed.  (I know.. I’m no fucking car expert, okay?)
So N called back just a minute later after I found my lug nut tool.  I told him again I have a flat tire.  He just sat there in silence.  I was like, “Hello?”  He said he was just thinking, because he didn’t know what to do.  I was like, “Um, can you come change it for me?”  He was like, “I don’t know what I I’m going to need.  I might not be able to do it.”  I’m thinking, huh?  You’ve changed my tire before.  He was silent again for a like a full minute and again I was like, “Hello?”  He’s like, “I’m here, I just don’t know what to do.”  Like he’s playing stupid on purpose??  Then he was like, “I just woke up and you know I’m not all there when I just wake up.”  He has used this excuse the entire time we’ve been together.  When he wakes up for the first hour or 2, he uses it as an excuse or a fucking free pass to be a dick.  He’s even said one time, “You can’t get mad at me for being snappy when I first wake up.”  But anyway, he had been awake for like 20 minutes.  He said, “And I’m in bed and don’t have any clothes on.”  I was like, “I was literally just there.  You were up and had clothes on…like huh?  why are you naked now?”  He’s like, “I just can’t think right now I just woke up.  You know how bad of an effect just waking up has on me.”  I was getting thoroughly irritated at this point and words just started coming out of my mouth that I couldn’t stop.  I said, “We ALL feel that way when we first wake up.  I feel that way, but I have to get up and go to work everyday anyway.  I just do it.  I don’t use it as an excuse to be mean to people.”  Then was all like, “Why are you trying to start an argument with me?  Oh my god!”  I was like, “I’m not.  I’m just wondering why you won’t come help me.”  He said again, “I just don’t know what I need!  I don’t have clothes on and I’m still tired.  And I haven’t eaten anything, so not I have to do this on an empty stomach.  And I’m out of mountain dew, so I don’t even have that to get me going.”  I couldn’t help myself.  The selfishness of that entire statement blew me away.  I was like, “Oh my god, no!  You’re hungry?  Oh no!!”  Again, I’m not one for arguing.  I never say anything mean to anyone.  I’ve only been in a full blown yelling argument with about 4 people in my life and it was because they had pushed me for so hard and so long, that I snapped and words started coming out of my mouth before I could stop them, and this was turning out to be one of those moments.
Then he started yelling at me saying stuff like, “I didn’t even KNOW you were going to your family’s until like 30 minutes ago!  I don’t think it’s fair I have to do this!”  I was like, “I TOLD YOU last night!!  And the night before!!”  He was like, “No you didn’t.  You said you weren’t sure and that you MIGHT go.  I just find out you’re leaving when I first wake up.  And I don’t even understand why it’s so important to go when they don’t even care about you!  They didn’t even get you a damn birthday present!”
My mom and my brother don’t have a whole lot of money.  My brother does make about the same I do, but he has a kid to take care of.  N asked last week why Adam didn’t get me a present, then asked how he couldn’t have any money, and he must be lying about how much he makes.  My mom, even if she did have money… she’s barely there nowadays.  Sometimes she hears voices.  Sometimes she forgets where she even is.  She’s just in her own world most of the time.  And I don’t EXPECT presents from anyone.  That’s shallow and materialistic.  N bought me a bunch of stuff, but it felt like he was expecting a fucking award for doing so.  I don’t care about gifts, I’d rather someone treat me nice, than buy me a fucking diamond or whatever.
So we argue like that for another minute.  I can’t remember everything that’s said.  But basically he was saying I was the one trying to start a fight.  And maybe I purposefully fucked up my tire to start a fight, or something.  I yelled into the phone, “I done with this!  All of this!”  And he hung up on me.  So I called my brother crying and I explained N wouldn’t help and he was like, “I can help.  Just give me a minute, I’m finishing up cooking, I just need to turn some stuff off, and I can grab what I need and I can help.”  I was like, “But I’m too far away!”  He was like, “It’s only 40 minutes… I can come help.”
You see the difference in the two reactions to me needing help?  Douche BF only 5 minutes from me is inconvenienced and douche-y.  My brother is 40 minutes away, and says he’ll drop everything and come help me.  That’s when I knew I wasn’t being completely crazy.  N makes me feel crazy.  Makes me feel like maybe I am overreacting sometimes, or I’m just losing my fucking mind.. that there’s something wrong with me.
So anyway, I told Adam I didn’t want him to have to drive that far and let me call N back to see if I could get him to help.  Adam told me I should pack my shit and come to the house.  I was really going to at that point.  So I called N back and he answered with, “What the fuck do you want?”  His exact words.  Fucking prince right there.  Made me feel like I’m a fucking fairy tale, I tell ya.  I asked if he was going to help or not, otherwise I’d get my brother to.
He said, “You just said you were done with me.  And you need me for something so you call me back?”
I just said, “Are you going to help or not?  I need an answer, because I need to call my brother.”   I was crying at this point.
He’s like, “Oh, yeah.. you’ll call your brother and make me out to be the bad guy.  I bet you won’t tell him you were the one that started a fight on the phone.  And you’re crying like a baby…”
Again, I was like, “I need to know, yes or no.”
He was like, “Fine.  I’m coming.  But I’ve got to get dressed and I don’t know if I’ll have everything I need.”
So I called Adam and told him N was coming and not to worry about it.  He said he strongly advised I leave the douche.  I agreed.  N finally showed up about 10 minutes later.  All the tire needed was air put in it.  I think the cold must have just fucked with the air.  Well, I thought that at the time.  After looking back on all of this, a part of me wonders if he purposefully did something to my tire the night before.  But then I think that’s just me being paranoid and crazy.  Because my mom does that too… she’ll think the world is out to get her, tell herself some story that someone is doing something to her, and convinces herself she’s completely right.  I don’t want to be like that.  I just don’t know what to think anymore.
So after he aired up my tire, I was planning on going to get my stuff and then going to mom’s.  But he was like, “You should be good to go to your mom’s.”  And he hugged me like nothing happened.  I didn’t hug him back.  He was like, “Oh, are you mad at me now?’  I didn’t say anything except, “thanks for your help.”  He said “No problem.  But there’s no reason to be mad at me.  You were the one who wanted to argue.”  I just said, “Nope.  I didn’t.”  He said, “Well, you know what you did.”  I said, “Nope.  I didn’t do anything.”  He’s like, “Well, okay sure.”  I got in my car and started heading to mom’s.  I fully intended on going back later, getting my shit, and Dexter, and leaving him.  I was crying the whole way to mom’s.  When I got there, I was just down, the whole time.  I couldn’t really engage well with anyone like I wanted.  My brother knew what was going on.  He kept saying he would go with me to go get my stuff, but I could also tell he was tired.  He was falling asleep in his chair.  I just said I would do it myself or just do it the next day.
A couple hours later, I left, got some alcohol, and some mountain dew that N had been complaining about now having.  I went home and he was asleep.  Again.  So I just drank my alcohol until he got up.  Again, he tried to act like nothing happened, but I was short with him.  I planned on leaving the next day.  But when I woke up the next day, I kept feeling like maybe everything is my fault.  I don’t know.  I feel like I’m going insane.  And I feel like I’ll never be able to leave.  It was my opportunity and I couldn’t do it.  Why can’t I do it?  What’s wrong with me????
And I NEVER have money anymore.  I actually make pretty good money.  I have a good job.  When I made $8 an hour at Subway I still always have money saved!  I wasn’t living paycheck to paycheck then.  But I make more than  twice that now, and I never have any!  Because of him!  It’s like taking care of a giant child!  And I didn’t even want kids!
And I swear the simplest things he says to be sound accusatory.  Like before I left for work today he was like, “I just don’t understand why your tires keep losing air.”  I know that sounds like nothing.  That doesn’t sound like a bad thing to say.  But everything he says sounds passive aggressive or like there’s hidden meaning.  Like I’ll actually be like, “Ya know, you’re right.  It must be the other guy I’m fucking… he likes to let the air out of my tires for fun! HEHE!  You got me!”  Fucking ass-hole.  I wish he would just go away.  Please!  I just want him to go away!!!

I am so fucking sick of being talked to like a fucking idiot.  I’m sick of his rude, condescending comments.  I’m sick of him making me feel stupid when I know for a fact I’m smarter than he is.  I’m sick of him acting like a child and losing his shit over the simplest fucking things.  I’m sick of being made to feel crazy.  I’m sick of his whole Jekyll and Hyde personality switch up.  I never know which one I’m going to get.  Even the nice side isn’t even really that nice.  When he IS nice, he’s just fucking boring anyway.  He never has anything interesting to say.  He will literally go on for an hour about credit scores, or golf, or poker.  That’s the only 3 topics he ever talks about and I don’t. give. a. fuck. about ANY OF IT!!!!  He’s constantly interrupting me like I wasn’t even talking.  If I have a problem, he doesn’t try to help me feel better.  He makes everything seem like my fault.  I’m sick of not being able to do the things I want to do.  I’m sick of tiptoeing around when he’s asleep.  I’m sick of feeling like I’ve done something terrible if I drop something, or spill something, or run into something.  I’m sick of walking on eggshells, never knowing what I could say will set him off.
I miss lighting candles.  I miss eating things I like.  If I have to eat Little Creaser’s pizza one more time, I might just jump off a mother-fucking bridge to end it all.  We can’t ever get what I want.  I love taco bell, but we never get it because he claims they skimp on meat or some shit and he throws a fit if someone gets his order wrong.  We can’t ever get Papa John’s.  It’s my favorite pizza, but he says it’s too expensive (even though I’m the one paying), yet the amount of soggy, crap pizza he gets every week is MORE than what one Papa John’s pizza is.
I hate having to think about every little thing I say, wondering if it will offend him somehow, or if he will try to correct me.  And he’s so fucking literal.  I can’t use metaphors because he thinks it’s literal and he doesn’t understand the point I’m trying to make.  I can’t make jokes, because he either gets offended or doesn’t get them or think they’re funny.  I can’t laugh at things I think are funny.  I used to, but then he started policing when I laughed by saying things like, “Why would you laugh at that?  That’s not funny.  Stop laughing so much.”
I miss my family.  He constantly says they don’t care about me now.  I miss having friends.  He told me I shouldn’t talk to friends about our relationship, they probably wouldn’t give good advice.  I miss laughing and joking, having fun.  I hate feeling so depressed all the time.  I’m so exhausted.  And I’m physically sick.  There’s always something wrong with me now.  I’ve had a cough for months.  I keep getting fevers.  I keep getting stomach aches and headaches.  I’m always tired.  My hair is falling out in huge clumps.  I can’t deal with it anymore.  I hate him.  I wish he would just go away.  Why won’t he just go away?
A lot of times I get the feeling he doesn’t even like me.  Why would you want to keep being with me, if you don’t even like me?  Why would you want to keep trying to talk me into staying, if you don’t even like me?  It’s like this deep loathing I can feel coming from him.  I don’t even understand it because all I’ve tried to do is care for him.  And the things he says sometimes… it’s like how do you have the audacity to say such things to someone who is basically keeping you from being homeless?  How do you think it’s okay?  He’s made me cry several times, then literally walks out of the room and just leaves me crying like he doesn’t care at all.  He then calls me a baby or a teenager for crying.  He has NEVER apologized for anything he’s said or done because he doesn’t see a problem with any of it!  I’m so fucking SICK OF IT!!  I AM READY TO LEAVE.  I’M FUCKING ENRAGED OVER ALL OF HIS SHIT AND I JUST WANT TO LEAVE!!!!!!  HOW CAN ANY HUMAN BEING ACT THE WAY HE DOES AND NOT SEE A PROBLEM WITH IT??!!!  I FUCKING HATE HIM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I learned too much info today about too many people.   Too much to type on my phone, but basically my brain feels like it’s over stimulated from all the info and human interaction today.
I finally did what I needed to do though.   I ended things with N.   More on that later.
"
1049,https://www.opendiary.com/m/mnmchick2004/i-finally-left-2-6166224/,2022-12-14,I Finally Left.,"
I finally left him.  Finally had the courage to leave.  It was last Thursday and we had our Secret Santa at work.  I got a bunch of gifts from several co-workers.  When I brought my gifts home later that night, he said, “I don’t understand why you keep bringing junk into the apartment.  There’s no room for anything anymore.”  It’s so ironic he says that.  He is actually the one that keeps bringing unnecessary shit into the apartment.  Large items, too.  Bookcases, 2 dressers we didn’t need, another desk and computer we didn’t need.  I could go on.  I never said anything about that stuff even though it was obviously making things very cluttered.  It’s a really small apartment, so yeah, cluttered.  But the items I received from people at work were things like candles, candy, socks, a blanket.  Little shit.
So anyway, I said, “These were gifts from people at work.  I don’t know what I’m supposed to do… tell them I don’t want their gifts?”  He was like, “You don’t have to get an attitude.  I’m just saying I don’t know what we’re going to do with this stuff.”  I tried to ignore the attitude comment and keep things civil . I really didn’t feel like arguing.  I was like, “I don’t know what you want me to do.  It’s gifts.  These are little things I can set on the bookcase or a table.”  He started getting mad and I can’t remember everything he said.  But even after I was trying to have civil conversation about it he was like, “I really don’t like you having an attitude about it.  I just don’t know why you keep bringing junk into the apartment.”  So, I tried a tactic I learned about  after watching videos about narcissists.  I said, “What do you mean by that?  I keep brining junk into the apartment?  These are just gifts.”  He said something about me taking it the wrong way and twisting his words.  I said, “I’m not twisting anything.  I just repeated exactly what you said to me word for word.  So what did you mean by it?”  He said “You’re just trying to start and argument.  You don’t get it.”  I said, “I’m not arguing.  What do you mean by ‘I shouldn’t bring anymore junk into the apartment?”  He tried to talk over me again and said, “You’re just starting stuff.  Twisting my words.”  Again I said, “I’m repeating exactly what you said word for word.”  So he just started yelling and talking over me.  So I finally said, “You know what?  You don’t have to worry about my junk being in here ever again.  You also don’t have to worry about my attitude anymore.”  So I started packing up all my stuff.  He was like, “Are you serious?  That’s so stupid.  You’re really going to leave?”
So yeah, the entire time I was packing my stuff, he just talked and I didn’t respond to anything he was saying.  The thing is, I’m so weak and vulnerable, I think if he had actually at one point apologized to me and promised not to act that way anymore, I might have stayed.  But he did nothing of the sort.  He just told me how stupid I was being and how I’m such a bad person for leaving.  He even called me evil at one point.  Said I was cold for leaving.  I didn’t respond to any of it, except the occasional, “Okay.  Sure.  Whatever you say.”   So, I grabbed the basics, and my cat, and left.  I went to my mom’s and my brother’s house.
I’m staying there now.  It’s just a little overcrowded and my mom’s a little crazy.  I’ve gone back to the apartment a couple more times to get the rest of my stuff.  To be honest, he doesn’t seem that upset.  I thought he would try to talk me out of it and call me a bad person again, but he hasn’t.  He did ask if I could at least help him and keep him from being homeless for the next couple of months while he looks for a job.  I agreed, as long as he remained civil.  It’s been almost a week and I was honestly expecting the occasional text making me feel guilty, but I haven’t gotten that, thankfully.  I’m hoping it stays that way.
I already feel better.  A weight has lifted.  I feel lighter.  When I come home every night, it’s a different feeling.  I’m not walking on eggshells.  Everyone wants to be around me at the house and we all even joke and laugh and have fun.  It’s so weird to be able to do those things again.  I’ve just got to save up some money to get my own place, because at this point, I am sleeping on the couch, and I know I can only stand my mom for a certain amount of time.  I’m 37, but when I live with her, it’s like she thinks I’m a child again.  She tries to know what I’m doing at all times.  I said to me my brother, if it gets out of hand, I will say something.  Because I’ve already spend the last 3 years being controlled by someone, and it’s NOT going to happen again.
I will never be in another relationship ever again.  I don’t trust men.  They act like they are nice until about 6 months in, they turn into monsters.  I’m done.  I’m so much more at peace by myself.  I get to focus on me again.  I get to take care of my health again.  Lose weight, look better, feel better.  And you know what… now that I think about it… I have barely coughed since I left a week ag0.  The cough I had for 7 months has suddenly almost disappeared.  The wrinkles under my eyes disappeared in the last week, too.  I just feel so much better already, it’s astounding.  If anyone on here is in a bad relationship and doesn’t know if they should leave or not, DO IT.  LEAVE.  You will feel so much better.  Your life will get better.

1050,https://www.opendiary.com/m/mnmchick2004/getting-better-292-6169269/,2023-01-04,Getting Better.,"
A lot has happened in the last several weeks.  My last entry I wrote about how I broke up with my narc BF.  The first few weeks were rough.  More bad things kept happening to me, to the point I thought the universe was punishing me in some way.  I started to really question myself if I really did the right thing.  Now that things have leveled out, I feel better.  I know I’ve made the right choice; it was just harder than I thought it would be.  I don’t want to really talk about all the bad shit that happened to me after that.  It’s not worth talking about now.
This entry might jump around a little bit.  My thoughts aren’t very organized at the moment.  I need to really work on healing after the damage inflicted by someone I thought was supposed to love me.  I am never going to date again.  I am definitely never going to get married.  There are so many things I can do now, I don’t even know where to begin.  I think this weekend I’m going to do the cliche’ things where a woman cuts and dyes her hair after a break-up.  I bought some dark blue hair dye… something I’ve never done, and something I know N wouldn’t have liked.  I was telling my brother how N never let me light candles, and he was like, “Fuck that!” and he started lighting a bunch of candles for me.  lol.
I’ve already lost a significant amount of weight since I left him a month ago.  I can really tell, and when I got on the scale, I was shocked how much it went down.  I also had a stomach bug that contributed to that.  I was praying to a god I don’t believe in to end my life quickly those few days I was sick.  N hasn’t even really contacted me that much.  I had told him that I would help him financially for the next couple months while he looks for a job so he won’t get evicted, but only a few months.  The only time he texts me really is when he needs something… usually money.  He has not apologized for anything.  He has not taken accountability for any of his actions.  He hasn’t even tried to ask me to come back.  He hasn’t said any of the things men usually say like how they will try harder, or they are sorry, and please come back, I’ll do better.  All he has done is try to slightly make me feel guilty.  I was the last time I went to his apartment to get the last of my stuff.  He was just making little comments about how he doesn’t have as much food or cigarettes and he hasn’t been able to eat much lately.  That was about it.
I honestly thought he would try harder to make me come back, but I’m relieved that he hasn’t.  His behavior shows me that never really cared about me and he never loved me.  He liked what I did FOR him.  I was his bank.  I don’t think he even really truly liked me as a person.  The fact that I haven’t heard from him in over a week makes me think he’s probably trying to find his next victim to sponge off of.  He was always making comments about my weight and never told me I was beautiful, so maybe he’ll find a hot skinny girl to leach off of.  That’s fine with me, but I wish there was a way to warn any other women, because I don’t want anyone else treated that way.
So anyway, at work I saw Chris.  He stopped me in the hallway.  He was like, “Did you happen to get a message from me recently?”  I was like, “Um, no.  Should I have?”  He told me his GF told him she hacked into his FB messenger and messaged me and that I supposedly messaged back.  I was like, “Um, no.  That’s impossible.  I have you blocked because she’s already tried to do that once, and I don’t want her fucking with me again.”  He was like, “So she basically lied to me to see if I was cheating on her?”  I was like, “Yep.  Sounds like it.  Have fun with all that.”  LOL.   So to catch up, Chris and I used to be FWB, but then he got with his current GF.  Him and I didn’t talk for a while because I was mad at him.  But for some reason, he told his GF about me.  I don’t know why he would?  If I was just a FWB, why would I have enough significance to tell his current GF about me?  Anyway, he said he told her because he wanted to be honest with her about his past.  But instead of taking that as a sign to trust him, it made her go fucking nuts.  She hacked into his FB messenger and read all of the messages between me and him from before they even got together.  Now she said she can track his phone to see where he’s at in our building at work.  She’s apparently talked some people who work here into spying for her… they found out my work schedule, so she knows I’m here for an hour the same time he is.  They also tell her anytime they catch me and him just talking.  It’s really fucking weird.  Psychotic.
Anyway, I’m just glad I’m single again.  No man to take care of like a giant, fucking child.  I can do whatever I want.  Say whatever I want.  I’m living with my brother, his GF, his son, and my mom at the moment until I save up to get my own place.  It’s loud and my mom is nuts, but it’s still different.  Like everyone there likes me and I don’t have to walk on eggshells.  I don’t have to watch what I say for fear of pissing someone off.  They all get my sense of humor and laugh with me.  We have fun watching fun things.  It’s just better than being emotionally abused every day.  It is still a bit chaotic, so I’ll have to find somewhere of my own.  And my mom still thinks I’m a child.  I’ve already had to tell her, I just spent the last 3 years being controlled by one person, and I’m damn sure not going to do it again.  She backed off after that.
Sorry if the grammar was terrible in this entry.  I’m just trying to get all my thoughts out.  Just feeling better enough to be able to talk about it all.

So, I started reading a book called, “Why Does He Do That?”  It’s basically about abusive men and why they do the things they do; mostly narcissists.  I don’t like to diagnose people, because it could be likely that term gets over-used.  It’s thrown around a lot when people talk about their exes.  Although, it could just be that we are more aware of it now and outing these types of people more often.  Anyway, at the very least, I think he had a lot of narcissistic tendencies.  He could possibly be a passive aggressive covert narcist.  I am now questioning everything.
When I first met him, one of the first few things he made a point of telling me was that he was not a liar or a cheater.  He was very outspoken and adamant about that, even though I didn’t ask him.  I’ve read and heard from a lot of people that say when you first meet someone, and they say something like this, they are outing themself.  They are, in fact, those exact things.  Because if they weren’t, they wouldn’t feel the need to tell you.  I mean, I never felt the need to tell him that.  He did keep something from me that I found out about him.  He said he was just afraid to tell me, but after he still hadn’t told me after a year and a half, I brought it up after he had been screaming at me about something silly.  It was something I SHOULD know, and after a year and a half he still hadn’t told me.
I wonder if he ever did cheat on me.  I don’t think he did.  I don’t care at this point.  But there were a few times when work was cancelled because of weather at the last minute, and when I told him, he would act really mad, like I had just ruined his day or something.  Like, why are you so mad that I’m not leaving?
Then the whole thing that happened on Thanksgiving . . . when my tire mysteriously didn’t have enough air.  I told him the night before I was going to see my family.  I asked if he wanted to go, and he didn’t even answer me.  The next day, I get in my car, start going down the road and next thing I know, I’ve got a flat tire.  It didn’t blow, it was just flat, like air leaked out.  When I called him, he didn’t seem surprised.  And he just said everything he could to make the situation harder, then he accused me of fucking up my tire on purpose so I could start a fight?  Like is that telling on himself?  Because I haven’t had any problems with that tire since then, and that was almost 2 months ago.  During that fight he even said, “I didn’t even know you were going to your family!”  And I was like, “I literally told you last night and last week…”  And he was like, “They don’t even care about you…”  So, did he fuck up my tire while I was asleep that night, so I couldn’t go?  Or maybe to have a reason to yell at me for wanting to go?   I don’t know.  Then I think maybe I’m being paranoid.  No idea.
I got a wild hair and decided to check on the dating website that we met on.  He’s already back on there.  I just started laughing.  He’s searching for his next victim, the next woman he can sponge off of.  While I am adamant about never wanting to be in a relationship ever again because of the damage he and other men have inflicted on me, he is already searching for some poor new woman.  I wish I could warn her, whomever she may be, but that would take the financial burden off me.  I have still been helping him the last few weeks so that he doesn’t go homeless.  I told him I would while he looked for a real job.  Something tells me he hasn’t even been searching.  There’s going to have to be a point where I cut him off.  I hate having to do shit like this.  It’s my money, and I would really like to be able to use it for myself, instead of some abusive, selfish fuck.  But I guess no matter what, I don’t like to think I’m the cause of someone going homeless or hungry.  If he finds another woman, maybe she can take the financial burden off me.  I’m betting that’s partially why he’s already looking for someone. . . so he doesn’t have to find a job, he can just find a woman to do it all for him.  There’s also the fact that he simply cannot fathom the idea of being alone, and he probably needs a new supply to feed off of.  Someone else to control and drain all the energy from.
Another thing. . . I talked to my friend Chris again at work.  He’s put in his notice to leave.  I was like, “So, I’m not going to see you anymore and we can’t even message each other because your girlfriend doesn’t even want you talking to me.  How am I supposed to talk to you?”  He’s like, “I guess you won’t.”  And he said it with just dismissive casualness that it really stung.  Like, the amount of shit I’ve done for that man, and shit I’ve forgiven him for, and he’s so careless about never seeing or talking to me again… like he really cares that little about me?  What the fuck?  He chose some immature little girl who tracks his phone and messages and even physically assaulted him over me.  He wants to be with her over even being my friend.  Part of me wonders if he just loves the drama.  That maybe he never wanted to be with me because it would be too boring for him.  Because I would never do any of that shit she does.  It’s just infuriating.
Anyway, I need to get off here.  Writing all this is just pissing me off more.

I stumbled across this song about a month ago, and I don’t know why I hadn’t heard it until recently.  It’s called Popular Monster by Falling in Reverse, but I actually heard a cover before the original song.  The cover was done by a group I found on YouTube called “Halocene.”  They do a bunch of covers of music that I fucking love.  Anway, the lyrics were really relatable to me.  I just wanted to post it here, if anything, just for myself to have.

I’m having a few days where it just feels like everybody hates me.  I look at even the smallest reactions from people and over-analyze them and think they hate me.  And I noticed that people I used to be friends with on Facebook have unfriended me.  It’s people I’m not even super close to, but I used to be, and I wonder what I did to make them be like, “fuck this bitch.  I don’t want to see her face anymore,” and just unfriend me.  Too many cat pics?  It’s okay to post a shit-ton of ugly baby pics, but I can’t post pics of my cats without pissing people off?  I don’t post political or religious stuff.  I post funny memes, usually self-deprecating humor.  Does that stuff really piss people off that much?  And a part of me realizes this is a dramatic reaction, but a part of me is sincerely hurt, and it makes me feel like nobody really likes me.  I’ve even sent friend requests to a couple people at work, and they haven’t accepted them.  So I’m thinking, “Wow.  People really don’t like me, and I’ve been so oblivious to not notice it.”  And when I walk in a room, it’s like I can feel people hating me.  Maybe I am the problem.  Maybe I was the horrible person in my relationship.
I feel like crying today.  Crying a lot.  Chris is gone now.  Haliey got exactly what she wanted.  He doesn’t work with me or see me anymore.  He can’t talk to me anymore.  She won.  I lost.  I bet she’s so fucking happy about it.  It’s because of her that I lost a friend.  We were best friends before she came along.  Then we weren’t allowed to talk and I lost him.  I feel so fucking sad and lonely today.  I really just want to cry.  I’m sick of life.

1054,https://www.opendiary.com/m/mnmchick2004/update-6194-6199701/,2023-02-22,Update.,"
I haven’t written much lately, but that’s because nothing seems significant enough to write about.  I spent the last year or so complaining about my (ex) BF and how depressed I was, and then I briefly wrote about the FWB I had.  Both are gone.  So there isn’t the typical internal drama going on anymore.  I guess I could do what I used to do when I was in high school . . . just write about daily mundane things that happened to me.  It was actually kind of fun to go back and read all the stuff.  I am thankful that those toxic people are out of my life now, though.
So, I was sick over the weekend.  I thought it was allergies at first, but it got progressively worse.  I’m getting a little better now.  I woke up this morning feeling pretty shitty, but I didn’t have much time to think about it, because I had a text from my brother that my mom had borrowed my car and got a flat tire.  The tire Lugnut thingy is in my purse, so he had to leave work to come get me to take me to work, then drop off the Lugnut thingy to her at the tire place.  I have so much bad luck with fucking tires.  But it’s probably because I drove 45 minutes to work for almost 2 years.  I don’t have to do that anymore.  I guess I can just be glad it didn’t happen while I was driving it.  Hahaha.  And she paid for the new tire and everything, so that’s good.
I still feel really foggy in the head.  It’s hard to concentrate.  I just want to sleep.
I think I’m taking this next year to focus just on myself.  I’m saving up to get a new place.  I could have already done that, but I’m helping the ex pay rent, so he doesn’t go homeless.  I don’t know how long I’ll do it.  I know I shouldn’t even be doing it now, but I don’t know.  I don’t know how or when to stop.  Anyway, I’m also taking this time to lose more weight and work on my appearance.  Next week I have an appointment to have a scar looked at on my face that I’m self-conscious of to see if they can do anything about it.  The place I’m going to also does liposuction, so I’m thinking I might ask about that as well.  I do have good credit, and I could do some financing options.  It’s just something to think about.  I would mention it to my ex sometimes and he would always immediately shut it down, saying we need to save money for a better place.  But we couldn’t ever save money because he was always blowing it.  And I’m betting he wouldn’t have liked if I did get liposuction and was suddenly much more attractive to other men.  I remember he would make comments about how I needed to lose weight, but anytime I tried to eat healthier, it’s like he would sabotage it and get junk.  And I would mention going to the gym and he was like, “But there will be guys there that hit on you.”
Fuck.  I hate thinking about him.  I got a few books on covert narcissism and they really helped me get through the first couple months.  Now I’ve started reading another book about narcissistic abuse and how to recover, and every time I pick it up to read it, I start thinking about all the things he did to me and how angry it makes me.  So I usually can’t read it for longer than 20-30 minutes.
I need to start writing again.  I mean writing my books.  I have a whole book series planned out in my head, and since I got with that douche-copter, I never had time or energy to work on it.  I finished the first book, and I started on the second one.  The idea of it makes me excited.  I feel like it’s a really good idea, but I just haven’t had the energy.  I’ve been feeling better lately (aside from getting sick over the weekend), so I really need to start writing again.  I miss it.  I usually write better when I’m not in a relationship and when I’m not concentrating on anyone else (including situationships).  My situationship is over now, I guess.  I saw on FB he asked his crazy, psychotic GF to marry him.  Fucking idiot.  That’s all I want to say about that, other than, I guarantee he’ll be back.  He’s come back to me like 3-4 times already.  And people don’t change.  Not people like him, anyway.
Anyway, that’s all I really wanted to say.  I just wanted to update.  I know it’s just boring/mundane crap, but hey, it’s something.

1055,https://www.opendiary.com/m/mnmchick2004/pretty-good-34-6204553/,2023-03-17,Pretty Good,"
I’ve been feeling pretty good lately.  Job is good.  Home is decent.  I’ve been concentrating on doing things that make me happy.  I went to a plastic surgery place to have the scar on my face looked on.  I have surgery on April 25th to have them fix it.  It’s something that has made me self-conscious for a long time, and I finally get to do something about it.  I dyed my hair blue.  I got a tattoo.  I bought a bunch of stuff that I would have never been able to get myself because my ex kept blowing my money.  I got some clothes, underwear, make-up, socks, sunglasses, self-tanner, a teeth-whitening kit.  Making yourself pretty is a bit expensive.  lol.  It’s fine, though.  I also have a bunch of money in savings now.  I’ve lost about 20 pounds.  I’ve got to see my best friend that I hadn’t seen in a long time.  I get to accept invitations to hang out.  I got a bunch of dudes in my DMs, but I’m not interested in any of them… except one.
This guy… Troy.  I don’t want to get into a lot of the past.  Basically, we were talking 4 years ago, but things didn’t work out.  I won’t get into the specifics of it, just because I don’t want to re-hash it again.  But, he has been the most similar person to me I’ve ever met.  His humor, his way of speaking, his emotions, his mental health, his sensitivity and compassion, empathy.  It was like I was looking at a male version of myself.  I liked him a lot.  And he broke my heart.
He messaged me a few times just in the last 3 months ever since I broke up with my boyfriend.  It was just a message every few weeks checking in and seeing how I’m doing.  And he was the person who saved me from my biggest moment of weakness when I ALMOST went back to my ex.  So many terrible things were happening, and my brain just wanted something familiar, so in a moment of desperation, I messaged him and told him to tell me not to go back to him.  I also messaged my friend Cheris.  She just said, “don’t go back.  You’ll regret it.”  Not much more than that.  It wasn’t the helpful.  But he sent me this long-ass message with the most heartfelt, helpful advice I’ve ever gotten.  And in that moment, I swear all the tensioni left my body and I felt calm again.  And I didn’t go back.
Anyway, I then noticed that every time I posted something on Facebook, he was ALWAYS commenting and liking it.  I didn’t think too much of it.  To be honest, I figured that ship had sailed.
But last week, he messaged me again.  We were catching up and chatting.  He mentioned he might move to Chicago in the next couple months.  I was like, “That’s awesome!  Good for you!”  But then he was like, “Well, you have to come see me before I leave.”  I honestly didn’t think he was serious.  So I was just like, “Yeah, sure.  Just tell me when and where.”  And he was like, “Well, maybe I shouldn’t… because if I see you again, I might be really inappropriate with you.”  I was like, “Huh?  How?”  He mentioned he hasn’t been with a woman in over a year.  I was like, “OHHH!  Well, I haven’t been with a guy in like 4 months.  I don’t think I’ll ever want a relationship ever again, but I like sex.”  He was like, “Me too.  I feel the exact same way.”  So we talked some more and we kind of agreed to have a kind of friends with benefits thing.  Even when he moves to Chicago, he said anytime he comes to visit, we could “have fun.”   Which is completely fucking fine with me.  I know it sounds shallow, but at this point, I am certainly in no mental state to be in a relationship.  I don’t think I could handle it ever again.  I’m happier being single.  But I do like sex.  I like having someone I trust touch me like that.  And we talked about things we liked sex-wise and we have a LOT of shit in common that we are into.  So he asked for me to come see him March 25th, and we could go see a movie, then go back to his apartment and have some fun.
I do like him a lot.  I always have.  And I think this may be the perfect set-up if all works out.  This morning when we were talking, he was asking if he should pick me up on the 25th.  I told him he lives an hour away, he shouldn’t have to come pick me up, then the next day drop me off again.  That wouldn’t be an easy task for him.  I just told him I’d drive to see him.  Then I said, “But don’t worry, I won’t overstay my welcome.”  He was like, “I’m not worried about that.  As a matter of fact, I was thinking about giving you a key to my apartment, so you can come by anytime that you need to get away from your family.”  I was just like, “Wow.  holy shit.  How are you so thoughtful?”
I know this entire thing sounds so shallow and that he could be using me.  But this is on both sides.  We both want this type of set-up.  And the conversations we have… he’s said some of the sweetest shit anyone has ever said to me in my entire fucking life.  I don’t expect it to go any further.  I’m just down to enjoy the moment and the fun we can have together.  He’s really intelligent too.  I’m so used to talking to the moron dudes that I work with, that try to message me shit like, “Wanna fuck and smoke a blunt?”  Like, I’m not exaggerating on that last one.  That was the message I got from one of them.  Others are also lacking in the woo-ing department.  Just straight up, “I want to fuck you.”  Or “Have a three-some with me and my wife.”  Or sending me fucking dick pics.  Like what the fuck am I supposed to do with those?  Those are not appealing.  At all.  Others have been too desperate, blowing me up and not even being able to carry on an actual conversation.  No basic spelling or grammar skills.  It’s so disappointing.
Anyway, I’ve got to work this weekend.  I’m not looking forward to it.  I want to get through this week fast to be able to go see Troy next Saturday.  I swear this is so fucking surreal.  I never thought I would be saying this again.  I am going to see Troy.  Troy wants to see me again.  It’s like it’s not even real.  Anyway,  I should go.  Bye!

So, I went to see Troy last night.  I’m not even quite sure how I feel right now.  I feel… odd.
When I got there, we talked for a little bit and had some wine.  Then he asked if he could give me a massage (he is a professional masseuse).  So I said yes.  I’m just going to say that ended… very well.  After all that, we played a game for a while.  It was a game with cards that have questions on them, but they propose funny/fucked up scenarios and you tell what you would do.  That was really fun.  We laughed pretty hard the whole time.  Then he said we should go to bed.  So we did.  And we had sex that… lasted maybe less than 10 minutes.  He apologized because he said it had been a year since he’d had sex.
That’s all fine with me… the sex stuff, but the thing is, leading up to this for weeks, he kept telling me all the things he was going to do to me.  He even bought a set of handcuffs that he said he was going to use, which he didn’t.  He kept saying how he was going to take his time and do all this stuff for me, but it didn’t happen.  He didn’t even freaking kiss me, which is something I told him I really wanted.  He then rolled over and went to sleep.  I felt so… used.  Which I understand we agreed this was not a relationship thing.  That’s not what’s bothering me.  It’s that he said he was going to do all these things, and he didn’t.  And I wonder why.  I keep wondering if it was me.  Was I doing something wrong?  Was he not attracted to me enough to have sex with me longer than 10 minutes?  Why didn’t he at least kiss me once?  Even Chris and the douche-nozzel-ex stopped kissing me after a certain point, and I was really looking forward to that, but it didn’t happen.  I keep wondering if my breath is just REALLY bad?  I keep using breath mints just in case.
So I was thinking maybe after he woke up, we would have sex again, but that didn’t happen.  He got up and we like, “It’s so late.”  He said it like 3 times to get the point across that I should leave.  So I did.  And now I just feel… weird.  I feel like I’ve done something wrong or there is something wrong with me.  It’s just this weird, bad feeling sitting in my chest, and I don’t like it.  He said he’d maybe see me again in a couple weeks, but I’m not exactly counting on that.
I definitely don’t want this to be a repeat of 4 years ago.  I don’t want to feel bad about a guy again, but I certainly can’t help it at the moment.  I’m not going to fall apart like I did before.  I don’t want to.  It’s not worth all that.  I’m just going to sit with this bad feeling for a couple days until it goes away, and I’ll be fine.  Then I’ll go back to focusing on me and what needs to be fixed (because it feels like something does need to be fixed).

I lied.  As much as I want it to be true, it’s almost impossible for me to have sex with someone and not have some sort of feelings for them.   I lie and say I’m cool with it.  I’m fine.  But I’m not.  I cannot seem to separate my feelings and getting physically intimate.   But boy does it seem so fucking easy for them.   How is it so easy to not love me?   How is it always so easy to use me and walk away from me…only to find someone better who you ACTUALLY do want to be with?  What is so horribly wrong with me?   I know there’s something, but none of them have to balls to tell me what it is.  I’m so broken and I don’t think I’ll ever heal.
I always wanted that text message out of the blue from someone telling me they miss me and how much they need me in their life.  But I never get things like that.   What is wrong with me?

Sometimes I truly wonder if I’m just mentally unstable.  I do stupid things, and while I’m doing them, I know they’re stupid, but it’s like I can’t stop myself.  I don’t know.  Sometimes I know I’m being irrational, and I do irrational things anyway.  I feel like I’m crazy.  I don’t know.  I feel like I carry this constant guilt and shame and it never goes away.  It feels like there is something very wrong with me, and I don’t know what to do about it.  I don’t know how to fix it.  I wish I could, before I lose more people I care about.

So ever since I went to see Troy, he’s only messaged me a couple times, and it was just like, “how are you?” and small chit chat.  It only happened a couple times, and it think it was honestly so it wouldn’t completely seem like he was blowing me off.  But yeah, he is.  I still don’t understand what happened.  But I do know, it’s like the 3rd time he’s hurt me, and I can’t believe I let it happen again.  He fucked me over 4 years ago, and I should know by now that people really don’t change.  There’s something off about him.  I think maybe he’s a super jerk, but he’s just really good at hiding it.  He has a way with words that makes him not seem like a jerk, but his actions say otherwise.  That’s what it is.  His actions never match his words, and boy does he have a way with words.
I hadn’t heard from him in almost a week, and I saw there were shootings in Louisville, and I got freaked out and messaged him to make sure he was okay.  He was.  He was polite, but said he was going through stuff and made the conversation short.  It’s always something.  I’m getting to the point where I just fucking hate him.  I have so much I want to say to him, but I know if I said the things I think he should hear, it would most likely end our friendship.  Maybe I should.  It doesn’t seem like we ever had a real friendship.  It’s always so easy for him to drop me once he’s used me for whatever he needs from me.  I’m thinking of just writing him an email telling him what a shit person he is, because maybe he needs to fucking hear how his actions affect people.
Anyway, trying to move on from that.  So, several weeks ago, before I even went to see Troy, I went to get a tattoo.  I’ve been wanting to get another one for years, and I couldn’t when I was with the narcissist, because he kept blowing all my money.  Also, he would have probably been jealous of anyone who touched my body for more than 5 minutes.  But yeah, a few weeks ago I went and got a tattoo of a blue rose with the word free.  When I went to get my tattoo done, it was a guy I used to go to school with.  I never actually knew him, but I knew OF him.  His name is Otha.  As soon as we started talking, we had this kind of chemistry… we like a lot of the same things.  His whole shop is decorated and creepy shit.  I told him I loved it and we both talked about how we’re obsessed with Halloween and creepy shit.  We both love Harry Potter.  We both have the same fucked up offensive sense of humor.  Seriously, we talked and laughed the whole time.  And there were moments, when I THOUGHT he might be flirting with me, but I wasn’t sure.  I looked like complete shit that day, so I thought there was no way he was really flirting with me.  After I got done, he even gave me his phone number, which I actually lost, but it didn’t matter, because he was still on my FB messenger.
So a few weeks went by, and that whole shit happened with Troy.  In the back of my mind, I kept thinking about Otha.  So, I had the extra money, and I decided to message him to get another tattoo.  I do want a lot of tattoos, so seeing him wasn’t the only reason I did it.  But part of the reason was to test out and see if he really was flirting with me last time, or if I had just imagined it.  I’m not going to lie, I did go more out of my way to look good this time.  lol.
So when I got there, him and the other tattoo artist were there.  It’s some chick named Rhonda.  He told me before that Rhonda has a thing for him and is obsessed with him.  He doesn’t want to be with her though, but she still acts like they are together, and tries to control him and gets super jealous of any girl he talks to.  She threated to kill herself a few times so he would change his mind.  So yeah, she was there.  And he was drawing up my tattoo before he actually did it, and she was just hanging around.  He was like, “Didn’t you say you were going to leave?” She was like, “Yeah, I guess.”  So she finally did leave, which meant him and I were alone for the rest of the night.  I was the last client he had before the shop closed.
So he got started on my tattoo, and almost right away, he started hinting at things.  He kept saying, “Yeah, no client except some 60 year old women has ever hit on me.”  I was like, “I don’t believe that, you’re so cute.”  And he kept saying that.  Like he brought it up several times in the conversation.  and we did talk about sex a few times.  And when he circled the conversation back again, I was like, “Maybe they do want to fuck you, they’re just afraid to say it because they’re a client.”  he was like, “If they did want to fuck me, they shouldn’t feel uncomfortable telling me.  I don’t mind.”  So finally I was like, “I’ll admit it, I’d fuck you.”  He was like, “But why?”  I told him because he was sweet and cute and actually intelligent.  And was like, “Well, just so you know, I’d fuck you too.”  So there was lots more flirting.  And we also talked about personal things, joked about shit.  It was really fun.
At one point Rhonda came back in the shop.  Otha was like, “Why are you just popping back in?  You usually text.”  She made some lame ass excuse and hung around for about 15 minutes before he was like, “Why are you still here?”  And she left again.  He told me he was willing to bet money she popped in to see if she could catch us fucking or something.
So he finished my tattoo, then he showed me his guitars he had around the shop and played some for me.  Then he started cleaning up. he kept saying he thought it was possible Rhonda might some back just to check on us.   Just as we were about to walk into the lobby area, he was like, “I’m going to show you something.  It’s about to get dark…”  He turned out the lights and closed the door to the lobby.   Hevwas showing me all his glow in the dark stuff, which was awesome.   Then he got close to me and asked for a hug.   Which, I obliged.  It not just a hug.  It was a long hug with a lot if touching, which then escalated to full on making out.  Lol.   After that happened I paid and he got my phone number.   We then walked outside and hugged again.   He told me to message him, and I said I would.  He said, “Seriously, you can blow up my phone.  I don’t care.”
 
So yeah…..I made out with my tattoo artist.   Lmao.   I messaged him a little yesterday and today, but honestly, he hasn’t given much more than short answers to me.  I asked if he wanted to hang out sometime.  He said he would love to, so I said to just let me know when he’s free and he hasn’t said anything else.   So…..maybe it was nothing.   I thought he was really into me, but I don’t know.   Maybe not.
Or the most optimistic scenario is, he’s the opposite of Troy, and he’s a man of few words when texting, but actually takes action.  Like I said…most optimistic scenario, because just going by the short answers in his texts, he doesn’t seem that interested.   I don’t know anything anymore.  And I certainly don’t understand people like I thought.
 
Another thing…it has seemed like guys I actually do like never like me back.  And what is so devastating is when you’re waiting for a text from a specific person, but you keep getting messages from garbage creeps instead.   It’s like adding insult to injury…like the universe is just mocking me in the most cruel way.  I’m j7st so tired of being hurt and used.   I wish I knew what was so wrong with me that decent dudes just want nothing to do with me, but I keep attracting narcissists, creeps, and morons who can’t even spell.   Fuck. Me.

I don’t know why I keep expecting people to care about me.  They don’t.  I wish I didn’t care about them.  Things don’t mean as much to other people as they do to me.  What’s wrong with me?
Maybe all I deserve is poor treatment, because that’s all I seem to get.  I don’t understand why I keep getting used and shoved aside like a fucking afterthought.   They use me, then don’t care whether I’m alive or dead.   Maybe I should be dead.

Bear with me, because I know I’m about to have some horrible grammar in this entry.  I’m just trying to get all my thoughts out as fast as possible.  I don’t have time for perfect grammar.  I’m seriously so tired of trying so hard to be loved.  I feel like I do SO much for people who don’t even care if I’m alive or dead.  And I try to not have that mentality.  I try to go about my day, and have more positive thoughts.  But today was just so fucking exhausting.  I feel like I want to do so much for people, I want to make their days better any small way I can, because I know what it’s like to feel unwanted and unloved every single day, and I don’t want anyone else to feel like that, so I try to do even small good things for everyone.  Today, I was trying to be positive and I kept going out of my way for people.  I was trying so hard at work.  I fixed several fuck-ups.  I caught shit that was about to hit the fan.  I gave away a ton of free cheese to people, while trying to chat with them, and make them happy.
Then my co-worker found out her husband had cancer, and she started crying.  And I never hug anyone because it makes me uncomfortable, but I hugged her and I let her cry and it made me cry.  It was just me and her by ourselves, so I called my supervisor and told her what was going on.  We had so much work to do, so my supervisor said she was on her way but it would be 2 hours.  So I was scrambling, trying to help my co-worker get all her stuff done, all while trying to finish my stuff, and people kept calling for me to help them do other things, and people kept stopping by for cheese.  I just wanted her to be able to leave.  she was refusing to just leave me with all the work.  Heather finally got there and Tammie got to leave.  But I had to do some shit I haven’t done in a while, and she was trying to help, but she’s not familiar with the stuff we do, so I was helping her, while trying to remember my stuff.  Which is fine.  I’m so grateful she took her time to come in.
And this whole day I kept trying not to think about the fact that Troy doesn’t even message me anymore after he fucked me (If you can even call it that) and the fact that Otha hasn’t messaged me, even though he stuck his tongue in my mouth the other night.  And I kept thinking, this is silly shit.  Tammie just found out her husband has cancer.  And I’m trying not to think about these dudes, who must not give a fuck about me at all.  And I keep thinking, I care so much for people, why can’t one person care for me?
I stayed 30 minutes past my shift to clean up my mess so 3rd shift didn’t have to.  My feet hurt, I was so exhausted.  I was walking to my car in the parking lot, trying not to cry.  But as soon as I got in my car, I started sobbing.  I’m exhausted doing so much.  I love and want to help people, but I don’t understand why I can’t get the smallest bit of reciprocation.  I let people borrow money, I give them gifts without any reason, I do work for other people, I offer advice or just an ear to listen, but I do NOT get the same.  I just don’t understand.  I’m so fucking tired.  So tired.  All I want to do is cry.  I feel like I can’t stop crying.  I don’t know why I can’t be loved.  I don’t know what makes me so unlovable.

So I made another attempt to message Otha and he said he was at some wrestling match thingy.  I believe him.  He even posted pics on FB.  He was with his kid.  And that’s awesome.  that’s totally cool.  I understand.  Go you, and your kid-bonding.  But the thing is, he didn’t even say, “Hey, raincheck?”  Or “i’ll try to message you later…” or something like that.  Maybe he’s just a terrible texter with a busy life and that’s totally okay, but let me fucking know.  And I swear to god, I’d get the fucking message that he wasn’t interested, if he hadn’t acted so fucking interested when we were together.  If he hadn’t said such sweet things… if he hadn’t opened up and revealed personal things to me…. if he hadn’t been hinting the entire fucking time that he wanted to fuck me…. if he hadn’t fucking KISSED ME.  If he hadn’t told me to message him… if he hadn’t told me to stop by and see him any time.  What. The. Fuck. @!!!  I don’t understand people.  How can you go from seeming so interested in someone, to totally nothing?  what happened?  Is it  an “Out of sight, out of mind” thing with guys??? I don’t know.  I want answers.  I’m so fucking confused.  At least with Troy, I get it.  I understand it…. kind of.  He was at least hesitant and not that enthusiastic with physical affection.  and his promise of messaging me was see-through non-committal at best.  I’m not completely stupid.  But what the fuck??!!!
Also, I’m kind of drunk right now.  Also, I’m tired of trying to do all the right things and getting nothing in fucking return.  I’m sick of doing so many things for people who shit on my very existence.
Also, a reminder to send my ex next time he tries to message me about money, “I’m sorry it has come to this.  I’m sorry you are having a hard time.  I have given you several months, and a warning.  I gave you a cut-off date.  And  maybe you think I’m being unfair, but if you look back on our relationship, I’m really not.  I’m actually being MORE than generous.  The way you talked to me and treated me was not okay.  You did good things, of course.  If you didn’t, no normal person would stay.  But the terrible out-weighs the good.  You can’t talk to women like they’re stupid.  You can’t talk to women like they are second-class citizens.  You can’t talk about or talk down to workers in the food-industry or retail industry such as Walmart, or McDonalds.  People make fucking mistakes at their jobs every day.  The difference is, these peoples’ mistakes are more on display.  You just happen to fall within the “Karen” people and make them feel like shit.  Which is completely ironic, considering they all make more money than you.  They all have more ambition than you.  You do have it hard, considering your circumstances.  I know it’s hard for you to find a job… but it is not impossible.  A man at my work has the same history as you, and he has a supervisor job now.  So, it’s really hard to feel sympathy for someone who refuses to try… for someone who refuses to accept the consequences of their actions…. for someone who treated their girlfriend terribly and refuses to apologize, even though she’s still giving you money.  How you don’t see a problem with your actions, just completely dumbfounds me.  You need to do some serious self-reelection and therapy, but I know you won’t, because you are a text-book narcissist… which means you see no problem with any of your actions.
Also, I realize that got WAY off topic, because I’m still drunk. My point was…. I have a game-plan now.  I know why no decent dude wants me.  It’s because I’m fat.  I do have an awesome, unique personality, but they can’t seem to get past my fatness.  Time to go back to high school and starve myself again.  That will fix everything, right?  Because I’ve got no other fucking answers…..  I want to be so self-destructive.  A lot of times, no…. most of the time, I just fucking hate myself.   I want to be so fucking self-destructive right now…. I don’t even know how to do it… or describe it.  But I know 90% of the men at work wan to fuck me, so I’m seriously considering, just becoming a whore and fucking them all.  I just want to self-destruct and die at this point, because there is obviously something VERY wrong with me, and I deserve to fucking die.

I have a lot going on in my mind.  I’ve had a few big realizations that have helped me with my self-esteem, but it’s still hard when certain things keep happening to me.  1st of all, I recently found out that I’ve had undiagnosed autism my whole life.  Why?  Because I’m a woman and it presents differently than men.  We also mask better.  We pretend to be normal every day, so people won’t know.  Also, when I was a child, information about these kinds of things weren’t as available.  I have been looking back on my life…. everything the past few days, and SO MUCH MAKES SENSE.  It’s like… I finally understand so many things.  I finally realize, there’s nothing wrong with me.  I’m different, of course.  But it’s such a relief to have so many things explained to me.
All these things that happened as a child… I’ll get into more of that later, but my parents made me feel like I was doing something wrong.  I got bullied by not only kids, but TEACHERS.  I was told so many times how weird I am.
I also saw a video of a man describing how no one is needy.  He used the example, if you sit down to eat dinner every night, you eat like normal.  You take your time, don’t think much about it.  If you’ve been in the desert, starving, dehydrated and you finally are able to get to some food and water, you are going to binge and being eating and drinking so much because you’ve been starved for so long.  He compared that to love.  If you haven’t experience love/compassion your whole life, and someone comes along and gives you just a little bit, you act the same way you would after starving for so long.  You just want more, and you don’t want it to end.
I can’t help but be angry at my parents.  I know information wasn’t as available back then, but they made some fucked up choices.  1st of all, neither of them was emotionally mature enough to have children, and they should have been more self-aware to realize that, instead of forcing two people into the world, who are now miserable because of them.  Instead of trying to figure out why I was acting the way I was, they just treated me as a burden and got mad at me, yelled at me…. Until I decided to pretend to be normal… as normal as I could.  I was emotionally neglected, gaslighted, emotionally abused, sometimes physically abused.  I was scared to ever say much of anything anymore, and people always asked me why I was so quiet.  Why?  Because I’ve been made to feel that my thoughts and feelings don’t matter.  I am worthless.  I am a burden.  That’s what I learned.  You add that to sensory issues, social issues, information processing issues, and you get one fucked up individual.
I will get more in depth and specific with all those things in future entries, because I’ve had so many revelations because of this new information.  They way kids, teachers, and parents treated me…  I have so many fucked up stories.  But now I know, there was nothing wrong with me.  I was different.  And I wasn’t treated with compassion, kindness, or love.  And now I’ve had this narrative in my head repeating so many things like, “There’s something wrong with you.  That’s why people keep abandoning you.  That’s why people keep using you and discarding you.  You’re not loveable.  You are worthless.  You are fat, ugly, stupid.”  That’s that narrative running in my head on a daily fucking basis, and now because of my parents, I have to unlearn all of that to have some sort of normal life.
I’m so exhausted.  I had my ex call me last night at 1am, so I’m tired and frustrated from that as well.  I’ll get more into that later, too, but basically it was a sob story.  Him trying to play on my empathy, but he didn’t realize than any empathy I ever had for him has disappeared.  And I could tell that shocked him.  Nothing he said made me feel bad for him.  And he said some “sad” shit.  Saying he wanted to die and all that stuff.  I was like, “Oh.  I’m sorry you feel that way.”  He was just blown away at my coldness, I could tell.  I couldn’t help it.  He contributed to making me that way.  It’s his own fucking fault.

I keep trying to understand people.  I just don’t.  Can anyone give me their opinion on this situation?  Because I don’t understand it at all.  So, a month ago, I went to get a tattoo.  I had already gotten a tattoo from this guy once, and that first time, I thought I felt a “vibe” between me and the artist because as soon as we started talking, we had this instant chemistry and we found out we had a LOT of things in common.  I even thought he was flirting with me, but I wasn’t sure.  I have pretty low self-esteem, so I just told myself he’s just a nice dude, don’t look too much into it.  So, a month later, I decided I wanted another tattoo and messaged him.  He gave me an appointment as the last person of the day… so we would be in his shop by ourselves.
So that second time I went in for my tattoo, he immediately started flirting with me to the point it was unmistakable this time.  We both even confessed we were attracted to each other and would definitely fuck each other (LOL).  I’ll try to keep it short and say he really, truly seemed to genuinely like me, and for me to say that is a lot, because I’m always thinking of the worst-case scenario, like “Eh, they’re just being nice, or joking with me.”  Even when I was with Troy a couple months ago, I knew he wasn’t SUPER into me.  I could just feel it.  I knew it.  So when he stopped messaging me, it didn’t surprise me at all.  But this guy was saying stuff like, “Come see me anytime!”  At the end of the night, we ended up making out a little too.  Then he gave me his number and he was like, “You can blow up my phone!  Seriously!  I don’t care!”  I was like, “Okay, I’ll probably text you tomorrow or something.”  He was like, “Do it!”
So, I was really excited that night.  He made me feel wanted and liked for the first time in a long time.  So, I texted him the next day just a coup0le of times, nothing serious, just trying to chat, and he just replied with one-word responses.  I was like, “Okay, he’s a busy dude.  I get it.”  So, I tried again the next day, and got short answers again, and I even asked if he wanted to hang out sometime and it took him 4 hours to respond with, “Sure, I’d love to.”  And I said, “Okay, let me know when you’re free.”  And he didn’t respond to that.  I left him alone for a couple days, then I tried to message him again that Saturday.  I told him I had a couple things I wanted to give him and asked if I could stop by to see him and he said he wasn’t working, he was doing something with his kid.  I understood that.  But he didn’t say, “Rain check, or I’ll message you later.”  So, I gave up on trying, and he hasn’t messaged me since then.  That was like 4 weeks ago.  I’ve heard nothing from him.
So, my question is, WHAT THE FUCK?!  Why act like you’re super interested, AND KISS ME, only to fucking do a 180 overnight?  What is that?  Why?  Can someone please explain it to me?  Because I don’t fucking understand.
And at this point, how am I not supposed to think there is something wrong with me?  How am I not supposed to believe I’m just unlovable or weird?  How am I not supposed to just believe that I only attract creeps and abusive people?  How?  Why?  WHAT. THE. FUCK.?!

I keep trying to think positive thoughts.  Been working on my self-esteem and I’ve been doing better, but every once in a while, I have a day where I just want to cry all day.  I start thinking these things…
Why did Otha act interested and just switch up literally over night?  I don’t understand.  What happened?  It makes me feel so fucking humiliated.  Because here I was, thinking he was so into me and I start messaging him, only to get barely anything back, and it makes me feel fucking STUPID.  Like how could I be such a fool?  It feels like it was all a joke.  Like, Haha, this bitch thought I liked her when I kissed her.  It’s fucking humiliating.  And I’m getting over the Troy thing, but the fact he was messaging almost every day until we met up and messed around… It just feels degrading.  Like, “Oh, I’m done with her, no need for further communication and attention.”  And when Chris was messing around with me but trying to get in relationships with other women.  When I asked why, he said I was just “too sweet” to be in a relationship with.  WTF does that even mean?
It feels like I’m disposable.  It feels like I’m just a huge fucking joke to these people.  I feel like an object.

Sometimes I feel like I don’t even deserve to exist.  After my break-up, I was very much set on the fact I would never date again.  Then Troy started messaging me back in March.  I was so excited because he was the one I truly wanted to be with before I met my ex, but he had led me on, then decided he didn’t want me.  But, he started messaging again, so I couldn’t help but get excited.  I’m not going into all that AGAIN.  I’ve already talked about it all.  But now he doesn’t talk to me anymore.  Then that thing happened with Otha and I got excited again.  But that was another huge let down.  So, I feel like the only men who do want me are creeps, weirdos, morons, and narcissists.  I have high standards now, and the only ones that meet them, are people who don’t want me.  What does that say about me?  That I only attract the bottom of the barrel?
So when these men don’t want me, it’s like I start thinking what they might be thinking.  Like, when I post something on FB, I make up this thing in my head like when Otha sees it, he’s thinking how stupid or annoying I am and how I don’t deserve to exist.  Yeah, I know.  It’s dramatic.  Then sometimes at work, I feel like that.  When I walk into the  break room every day when I first get to work. there is a group of people that are sitting there almost every day, and they are people that never talk to me.  They always glare at me.  Everyone else in the building seems to like me.  But this group seems to not.  And one of them is this guy that over a year ago… he was acting interested in me.  He asked if I was single and told other people he thought I would be a good person to date  because I seemed like a “good girl.” Whatever the fuck that means.  Anyway, he told me to add him on FB, so I did.  Literally OVER NIGHT, he changed his mind.  He sent me a message saying he shouldn’t have tried to flirt with me and he bascially was saying, “Never mind,” in a nice way.  Like WTF?  And ever since then, he has been rude to me any time we have to converse regarding work things.  And he always avoids looking at me, or talking to me, unless his gaze just happens to fall on me, and he doesn’t look very happy about this.  WTF?  So anyway, I feel like every time I walk in the room and he’s there, I can feel his hate (I don’t even know why he hates me… he’s the one that said ‘nevermind’), and I can feel him thinking that I don’t deserve to exist.  I don’t know what I did that pissed him off so bad.  Maybe he saw something on my FB he didn’t like?  But I don’t know what it would be?  No fucking clue.
So yeah.  Bad depression today.  I feel like I don’t deserve to exist.  There is something very wrong with me and others can see it.
