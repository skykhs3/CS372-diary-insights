my last breath
hold on to me love
you know i can‚Äôt stay long
all i wanted to say was i love you and i‚Äôm not afraid
can you hear me?
can you feel me in your arms?
holding my last breath
safe inside myself
are all my thoughts of you
sweet raptured light it ends here tonight
i‚Äôll miss the winter
a world of fragile things
look for me in the white forest
hiding in a hollow tree (come find me)
i know you hear me
i can taste it in your tears
holding my last breath
safe inside myself
are all my thoughts of you
sweet raptured light it ends here tonight
closing your eyes to disappear
you pray your dreams will leave you here
but still you wake and know the truth
no one‚Äôs there
say goodnight
don‚Äôt be afraid
calling me calling me as you fade to black 
mood check is delirious and kinda groggy‚Ä¶the song kinda is the theme or quote of the day‚Ä¶later yahll‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.

‚Äúcuts like a knife so deep it hurts is the words of cyndi thompson‚Ä¶..‚Äù I decided to come back and really write something meaningful for me,I am hurting and my heart is so full of questions regarding the person that i last gave it to‚Ä¶Kristina ( imortal k‚Äù) I didnt really think that I still hurt when it came to her, it has been two years and some months, but I still ache and my heart skips its normal rythym and boom there I go again,I have told people i have a wall up but it isnt really there it is a shell of soft tissue and a reborn heart that still has the same ingredients for pain. I have taken meds, have talked it out, have prayed and still the memory kills my every strand of my heart üôÅ I am so sick and tired of being the guy that women or girls come to for emotional pick me ups or the story of the guy for the day or night‚Ä¶.i enjoy helping people and most of the time I dont care, but after awhile its like these people make the same choices over and over‚Ä¶and im a great guy..so why not me? People often stare at me with glances that I cant read..never smiles of happiness but stares of ‚Ä¶hmm repulse? I have done the whole self help stuff hell i am goin thru school to council, i love me‚Ä¶but the truth of the matter is most dont‚Ä¶and that just messes with my physche‚Äô because I dont understand why they wouldnt‚Ä¶I pray..I meditate, it all lasts for a short time, then the feelings of inadequecy set in again‚Ä¶I dont know what normal is anymore, I only feel secure when im out doing lord knows what‚Ä¶i just want to be loved..i crave it like a drug‚Ä¶didnt have it as a child,, not as a adolescent..and now not as a adult‚Ä¶and those of you that say be patient it will happen‚Ä¶do lonley people really believe those cliches? its the ones that are in a relationship talking that nonsense. then when they are alone ‚Ä¶the words of advice just dont seem to fit anymore‚Ä¶my mind is so tired‚Ä¶my heart aches so much,,not tryin to be a victim or a martyr‚Ä¶just a guy tryin to understand why i am in this spot and trying desperately to live in the moment of alone‚Ä¶im not depressed‚Ä¶im sad there is a difference‚Ä¶and medication doesnt cure it all if you yourself dont learn how to adapt to a new way of thinkin..otherwise you get off the meds and boom! same thoughts same actions‚Ä¶vicious cycle‚Ä¶if this entry alienates some of you im sorry‚Ä¶but this is me and i have listened to your stories for a long time‚Ä¶how bout giving me my time to speak? Some days are sane and others are just plain crazy‚Ä¶without hope or any sunshine..i miss the thought of being in a circle of tranquility and completeness‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.this is all for now‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶talk to you soon‚Ä¶.off to work out.*

song of the moment:who needs pictures by brad paisley
mood:groggy but inspired
Good afternoon, I am sitting here looking at the flashing cursor tick tick across the screen as my thought pattern is more stable then my last entry.In a emotional kinda state..your emotions take over and bam~you have a verbal meltdown and then you have time to assimilate it all. I think some of the reason for these feelings to be surfacing is because of the class I am taking it is almost like a daily therapy session. It is definately bringing out some feelings, some that I forget even existed. My teacher is a great inspiration and leader, you know sometimes god puts people in your life to lead you to the right path or to the right people well, I think right now that is happening and its kinda scary even though you know what is going on.Thanks for you guys that have taken a interest in my feelings it means alot to hear the positive comments i receive. 
I am off today and tommorow so i think i will take it easy with no real expectations..or plans. I am making a concious effort to remain in the moment and quit trying to live in yesterday or the pain of the past because obiously i cant handle it and need some deep rooted counceling to be able to. I dont write in here to be a whiner or anything like that because i know there is people out there with more severe problems then i..i think i will go to a movie or two today‚Ä¶just hang out and relax‚Ä¶if any of you want to hang with me call me or come by‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.have a great day..love you all

In time we meet people along the way
those that come, go or just fade into
space, and in time we wonder if they really
existed at all‚Ä¶just a vision of light
not expected to be seen in the darkness filled
hall. I look up and wonder where has my years 
gone, am i really that further down this road 
of life we take as minutes on a clock, but who 
pays is it hourly or just in stock.,mostly in stock
of a unfullfilled dream or quest, we often try to be 
the best, if we fall we blaim him for that,
instead of knowing we dropped the hat, if a person
thinks that he or she gets out without paying 
some along the way‚Ä¶pain is a token that the devil 
takes on a daily basis, we are to ignorant to acknowledge
or even fight for our sanity or happiness,just rolling thru life on that darkend bus, we use all sorts of things to fill the void of a jaded heart, never really erasing but allowing it to try to stop. one day it will and then we will be faced with the light that was never seen in the darkness then what do we do, laugh and say this is a illusion too? love exists in the purest of the pure, its the expectations of others that causes us to never see or feel the joy‚Ä¶.if a drop of rain can erase the blemishes of the world, then how could a tear not bring the same kind of joy to the soul?some confuse kindness for weakness and i ask you this‚Ä¶.if it didnt exist‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.would you be here to be missed? the clouds are rolling away from the sunshined horizon of a delicate heart‚Ä¶.waitin for the blood to flow again for a moment of pureness to start‚Ä¶it may be a prayer or a nice warm smile,,,,more of these things might warm the world and somehow make it thaw‚Ä¶..so the jaded pieces of my heart are scattered and tryin to make them make sense‚Ä¶.i think ill sit back and just let the rays hit me‚Ä¶and the drops of rain to cleanse my soul‚Ä¶.anyone want to dabble in my sunshowered stroll‚Ä¶.:) winks‚Ä¶*

mood: song of the moment is way i am by eminem
I decided to start this entry with a little bit of emotion check‚Ä¶  you tell me what you think‚Ä¶evil smirk
:::Lyrics
Album: Marshall Mathers LP (2000)
Song: The Way I am
[Eminem]
Whatever..
Dre, just let it run
Aiyyo turn the beat up a little bit
Aiyyo.. this song is for anyone.. fu*k it 
Just shut up and listen, aiyyo..
I sit back with this pack of Zig Zags and this bag
of this weed it gives me the shit needed to be
the most meanest MC on this ‚Äî on this Earth
And since birth I‚Äôve been cursed with this curse to just curse
And just blurt this berserk and bizarre sh** that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
all this tension dispensin these sentences
Gettin this stress that‚Äôs been eatin me recently off of this chest
and I rest again peacefully (peacefully)..
but at least have the decency in you
to leave me alone, when you freaks see me out 
in the streets when I‚Äôm eatin or feedin my daughter
to not come and speak to me (speak to me)..
I don‚Äôt know you and no, 
I don‚Äôt owe you a mo-therf**k-in thing
I‚Äôm not Mr. N‚ÄôSync, I‚Äôm not what your friends think
I‚Äôm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick
if you tempt me my tank is on empty (is on empty)..
No patience is in me and if you offend me 
I‚Äôm liftin you 10 feet (liftin you 10 feet).. in the air 
I don‚Äôt care who is there and who saw me destroy you
Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
I‚Äôll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
I‚Äôm tired of all you (of all you)..
I don‚Äôt mean to be mean but that‚Äôs all I can be is just me
Chorus: Eminem
And I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn‚Äôt, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news everyday I am
Radio won‚Äôt even play my jam
Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn‚Äôt, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news everyday I am
I don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs just the way I am
[Eminem]
Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered
with all of this nonsense it‚Äôs constant
And, ‚ÄúOh, it‚Äôs his lyrical content ‚Äì
‚Äì the song ‚ÄòGuilty Conscience‚Äô has gotten such rotten responses‚Äù
And all of this controversy circles me
and it seems like the media immediately
points a finger at me (finger at me)..
So I point one back at ‚Äôem, but not the index or pinkie
or the ring or the thumb, it‚Äôs the one you put up
when you don‚Äôt give a fuck, when you won‚Äôt just put up
with the bullshit they pull, cause they full of shit too
When a dude‚Äôs gettin bullied and shoots up his school
and they blame it on Marilyn (on Marilyn).. and the heroin
Where were the parents at? And look where it‚Äôs at
Middle America, now it‚Äôs a tragedy
Now it‚Äôs so sad to see, an upper class ci-ty
havin this happenin (this happenin)..
then attack Eminem cause I rap this way (rap this way)..
But I‚Äôm glad cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire 
to burn and it‚Äôs burnin and I have returned
Chorus
[Eminem]
I‚Äôm so sick and tired of bein admired
that I wish that I would just die or get fired
and dropped from my label and stop with the fables
I‚Äôm not gonna be able to top on ‚ÄúMy Name is..‚Äù
And pigeon-holed into some pop-py sensation
to cop me rotation at rock‚Äôn‚Äôroll stations
And I just do not got the patience (got the patience)..
to deal with these cocky caucasians who think
I‚Äôm some wigger who just tries to be black cause I talk 
with an accent, and grab on my balls, so they always keep askin 
the same fu**in questions (fu**in questions)..
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in
The why, the who what when, the where, and the how
‚Äôtil I‚Äôm grabbin my hair and I‚Äôm tearin it out
cause they drivin me crazy (drivin me crazy).. I can‚Äôt take it 
I‚Äôm racin, I‚Äôm pacin, I stand and I sit
And I‚Äôm thankful for ev-ery fan that I get
But I can‚Äôt take a SH*T, in the bathroom
without someone standin by it
No I won‚Äôt sign your autograph
You can call me an as*hole I‚Äôm glad
oh well one of my all time favs..:) I am doing okay today I just basically tired of people that try to manipulate or try to threaten me especially when i try to be civil and its not my fault their emotional state wont let them see past the $$ in the situation..we are all broke we all hurt‚Ä¶we all work long hours‚Ä¶.get over it‚Ä¶i have tried to be civil and this person just wont see the light she always thinks its a personal attack towards her‚Ä¶I am through with it..i am better then the tension i receive from her‚Ä¶always drama from her ‚Ä¶like life is any easier on my end of the stick‚Ä¶so im sorry for you readers that have to endure the poor me entries‚Ä¶just a moment in time‚Ä¶we all have em‚Ä¶i pray that all this fades away and the truth shal set us free‚Ä¶i love all of you for truly giving me the opportunity to voice my opinion without judgement‚Ä¶and btw i was called ‚Äúpreaching‚Äù how many of you that know me think i preach..my beliefs on you? oh well..enuff on that tangent‚Ä¶the week is almost over and how many of you guys got the pimp juice out and the beer or whiskey chillin‚Ä¶if so drink one for me‚Ä¶i work all weekend‚Ä¶ill be back to write a real entry this is just a short lalalala‚Ä¶.sticks middle finger in the air~!‚Ä¶.hehehe‚Ä¶that that does not kill you only makes you stronger‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.quote of the day:)

I am not angry and not sixty nine either, i am just a guy that has the world on his damn shoulders sometimes and others take personal attacks at my character just because im honest‚Ä¶i had a hell of a night last night i couldnt sleep and this morning had class and had to head bob it thru it..anger is my fuel to the positive side of the horizon‚Ä¶if i gave a damn bout other peoples perception of me .. i can only be good for me or even be cared for by me‚Ä¶but the only reason i write bout sadness is because lonliness gets the best of me at times..i just moved to this area and dont know very many people and am used to a smaller area with lots of people always around..for those of you that dont know..my parents are in prison..my brother in san angelo‚Ä¶we are close and unfortunatly the only family i have at the moment. the rest of my family isnt close and scattered so the support system for now is the internet and the few people i know‚Ä¶and those people have their own problems so i keep alot to myself.i miss having a gf yes‚Ä¶but i miss the closeness of what a female brings‚Ä¶and this area is so fast that its not the easiest to get to know someone or to keep them around‚Ä¶can someone explain why drivin around dallas that it seems like the roads never end‚Ä¶.lol oh well, just wanted to send a shout out of positive light even though it has been a hellofa day..hot hot hot‚Ä¶love you all and if ya can say a prayer for me‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..:) ~~ martin

mood:here and there
song:bring me to life>evanescense
In a cloud studded storm a drenced soul
looks for shelter or a calm so they can 
get some control,the rain never stops and
the aching pain in the veins of life always
seem to slow and stop even tho a jolt of 
thunder always makes it start again, been
searching many years for a answer to the 
storm all i can think of is it was around
before i was born,the stillness of a moment
in time, the ticking of the clock that just 
seems to stand still, the half empty glass
of will, raising your head to the sky, asking
for cleanseing so the rain doesnt burn the skin
then off again we go to sin, we fall in a enigma
of questions that never seen to get answered 
in this quest we call life..just faces with 
different masks, is the true identity ever 
really seen?, the battle scars are etched across
my organ of trickling life juice, that to is 
always trying to stop and explode,the glass that 
have etched my eyes for so many years, i am 
ready for the tears, they never escape but build
up underneath the surface of the sandy skin,i dont
know what pain is anymore even tho my mind tells
me to feel, lost in a three walled world with no
exits or seals‚Ä¶the air is thick in here the 
beating of the drums never quit, a passion of 
stinch fills the air, aching for the rain to appear,
help the tears seep thru the cuts in my veins 
and slits in my soul, i stop long enough to look up 
again and see the thunder roll, feel the juice start to
trickle again, then a warmth comes over my soul, as 
soon as that starts the tears extinquish the flame 
and and there we are again‚Ä¶plz help my veins to bleed
the oceans of salty venom that is constantly burning
my flame out‚Ä¶help it to start and never stop,help
it to overcome the distance from my HEArt, somewhere
in between there is a place of redemption and not of
pain‚Ä¶.but will i ever make it thru the rain???
hey you guys, hope you are having a great day, i felt creative today and decided to jot down some lines‚Ä¶i am happy and chilling. i love to write poetry and make up art‚Ä¶.:) i just had a bowel of cereal some poppy things‚Ä¶was pretty good.I am goin to get my check and pay some bills‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.ugh..lol love you all and hope you have a great day.:) laterssssssss‚Äú‚ÄúmaRtIn

Hi there journal,I am sittin here thinking bout the injustices of the world and wondering why such things have to be. It seems like everyone has the magical solutions to everybody elses life but their own. I guess just because they are so indulged in their misery that they cant see a way out of the insanity. Im not perfect by any means but believe you me ‚Ä¶people wont see this disclaimer they will just read up to this and start attacking‚Ä¶the world is full of self righteous people that think that the whole existance is making as much as they can while they are here‚Ä¶.does it matter when the kingdom we are supposed to be trying to get to we will never have to hurt again? this is a stepping stone folks‚Ä¶live in the flesh or out of it‚Ä¶its a shell that protects the soul and the very brain center of our existance‚Ä¶the heart‚Ä¶if that isnt pure then there is no way you could ever have any reason to gripe‚Ä¶no one can clean it for you‚Ä¶no one can restore it for you‚Ä¶no one can make you whole ‚Ä¶.only one can and if i have to tell you ‚Ä¶i dont think you believed anyways‚Ä¶.but as a server‚Ä¶HIS NAME IS JESUS‚Ä¶may youfind him soon..cause living life for your kids‚Ä¶your job‚Ä¶your family‚Ä¶and not knowing him is not enuff to keep you from going to hell‚Ä¶we all gripe bout what we dont have ‚Ä¶but what do we really need‚Ä¶.great health and peace of mind go along way. if you take this as preaching or whatever dont read anymore‚Ä¶its your lost. he is the salvation that everything exists in‚Ä¶all i can ask you is..do you want to be rich and die with none of it and never know him or his father? people take goodness as boredom, i know i have for a long time, if i didnt go to the clubs..or chasing this girl and that..or indulging in liquor or taboo behavior i wasnt‚Äùhappy‚Äù well im just trying to make a concious effort to change things and allow my soul some salvation and to be cleansed from all the dirty things that i have let in..i dont think that many really understand the goodness they are missing out on‚Ä¶because it takes believeing in something that you dont see‚Ä¶..well let me ask you this‚Ä¶how come it is easier to believe that cliche‚Äô ‚Äúhe is out there just stop looking and be patient and have faith that he is..‚Äù well you believe that for a mortal guy but not for the most promising figure the world has ever known‚Ä¶.no wonder you get your hearts broke..your mind scrambled and our livers jacked up‚Ä¶because we are all waiting for the wrong things‚Ä¶..people places and things‚Ä¶they all fade‚Ä¶.and beauty fades‚Ä¶.those tight abs end up dropping‚Ä¶and that cute face gets old and grey‚Ä¶so why not put your faith in something that doesnt ever fade or cause you pain..if you truly believe‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..JESUS and his father GOD‚Ä¶.I am new to the area and have tried to make friends and people that are true to themselves and stuff and that task is so hard this day in age‚Ä¶i have felt like i have had to adapt to fit in‚Ä¶im sick of it‚Ä¶and starting to do something about it‚Ä¶.i love martin he is a great guy‚Ä¶..and those of you that truly want to know that‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..you know where im at‚Ä¶lets talk sometime‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..have a great day and keep smiling..love you all‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶martin

as you read earlier ‚Ä¶the devil is running rampant and taking souls‚Ä¶i am trying so hard to defend mine. i feel edgy and on alert‚Ä¶like someone is trying to attack me as i have taken my guard down.when you hurt no one really cares and calls it weakness or a emotional breakdown ..but who was the idiot that said men dont cry? well because of that idiot..my tears are all inside in a stream of emotion that i dont know how to bring out‚Ä¶i am like a little kid that doesnt allow himself to feel or to even care bout others..and tho im going into a field where taking care of others is the primary goal‚Ä¶that is the purpose i am trying to get in check with myself‚Ä¶first. it is a hard painful process trying to cleanse the soul..of garbage and insecurities‚Ä¶my father beat me so severly as a child that i wonder if it succeded when in time rejection, loss, take its toll on my heart in ways that they shouldnt‚Ä¶i let girls telling me no as a way or form of rejection or those old feelings come surfacing up and they burn me apart at all the areas of my soul. i admit that i am not the normal looking guy but i love myself and sometimes wonder why people cant get to this level of me to realize that the exterior isnt the best i can be or do‚Ä¶if they only listened with their heart..it may be a different adventure. today was a weird day..i have been so sleepy and tired that i just kinda lounged it. i took my car into the body shop for a total redoing of it. so in bout two weeks or so the car will be ready for me . i got class in the morning and was supposed to go hang with a friend that was having problems tonight‚Ä¶but of course they never called and well here i am‚Ä¶writing about it..oh what a exciting life i live. i have a birthday on the way and i guess in the back of my mind i am feeling my age or something because i am starting to hurt slowly from the vicious workouts i exhibit. i am trying to slow down my drinking and most of the time dont realize i dont indulge like i once did..i feel physchotic‚Ä¶at times and i know im not..i just want so much more outta my life and have to realize that i must be patient in order for that to happen‚Ä¶and that in his will for my soul all things can be done:).once again if i stepped on any toes or sound to poor me‚Ä¶read again til you can take some empathy from your heart and truly understand where i am trying to come from‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..well im out‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..martin

Hi journal, whats up my fellow pad of blackend thought process?just woke up from a nap.whoa, the dreams of the subconcious mind are intense at times and most of the time insane. how that you can view your dream and it seem so real and dimensional makes ya wonder if that isnt a way to view exactly what your soul is trying to tell you ‚Ä¶that you need to fix. I have to work tonight and just plain tired..i dont understand why im so tired all the time anymore, it isnt like im fat or outta shape just always sluggish and lathargic‚Ä¶i eat well and excercise‚Ä¶right now listening to some techno song that is keeping a beat in my mind and allowing my fire to start to heat up‚Ä¶.can ya feel the burrrrrrn‚Ä¶.oh yeah baby make it burnnnn‚Ä¶lol newho im not a big techno fan‚Ä¶but at times it has the right beat to energize the soul and get ya moving‚Ä¶how many of you are dancers or ravers out there????? hell ya gimme a shout out‚Ä¶.i put my screename on yahoo messenger if you feel the urge to holla at me‚Ä¶im not 16‚Ä¶or anything just like the concept of the song‚Ä¶girl disses guy ‚Ä¶guy gets famous‚Ä¶girl likes what she see‚Äôs and guy has moved on with someone that loves him for him‚Ä¶‚Ä¶yeah~! so in time we all get ours‚Ä¶there were times when a overweight girl liked me but i shunned her‚Ä¶but look now i like some girls and get dissed ..it all comes around i guess‚Ä¶lol hmmmm‚Ä¶..as the music plays my mind unloads its garbage on this page as i try to control my anger and let it just flow out‚Ä¶damn its hard dealing with things when they just rise up and rear their ugly heads‚Ä¶gimme the light and pass the notes‚Ä¶.i dont ever remember life being as hard as some people bring it to me‚Ä¶they hate this they hate that‚Ä¶and it all revolves around a damn guy or how a guy is acting‚Ä¶they all want peace love and happiness but their insides are full of insecurty and doubt so it just pushes the guys away‚Ä¶.or vice versa‚Ä¶.they all want to cling on to that ‚Äúone‚Äù because of the exterior or whatever but in time‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.boom they back crying bout that guy fucked them over‚Ä¶.lol grow up life fucks you the hardest people just warm you up for it‚Ä¶kinda like the lubing process or something sick like that. time to rise above the mortals and remain focused on the eternal light that is being beamed down on us‚Ä¶..if your life is so bad‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶what the hell are you doing to change it? what is it that you are looking for with every guy that you quest‚Ä¶that you dont possess? men arent the fix all as women arent‚Ä¶we just make it a little better‚Ä¶but let me be bold and honest‚Ä¶for the most part ..if your cute ‚Ä¶all we want is ass!! unless you prove to be more then that‚Ä¶but some of you women dont want more then that from us‚Ä¶so how can you be the victim when you are just as shallow.? that is why i gave up the game along time ago and try to look deeper then the skin tone or luscious legs‚Ä¶or stuff like that‚Ä¶cause i want more then ‚Äúass‚Äù but we learn early in the lockerrooms of the world‚Ä¶women that give it up‚Ä¶.and are easy have a look bout them and act a certain way‚Ä¶we are programmed‚Ä¶and we spot you a mile away‚Ä¶you go out bitching bout this guy and that‚Ä¶hehehe..guess what he is gettin his pole lubed for ya cause all he has to say is the right things to pick you up‚Ä¶..then what‚Ä¶next thing you know you are bitching bout him to another in a couple of weeks if your that lucky..so cut the bullshit you know who i am talking to out there‚Ä¶.get your self straight‚Ä¶if you want to be used stay dirty and easy‚Ä¶and you get what you put in..so quit bitchin to me bout guys‚Ä¶lol i am one no matter how different i am‚Ä¶.look in the mirror and make the change‚Ä¶to quote a weird but on track guy‚Ä¶it starts with you..if you hate your life its because of what you do in it‚Ä¶.its yours‚Ä¶you only get it once‚Ä¶so why you wasting it trying to make another your total reason for existing..lol‚Ä¶next sermon..:P well i have to get ready for work‚Ä¶.long night and day ahead of me‚Ä¶.this entry is harsh and blunt ..but they all cant be inspirational:) im human also‚Ä¶come back soon ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶love you all:)

song: stay gone..by jimmy wayne
Hi journal, just another day in paradise. I just decided to stop by and pay some homage. So let the bloodwork begin. while jimmy preaches on and makes all of our hearts ache‚Ä¶lets talk:)I read my last entry and it was a little on the blada blada‚Ä¶screw girls vibe and not the intention at all. I love females..just stupid ones i cant stand for a long amount of time. I am just opinionated and such at this point in my life because of the cleansing of my soul that i am trying to accomplish. i have allowed many to hurt me or even get to the very core of my existance and its not worth it. everyone shouldnt be given that special part of me even if they do act like they want to be there, because it is just a illusion that is made up for the foolish at heart.i am a sensitive emotional guy~~journal‚Ä¶ya know? for most people that just doesnt fit because im not a little miniscule of a guy that should be..(stereotype)..lol newho for those of you that know me‚Ä¶my fuck the world attitude is just growing stronger and once again im taking applications for those that truly want to be in my world..not the emotional leaches that get on here to spill this and that‚Ä¶but never really live the way they talk‚Ä¶that is one thing im working on‚Ä¶if i say something..i need to live it..otherwise it is counterproductive and a recipe for disaster. anger issues oh man..do i have em‚Ä¶here are some things that tick me off‚Ä¶.if you say martin lets hang out‚Ä¶mean it‚Ä¶if you say martin we should do this..or that‚Ä¶dont blow smoke up my ass to pacify me..im grown and dont need dishonesty just because at the moment i may seem fragile, if you have a bf or husband and need that support that he doenst give you..i enjoy these people but damn..they always end up throwin my friendship out because their sig other doesnt understand the need for me..to be around‚Ä¶well dipshit get off the horse and be a real man‚Ä¶which means learning to feel and talk‚Ä¶and not be mean to her all the time about stupid shit‚Ä¶then there would be no need for guys like me‚Ä¶because you would be one..damn take the cowboy hat off long nuff to let your brain breathe and really fill the hat up instead of hiding lil man syndrome in that mf‚Ä¶lol if you say‚Ä¶martin i will call you back or hell even say i will call you‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.plz do even if its to say im busy we can try again later‚Ä¶common ettitcate..mispelt im sure‚Ä¶but oh well you get the picture‚Ä¶im sick of liers‚Ä¶and you know im tryin to get better at some of this myself‚Ä¶as some of you know im the worst‚Ä¶but damn that only amplifies my shortcomings when you dont come real with it‚Ä¶im workin on me..so if you want to be here as my friend or whatever how bout doin the same ..?i dont use this forum as a bitch session or anything other then a forum where i can vent and letcha into some things that you can do to better our friendship as well as letcha know what i am doin to do that also:) i was so pure once‚Ä¶believe it or not‚Ä¶i walked away because kristina broke my heart‚Ä¶then i said screw it‚Ä¶ill never love again‚Ä¶because when love engulfs your life as gods love did mine back then‚Ä¶its a hard pill to swallow when it gets rocked and i didnt fight for it‚Ä¶i walked away..hopeing to take the easier way out‚Ä¶.i really loved her‚Ä¶and didnt really know how to LOVE her..if that makes sense‚Ä¶she wasnt the type of girl that i needed to make me whole because we lived different lives and made our way to the middle to make it work‚Ä¶was a real healthy thing‚Ä¶and now i search and act so damn desperate like i would just get with anyone because the nights of lonliness are to strong to handle at times..one reason i work em..so i dont have to be at home in bed alone..i know my behavior sounds codependent as hell..but i miss the support the strenght of a female is unmatched on this planet‚Ä¶makes men act fools‚Ä¶to preserve it‚Ä¶im not questing anymore or gonna try not to because i am talkin to a female right now that is so kewl..but we are just friends‚Ä¶i can handle that ‚Ä¶and it doesnt all have to be bout me‚Ä¶at least not for today ‚Ä¶hey god want to take the stage now? btw im not really needy today‚Ä¶.so just thought i would write and letcha in for one more entry‚Ä¶and may your day be full of smiles‚Ä¶.i have a long way to go be4 i can be a bf again so women dont panic or quit talkin to me‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..she is special tho‚Ä¶well talk to you guys soon‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.love ya all.:) someone say lets get this one started? rock on!~!~‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..*falls down*‚Ä¶hehehehehe ~martin

song:epiphany by staind
Hi journal, i had to come back to type in you again because the last entry was kinda dry and not really up to par by my standards..this song is so sentimental to me for some reason..maybe because when it came out i played it none stop for six months trying to find a clue in the song that could break me out of the circle of destruction i was in. I had a weird day today as you read earlier, but still my spirit is calm. I am very thankful for that. there is a verse in this song that states..‚Äùi am a nothing more then a little boy inside..who crys out for attention then i run to hide..‚Äù well that is so true to most of my life up to this point. I crave to be heard so i speak and then i dont want the spotlight on me‚Ä¶its like in high school, i was a star football player who ended up with a scholarship to college‚Ä¶i was awesome so they said..but i never felt like i could live up to the awesome moniker so i never enjoyed the spotlight‚Ä¶always did it because i was so full of pain and football helped me channel that energy and to let it out all at once..i have been chained by those demons since..its like a burning fire i cant put out..and most of the time i dont know if im calm or happy or just in the moment‚Ä¶lots of weird things goin on inside my body‚Ä¶i know im not alone and that is why i write to try to find some kind of calmness that can help my soul..i miss my brother, i talked to him today and he sounded like i used to‚Ä¶hearts my heart ‚Ä¶but all i can do is pray for him and hope he makes it thru these dark times‚Ä¶damn its hard being human at times‚Ä¶not only do you have to meet up to your warped interpetation of what you are..but others tend to try to mold yours also‚Ä¶and then god forbid you have issues from your past‚Ä¶.lol no wonder it would be insightful to buy stock in anti-depressants..lol‚Ä¶i talked to my belle of a friend tonight‚Ä¶she always brings a smile to my face even tho she and i have yet to meet‚Ä¶i think the thing i like bout her is her honesty and non shallowness ‚Ä¶and maturity. rock on!..lol well alot of you want to know bout my parents‚Ä¶well..they are both in prison..my dad was charged with aggravated sexual assualt back in 89‚Ä¶and has been in since‚Ä¶my mother is in also..she was there against her will and she got probation and did eight of ten years ‚Ä¶then they revoked her because she got behind on her payments‚Ä¶so she had to plea because she didnt have the money for a high priced attorney‚Ä¶so she is currently in and i miss her‚Ä¶we have tried to bridge the gaps between us in this time..but it has been hard because my dad used to hit me so vicious i thought on occasion he was gonna kill me ‚Ä¶he has choked me ‚Ä¶the scars on my head..they are his handy work‚Ä¶i always had faith in god‚Ä¶even young‚Ä¶i would pray make me big lord‚Ä¶
make me not feel his anger on me‚Ä¶please take him away‚Ä¶and then it happend i wasnt happy bout it because who wants to tell people their dad is a rapist‚Ä¶not the most formible way to get to know people‚Ä¶but you know what..i dont hide much anymore because i am tryin to get this out..if you judge me do it‚Ä¶i know the true people wont think i am like that ‚Ä¶if anything his addiction turned me against sex and stuff for a long time because i didnt know if i had the possibility for that and stuff‚Ä¶scared the shit outta me‚Ä¶so it messed with my relationships‚Ä¶the girls i was with never understood my family situation‚Ä¶i am a little boy inside‚Ä¶lookin for positive attention and i do go to hide‚Ä¶when i get it‚Ä¶because for the most part i have never had people in my life that said good things and stayed true to them‚Ä¶they always used them against me when things went bad‚Ä¶so i am working on that‚Ä¶love has been distorted in my world for so long..all this time i have had to raise my brother and have so many things on my shoulders‚Ä¶havent gotten to really know martin‚Ä¶or his wants needs..or likes‚Ä¶i can tellya the superficial things..but really..deep down‚Ä¶.im tryin to dig to wake up the soul i shut down so many years ago‚Ä¶for so long i learned not to feel the beatings the name callin the abuse‚Ä¶so i ended up shutting everyone and everything out‚Ä¶girls family‚Ä¶friends ‚Ä¶i want to wake up ‚Ä¶tired of the blood just trickling in my soul,i want to truly feel happiness without condition without the fear of people judging me for minut things‚Ä¶im really trying you guys‚Ä¶i have fought for martin all my life..the ones that did also have long passed away(grandma and uncle) i dont know how to cry or when‚Ä¶i keep it all in‚Ä¶and then when i truly want to say something i cant‚Ä¶for fear you wont like me or that i wont be good enuff for you..once again my insecurities‚Ä¶.im tryin to empty out the trash in my heart and soul‚Ä¶tired of the excuses the labels‚Ä¶if you think im this or im that‚Ä¶so be it‚Ä¶tired of fighting because i know im not..but when things build up‚Ä¶then i listen and feel the negative stuff‚Ä¶well im off to talk to the belle..*grins*‚Ä¶hope you enjoy one more step in my journey of insight and healing‚Ä¶love you all‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.martin

song: house of pain‚Ä¶faster pussycat
Hi journal, sup? I am sitting here just chillin enjoying my night off.if you dont know the song go download it..speaks alot of truth bout my upbringing‚Ä¶even tho my father was there still felt like he wasnt so i lived in a house of pain due to the fact of all the authoritorian child rearing going on.i told brittany last night that the song represents the mood i am in at the time of the entry so if you see a song and dont know it‚Ä¶go download it and listen to the words‚Ä¶and you will know what my mood was‚Ä¶okie focus martin. I was talking bout me growin up in the environment of despair and inconsistancy‚Ä¶there was only one thing that was constant.. me getting the crap beat out of me. i still wake up startled and ready to fight‚Ä¶if someone wakes me up hard‚Ä¶.i was never allowed to sleep peaceful always on the lookout to not be snuck up on.today in class we had to write bout our parents and what kind of people they were and how they raised us‚Ä¶well i wrote just that‚Ä¶and some. he really hurt me in a lot of ways and in time i have written to him to let him know bout it..and its like he gives me excuses instead of seeing my point‚Ä¶and admitting failure as a father‚Ä¶i have tried to hard not to be like him‚Ä¶and at times that is why i get so mad because of the way i act out..the anger the resentment‚Ä¶all taught by him‚Ä¶and passed down. i am working on these things tho..ever been hit by a gun stock? if you see the scar on the back of my head‚Ä¶yup his work‚Ä¶ever had to hold your hands out and have em palms up and hit with a rubber strap til they bled‚Ä¶all this for bad grades in school‚Ä¶damn was a ‚Äúa‚Äù really that intense for the man‚Ä¶i have been cut‚Ä¶have had lacerations and spilled alot of blood tryin to be the son‚Ä¶he wanted me to be‚Ä¶or he was gonna beat it into me‚Ä¶or out of whichever the case may have been..my mother did nothing because of the retaliation he unleashed on her if she intervened..but she couldve‚Ä¶more i think. i will die for my kids if need be‚Ä¶or she could have left him.these beatings took on a new form when the video camera cam out‚Ä¶he became obsessed with filming women in compermising situations‚Ä¶example‚Ä¶sunbathing,at water parks..whereever there was scantly dressed women‚Ä¶the voyeur in him‚Ä¶then he would go home and god knows what..masterbate to it? all i know is that we werent allowed to bug him when he was in his room‚Ä¶so that was our only time of sanity‚Ä¶and we cherished it..ever seen the movie radio flyer.? well that was our home except my dad didnt drink or do drugs..it was sober anger ‚Ä¶i have flown thru walls‚Ä¶been choked‚Ä¶kicked‚Ä¶chained up and beat‚Ä¶locked up in a room with nothing but a bed‚Ä¶and fed at his convenience..only to go to school and home..isnt that ironic how it turned around‚Ä¶now he is in that situation..:) i dont wish him harm but he did so much that i dont pity him if he is gettin hurt‚Ä¶at least he will know what it is like for someone bigger to hurt him and not be able to do anything bout it. all these extremes in the name of bad grades‚Ä¶isnt that insane? so for so long as a adolescent felt not good enuff and then he left and boom ‚Ä¶freedom called‚Ä¶i couldnt stand my mom so i became wild‚Ä¶started drinking ‚Ä¶acting out on the field and just went crazy unleashing all the pain from the past on others‚Ä¶i hated myself for so many years and to this day battle with the insecurities that he tryed to beat out of me‚Ä¶they resurface at the hint of rejection or not feeling good nuff..i quit crying years ago..the only time i do now is when i am really really drunk..well i am sittin here just thinking wow‚Ä¶sounds like a movie script..on the demented side‚Ä¶i have held on to faith like a old familiar friend all these years as women have gone‚Ä¶friends have gone..and family has gone‚Ä¶.and today im here with martin remenising on the past‚Ä¶tryin to unload it on a page so that it quits coming back‚Ä¶well that is all for now..the brain can only unload so much in increments‚Ä¶thanks for yu guys‚Ä¶love you‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶martin

song: last goodbye‚Ä¶miranda lambert
Hi journal, just woke up and head is kinda hazey and the rain is pouring outside.I just have been sitting here listening to this song and thinking‚Ä¶how pain from a artists voice hits so deep in your own soul..how we all have some kind of connection and we feed off of it from each other whether it be positive or negative.there are times when the very string pulls the right way and boom..your heart explodes.** emotions and feelings are something i am working on journal‚Ä¶it is so hard to cry though because of the ways a person looks at you as you do‚Ä¶have you ever seen a pretty crier tho?lol im not goin into work from two to ten today‚Ä¶got my schedule changed ..i am having a dismal day of some sort and my head hurts‚Ä¶cant really breathe all to well‚Ä¶last night was full of cowboys and country music i think i am having a hangover from the sadness in the sounds..lol ..todays topic is goodbye‚Ä¶a word that is so definate and short‚Ä¶no interpetation but the end‚Ä¶there are times when goodbyes arent even stated and actions speak for the unspoken word‚Ä¶my grandma passing away is a time that this happend. She was 86..and passed away in 94‚Ä≤ at the time i couldnt feel her leaving or the pain of seeing her laying there dead in that bed at the hospital.a day be4 i saw her struggling to stay alive and didnt know at the time whether she was able to hear me or not, the feeling of not being able to save the person that took so great care of me was more then i could handle..she loved me so much..i knew that and i loved her as well..to the resentment of my cousins..i miss her..i really do.. like everything else i dont stop to think bout it cause if i dont think bout it‚Ä¶then it cant hurt‚Ä¶but im like a open sore inside of my body. she was laying there with her eyes closed and a machine was helping her breathe‚Ä¶she had congestive heart failure..which means her lungs were filling up with fluid and it was happening faster then her heart could pump out‚Ä¶so she basically aspirated in the fluid and passed on..i was so mad and didnt know how to respond to god taking her‚Ä¶i wasnt trying to be selfish but here was another in my life that truly loved me and they got taken also‚Ä¶right now i can feel the emotions i needed that day‚Ä¶they are pain, sadness, and my eyes are swelling‚Ä¶please cry ‚Ä¶eyes‚Ä¶please‚Ä¶oh god ‚Ä¶they get to the point and then stop‚Ä¶:( the second person that passed on was my uncle who was heavy into drugs and was in austin after a stint in a rehab. i later learned that he owed a substantial amount of money and that a hit had been put on him‚Ä¶and he was executed by two guys‚Ä¶he was ambushed at this house and they jumped him and broke a beer bottle over his head and stabbed him over and over again‚Ä¶and when he got to the hospital he had so much stuff in him..they couldnt stop the bleeding‚Ä¶so he hemorraged to death..person number two in my life that trully loved me and was taken away‚Ä¶different circumstance but as a young child ‚Ä¶love was taken with him..no matter what person he was or how he coped‚Ä¶he never did that stuff around me or his son‚Ä¶he self medicated and it cost him his life like in so many instances it does‚Ä¶.then anytime after that i started the trend of making it end before it even got a chance to start because ‚Ä¶i didnt like the feeling a broken heart feels like. this happend with girls‚Ä¶family‚Ä¶and friends‚Ä¶i always tried to keep people at arms length and never let them to close because i felt like if i did..eventually they would find out my family dysfunction or just end up leaving me ‚Ä¶.so i never got to close‚Ä¶and to this day i am really choosy bout whom i really trust and the ones that even reading this dont even really know me‚Ä¶and you ask yourself how is that so‚Ä¶well they read and they dont assimilate the stuff with a open mind‚Ä¶they think im whining or negative‚Ä¶all the time‚Ä¶but these are my pent up feelings and i choose to share them with you because 1. i want you to know the real me..2. when i act a certain way you will think deeper then im being a asshole or such..not making excuses but these issues have molded me and im trying so hard to change it. i never even realized some of this still existed but it is‚Ä¶and just trying to get it out constructively..its a dark road and i hope you guys have bright lights when your reading otherwise you will not truly catch where i am coming from‚Ä¶so goodbyes are hard‚Ä¶no matter if they are your fault or not‚Ä¶they leave that lasting impression in your heart that allows only so many to come in and be there and not to believe people at face value‚Ä¶because the ones i was supposed to do that with warped my reality and abused my innocence when i was a child‚Ä¶i told someone the other day that i have a little boy inside me that is curled up in a corner crying constantly..and i am makin a effort for the first time to listen to his crys‚Ä¶and try to catch him up and get those out‚Ä¶so that he may grow up into the adult i need to be..and that he may help me be strong during times that have nothing to do with me‚Ä¶but with the way i perceive things‚Ä¶.he is sittin up in the corner now‚Ä¶still crying but not as hard‚Ä¶..his name is marty by the way‚Ä¶.i have tried so many years to kill him‚Ä¶and maybe the pain would end‚Ä¶well in fact i should have been saving him and useing him to make martin stronger‚Ä¶thank you guys for listening‚Ä¶.btw goodbyes arent always so tragic‚Ä¶but still it is final so becareful how easily you use it‚Ä¶:) love you all and enjoy the rain if it is raining near you‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.i love water:) be safe and may you have a sunny inside day:P ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..*poof*

Seems that last night him and his friends had a party at their house which is a every night occurance im sure,well he goes to tell me that the rent has gotten stolen and the electric money as well‚Ä¶i didnt know what to say so i said you need to be more responsible‚Ä¶like i am swimmin in money or something‚Ä¶well he hung up mad im sure, im trying to not let this effect me but at times it is really hard because as you know he is my family and i hate to see anyone hurt let alone my own family.well unfortunately there is nothing i can do for him at this point because of my own obligations.talking bout my title of my entry..well, he heard my declarations and guess what he is doing everything in his power to make me loose my focus and my faith, after all doesnt misery love company?I am sitting here just with not much running through my head other then, i wish i had all the answers and a magical wand to fix the problems of the ones i care about the most. at this point the little boy inside of me is crying for the anger that i feel‚Ä¶i cant cry so he does and that means weakness to you well that is your buisness..i just think that all of you that make fun or judge this site‚Ä¶do you live in a glass house‚Ä¶i thought so ‚Ä¶so throw away. i have class in less then six hours and have so much on my mind‚Ä¶i have a job oppurtunity that is right there‚Ä¶the one i have wanted since i quit rivercrest two years ago‚Ä¶a redemption‚Ä¶i have a oppurtunity for what im goin to school for‚Ä¶i really am sick of the job i currently have and it would fit into my schedule other then the fact the only shift they are hiring for is from twelve at night til eight in the morning so i have to talk to my teacher to see if it is okay that i show up late and still come to class‚Ä¶i think she will go for it..but nothin is really guarenteed so its a toss up also‚Ä¶how can a person get any sleep with all this on your mind and then it be restful..i am in severe need of a massage and have a crick in my neck..lol‚Ä¶trying to just slow down these thoughts‚Ä¶.slow down my blood as it is raging thru my veins‚Ä¶i tell you im not sad right now im just fuckin pissed and i know that people cant make you anything but that is a art i have yet to master, i have lots of work on my anger before i can master that art‚Ä¶i know so many that say forget bout it it will get better well how many have walked in my shoes? how many?not many and i know that we all have unanswered dreams‚Ä¶the ones that got away the career we didnt get ‚Ä¶the shit list goes on and on..and that makes us human‚Ä¶so forget all the shit that you think is more then you can handle like i start my entries then it is like i get a burst of energy and a light that starts to kick in inside me that goes‚Ä¶.wake up ‚Ä¶i am here dont give up‚Ä¶dont let things get to you martin..dont let em‚Ä¶keep goin the same way you have started‚Ä¶it does get better ..its not that bad‚Ä¶forget all the ones that think that living here is all that matters‚Ä¶live in the flesh and enjoy burning in hell‚Ä¶.let that soak in for a bit‚Ä¶it may sound depressing or without hope but look read it again..it is full of hope‚Ä¶we need to pick out the best part of the world we live in and deny the things that hurt us‚Ä¶.we are programmed to want the evil shit or the taboo stuff we never want the goodness ..because if you are like me i get bored when it is to easy or not full of chaos‚Ä¶i cant seem to make up the right emotion for when im not supposed to feel bad about things‚Ä¶like guilt is my number one allie..right now im sittin here guilty as shit because i want to help my brother and cant‚Ä¶otherwise i would even if it made me in debt‚Ä¶i have never learned where to draw the line and therefore constantly causein me pain. i get like that with anything in my life‚Ä¶with girls a girl can not be interested and i still pursue it just to see if she really ment what she said or if maybe my personality will catch her second look..thinking that the thing may not have anything to do with me anyways‚Ä¶i am so childlike i hate it‚Ä¶never learned the correct way to do shit..always do it on emotion and feelings and therefore making others the bare er to my cross and sometimes that cross is to big for you guys to carry or to even help me with..i guess im just fucked up and keep trying to grasp onto anything to make it better or a little normal‚Ä¶i just want to have calm thoughts‚Ä¶normal emotions‚Ä¶less dramatic outcomes to my life‚Ä¶and a strong belief in god ‚Ä¶and to somehow find someone that doesnt see me as fucked up or my past to checkered for them to look past‚Ä¶and time is not my ally because i have a problem with patience‚Ä¶i dont know what to do‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.im so lost with these issues‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶love ya all ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.martin

How to Stay Calm in Every Situation in 10 Steps
How many times have you lost your temper, became tense, unhappy 
or afraid during the last week? Do you stay composed under 
unusual, uncomfortable or inconvenient situations? Do wish you 
could remain relaxed and function normally under unfamiliar 
conditions, in danger or under stressful situations?
You may have promised yourself many times to stay calm while 
talking to your boss, when dealing with unpleasant situations 
or people or under any condition that annoys or stresses you. 
When the appropriate time came, you have probably found it 
hard to stay calm. You may have even forgotten your promise, 
lost your composure and behaved awkwardly. 
Below you will find a few suggestions that can help you reduce 
stress, fear, anger or any other negative emotion and increase 
your peace of mind.
1) Each day before you go to sleep, preferably before you 
enter bed, think for a minute or two about the things you 
have to do the next day. Then repeat in your mind for 2-3 
minutes the following affirmation:
‚ÄúTomorrow is going to be a wonderful and happy day‚Äù.
2) After you enter bed and switch off the light, instead of 
letting the mind think all kinds of idle or useless thoughts, 
tell yourself how calm you are, and that you can function in a 
relaxed and peaceful manner in every situation that you 
encounter. Don‚Äôt fight with your mind, which may suggest to you 
otherwise. 
3) Pay attention to the thoughts that enter your mind until 
the moment you fall asleep, but without any interest in the 
thoughts. Stay detachment. Don‚Äôt let the feelings evoked by 
your thoughts carry you away and make you forget what you are 
doing. 
Keep disinterested in your thoughts, don‚Äôt follow the chain 
of associations that the thoughts bring, and don‚Äôt discuss or 
analyze them. Just let them pass through your mind without 
letting them arouse your interest and curiosity. Look at your 
thoughts as if looking at some uninteresting scene.
4) Upon waking up in the morning, and before you get out of 
bed, repeat in your mind the affirmation mentioned above for 
about 2-3 minutes:
‚ÄúTomorrow is going to be a wonderful and happy day‚Äù.
Then for another 2-3 minutes tell yourself:
‚ÄúI am calm and relaxed, and stay so under all circumstances.
5) During the day, try not to react immediately when encountering 
something you do not like. Wait a moment, and think whether 
there is another way to solve the situation or problem. Angry 
retort, sulking, physical aggression or timidity and fear do 
not solve anything.
6) Don‚Äôt give too much importance to what people say or think 
about you. Exercise a little detachment. What people say or 
think is there opinion and is there business. If you allow 
yourself to be influenced, you let them control your life, 
behavior and moods.
7) Whenever you feel that you are beginning to lose your inner 
peace or get stressed, take a few deep breaths, and mentally 
repeat the following sentence several times, with attention 
and faith:
‚ÄúI am calm and relaxed, and I am going to stay so. Nothing can 
influence me‚Äù.
8) Always concentrate on what you are doing. The mind has the 
tendency to wander, and often thinks in a negative way, thereby 
increasing the tendency to fear, stress and expectation of 
difficulties. 
9) Learn to laugh and smile more often.
10) Think, feel and believe that you deserve, and are able to attain 
happiness and peace of mind.
By concentrating on what you do, you do not let the mind wander. 
You keep it focused and therefore calm. Developing the habit of 
always concentrating on what you do increases your powers of 
concentration, and your power to control and pacify your mind. 
A controlled and focused mind is a peaceful mind.
Whether reading, writing, talking or doing any kind of work, put 
your full attention on what you are doing. Try not to let 
noises, voices, people, thoughts or any kind of outer stimulus 
detract you from paying attention solely to what you are doing.

Around every circle, a larger circle may be drawn. Around every fence, there is
an open field that is waiting to be cultivated and harvested. Around every set
of limitations, there is a limitless expanse of possibilities. Around every
experience, there are larger and more meaningful experiences.
Beyond every horizon, there is a world of discovery. It is yours if only you
will make it yours. A universe filled with abundance awaits you if you will just
accept it.
When you are standing on the ground, the horizon is only a few miles away. On a
mountaintop, the horizon expands to dozens of miles. In an airplane, the horizon
can be hundreds of miles away. In a spacecraft orbiting the Earth, there are
thousands of miles between the horizons. And when you leave Earth orbit, the
horizon is infinite. Where is your mind‚Äôs horizon?
You can choose to bounce back and forth off the walls of your limitations, or
you can choose to transcend those limitations and expand your horizons. You are
only limited by the boundaries you place on yourself. Rise above your
limitations, expand your thinking, and consider the possibilities.

mood:hazey and squishy
song:fast moving train‚Ä¶restless heart
hey journal, how is it going today? first of all let me start by telling you that the great mood i was in yesterday was not tainted by anyones ignorance, i kept my power of serenity and gonna do my damndest to maintain it:) I came home from the club with a sense of weirdness that always overcomes me after a night of couple watching‚Ä¶belle was at a concert so I was here on the comp alone til she got home and we chitchatted‚Ä¶she was tired and exhausted so we both said goodnight and went our ways‚Ä¶to sleepy land. I stayed up thinking in my bed because I dont ever just go to bed and im out.I was thinking of the opportunities that are in front of me at the time and it just makes me excited how things that you truly want happen so easily‚Ä¶i just lay in bed thinking‚Ä¶what catagory i try to fit in because even tho its not college anymore or even high school we all still have a certain part to play in society‚Ä¶im not a cowboy or a thuggish gangsta so i guess my look is more ..casual? i wear tommy gear alot and just dont understand the whole cowboy get up or why women are so gaga over these fake ass people that think even tho they wear a hat and a big belt buckle and some tight ass jeans they are gods gift‚Ä¶.cause it takes no energy to copy everyone elses style then to make up something of your own‚Ä¶.but women just seem to go gaga over that shit so to his his own..lol i wont sell out cause i have to much respect for my nuts‚Ä¶and dont like something that tight round that area unless its someones mouth or something else‚Ä¶.i am gonna go to the carnival or just hit up a movie or something because im really bored‚Ä¶i realized something last night as i was in the club alone for like two hours‚Ä¶.i was in a spot that i had never been be4‚Ä¶it sucked..lol i do alot of things alone but somethings you just stand out more then normal when you are alone doin em..lol‚Ä¶so i may go chill today and spend more time with martin‚Ä¶the online lifestly is okay but it gets old quick‚Ä¶one thing i dont understand is when you hit it off with someone on here and you want to hang out and have fun and they are so apprehensive like there would be any difference in real life or something‚Ä¶.i understand the safety of it tho but not all guys on here on the net are pervs‚Ä¶.lol this area is so humid‚Ä¶could someone please pass the inhaler?:P when i go im sure it will have something to do with the oxygen intake in my body because that is the only thing that i cant stand is not being able to breathe or having to have labored respirations‚Ä¶‚Ä¶it really sucks when the air is so thick‚Ä¶or spendin a night in a smokey room..doesnt do it much justice‚Ä¶i am sittin here thinkin of the movie pretty woman‚Ä¶does that fantasy really occur? if he didnt have all that money would she still have wanted him?or was there a connection that went beyond the $$ signs‚Ä¶i loved the part when they went shopping..love is so kewl when it is portrayed in the movies‚Ä¶.because imidst the turmoils of the plot ..the guy always gets the girl‚Ä¶.serendipity..is another one of my faves‚Ä¶that is about fate and finding the one that you met and let it up to the forces that be to bring you back together‚Ä¶.he was obsessive when it came to her‚Ä¶and he was already with someone ..that is usually what it is like‚Ä¶.you always want what you cant have then it is there dangling itself be4 you‚Ä¶and then the chase is more important than the reward because we always build up a vision of the person that distorts our reality and makes them the‚Äùone‚Äù even tho they are just as human as the next one‚Ä¶pearl harbor‚Ä¶this one just speaks for itself‚Ä¶guy gets betrayed by his best friend and the woman cant seem to say no in her time of grief ‚Ä¶just tells you that women always talk bout us being unfaithful but they always out there with one eye peeled tryin to find that guy that has it all ‚Ä¶that they have built up in their head is the perfect catch‚Ä¶people say that women arent as picky as guys..that isnt really true is it? because otherwise the overweight guy asking you to dance would have all the women in the bar or the nerdy looking guy askin for your number would not be laughed at or ridiculed‚Ä¶but we all have those people inside of us and i guess we spend so much time trying to keep them hidden that we have to make fun of those type because our nerd or overweight person always tries to surface‚Ä¶.life is one big question and the replys are always ‚Ä¶i cant get with that person cause there is no attraction‚Ä¶well that attraction is it really yours‚Ä¶or what your friends will say when they see you with this person or parents or society ‚Ä¶i think that you can love someone with a open heart and mind ..if these things didnt come into play because as humans we all want to be loved and those that love freely are the ones that others ‚Ä¶overlook most of the time‚Ä¶.i am not preaching because i rode on that train for a long time‚Ä¶i played sports all my life and never thought that a overweight girl was my type..but i didnt ever take the time to see what she had to offer..i was thinking of all those girls that werent cheerleaders‚Ä¶the skin is a shell that protects our soul‚Ä¶nothing else‚Ä¶it deterioates in time and we are left with old wrinkly skin with no teeth no hair‚Ä¶.and so we are old and left with nothing but the internal love that was seeded long ago..i have tried to plant my seed in alot of areas tho just for the exterior and that didnt work they left anyways‚Ä¶‚Ä¶lol we were talkin bout death yesterday in class and that is such a morbid topic ‚Ä¶but i got to thinking ..i want my legacy to be a positive one and tired of all the superficial lies that get me thru the day‚Ä¶im sick of the ties that society trys to put on me..i used to live my life how i wanted and then i got a girlfriend and all that changed‚Ä¶i lost a part of me all in the name of love‚Ä¶.and i have spent the last two years trying to find that part of me‚Ä¶and it has been a bitch trying to reinvent the strong minded strong willed guy i know that exists there somewhere‚Ä¶i think the reason that i try to be nice and all that is because otherwise i get called arrogant, obnoxious or a asshole and those arent me at all..people just mistake that for cockiness when in reality it is self confidence..

Imagine yourself in a difficult situation with your boss, your spouse, your
child, an irate customer. The other person is very angry and tense, and you are
the target of their anger. How do you react? Do you meet fire with fire, become
defensive, raise your voice? Does that really accomplish anything?
Have you ever thought of consciously trying to relax when the world around you
is tense, upset or irritated? When the pressure is really on, you can
dramatically improve your own performance by remaining calm and relaxed.
Impossible? No, not at all. You always have complete control over your emotions,
your actions. You can choose to be angry and tense, or you can choose to be
relaxed. Realize that your reaction is just that, a reaction. You are not under
the control of the other person.
Say to yourself, ‚ÄúI am going to take a deep breath, relax my shoulders, my neck,
my back, and meet this situation with calmness. Rather than giving the power
over my thoughts to this other person, I will keep control of my own thoughts
and work to resolve this situation.‚Äù
Even when the anger and tension is not specifically directed at you, an attitude
of calm relaxation and control can help you to make the best of any situation.
i had to continue on this page because i went over the 6500 characters in my last entry and some of the best shit had to be deleted‚Ä¶i was talkin bout myself and the arrogant tone i sometimes display‚Ä¶people tell me that i sould just try to make peace with my father to end some of the animosity i feel towards him and i have tried ‚Ä¶i have tried to write letters to go see him, i havent been there in like four years now i think..i just cant stand when he starts to tell me his perception of life and its messed up schemes‚Ä¶i dont judge but i am a adult now and dont really like to be told what to do especially when your life is not as well in the rotation of society‚Ä¶.my mother is the total opposite she just acts like nothing ever happend‚Ä¶like all the times i got thrown thru walls and hit they were not his fault ‚Ä¶it was his fucking fault!! he has caused to warp my reality so much that i dont know what is real and what to trust or if everyone is gonna up and leave for some stupid shit that i may do or say‚Ä¶im drowning in these emotions and my teacher said to get them out that it helps‚Ä¶but you know what? they hurt alot and bring back some pain that i havent felt in years‚Ä¶and the worst part is im tryin to deal with them alone‚Ä¶this is the side of me that you dont see‚Ä¶.this is the interal part that makes me even uglier ‚Ä¶so i hide it with all i have‚Ä¶.and still you run‚Ä¶all that i like it goes away‚Ä¶all that i try to hang on to..it goes‚Ä¶.so most of the time i act like i dont want it or try to get anything‚Ä¶because it always goes‚Ä¶but i want to im just so overwhelmed by the fear‚Ä¶it keeps me in my concrete studded area‚Ä¶i see things in a different view then anyone i know‚Ä¶i feel like such a weirdo for a guy because i dont fit into the normal fit‚Ä¶i dont treat women like shit..i dont cuss much‚Ä¶i dont take things for granted‚Ä¶and still those things are the things that build up and i go thru cycles when i am arrogant and rude and then people are like what the hell‚Ä¶we didnt know that you were like that‚Ä¶well fuck there is alot about me that you dont know‚Ä¶and you never take the fuckin time to ask me either‚Ä¶or want to know..because it is more important to ask me superficial things‚Ä¶.yeah im fine my job sucks and school is goin well‚Ä¶now what? where do we go after those three things have been answered? i dont have your kid stories..dont have a pet ‚Ä¶dont have a wife to trade shitty marraige stories‚Ä¶its all the things that you loathe is eveyrthing i think i want‚Ä¶and then hearing you talk bout them makes me glad that im not‚Ä¶but still i think bout those things‚Ä¶i dont know what my number count is so if it cuts off ill continue on the next page‚Ä¶.i dont hate people‚Ä¶i just despise the simplicity of most of them and why they seem to worry bout the stupidest shit‚Ä¶i know you probly think my shit is just as trivial but oh well..now what? do i care? not one in the least‚Ä¶i can at least voice what i feel unlike you who keep it all inside and beat your significant other or your kids‚Ä¶or cheat and lie to keep what you think is your world..fuck you get a clue‚Ä¶.it can all end in one swoop then what‚Ä¶.all those things wont help you‚Ä¶when you are goin before the true judger‚Ä¶he dont take visa or american express‚Ä¶but he does take clean souls‚Ä¶:) i am full of thoughts but im coming back later‚Ä¶belle signed off and she said she wouldnt‚Ä¶.oh well right‚Ä¶its not bout me‚Ä¶just my perception‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..well right now im perceiving‚Ä¶im a object of convenience‚Ä¶holla at your world later‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..martin

Everything ‚Äî absolutely everything ‚Äî that happens in our lives has a spiritual
cause. Events on all other levels ‚Äî mental, emotional and physical ‚Äî are only
effects.
When we are struggling with any challenge, whether it be ill health, a lack of
money, a lost job, poor relationships, an accident, whatever ‚Äî we need to look
for the spiritual learning. We can ask ourselves, ‚ÄúWhat quality does my soul
want me to live more fully?‚Äù
‚ÄúIf you start to think the problem is ¬ëout there,¬í stop yourself. That thought
is the problem.‚Äù
Hi journal,just got finished watching a intense movie called the life of david gale..if you havent seen it i really recommend it..there was something that was stated in there bout desire and wants‚Ä¶.and it just hit me in the face like a sledgehammer‚Ä¶once we start not wanting or desireing things life indeed is over in our mind and our soul slowly starts shrinking and we are dying or dead by that point so the things that proceed that action has no consequence‚Ä¶in our minds‚Ä¶its like living life without hope, ambition and the ability to know everything is gonna get better if you desire enough and believe that there is just so much we can control and the rest that is done to us is sometimes beyond our control..no use gettin mad bout it or dwelling in the problem but lookin off into the horizon and seein the silver linings in the clouds‚Ä¶it also spoke of being careful what you want ‚Ä¶.cause damn if you may get it then the fantasy is over and what ever will you do with it then,,,,,that is why so often we fuck up good things in our lives because it is easier to see thse uptouchables as unreachable and we think we could handle if we could only have but a second in time‚Ä¶and what do we do..we fuck it up..lol because we place expectations on the survival of whatever fantasy we made up and forgot to tell the other person‚Ä¶therefore not letting them in..and the whole time trying to save them‚Ä¶to mold them into the person we want them to be‚Ä¶this goes with life also‚Ä¶cause by damn we always want to make it our soul purpose to be successful but we never really appreciate the small steps that it takes to accomplish this‚Ä¶i am the biggest allie to this philosephy because as you have read in the past i have a problem with patience and i need what i need when i want it‚Ä¶its a imature concept but we all seem to devulge in it‚Ä¶and then what happens‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..we get bored of it‚Ä¶and try to always find grass on the other side of the fence‚Ä¶new scenery‚Ä¶new location and to try to start over without the chains of the past haunting us‚Ä¶well guess what journal that damn chain still clinks even if we drown out the echoes of the burden it reaks on our ankles‚Ä¶only in death do we realize the mistakes that brought us there‚Ä¶.a replay of time of yesteryear‚Ä¶a innocent childlike dream with no pain‚Ä¶all a fantasy..we have always known pain and letdowns‚Ä¶we just rose color these things to say damn my life is so much more fucked up now then it was when i was this or that‚Ä¶..but you know what‚Ä¶its your life‚Ä¶and outside things mold us ..or break us‚Ä¶but in the end..its still our lives to make how ever we wanna‚Ä¶but we always think people owe us something‚Ä¶or life is just to hard to deal with‚Ä¶hell i am once again a ally‚Ä¶of this theory‚Ä¶‚Ä¶and im not perfect so im sure ill go on and whine about it on occasion‚Ä¶helps humble even the worst cynics‚Ä¶.we crave easiness like we are owed it‚Ä¶and want fuckin reward when all we are doing is what it takes to make it in these hard times‚Ä¶many lose their lives daily‚Ä¶as nobodys only to the people close to them‚Ä¶then again it isnt a given anyone will ever know they existed‚Ä¶we all want to be noticed but dont want the responsibility that comes along with noteriority‚Ä¶so we run to hide and bitch bout how bad things are‚Ä¶or is this the end of the world‚Ä¶nope!~ think of the people on death row that crave one more chance at fresh air‚Ä¶to feel the grass on that perverbial other side of the fence..but nope the only end they have is knowin that they are gonna die and what day‚Ä¶.and how‚Ä¶.never really trully knowin why‚Ä¶they become a number a crime..not a person‚Ä¶why is it if we treated them as human that they would think that their crime was as less as the sentence? is that our thinking? like as long as i beat a puppie at a young age he will be scared to piss on the carpet as he grows‚Ä¶that is bullshit‚Ä¶his fear turns him into more devient behavior just tryin to adapt to a sure beating a pissing brings on..so he just becomes more violent then ‚Ä¶when he does have the chance to escape this master ‚Ä¶goes and bites a kid and gets sent to the pound to be put to death‚Ä¶is it his fault that violence is all he knew? sure it didnt help the kid‚Ä¶but couldnt they both be taught the cycle instead of the dog being put under? food for thought‚Ä¶we breed ignorance when we try so hard to tame it..we want the quick fix in this society we live in‚Ä¶and win at all costs‚Ä¶we frown on those that arent just like us..or have what we do..but how much would it hurt to help them up from the bottom to reach where we are all at? isnt that the basic concept of god and heaven‚Ä¶we all get kicked and he helps us to reach a golden equalness for all‚Ä¶never knowing hurt or pain again‚Ä¶not being in the presense of famine and dispair?..all we need is the strip away the old vices of the world and learn to continue to desire for the vision of a perfect world‚Ä¶we all rally against things to fit in‚Ä¶but do we ever know what we are rallying for‚Ä¶and do you do any research for the cause? or just want to fit in‚Ä¶cont..in next entry‚Ä¶

How can you see into my eyes 
like open doors.
Leading you down into my core 
where I‚Äôve become so numb.
Without a soul
my spirit‚Äôs sleeping somewhere cold 
until you find it there and lead it back home.
(Wake me up.
Wake me up inside. 
I can‚Äôt wake up. 
Wake me up inside. 
Save me. 
Call my name and save me from the dark. 
Wake me up. 
Bid my blood to run. 
I can‚Äôt wake up. 
Before I come undone. 
Save me. 
Save me from the nothing I‚Äôve become.)
Now that I know what I‚Äôm without
you can‚Äôt just leave me.
Breathe into me and make me real
Bring me to life.
Bring me to life. 
I‚Äôve been living a lie
There‚Äôs nothing inside. 
Bring me to life.
Frozen inside without your touch,
without your love, darling.
Only you are the life among the dead.
All of this sight
I can‚Äôt believe I couldn‚Äôt see
Kept in the dark
but you were there in front of me
I‚Äôve been sleeping a 1000 years it seems.
I‚Äôve got to open my eyes to everything.
Without a thought
Without a voice
Without a soul 
Don‚Äôt let me die here
There must be something wrong.
Bring me to life.
Bring me to life.
I‚Äôve been living a lie
There‚Äôs nothing inside.
Bring me to life

There is one person whom you have no choice but to believe ‚Äî yourself. Just to
make sense of the world, you must believe what you say to yourself. To do
otherwise would lead to insanity.
The problem is, not everything you tell yourself is in your best interest. Have
you ever caught yourself saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôll never get that done‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just no good
at this‚Äù? Now what is the point of saying something like that to yourself? There
is no point! It accomplishes nothing but to convince you of your own weakness.
When you catch yourself doing this, STOP. And instead, tell yourself something
like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm making good progress on that‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm getting better and better at
this.‚Äù Whatever you say to yourself, you‚Äôll believe. And whatever you believe,
you‚Äôll be. That is the power of positive affirmations. They‚Äôre not just ‚Äúfeel
good‚Äù escapist rituals ‚Äî they actually program your mind for success.
After all, you are your most trusted advisor. Make sure you give yourself the
very best support, advice and encouragement every day.

The only way you can successfully communicate and relate to other people, is to
like yourself. The more you like yourself, the more others will like and accept
you. Unfortunately, many people have experiences in their past that leave them
feeling unworthy, incapable and embarrassed.
That is all over now. It is in the past. The reality is that you‚Äôre an
expressive, sensitive, gregarious person, if only you‚Äôll let yourself be. It
doesn‚Äôt matter what someone has said about you in the past. It doesn‚Äôt matter
what shortcomings you have previously experienced. That is all history.
What matters is what you do from this point forward. Realize that you are a
worthwhile, valuable person with an enormous contribution to make. Find the best
within yourself and feel good about the person you are. You are a special
person, and your life begins today.
Hi journal, how is it going tonight? I had a great day of class today, just learned alot of things that I can put to use, first i dont have to forgive my father or to forget what i have been beating myself up over daily. I was a child and none of it was my fault or I should not have to carry that cross any longer‚Ä¶time for acceptance and to know that I dont have to feel bad to have ill feelings for my father or mother for their shortcomings,for so many years i have carried this and it burns a hole in my soul and hurts like i have told you about journal, just finally slowed down to my understanding today‚Ä¶my teacher is so intuned and wise‚Ä¶i wanted closure and today i got me some answers that have taken the load off‚Ä¶.
Now let me tell ya whats going on in my mind at the moment besides listening to chevelle, feelings check: stable and smiling:) so for so long the weight has been hard and i have had lots of reasons for failing and not giving it my all because i was fulfilling my own prophecy‚Ä¶or the self fullfillin prophecy that i viewed as a kid‚Ä¶the inner marty is chillin..he isnt crying and not even in the corner‚Ä¶he is out and about still a little squimesh at times but for the most part he is being more sociable‚Ä¶without the turmoils of a head full of tears‚Ä¶redemption at its finest is happening right now‚Ä¶i feel the positive stuff happening as we speak‚Ä¶i have a great job opportunity ahead of me‚Ä¶caring friends‚Ä¶and a wonderful gal ‚Ä¶all these things ad up for success no matter how you mix them up‚Ä¶the most important thing is to slow it down enough not to get overwhelmed and enjoy the smallest thing that when your head is buzzin so fast you cant hear or see‚Ä¶i notice birds‚Ä¶trees‚Ä¶grass again‚Ä¶my head is not hazey anymore that much‚Ä¶it is so stable at the moment and im not sayin that to boast just outta appreciation..there is so much im thankful for today‚Ä¶the small things are the building blocks of society that lead to a stronger foundation for the things that last the longest. It starts from knowing who you are‚Ä¶what you carry around that burns in your soul..i give up the garbage to god‚Ä¶of my own understanding the one that keeps me safe and secure for the most part‚Ä¶he is my god the forgiving god..not the fire and brimestone caster from above..but the one that lifts you up and keeps the devil off your back long enough to enjoy the smallest most precious things‚Ä¶.a babies crying..a flower blooming and a cool summer breeze with jasmine in the air‚Ä¶:) people state all the time..‚Äùwhat do i have to be thankful for?‚Äù they ask i do tell..lol ‚Ä¶..well be thankful your alive for one‚Ä¶thankful you ate today or are not in a gutter trying to survive the famine of the land‚Ä¶or in a desert being beaten and hurt just because of your beliefs‚Ä¶feel good that you are a us citizen and that the land just isnt that bad‚Ä¶life is what you make of it son‚Ä¶..nike said it best..life is a contact sport drink it up‚Ä¶‚Ä¶well by all means indulge away and just know your limitations and bounderies and show humility for your feelow man‚Ä¶the one that doesnt have all that you do‚Ä¶the one that needs some guidence ‚Ä¶the one that is ill and needs a friendly ear to listen even if what the ill patient says doesnt make sense to you‚Ä¶we all need the verbal dumping ground ‚Ä¶it emptys our mind and our souls‚Ä¶so learn active listening if you have to‚Ä¶not all news is bad news and you may learn something bout that person that sits next to you that you didnt have a clue existed‚Ä¶we spend so much time hating on people and their ambitions that we keep our own self grounded and negative‚Ä¶why live this one chance on here that way? who said that it has to be bad‚Ä¶.? do we need to be rich to love your life‚Ä¶nope
do we need the best clothes‚Ä¶the most influental friends‚Ä¶nope‚Ä¶:) we need internal peace of mind and a healthy heart that beats in purity and love‚Ä¶:) stop sayin mean things bout people they dont deserve it..no one is that bad that you have to hate them‚Ä¶dislike the actions ‚Ä¶not the individual‚Ä¶that person is god that you are looking at ‚Ä¶.he created that individual your hateing on‚Ä¶.so essentially your hating god‚Ä¶which we all do..just when you start to waste time on negativity‚Ä¶.stop and turn it around and see the light in the darkness so many walk around in‚Ä¶.its a great feeling to see it again‚Ä¶but you know i had to want it‚Ä¶because it has always wanted me‚Ä¶i just was making all the excuses in the world why not to receive it‚Ä¶love you guys‚Ä¶hey b-ritt‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.martin:)

Life often seems overwhelming. Constant deadlines, ever-increasing
responsibilities, things that take twice as long as you thought they would.
Tempers get short and people get frantic. Is this any way to work? Is this any
way to live?
The pace of work gets faster and faster. The Internet dumps pages and pages of
e-mail on you each morning. The the fax machine starts churning it out, and then
Federal Express arrives. How can you possibly cope? How can you get anything
done in such a world?
Step back for a moment. Step back from it all, on a regular basis. Yes, it‚Äôs
urgent. Yes, it‚Äôs frantic. But, in the overall context of your life, is it
really that important?
You must learn to do your work, without letting your work do you. Remember, you
are in control here. Your work is something you have chosen to do, for whatever
reason, to add value to your life. Think of the absolute worst thing that could
happen in your work, and realize that you would most likely survive it as a
person. By all means accept and honor your responsibilities, just remember to
keep them in perspective.
Don‚Äôt let it get to you. Especially when you are overwhelmed ‚Äî that‚Äôs when you
most need to be productive and in control. Worrying and fretting are complete
wastes of time. Make an effort to step back. The more at peace you are, the more
produtive and creative you‚Äôll be.
Keep things in perspective. Accept that you have a lot to do, accept that there
will be problems, and then just do what needs to be done, with control and
diligence. Take a deep breath, and start to plow right through it.

song: the river‚Ä¶.garth brooks
Hi journal, whats up my long lost friend? just thought i would stop in and pay my homage to the cursor on screen thought process of today. i will sail my vessel til the river runs dry‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..words of infinate wisdom surely it isnt oscar wilde or anyone of that magnitude but garth reaches more with that little intro then the latter does im sure not to say mr. wilde isnt more knowledgeable but the audience isnt that is the skinny of it all. So what is goin on in the mind of the master today? well, i just sat thru five hours in a class of moronic proportion and i dont say that in a judgemental way but it is a torture at times to sit and listen to the thought patterns of most of the specimen of life we have in our class‚Ä¶just four more months i tell myself‚Ä¶and i can get out in the real insane world of chemical dependency. one thing i have noticed is that i have been listening to alot of country music lately..i dont know why that is..but not a bad thing im sure. whats goin on with the world today..just random random mayhem, do you really care or are you current with the atrosities of todays headlines? so give me some of your insightful peeves for today‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.ill be back later to add on this

hey journal, i had to come back and write a addendum to the pathetic entry i dispelled on you guys earlier. I am listening to this song and it is a oldie, but to those that love classic ballads‚Ä¶one of the best..it takes me back to a dance that started a nervous teen and a girl of ‚Äúhis ‚Äù dreams‚Ä¶well he had waited the whole year for this moment and after all the stupid ass horseplay with his homies‚Ä¶the moment arose when the prom was almost over and he walks up to her while she is wearing his bowtie round her neck and grabs her hand and nervously asks..‚Äùwould you like to dance?‚Äù the whole time the intro to the sound blares up and his palms and knees get sweaty‚Ä¶he was so in love with this girl that the rest of his life seemed just a heartbeat away and he never thought he would see as much as he has in this duration of time and space‚Ä¶we danced and held on to a moment of forever there in that gymnasium and for the moment seemed like it took forever for the song to end and the moment was so surreal and it seemed like it just stood still for that couple of minutes‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..then boom it was over and i woke up and it was two years later and she was gone as well as the memory no matter how hard i wanted it to last a lifetime..i saw her two years later and we talked bout how we had grown and how life seemed to always bring us together thru the weirdest times‚Ä¶the times you dont know what to say or what to do‚Ä¶and if you did you would stutter thru them‚Ä¶she was my first love she taught me loss and hurt and pain of endless proportions but i swore i could never love another as i did her‚Ä¶holding that idiocracy for a long time i seemed to always be chasing the memory of the one that got away or the one that didnt want me as bad as i wanted her..then there came the followers‚Ä¶.karen, christy, jade, cynthia,jennifer, robbie, kristina, and the ones in between‚Ä¶the ones that just were good nuff but not ever could raise the bar on the origional..oh i forgot melissa ‚Ä¶ girl‚Ä¶they all just were good but not great‚Ä¶.because i felt i wasnt and therefore they couldnt be either..natasha was never a gf but was someone that was in the mix as well‚Ä¶so was angela, lisa, tina, deneise, another karen, debbie, claire, teresa, brieanna, lia, shannon, and the others‚Ä¶as you can see the quest for the beginning of this list ‚Ä¶the one that started it all be4 that dance ‚Ä¶and the one that ended it at that dance‚Ä¶has left these others just a scar in my blemished life of seek and destroy, i had good intentions but never really thought that i could overcome that pounding sound in my ears as i thought hmmm‚Ä¶.she is this but hell she is not any of that‚Ä¶..so i got bored and moved on‚Ä¶.the ones i didnt name ‚Ä¶dont feel bad you didnt make my wall of conquest its a honor that you didnt and these people did. i cared bout them at one point but never really gave them or myself the opportunity to grow or they were playgin games and i had to get them be4 they got me..as time has gone on‚Ä¶no one wins or won‚Ä¶.i lost everytime when i thought i was showing them for not caring enuff or for not being enuff‚Ä¶but i was killin the innocent idea of love that had been planted in my head at a early time‚Ä¶so wherever you are people in this entry‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..im truly sorry for the way of turmoil i caused you guys and may your lives be great and may your wishes be truly granted daily‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.well im out for now‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.love ya ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..marti

Doubt will stop you cold. You are what you think you are. You do what you think
you can do. When you doubt that it can be done, it won‚Äôt happen for you.
When you go to sleep and dream, anything is possible. In your dreams you can
fly, you can hold conversations with people who have long since left your life,
you can move forward or backward through time. In your dreams, you have no
doubt. And in your dreams, you can do anything that you can imagine.
What if your waking life had the same absence of doubt? Think of the things that
would be possible.
‚ÄúJust say no‚Äù to doubt. Your doubts are all in your mind, and you can control
your mind. When doubts come to the surface, send them away. Focus your mind on
other, more positive thoughts. Crowd out your doubt. Take control of your doubt
before it has a chance to take control of you.
You are capable. You are worthy. You are deserving. You can do it. Have faith.
Know that you are able to overcome any obstacle. See yourself accomplishing your
goals. Visualize and feel what that would be like. Make the experience real, and
you‚Äôll know you can do it‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..

Hi, journal‚Ä¶just sitting here chillin with myself and the friendly blink of the cursor. I thought I would sit and just releave some mindless garbage out of my head. I am sitting here trying to explain to a moron the exact meanings to my sentences‚Ä¶which is hilarious to me because she thinks she knows all and is the higher up bar of excellence that clearly she is not. But like I have learned in this field I am going back into there are those that have no problems and clearly walk on water‚Ä¶.riiiiight. I am not one to judge them because of the ignorance barriers they have up for themselves and project upon others. I get what logical person talks like this‚Ä¶.hehehe.. the smart and intellectual do. I was explaining this sentence to a person‚Ä¶ok? she called me a physcho for this journal and said who really cares what goes on in my day‚Ä¶.i told her it wasnt for a daily account but more of a dumping ground for useless information‚Ä¶and let the people that read it process it with me ‚Ä¶and so on‚Ä¶and i stated there is no such thing as sanity and those that think so should take a deep look in the mirror‚Ä¶..well she couldnt comprehend that thought either so she said would you please expalin it ‚Ä¶i tryed yet again to no avail‚Ä¶to her response was ‚Äúdog you got issues, i cant hang ‚Ä¶bye‚Äù exactly‚Ä¶the mirror is so hazey in her eyes that she is blind to intelligence and reflection. I am on a spiritial journey now‚Ä¶a journey where i am not in the same spectrum as people of this nature. I cant believe that i actually let myself coherse with her‚Ä¶.or even entertained the thought that she may have been a friend. real friends dont make fun of you or call you names‚Ä¶they support your efforts and try to understand what you are going through in your progression thru life‚Ä¶.that is why she will always be a dreamer of higher things but not be any more inlightened then when her fantasy began. I may not be rich by this field of work, but the non monetary value i get out of helping people will last me a lifetime to what temporary gradification is to others‚Ä¶.they will always be wishing for a better life, a better this or that‚Ä¶because they will always be empty without the blessings of a higher power. I know i talk bout god and jesus in here but im not really a religious person, i am more spiritial then anything‚Ä¶i choose to know them‚Ä¶not push my beliefs on you readers‚Ä¶but as a member of humanity i wont stand and watch the sick get sicker and the ignorant demean the weak‚Ä¶.i will stand for my beliefs and if it is physcho in someones eyes‚Ä¶then let em think that‚Ä¶i wont budge because one day all the laughter and ugly things that are said to me‚Ä¶they are being said to my creator‚Ä¶i am happy‚Ä¶and serene and i wont let anyone have my power that i have regained‚Ä¶i love you all and to those that have positive things to say or even the negative its just a view from my eyes‚Ä¶nothing else‚Ä¶:) thank you for reading and your comments‚Ä¶love you all:) martin

Your beliefs have the the power to create or to destroy your life. Whatever you
believe, is what you will become. If you believe that you‚Äôre a loser, that you
never get a break, that you can‚Äôt accomplish anything, these things will be your
reality. Believe that you are unlimited, that you can do anything you commit to
doing, and when you do, your accomplishments will know no bounds.
You control your beliefs, and that is how you ultimately control of your life.
This is a very important point. You control your beliefs. You believe what you
choose to believe. 
So how do you develop beliefs that will empower you?
Many of our beliefs come from our environment, the world we live in on a daily
basis. If your environment is limiting your beliefs, then work on changing it.
If you‚Äôre constantly around people who are negative and limiting, find other
people to hang out with. Get around positive, successful people. If your living
space is constantly messy and depressing, clean it up. Put on a fresh coat of
paint. Vacuum the carpet. Clean off your desk. Wash the windows and let the sun
shine in.
Beliefs also come from past experiences. That is why it is so important to
experience success on a regular basis. Set small, achievable goals, and then
reach them. ‚ÄúI will finish this project by early afternoon.‚Äù ‚ÄúI will make 6 cold
calls on the phone in the next hour.‚Äù ‚ÄúI will exercise for 20 minutes tonight.‚Äù
When you start to experience success, then you start to believe in success, and
that leads to more and bigger successes.
Beliefs come from knowledge. The more you learn, the more things you‚Äôll know to
be possible. Always take advantage of opportunities to learn something new. It
will bring new possibilities into your beliefs and your life.
Most importantly, you can develop new beliefs by setting and visualizing goals
for your own life. Define your goals clearly and with precision. Then, in your
mind, see yourself achieving them in all of their sensory detail. Mentally live
the experience, see the sights, hear the sounds, smell the aroma, feel the
feelings. Your nurtured beliefs will lead you to their reality.

Hi journal, 
hows it going? I am sitting here feeling like shit because it is my moms birthday and I didnt make it up in time to go see her or to even have the money to send her a card, it sucks being broke and living in the situation of the student bladada bladada‚Ä¶i feel all stuffy and sick because i cant fucking breathe. I took a claritan-d and it is kinda starting to work but it just adds to the delirium i already am feeling,why is sleep such a hard fucking thing to obtain? the energy of working out isnt coming any quicker either‚Ä¶old age is catching me quickly and i guess it is true that you cant fight it no matter how much you do or think that youth stays forever,I just completed three days of orientation and for the most part it sucked.I am so ready to have the reigns passed to me and let me start to ride the fucking horse instead of being instructed on its every move. I hate first days anyways because the people no matter how kind they are make you feel stupid or like you are not intelligent enough to catch on the first time. I had this lady tell me yesterday like eight times after checking each door in sequence to be sure to lock the door after everytime opening it and closeing the door.It was quite annoying,but i smiled non the less and went on with it. I dont know what it is‚Ä¶really, I am trying so hard to make this fuckin place my place of residence‚Ä¶is there no friendly people in this mother fucker and just superficially affected individuals? I am so ready to get my license, and go on from there. I am angry and surelly this wont be my feelings tommorow but for today fuck all this bullshit..!! Have to drive fucking ten million fucking miles to get to the nearest shit or its to fucking crowded that no one really truely knows you‚Ä¶just a constant number or another face in the crowd‚Ä¶.i want to be huge fuck the mediocre lifestyle of the eight to five robot..I dont give a shit anymore bout the labels of people for the most fuckin part ‚Ä¶.people are not that fuckin important either‚Ä¶just faceless figures in the wind ‚Ä¶.of questions‚Ä¶..no one really gives a damn anyways because its that we are all to busy projecting our own issues and stuff on others and constantly have that fake happiness‚Ä¶im workin at night to be able to go to class‚Ä¶so that what? i can sit in a class of fucking ignorant clueless individuals that waste the teachers time with dumb shit from a to z and just a waste of good education in a field that they thought hey the title is better then medical assistant i can do this i like people‚Ä¶fuck that‚Ä¶its a field that you dont have to reaalize people exist but truly bout emotional value and frankly‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..most dont get it in there‚Ä¶hell most of the time‚Ä¶i dont get shit that happens in the world‚Ä¶.oh im so mad right now and just could scream my lungs out‚Ä¶i hurt and cant breathe but i have to get these feelings out..cause they are burning a hole in my soul‚Ä¶wonder why we ever need a person to even touch our souls‚Ä¶.i would rather lay in the sea of sickness then to have a fuckin dime of the people that are clueless when it comes to knowing what life trully is‚Ä¶its pain suffering and hurt and demise of the human spirit from the demon that trys to control us all‚Ä¶.i dont have any answers‚Ä¶i dont have any insight‚Ä¶all i have is empty anger and darkness‚Ä¶.i feel like shit im outta here‚Ä¶..lata

song:nothing but the sound of pills being counted
Hi journal, 
It is five thirty four and im sitting here listening to my coworkers count pills while i write in this thing called my life works on a cursor prompting page of admiration for self. I am feeling alot better then my last entry like i told you was just a temporary moment of insanity. I didnt really understand why i was so sad or angry but those things happen and i dont really know what was goin on in my head at the time and now the head is clear and no anger is really going thru it. the anxiety of a new job the anxiety of a weekend where there is so much planned and not enuff hours in the day to fulfill all of the obligations so inward depression seems the easiest way to cope. My coping skills suck! I need to learn new ways to understand why i do things and why things seem to happen to me. I know life isnt as bad as I make it but sometimes it feels so damn grim and unworthwhile. Not that i would ever do anything that endangered my ego inflated head of mind, just the thought of wandering around and not knowing why things happen is just a anxiety in itself. I dont really understand why things exist in the spectrum that they seem to be floating in. I have class in like two hours and im so ready for it to be over im ready for the people in my class that i like to move on with me or be4 me and have successful careers and the others to finally see their shortcomings and submit that they arent as worldly as they may seem. I was thinkin today that my grandmas birthday is on the sixth and sometimes i wonder ‚Ä¶.did i ever get over that grief ridden time in my life. ? who knows but i know this i wont forget her day of life and death‚Ä¶i loved her so much and still miss her to this day.‚Äú`the angels must be having a great time with a great soul like my grandmas‚Ä¶‚Ä¶i miss you ama wherever you are‚Ä¶and thank you for keeping me safe with all the times that i could  have been hurt or injured‚Ä¶..god thank you‚Ä¶for all that you do‚Ä¶‚Ä¶may you guys have a great day and god bless you all‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..love martin:)

Admit your mistakes and examine them carefully. Take responsibility for them,
and learn from them. Mistakes are superb teachers. Knowing what doesn‚Äôt work,
can be a tremendous help in determining what will work.
Successful, effective people learn from everything that happens, including
mistakes. When you make a mistake, the best policy is to pick up the pieces and
look carefully at what happened. Don‚Äôt tear yourself up over it. Just examine it
and learn from it. Then apply your new knowledge and try again.
Hi journal,
Just sitting here gettin some homework done for class.I have a huge project due on friday and have procrastanated as usual. oh well, it is a good thing sometimes. Im not to worried bout it. I just thought i would update and let you guys know that im doing okay;) 
As the ship rocks along the stormy 
seas not knowing where it may be,
it looks up and wonders why‚Ä¶is there
really a vision in the sky? The lost captain
hollars loudly to the air, oh where am i lord
is anyone there? the sky stays silent
as the clouds turn to rain, then only then
does the captain think in refrain, oh why
do i suffer such turmoil and pain, now 
one more cross to bear..here comes the rain
out of no where the storm shakes his boat in haste
and he wonders if he will make it out in 
one piece, he says the daily prayer that
has brought him such peace throughout time,
and falls into a majestic solace sleep
with not fear or distressed emotions in his 
head, early the next morning awoke by a thud
he thought surely he had bottomed out, with all 
that flood of water of the night before.,
but behold there stood in the sunny sky‚Ä¶a land filled
paradise right before his eyes., it was faith 
that drew him here, so the captain was grinning 
from ear to ear, he knew it was his prayer
that coasted the boat to safety in this kind
windless serene oasis abroad, then all he could think
of was..THANK YOU GOD!~~
hope you enjoyed that, i just felt inspired to write a couple of lines‚Ä¶and if it does not ryme the messege is clear‚Ä¶throughout the shakiest of waters there truly is a light that can direct us to safety from the unknown..that one is god may you find him now:) love you all and have a great day‚Ä¶.martin

Hi journal,
I just want to start this entry out by saying thanks for all the positive entries people have placed in my journal, diary is to girly..lol anyways I am at work and fixing to start my homework I have been procrastinating for a week now it is time to do it:) 
I feel tired and alive at the same time, my will is not so strong today because I really didnt sleep much, but I will catch up on it tommorow im sure. 
As I sit here and stare at the keys
wondering what type feelings flow 
from my heart, all i can ponder is
its just another step along the way,
to happiness or a contentment that
for a moment feels right, then all 
the questions i ask to rid my soul,
get tossed in the way. 
I dont really realize or understand
true living or think i ever did, Most
live happy without reason or without
need, I try but it just seems like 
I end up with a field without seeds,
they were planted but somehow blew 
away and i start back at step one 
to ground them again in the earth,
there are times i ask god what is 
all this confusion worth? He sends
his answers in the shapes of a 
morning smile thru sunshine in the 
air or a birds lovely singing that
can be heard throughout the spheres,
dont cry i tell my heart as it longs 
to rid the river from my veins, a 
history that medicine cant make 
better or even rid the rapids in my 
soul, just another day without a pulse,
a broken smile that the child longs to
be straightend and fixed, but it stays
crooked for weeks, we question if sleep 
helps repair the damage of the day,
or is it just a blind mans get away?I ponder
the questions of the day and the nights‚Ä¶just to 
wonder which is wrong and which is right.
it is four in the morning and nothing really goin on but delirium and sleepless mindset of a vision in my eyes that is blurred by a hazey mound of sleep in my soul,no amount of chocolate or coffee can break its hold. I am soooo tired and lost in my mind wondering when the clock hits eight and the tocks start jumpin in my dreams as the day says goodnight to day and my heart slows down just a little more and the issues of the day also have been placed to rest‚Ä¶forgive me for my sinful thoughts and actions lord‚Ä¶i am lost most of the time and really wing it on a daily basis because I am really new to this‚Ä¶I have a wonderful support system and it is just the feeling of being able to be consistant in my efforts for well being and the quest for the unconditional thing‚Ä¶will i ever be able to let it back in? I am so numb to most right now that I just seem to levatate in this world, my eyes twitch and they are reddend with pain as i long for the rain to end ..lol well you guys have a great one and keep me in your prayers‚Ä¶love ya martin

Hi how are you doing? Im aight just sitting here , just woke up not to long ago and not really all that tired feeling because for some weird reason I am not..lol . I had a hell of a day today and for the weirdest part it wasnt all that bad either. I realized alot of things and then again got some questions resolved due to my searching mentality.I sat thru a wicked end of a ‚Äúnot therapeutic group today‚ÄùIm really not allowed to go into detail because of all the technacalities of it ..but for the most part a feelings analyses is that it sucked. I am not letting much get to me as it is trying desperately to and for the most part it wants to. I think im goin out of town this weekend and maybe get me some r&r . Im not mad but wish that i could let things go as they may and never think of them again as long as i live at times‚Ä¶.but in my mind its not that easy and those that do or can it seems like they really never make a tight enough connection to human contact or actually ever really know what its like to feel to the fullest. 
I want to talk bout something that burns in me daily and that for the most part I dont know what to do with it. LOVe¬† i dont know what to do with this word..and it confuses the hell out of me because without condition is a strong concept to master.I am tired of being so damn clinical and thought provoking not only in myself but in the people around me. I get to the point where i feel stupid and numb. I wish i could just let it roll off me and be uncaring and callase like most i know. i wish i could use pain in my past as a crutch, i wish i could just walk round in the clouds and act like hey ‚Ä¶.if i dont feel it ..it doesnt exist‚Ä¶but for some weird reason i feel everything so deeply and thouroughly that it burns when they hurt and it burns when i cant seem to reach them or to help them for the better good of humanity. I am not giving up by any means‚Ä¶just kinda looking at this in a different light. I was thought when i first started in this field to be full of compassion and humility and that would take me a long way and it did. now im at a point where i feel so numb inside that i cant feel much‚Ä¶.only in increments and in spurts ‚Ä¶im no longer afraid,, im no longer makeing excuses for my actions and no longer defending and denying‚Ä¶.but the feeling is so numb that it scares me‚Ä¶..because what if i never feel like i did once bout the passion of helping another fellow human being.? I dont feel love for myself right now but i do like myself alot if that makes sense. I dont feel love for much‚Ä¶..love to me has been reevaluated and its taken on a deeper meaning then just defining a liking for‚Ä¶.i wonder if i will ever love unconditional ever again‚Ä¶.and that worries me‚Ä¶.so many have hurt martin in his life that just know im being honest without all the things‚Ä¶.in the way‚Ä¶and not making excuses‚Ä¶..im scared that in all the pain‚Ä¶.if it didnt chip away my ability to love another ever again or truly trust so deeply that it doesnt consume me ‚Ä¶..but kinda just grabs where i dont want to let go of it‚Ä¶..im wounded today. I didnt let the devil get me but he is around everwhere i turn‚Ä¶.and he is vicious‚Ä¶.its like the deeper you getinto prayer and self actualizing‚Ä¶the stronger he becomes and that is why i gave up once‚Ä¶because after awhile‚Ä¶it got to be to much and if he cant make you fall‚Ä¶.then things you care bout fall round you‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..so one thing gives‚Ä¶even if your strong‚Ä¶.do you still have to lose? confusion is the devils allie‚Ä¶.and right now‚Ä¶i hate that i feel it in my school‚Ä¶.and my abilities to love again and trust unconditional and to know these things hurts more then i can ever write in here‚Ä¶.i feel like pukin‚Ä¶i feel like im gonna just hurl because of the day in class the night is around the corner and for the most part i dont like the person i work with tonight‚Ä¶.she is snotty and not to friendly and the more i work on me the more i get stuck insituations that i cannot change‚Ä¶but the understanding is taking its time..for some weird reason‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..im tired and im not to certain if any of this makes sense‚Ä¶.i dont want to feel but yet‚Ä¶.i need to its part of my lifeline‚Ä¶too ‚Ä¶.and this fuckin medicine is driving me crazier it seems‚Ä¶..what is worst‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.no sleep and stress‚Ä¶or sleep and no real emotional connection with the world ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶and to some of the people in my list im gonna delete them because they never talk to me anyways‚Ä¶.tired of fake ass people‚Ä¶..be one with yourself and then be one as you are talkin with me‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..to much drama for my head to absorb‚Ä¶.please forgive me lord‚Ä¶.i am a weakend soul at the moment‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.love ya all‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶martin

song: valentine by martina mcbride

Hey journal whats up? I am sitting at work with full of thoughts and various things that are just eating me up right now ‚Ä¶mostly bout earlier in class almost a whole twenty four hours ago, now if that isnt holding on to something i dont know what is‚Ä¶lol well i read in my recovery bible til after the great flood of society. If gods will was that strong then the minut issues of my every day existance is just not that important i dont think,‚Ä¶as eye twitches*..to him in my interpretation was that man was born of evil and that it was time to start anew without takeing the goodness out with the bad‚Ä¶.the living in the grey and allowing the goodness to sprout more goodness instead of living in the problem that we sometimes feel overwhelmed or in a circle of confusion. 

¬†

To the addicted and uncharmed

life of the world, we often want

more then the land or body should 

endure, then we place blame on others

to justify our illicit behavior of our

fellow man, only to realize its our own

body or mind that beats out of rythm,

but we will not accept accountability

or creed to our awful shortcomeings we

bring to the table of life, its not bout 

helping pureify the world we sometimes

seem preoccupied with destroying it and

ourselves in the name of greed and envy,

deceit or false pretense, but again we 

rationalize this behavior with a smile or kiss

from the neighbors wife as we juggle the 

credit card in front of a homeless man

and then wonder why he ills to kill all in the

name of survival and the venom that bestows 

your head‚Ä¶its this head he must crush because

god told early man to do such, to be a reminder

of the fruit of good and evil that he shouldnt 

have touched‚Ä¶or eaten‚Ä¶.maybe then we wouldnt

be all so full of cynisism and hatred for our fellow

man‚Ä¶.so when you reach into that cup you call life‚Ä¶

ask yourself this‚Ä¶..is your $$ really more important 

then what others souls are starving for?‚Äù or can it

really buy u into heaven ..???? its the soul that is 

empty and the green in your pocket cant mend the

blemishes and scars inside you‚Ä¶..remember scars ..? 

ask jesus..i bet he does‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..why

let his dying for us to be all in vain? as we still want to suffer

with so much pain‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.

hey journal,

it is three forty five in the am and i am sitting here listening to the soundtrack of the movie i couldnt sit thru isnt that funny? I just finished cleaning the kitchen at work and tired as hell‚Ä¶especially since my brain is off and my body wants to follow suit. ..I just read britt‚Äôs diary and made me smile;) I am not trying to be¬†a jerk at all just think that this medicine is slowing down my brain to much and really doesnt allow me to make my own logical reasonings or decisions according to how i really feel instead of just acting first.

well my team lost tonight as usual and it kinda pissed me off but im gettin used to it and think damn the coaching needs a revamping we need a coach that is not so conservative and gambles with the players he has‚Ä¶its really funny when they start moving the ball its when the plays are wide open and not so run run‚Ä¶.pass run‚Ä¶stuff‚Ä¶but oh well as a disgruntled fan i must endure another hard season of bear football. it has not been easy at all..considering the team that beat the packers last week sucks‚Ä¶.so that really leaves my team on a very minut measureing stick‚Ä¶.oh well life goes on‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.could someone make my head stop wanting to sleep‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..aggggggggh‚Ä¶lol‚Ä¶..

this cd is not really as bad and awful as the movie was for some reason i cant sit and listen to a movie that sings‚Ä¶..its more then i can stand. I guess west side story in high school tramatized me forever‚Ä¶and that movie had so many mixed messeges‚Ä¶.earliest form of homosexuality i have ever seen‚Ä¶I am still debating whether to go to class or not in the am‚Ä¶or just go up there and pay my tuition and come home afterwards‚Ä¶.just not really in the mood for group and its still going on‚Ä¶so call me a non team player but i just dont want to be a part of that‚Ä¶it has nothing to do with training ‚Ä¶just a way for strangers to open up their darkest secrets and the rest of the ‚Äúso called professionals in training ‚Äù ridicule them..or offer advice‚Ä¶.bah humbug horsepoop!!‚Ä¶..newho‚Ä¶this cd is making me so tired‚Ä¶.like the movie

tommorow is tuesday and almost time for a day off again‚Ä¶sheesh i cant get enuff of them for some reason‚Ä¶.it would really be kewl tho if britt moved to dallas we could spend alot more time together and i think that is why we are in this weird part of our relationship because of the distance and the issues that we are both trying to resolve involving alot of past baggage on both of our parts‚Ä¶but it is all good‚Ä¶.what does not kill you only makes you stronger‚Ä¶isnt that right? i wonder when it is gonna get cold nuff for a coat‚Ä¶its pretty nippy outside as is‚Ä¶but it is just great football weather and alot of lucky people are given the opportunity to cherish the moments‚Ä¶of the ol pigskin game‚Ä¶:)

my coworker is counting medicine as i twist off on the comp‚Ä¶oh well she didnt have to throw a huge bag of trash into the dumpster full of old food and grease‚Ä¶so im not really that empathtic towards her needs right now‚Ä¶.im in a weird mood right now and only wish i could just lay down and go to sleep.for a bit‚Ä¶..snooooooooooooxeeee away‚Ä¶well hope you guys are doing great‚Ä¶.gotta go do rounds‚Ä¶..lata‚Ä¶;) martin

HI journal,

its day time and im sittin here listening to a all time favorite of mine, it helps soothe me so serene it just seems like the problems of the world just wash away in sarahs voice and emotions‚Ä¶today at class was a prime example of martin being good at what he does‚Ä¶.to many distractions and all i did was get out a piece of paper and write the serenity prayer on it and think ‚Ä¶sheesh i am paying for the history of the class‚Ä¶.and their dysfunctions oh well i could get paid to hear their stories‚Ä¶lol ignorance is bliss in there and the sad part is‚Ä¶that it is infecting the rest of the class‚Ä¶..but i pull out my super hero shield and dont let it get me‚Ä¶hehehe‚Ä¶.

in the arms of the angel‚Ä¶.such powerful words‚Ä¶to the fallen in the world that statement just spells out serenity and hope. I have been at the point where life just didnt make sense of that it really didnt seem worth living in such a jaded time n¬† my life‚Ä¶and thru it all the angels.. helped me out by not letting me drown..then the waves came and i got cleansed‚Ä¶the darkness subsided and redemption and purity replaced the demons of my past and allowed my mind to slow down enough to really enjoy life‚Ä¶thru dark times and people we need the few that can bring the light and totally shine it on us‚Ä¶but we cant be scared of the goodness‚Ä¶.because it can be counterproductive if we do as such‚Ä¶as the wave crested and the mist splashed me in my face‚Ä¶then only then did i realize that water is the true cleanser of the soul that for so long felt dirty and unclean‚Ä¶.always wanted something to fulfill the void but didnt know what i was looking for‚Ä¶‚Ä¶then it came‚Ä¶in the the words of a addictions book‚Ä¶.GOD‚Ä¶and if you dont know what GOD means‚Ä¶..look it up in the dictionary‚Ä¶it doesnt mean religion or a person‚Ä¶.GOD is a title for a being higher then yourself that can restore you to sanity in any copassity‚Ä¶or in a acronym‚Ä¶.GOOD ORDERLY DIRECTION‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶if that takes the religion out of it for you‚Ä¶.this person or being saves the darkest souls reaches the deepest pain that you think no one can understand or that you have lived your life full of guilt pain or shame‚Ä¶time to step out of that bs and get into the light of your good orderly direction..:) we all play the game of life and we lose at times..its what we do after losing so much that defines our character‚Ä¶we all need help and need some damn good smiles along the way to let us know that we are loved in the simpliest forms‚Ä¶a gentle touch a simple word‚Ä¶.a thank you or yes ma‚Äôam , sir, etc‚Ä¶.makes the building blocks of humanity even stronger because thru fear the devil has power‚Ä¶without it‚Ä¶he is powerless and guess what‚Ä¶so are his bad directions and intentions‚Ä¶he is not worthy of your soul or goin to a place where darkness dwells‚Ä¶ask you this‚Ä¶.if you died today‚Ä¶.even if your not religious‚Ä¶are you done with your journey here? would you go with no regrets‚Ä¶could you leave all behind knowing that you would be truely at peace? could you know that you were loved and gave love? the ones that hurt you..did you really forgive their actions and them? did you really make that little boys day by showing him how to tie his shoes‚Ä¶or that old lady how to put in her false teeth‚Ä¶..or the snobby girl know that she really is insecure so that is why she acts that way and peeled back that mask to see who she really is‚Ä¶and let her know it was okay to be herself‚Ä¶.touch the light and reap the brightness to the world we all can make a difference..even if they dont love you right away‚Ä¶they cant deny your goodness‚Ä¶.i am working on goodness..and my plant is still a seed but i water it daily‚Ä¶cause i want to know i give more then i take and want to truly appreciate people in their simplest forms without labels without judgement‚Ä¶only the person and their personality‚Ä¶..so getcha¬† a surfboard and hit the wave on wave‚Ä¶.and feel the water hit your face and feel the cleanseing of your soul as you surf‚Ä¶‚Ä¶god will dry you off so you can do it again‚Ä¶.a wise person once said to me god makes no mistakes‚Ä¶.he sure doesnt‚Ä¶.catch that wave and surf til you cant surf..then let him carry you to the shore to dry you off and make you rested and whole again‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..give it up..what you got to lose? surf on baby!!!!!~~~ love ya all martin‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

song: behind blue eyes..by limp bizkit

Hi journal,

just sitting here thinking bout what is really going on in my mind. I have been cleaning and doing somethings to get my mind off of always being on the computer for a companion when I sit in this house all alone. If you havent heard this song go download it..its fairly new so you may not be able to find it but if you can great sonnng:) underneath the blue eyes of my soul live the brown filled serenity of my heart:) I dont really have any issues going on today or lately. I went to a awesome haunted house last night that scared me to death at times, I havent been to something that fun in awhile, but i tell you the people i was with contributed to the fun. I had a great weekend considering my stomach is in knots for some reason. I have some stress stemming from some where and I am gonna get to the skinny of it all. I may have used my counceling skills earlier and shouldnt have so if your reading susan, Im sorry. I was just trying to have a objective view on things not to place judgement or to say you were advocating the behavior. I hope that you truely got the real meaning that i was trying to put across to you. 

To truly appreciate the lovelyness of recovery or going forward in life we must know that without the clouds we would not appreciate the sunshine..or the rays of light that happen in between the clearing of the darkened day. No one knows more then I the true effect of darkness, I guess for the most part of my life i always created it to make life faster or to somehow make sense of all the madness if i could solve the dysfunction then i would feel so more empowered by my own solution.I have been in a wave of emotions for most of my life and it is those emotions that help me to be the person i am today. i would not change a thing.I would not ever back track and think that all the people i have been in contact with in my short time on this earth were for all bad experiences. Sometimes in gaining enlightment we seem to somehow to want to give up living in the process‚Ä¶and overevaluate things and stop doing the things that are natural:) and then we lose one addiction for another‚Ä¶.and somehow keep in the insane process‚Ä¶..so we can be aware of the problem but we do have to remember to live and let things come natural . its only gets insane when we go and do the same things as we used to and then wonder why we are not gettin any further down the road.Its so simple to slow the thoughts down by accepting one thing‚Ä¶that god knows all but we also have to be aware enuff to do the things we need to do make the change as well. He cant stop you from reaching for that addictive behavior when you are at the crossroads‚Ä¶.do we make a left or do we make a right‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶the words in this song are so real‚Ä¶the start goes like this..* no one knows what its like to be the bad man‚Ä¶.the sad man‚Ä¶..no one knows what its like to be hated‚Ä¶misinterpreted, >‚Ä¶.* how many cant relate to that? we all can in one way or the other‚Ä¶but just as you think of those feelings that go along with feeling like that‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.its those unsaid built up things that make us cope in different ways‚Ä¶.some of us drink..some of us drug‚Ä¶and some of us..do other things‚Ä¶in the end its our souls we make dirty and our wings get unclipped daily with sin‚Ä¶‚Ä¶;) so remember take the thoughts in your head and recognize they exist for if you dont‚Ä¶.then the anger will make your blueest of eyes turn into a sea of sadness‚Ä¶.without pain there is no redemption‚Ä¶:) and dont take the blue eye statement literal‚Ä¶its talkin bout the darkness in the eyes that when they reflect in the mirror there is nothing but sadness due to the vision society has placed on our existance. I am in a thinking mood as you can tell by now‚Ä¶but you know i will always analyze and think‚Ä¶and be sad and happy and up and down..but its what i truly enjoy that gets me thru the days on this planet‚Ä¶and for the most part its not giveing a damn what anyone thinks of me or my decisions its so free but a lonley world at the same time because all this therapy stuff gets to much after awhile where you overthink your every step and your every reason for living‚Ä¶so there comes a time when you step back and say‚Ä¶i am making a concious effort to stop the ‚Äù i cant feel nothing but goodness ‚Äù stuff and let all things in‚Ä¶cause we are multi fauceted individuals that live thru the bad things and things to get to a common ground‚Ä¶without it we would be robots programmed to only live in tranquility and one way with all the same emotions and not ever to take risks on living for fear that we would enjoy the dysfunction to much. that is why i say i love my life and would do it all again ‚Ä¶there is somethings i truly enjoy and to some they are not normal or taboo stuff‚Ä¶but i dont use them in excess so it all balances out‚Ä¶and before your mind starts wandering ..nothing illegal and nothing that is stuff you keep in the closet for fear of judgement..if you truly want to know ask me‚Ä¶ill tell the world everything‚Ä¶i dont care.:) i appreciate the notes on here from you folks..it is kewl..but remember when im writing bout being down or hurting‚Ä¶its part of a process that i wont stay in long because im more then the pain at the moment..just pausing to regroup. i love ya all‚Ä¶and peace:)

hey journal,

how is it going? I am just sitting here from wakeing up from sleeping. Im not in the best of moods or even think I am happy. I am really sick of all the therapy crap, I had a incident at work that was totally uncalled for and didnt get to me then but the more i think bout it was total bullshit. rules are ment to be followed not to be picked over and used at your own descretion, someone called my jrnl writing inspirational writing, i dont get on this damn thing to inspire anyone but martin. I dont care if you get anything from this or not. Its my thoughts and beliefs not a place for me to bring you up because if it was i wouldnt put the entries in how i do. I put it in so that i can go back and read my stuff and when i feel unsure i can let myself read all the stuff i write to let me know its not so bad after all. I have to much stimuli right now and dislike the feelings that brings. I feel pressured at the moment and feel like i am losing the battle for sanity. Im mad today and hate to feel that as well. I live in a moment when i just want to let things happen as they may and for the most part last night sucked ass, made me wonder what type of people are leading these i work with or that if it is really worth all the trouble to help people that obiously dont want help, all they care bout is hooking up and being devient. I just wish that they wouldnt come to our facilities and keep their homeless out in the rain til they were ready. I dont know why i feel like this but the wishy washy shit of the world is clouding up my vision today. If you want to make a decision make it‚Ä¶im so sick and tired of being told I made them do anything or that I made them feel like this. I dont have that much power and i feel like im fuckin losing my grip on sanity today and maybe it will all get better if i wake up for a bit‚Ä¶and not trying to be mean but plz dont leave any notes about it will get better martin, yada yada‚Ä¶cause if it does it does‚Ä¶i know all that i need to do to turn this around and i just feel that i gave up control for god to run my life, then why should i let humans have say on my day ‚Ä¶when it feels so shitty right now. I didnt say that to be mean either i just should have the ability to speak my mind‚Ä¶.gonna go hide out for a bit. I dont feel like being round things at this moment. sick of living my life like i am thinkin bout every move i make..i feel so controlled right now and i dont like that feeling. its funny when you lose control that then things start trying to control you and how is that condusive to great mental health? i dont feel cheery today ‚Ä¶.i feel full of fuel and anger ‚Ä¶think i need to go get that membership back at the gym. my mind finally is wakin up after all that medicine crap was in it‚Ä¶.i guess im crazy truly cause i dont want it to be all serene and calm ‚Ä¶the world feels so boring haveing that in it all the time. dont get that statment wrong, I love peace of mind..but damn sometimes all that is to much.. i cant live in that daily‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.i can for a bit then it gets to much.feels like i stop living with passion and my passion gets put on idle or something dumb like that. i guess for all my life i was controlled‚Ä¶and beaten to maintain that‚Ä¶and dont like the feeling of letting things just happen without making sure that they are alright for martin‚Ä¶i cant let go of that ‚Ä¶for so long im all i have ever had‚Ä¶.can the readers understand that? when your all you have had for so long its hard to let go of the emotions especially when you want to‚Ä¶but just wont happen on its own‚Ä¶i enjoy the fast ness of the world¬† the edrenaline rush‚Ä¶the uncontrolled ways and attitudes‚Ä¶i dont put things in a list of importance‚Ä¶its on how i feel them that they have creedence in my life. labels on things puts expectations on them and those can smother you in time‚Ä¶.so i try to leave the labels off‚Ä¶.damn i dont know why im feeling this way‚Ä¶.but i have to know its okay to‚Ä¶ugh stop it martin‚Ä¶you are because you are‚Ä¶quit tryin to find the origion of everything. you are empowered with the source‚Ä¶.dont need to analyze everything. your not in therapy or are sick‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..so stop it‚Ä¶dont have to be in the mindset to be effective to what your training to do. oh well that is all‚Ä¶tired of the self help shit for today‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶later jrnl.

hey journal,

I just awoke and Im ready to take on a new day. First of all i would like to apologize for all those that read my entry and were offended. It wasnt aimed at anyone and if you really read it again doesnt really make much sense. I have told you guys that this is my dumping site and some of the stuff in here isnt pretty but it is my thoughts. I do understand that people read this and get inspired or what not, but when a person made a dirogatory remark about it, it made me mad and i went off on what actions that the statment made in my head and put them in here. I dont really write in this for praise or anything, im just trying to get well mentally, and if you can tell by the entry yest‚Ä¶i still have a ways to go if i get that upset bout things and my impulse control is that weak. I dont want to make excuses and i already made peace with the people i needed to and to the ones that didnt want to hear me out, i want you to know that you mean alot to me and i would never single you out in this to attack or be little. I am not shy i would talk to you bout my feelings. This song is so true in a lot of ways. It is about misunderstandings and how people cope when things get to much to handle in certain situations.I was so upset last night after my entry i made myself go back to bed to sleep it off. I would have gotten dressed and gone out in the past, but i was aware enough to know that all that isnt necessary and it is counter productive in what i am trying to achieve. I miss things that used to be natural and now just dont feel as such. I feel like my world is so structured and controlled that I have to rebel sometimes. I am not perfect and thank god im not. Most people that i effect should remember that what i say is not gospel, just a thought process of someone that has tried to get well thru all adversaty and in the process hurt some along the way. I dont mean to hurt you or get you upset, but in the same token its my life at times and if i feel in pain i lash out and i do it in here. nothing more. I appreciate all the caring but sometimes i cant really turn to it when i hurt that bad. it is something i have got to unlearn, but like everything else, takes time. im sorry again and hope that in time we can talk again without the wall of my imperfections gettin in the way. well im off to get ready for school and once again if you guys want to post notes its like what i write its your feelings and i respect them, i dont use them as weapons to hurt the readers in here ‚Ä¶so please dont take it as such and your free to leave anything you want. hope journal that all is well today in the world and that all the people that care bout me have a great day ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶love ya all‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..martin:)

Hi journal,

My lovely blinkin cursor buddy, I am at sante‚Äô and it is pouring rain outside a light gentle mist of raindrops fall ever so gently on our heads as we go make rounds and throw the damn trash out.I was just thinking of how serene the rain makes ya feel in times of despair and helplessness its like natures way of cleansing you and showin you that all to can be made new once it is washed off.I was also thinking bout the playdough analogy that my teacher gave us¬† yest in class.It was a speech that told bout how when we grow up our souls or body makeup is like a new thing of playdough and in time we always re-invent ourselves and can be stretched out, made into clones of the other..etc.well in time we get bruised and abused and that innocent pile of dough becomes just a little hard but still flexible and then people forget bout us or take us and leave us out in the cold or isolate us and then it gets h arder and harder as time goes on and then we stop being flexible and able to be put in different situations like we once were. Then only then do we get totally hard. If you have ever felt playdough after it hardens‚Ä¶maybe a little water makes it less hard‚Ä¶.and guess what that water is doing‚Ä¶..aka raindrops cleansing the hardness of and allowing you to bend again like you did once at the innocent part of your life. Just because some things happend to you as a child or early adult doesnt mean that, it is who you are to become for eternity everyone can make that playdough playable again. Just allow the water to help yo udo that and that water goes by another name‚Ä¶.Good Oderly Direction‚Ä¶‚Ä¶or god‚Ä¶.It is a simple concept that takes time to master and we always have to work at it daily and remember that there are two days¬† we cant be preoccupied with ‚Ä¶yesterday and tommorow ‚Ä¶there should be no stake in either of those days‚Ä¶cause then we either bring the baggage of yesterday into the clean new day or today‚Ä¶or take the future and pollute it with thoughts of tommorow. If we can somehow slow life down enough to enjoy today we will be so much further down the road. Its not easy and you say what bout living martin‚Ä¶I love it fast‚Ä¶well guess what no one is as much of a adrenline junkie then yours truly..but without the calmness all that happends to a fast burning candle is it burns out to fast for you to ever enjoy the true reason it started burning with in the first place.Pain is a thing that can cripple you and make you self medicate and eventually turn to abuse‚Ä¶we self destruct when we get overwhelmed with all those negative condentations‚Ä¶.not good nuff , not tall nuff, not pretty nuff, not smart nuff, not this or that enuff, well guess what folks‚Ä¶everyone is not something enuff and just because y ou dont know bout it doesnt mean it doesnt exist. We were all made with flaws of some sort‚Ä¶we just need to learn to remold the inner person and get rid of the negative thinking of ourselves and the way others perceive us reflects on our own thoughts of ourselves. I had problems with self esteem for a long time and sometimes get back into the rut of those awful feelings i just described and I used to try to do anything and everything to overcome that stigma that my father started‚Ä¶and soon turned into a self fullfillin prophacy. I love martin to death at times‚Ä¶but sometimes that is not enough if i get a hint that you may not. I know that is not fair to myself to think others should worship me as i do at times, but I feel that I am such a great person alot dont ever get the beauty of gettin to know me fully and that saddens me because I am so diverse in many areas. I struggle guys with this‚Ä¶and the thought that I may never truly recover from the issues of my past even though i am doing hardwork into them. I feel so numb at times like i dont feel anything and that much doesnt touch me at all and that feeling scares me also. I used to be a hundred to nothing on everything and soaked it up like a sponge and now i am at a turtles pace on certain things and it concerns me on the fact that is it because im leary of heartache or just cautious from the last thing i had. For whatever the reason it does confuse me and I am the only one that can answer it and one day it will come to me‚Ä¶im sure. Hope that it isnt to long tho. I am enjoying the rain outside and the coolness of the weather‚Ä¶but without sun to dry the rain then we would always never heal just be drenced with issues and no way to rid them or dry them up. ‚Ä¶well take care of yourselves o‚Äô loyal readers i love you all and talk again soon‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶martin:)

hey journal,

I am at work sitting here in a dark office t yping my thoughts of the night. I just finished cleaning the kitchen and it went pretty quick.I burned a awesome cd and made the time fly by even faster. I still have to count meds and stuff of that nature and then i will get to slow it down some. I really dont have much to say other then i havent updated the entries in forever. I just start typing and nothing really comes out so i ramble. I hear kim in the other room hacking on the computer lookin up apts and answering emails to prospective roomates.I have had a hard time up here at work because it is so lack in some areas and I am a very structured person, so it kinda drives me nuts. We are starting the twelve steps of recovery in class tommorow and im kinda looking forward to it, alcohol is a killer but to many label it as a character flaw or something of that nature. The title of my jrnl is a song by otown that is one of my favorites it talks bout all or nothing and for the most part that is what tye of person i am. I guess that things are pretty smoothe right now and for the most part chaos is out there but not so prevelant. Im tryin just to live it as it comes. I saw some kewl arts stuff this weekend and went to a traders village thing where it was so hot that was melting the concrete..lol not really but it was pretty warm, I got one of the funnel cakes and it was yummy. How do you make your mind believe something your heart isnt feeling? my heart is numb. I think it is off and needs a new battery. Im surely not the most open book when it comes to expression of total devotion but emotions i try to work with dail

sleepy time ..while the world sleeps the nocturnal weep the nights that we deprive ourselves of zzz time. I dont know what in the world i feel at this moment but it is not lonliness or love or angst or nothing‚Ä¶.to the bat cave to regroup the brain and make some gabba re-invent some neurotransmission of utopia filled emotion..misfires in the brain cause head trauma‚Ä¶save it for ya dilemma of a crusty loaf of tear drama‚Ä¶take care o‚Äô loyal readers‚Ä¶question‚Ä¶when it is the real thing..does your heart really sing? what if it doesnt work and is just out of tune..lol oh well tune in again sometime same ‚Ä¶.page

same bat channel‚Ä¶.later hooyahs!!~~~ martin

hi journal,

I apologize my word dumping agent from my last entry it was delirium overload and lots of bad food i guess cause i dont know what the hell i was thinking when i wrote it. I am sitting here smelling all good and clean ready to take on the world and school. I woke feeling rejuvenated and happy. I just thought i would leave a short note to the jrnl to let it know that i am okay and not in a physchiatric institute due to a meltdown.I was just thinking bout letting go ‚Ä¶that statment puzzles me in the deepest regards because it is so hard to just let things be in this world of mine, because for the most part if i ever let it go‚Ä¶i either A> didnt want it back or B> it never came back‚Ä¶so with that track record letting go of something equaled termination of some sort. I also was thinkin that thru daily prayer that my life is so stable and calm and serene, and i look at others and can see who really is in touch with the word and lives beside the good orderly direction in their lives. I am really excited when i find a true christian person that isnt afraid to announce their faith and stand by it thru all. In times we hit days we cant take most of the time, but it is the devil that feeds that chaos and dysfunction‚Ä¶we all have to remember tho we can restart our day at any given time and take the negativity out of it and start anew.So many let the actions of others ruin their days, their moods, their happiness. JUst another note‚Ä¶no one can make you feel anything that you dont want to. NOthing at all. If you feel yourself getting mad‚Ä¶be aware that you can stop that. Turn that dark cloud into a sunshine moment and realize its their insecurties that is tryin to get you into a moment of powerlessness. Keep your power and just see how much a difference those awful moments that used to be‚Ä¶can be no more. It takes practice and help tho. Ask the good orderly direction in your life to take the compulsion of negative thinking out of your life and to let the positive reign free. I know you can do it. When it comes to loving others i have found that you can love all you want and if it is just one sided then you are losing the most important part of your heart to waste.¬† I love my brother so much but had to move here to stop enabling his behavior and for once he is really foreced to live life on its terms..not by me or my mother doing everythign for him. GUess what? he is succeding because he has to, and chooses to, not because we love him less. Personal choice is a strong decision to make a different action when the thoughts of negativity come your way. Its that fight with your significant other‚Ä¶your mom, etc. Instead of shutting them out. when all the screaming and stuff stops‚Ä¶let them know how they made you feel whether they want to hear it or not, you are a individual with feelings and they shouldnt abuse them just because they are connected to you in a ‚Äúlove giveing‚Äù copacity. We need love and respect to make it thru the day. without it the day is full of null and sadness. That frown that we wear most days is because the seed of true identity and love isnt in you. You lost it thru finding..‚Äùthe one‚Äù or thru past luggage that is unresolved‚Ä¶if you feel after two years plus or so‚Ä¶that person isnt coming back ..guess what? they arent‚Ä¶it takes two years plus to officially stop the grieving process of a loss. Love yourself first, find who you really are‚Ä¶and god forbid what makes YOU happy. ITs your life not anyone elses‚Ä¶you only have one‚Ä¶why waste it in negativity and chaos..the secret to life is like faith says‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.there is none‚Ä¶its yours to make ‚Ä¶SO get started on that seed planting and water that bad boy daily‚Ä¶.cause you know we get to hungry..to angry‚Ä¶to lonely,,,or to tired‚Ä¶.there is only one thing we can do ..is halt that and start anew‚Ä¶.realize that those things will hurt your phsche‚Äô more then anything‚Ä¶so work on them..and realize them and make the difference daily‚Ä¶love yourself you are worth every breath otherwise‚Ä¶why are you here? and give to others in the name of goodness‚Ä¶is all we truly can do ‚Ä¶nothing else matters‚Ä¶love you all take care and have a great day‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..:) martin

hey journal,

I am sitting here chilling like a villain thinking of something inspirational to write down. That is usually when nothing comes so i have to wait for it to develop kinda like a cloud about to rain on the world. Today has been a great day full of unexpected things that have happend in class and in the world of martin. 

Lets see, I watched a movie called the matrix reloaded and it was very deep in alot of areas. Being in touch with the goodness of the world just makes you understand that when you see goodness it shines like a ray of light that is there and you cant escape the shining of it. I was really touched by the part where neo had to choose the two doors either choose love and the girl or to save the world and lose the one that he truly loved. If put in that sitation it is bout choice that makes it so extrodinary. I would choose to save the world and know in my heart that love will go on even if the person is not around.¬†I have learned that if you truly love something you have to let it go when the time comes for it to end ..even if there is no logical reason to let it go. It is the good times that continue on in your heart and mind. LOve is a powerful tool to conquer even the loudest critics ‚Ä¶because with out it we are only chasing that drug that was established from the earliest times‚Ä¶‚Ä¶the fruit had evil and sin‚Ä¶.there was love and purity before they ate from the fruit‚Ä¶..and after that‚Ä¶in my understanding god took it away and gave us free will to lose the most important lesson in life‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.that without love in our world there is nothing but pain and chaos. This is love of self and love of others with no condition‚Ä¶but knowing that if you give freely it will come back in given time freely. If love is costing you something right now‚Ä¶then i tell ya one thing‚Ä¶it isnt real and genuine‚Ä¶so put it back on the self and go shop at a different store. Love is gentle and kind‚Ä¶believes all things‚Ä¶.endures all things‚Ä¶..these are parts of a chapter i read‚Ä¶on it..corinthians‚Ä¶13;21?? somewhere in there‚Ä¶‚Ä¶that is simple and true‚Ä¶with these things‚Ä¶.a strong foundation can be built on believing without proof, enduring all things without limits‚Ä¶and most of all being kind and gentle to the delicate heart of one another and understand the soul is attached to this organ‚Ä¶.so if you love and lose‚Ä¶..just rejoice in the times you had that precious gift that doesnt come along¬† but every once in awhile..I havent had to lose this in a long time but I have heard alot of people lately that have the lines blurred and i decided to write bout it. Its as clear as the reflection of your face in the mirror‚Ä¶no questions no confusion‚Ä¶just clerity‚Ä¶.its the devil that dabbles in confusion‚Ä¶sometimes a jaded heart takes along time to heal‚Ä¶and do i know this one‚Ä¶.a jaded heart can learn to love again freely‚Ä¶.then so can¬† a heart from the deepest origions of existance.we ate from the fruit ‚Ä¶how bout eating from the body of christ‚Ä¶and really knowing what it tastes like again..to be pure and full of light‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..and the greatest of these is love ‚Ä¶not another person place or thing‚Ä¶just a love that grows from within your soul‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶water it and watch it grow‚Ä¶‚Ä¶GOOD ORDERLY DIRECTION>>>>>>>>>>>without it we have nothing but questions‚Ä¶live in the answer to all your questions‚Ä¶just ask him‚Ä¶he will let you know ‚Ä¶.;) take care everyone and dont be scared to stop and enjoy the simple things‚Ä¶the love that comes from the air we breathe‚Ä¶we only live this once‚Ä¶.dont look back or to far ahead‚Ä¶.live in the seconds of the day‚Ä¶..slow it down so you can feel it go in and out of you ..pure..and serene‚Ä¶.exhale that good ness‚Ä¶..love you all‚Ä¶.martin:)

hey journal,

just been in and out of it today. I tried to sleep after my friend and i went to eat out. I was driving and side swipped a median and put a hole in my tire‚Ä¶so the next couple of hours trying to find a tire and the cheapest we could find was ninety plus so I just drove round and he said that his uncle had a used tire shop so i decided to wait til tommorow and get one be4 i go to class.I had just made a remark bout how much more i had left to pay on the car and boom..hit the damn median and then had the blow out. I felt that anger that I havent felt in a couple of weeks and was like whoa‚Ä¶what is goin on‚Ä¶but then i had to remember that it is okay to feel it ..its how you deal with it that makes the make or break situation. so i just came home and went to lay down because my head has been splitting for most of the day‚Ä¶.after that. took some allergie meds and havent touched it. so i am thinkin i will go lay down again here in a bit and try to get well before work because for some weird reason we dont have the staff to call in sick or anything‚Ä¶.I am not to postive right now because of the intensity of this headache is more then i can take‚Ä¶.of all the times i can remember i have never had to deal with this crap on a daily basis where it changed my mood so tremendously..ill be bakc in a bit to update somemore but for now i dont feel to positive‚Ä¶lol lata

hey journal,

I am entering another entry because the earlier one was full of pain..oh god my head felt like i was having a anerysm or something. I took some medicine and layed down and then got up feeling better and came to work. I am not really in the most condusive moods for inspiration and I know that is okay. I am not angry or upset or anything just feel kinda hazey at the moment.

I looked in the mirror tonight and realized that the person i see is the person i have seen for all these years and wonder what is really different bout him‚Ä¶I have tried for so many years to rid the voices that flow so frequently bout the nonsense of anothers insecurities and shortcomings. I dont really know why you can have so many great days and then have two blah days‚Ä¶when you do the same stuff as you have been doing the previous times. I just wonder why on earth does the past have such a place in today even if you dont want it to be there. I havent written my mom in ages and havent went to see her as well. It isnt that i dont want to do either it is just hard to find the words to say or the energy to say them. I love my mom but its a weird kind of love its not deep like i guess alot of kids have with their parents it is on the surface just is. I never have had a close relationship with either of my parents and they just always treated me like a burden or a blemish on the family picture. I tried so hard to overcome all that they did to me. My mom was the person who sat round and acted like the life we had was more important then the protection of her own son from the brutality that was goin on around her. I dont really understand how you could watch this happen to your own kid and act as if it is okay. I have great dislike for my father and for the longest I have tried to find a way to be civil to him but you know what. I dont want to really. I dont care what happens to him or if i ever talk to him again‚Ä¶is that bad? I feel that all those years that he could have truly been the proud father and really loved my accomplishments he was to busy in the stands with the video camera filming cheerleaders and such and not really learning what my drive was bout. I excelled in sports and really never had to try to awfully hard at them. I am in a slump right now due to not having the time or energy to excercise. I like active people in my life so that it helps me want to be as well. I have had a big portion of my life either playing sports or being round t hem so it never seemed correct for me to involve myself with those that didnt. Back to my father, I just wish that one time he could have said great job martin and ment it.I guess since he didnt play football and stuff he never really understood it or the concept..but I was a product that he was envious im sure. Because anyone knows that if you are good at football in texas no matter what level it is played the community recognizes that. People know who you are‚Ä¶and since he wanted to live the secluded lifestyle of lies it was a burden on his antisocial behavior. He never took us to places normal kids go to. We always had to go to places adults liked. ‚Ä¶.never went to the parks‚Ä¶lakes‚Ä¶fishing‚Ä¶hunting‚Ä¶.riding four wheelers‚Ä¶.anything that involved injury or possible injury was forbidden‚Ä¶I dont understand alot of his rationale behind things..but I just know he was a very sick person that let his insecurities rule his being and land him exactly where he is at‚Ä¶in prison. I dont know if he ever will get out or if he does how long he will be able to adapt to the world of today. He went in in 89 and has been since‚Ä¶so that is a long time of change and progression that he has only seen on tv or heard bout. To this day I have never heard him utter the words im sorry for what crime i did and how it effected the family. We lost so many years because of pain and abuse that my brother and I are hanging on however we can and to the extent we may. I just wish i could have had the loving parents that wanted to see me do good..instead of the ones that messed up their lives and only now say‚Ä¶oh good job‚Ä¶how is that believeable when look where they are at‚Ä¶..I didnt put them there‚Ä¶just wonder how things could have been if I would have had real parents ‚Ä¶never being able to have things of your own‚Ä¶just the familys stuff‚Ä¶beaten with chains..kicked punched‚Ä¶yanked out of bed in the middle of the night while your in a deep sleep because a porn book is missing and you dont know nothing bout it‚Ä¶being to young to even think of such‚Ä¶but having to take the blame once it was found because you were not allowed to go back to bed til it surfaced..your hearing not being so good and being hit because you didnt understand what was said‚Ä¶always judged because you had such odd parents‚Ä¶so people stayed away from you‚Ä¶never hearing praise always profanity..wanting peace..but only chaos..being told you were ugly and retarded looking and no one would ever love you..never taught bout god‚Ä¶just heard it downed all the time‚Ä¶continued on other page‚Ä¶>>>>>>>>

Hi journal,

I havent wrote in you in quite a couple days and decided to update, first of all I just wanted to let you guys know that whoever wrote that obsene note on my jrnl i neither thought it was funny or cute. It was quite gross and you have some sick ass issues of your own to think that would make me laugh at all. I am neither gay or want to venture into the mana‚Äôge of marraige. SO if you get the notion to write anymore sick shit like that on here ‚Ä¶dont waste your time it will just get deleted.I dont really waste that time on negativity anymore just had to address the situation ‚Ä¶lol still working on the compulsion to make all right ya know. Anywho, now back to the more important stuff, class is going quite interesting this week it is touching on alot of different topics..rape, domestic violence, child abuse, and some of the other doosies. I am glad I posted what I did on my last jrnl entry and deseray im sorry you had to go thru those things as well,it sucks i know but maybe writing it out and praying for it will make some of the pain go away. Remember even jesus had his scars at the end and those things just were left here on this earth all the pain all the critism he went thru. So even tho as children most of us suffer we can always turn the future and make it as bright as we want. Today was a good day as i can remember thru naps i took thruout the day, so now at work im not really tired but just chillin listening to this cd i burned awhile back and it has the same craving love songs i used to crave on a daily basis because i was always looking for it on this earth‚Ä¶but had to look up and realize it was just above my head. Now all i see is goodness all the way round the spectrum.Perfect song‚Ä¶.Moving on‚Ä¶by lonestar‚Ä¶.took awhile to figure out the meaning of finally letting go of the past ..it used to burn a hole in my chest on a daily basis, where i couldnt wait to douse the fire‚Ä¶when we are trapped in the past‚Ä¶.for a long time we just become stagnent and die slowly as our hearts wither and our love stales‚Ä¶we meet new people and our stale love and stagnent heart ‚Ä¶only stink unless we keep em cleaned on a daily basis‚Ä¶i love this line in this song‚Ä¶* at last i can see that life has been patiently waiting for me‚Ä¶..* amen‚Ä¶life never wanted to go on without me because of all the crappyness i was infecting the goodness with. All the times you wonder‚Ä¶why am i alone? why dont i receive what others do‚Ä¶.? all those why questions i no longer ask myself‚Ä¶its easier to dabble in the solution t hen to dwell in the questions people‚Ä¶.wake up the sun is shining and bright get out and rejoice in its goodness!!! all the times we frown for what we dont have‚Ä¶.your alive arent you? even if your soul is dirty, someone is keeping you safe and alive for a purpose‚Ä¶find your cleanser and clean that dirty house you live in‚Ä¶.(your soul) deserves the pinesol and the smell of bleach‚Ä¶.to rid it of all the pain that has accumolated in it thruout the y ears‚Ä¶.all those that hurt you still went on while you kept the memories alive with pain ‚Ä¶.let it go ..let it go‚Ä¶‚Ä¶i always used to say‚Ä¶i k now when its love ‚Ä¶when it makes me feel like my favorite song‚Ä¶i can never get tired of puttin it on repeat‚Ä¶GOd is doing something for me now that I could never do for myself‚Ä¶live in sanity and serenity‚Ä¶he has blessed me with the knowledge of so much lately and the wonderful people he has placed in my life‚Ä¶find him now!! at this moment‚Ä¶dont read any further..utter out those words‚Ä¶.JESUS I am lost and need your help at this moment and my life is unmanageble and I cant go on without you one more breath, I have lived a life without you and has gave me nothing but pain and a miserble existance, please come into my heart and rid me of my demons and start the process for I may start to walk with your father and you in the glorious life I crave on a daily basis that is so empty and unclean‚Ä¶.* do it ‚Ä¶see if it works‚Ä¶and truly let it go‚Ä¶your life¬† your old thinking‚Ä¶.start on a second to second basis‚Ä¶..dont be scared‚Ä¶we other christians will be there to help when you cant do it another day‚Ä¶.we will help you as you are weak..but remember we can sin and be forgiven..its not all or nothing with god‚Ä¶.he gave his son..so we may have a second chance to live in eternity‚Ä¶please believe and stop the nonsense of a miserble life full of deception and lies‚Ä¶..he is waiting‚Ä¶.say the statement‚Ä¶no need for a elaborate speech‚Ä¶talk to him as you would¬† your best friend or your closest ally‚Ä¶‚Ä¶love you much and take care of the person you are trying to be‚Ä¶.whoever you are‚Ä¶.make the change..you only have this life once‚Ä¶..stop the INSANITY>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>martin

Hey journal,

I am sitting here at work barely able to function, I am just running on pills that I have been taking to stay awake and function. I have put myself in a bad predicament. I missed alot of class this semester and now on the verge of getting kicked out of the program so I am doing all I have to do to stay focused on that. I work and sleep and school that is about all I really do:( I dont like this cycle anymore then any of the special people in my life but you know if I am really important to you then you will understand that this has nothing to do with you, but for me to be focused on the task at hand. I have been so lack at detail that I have not really taken the steps to be the best I can be in this opportunity that has been laid before me. Britt I know i promised you I wouldnt talk to you thru here but all i have to say is please understand that in my crucial time packed schedule sleep to me is like winning the lottery and has nothing to do with avoiding you or anything of that nature. I have one day and that is all i really want to do is sleep, nothing else and I didnt want you to drive all the way up here and me be so tired that it would ruin the whole thing or worst me be cranky and not want to be round you but to be sleeping. I dont know if it makes sense to you but it does me. Like you I have two months to get my grades, studies and all the things that are gonnna see me thru in the future in order. Education is important because it defines you in the end, if you dont settle down and focus you will always be chasing that tail of yours thinking i can wait¬† and do it later‚Ä¶well then you get in the situation i am currently in‚Ä¶cramming time and stuff where i should have just been focused in the first place. Once again i will delete any negativity from my jrnl it is bout positivity and nothing else. It is not a forum to leave notes of this or that‚Ä¶strictly to the topic at hand..I am not in the best of moods and I can tell that it is due to the delirium and the pills that are excelerating my heart and mind to stay awake‚Ä¶.you do what you have to do‚Ä¶and then they wonder why people end up addicted to things‚Ä¶oh well‚Ä¶I pray on this and know that if it is ment to be it will if not then i cant do nothing bout it‚Ä¶but im gonna do my part. I have realized that I cant give everything in my life 100% attention or dedication and that saddens me because I have always been a extremist and want all to be equal on the scale‚Ä¶.I hate when i get this tired because every little thing sets me off no matter how much i pray or what not..all i want to do is sleep and be alone‚Ä¶and as selfish as it sounds‚Ä¶that means more then anything to me at this moment‚Ä¶i definately miss the relationship my bed and i used to share‚Ä¶.IM sorry if this entry offends anyone or hurts your feelings‚Ä¶but im not intending on it..just tryin to make sense of the madness that is running thru my head right now‚Ä¶school‚Ä¶failing ‚Ä¶panic and desire‚Ä¶..i can never do more then one thing for some darn reason and be the best at it..i have never had a fulltime job working at night goin to school fulltime ‚Ä¶.driving in such traffic‚Ä¶half asleep‚Ä¶where no area wants to bend and knowin that if you give one up when it is necessity for the circle¬† to be complete‚Ä¶you start fighting with all your worth to make it¬† happen‚Ä¶well folks it is caution time‚Ä¶martin has to start fighting for this last two months to happen ‚Ä¶to be totally focused and full of intensity and dicipline it is gonna take to make my dream come true‚Ä¶Those that trully care bout me will be there when it ends‚Ä¶and if your not..im sorry‚Ä¶I believe in your dream ‚Ä¶i just hope you believe in mine‚Ä¶well oh dear journal this entry proves in the doubting mans mind that oh you can love god all you want and have him in your heart but if you dont do what you can to take care of yourself‚Ä¶the creeping demons seep in when you are the tiredest ‚Ä¶or vulnarable‚Ä¶god bless you all‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.martin

hey journal,
I am just sittin here at work havent been here long and decided to drop a quick line in my journal before i got to work. First of all I have had a hella day but it seems to have gotten better as the hours ticked away into the night. I went to class tonight and it was a great experience because of all the positivity in that room. For those of you that dont know we run groups in there and simulate a real life forum in the addictions part of our curriculum.I am sorta awake tonight but still sluggish in a sort of weird way‚Ä¶its like my mind is on but the things around me are on slow motion. I hate this feeling and know that it is only temporary. I had some thoughts tonight as i was driving home, thinkin about lookin at the cars in my rear view mirror and wondering what the cars behind me and people in them were thinking or who they were riding to see or what home was waitin on them to get there to.I was t hinking am i on the same road as a spouse that just was mean to his wife and on the way to get drunk? on the same road as a guy running from a violent outrage or crime? on the same road of a generous person that just gave someone a gift of life and just on their way home‚Ä¶on the same road as a priest that just commited a sin against humanity? on the same road as a young person intoxicated on drugs because they cant deal with life? on the same road as hitchhiker and a kind person who is bout to meet his maker due to pickin up the wrong person all in the name of good? on the same road of a kidnapper with a stolen child that is on flyers at the wal mart or the milk cartons of the world‚Ä¶all those lights lead to a story that only behind the roaring of a engine there is a soul in that car that is either on a good road in t heir lives or on a road that is filled with demons in which speeding along this road never cures..I wonder if the people rolling along this road ever stop to think of all they do to society as a whole or if they really care‚Ä¶this road we are on is a blacktop that leads us to the connections of a tree of life we started a long time ago‚Ä¶that road has lots of pot holes and when you hit them it feels like they take the air out of your tires and many times you cant recover from that shake in the smoothness lifes highway gives. Do ya veer off that road and crash your car ‚Ä¶and end the process or do you regain that wheel and over come the shock of the hole in your lane of life.? Alot of times we steer off to avoid the bump and cut someone off and cause a bigger mess or alot of times we car pool and forget that it is our turn to repay the favor next week and we use excuses to not have to and to someone leach onto the kind soul that let us ride in his or her vehicle in the first place.we ride for free alot and not pay for the goodness that is bestowed upon us..we take and take and never give back for we have a entitlement feeling that somehow by walkin on this road for a long time we are owed when we get to ride it at a faster pace.I have seen the darkest roads in the world‚Ä¶the least lit where i could not see but just the minute space in front of my face‚Ä¶and still i drove thru it with lots of fear and hopin my car would make it‚Ä¶runnin the tank on empty and prayin that it wouldnt stall in the most feturous areas of road imaginable. I fueled up my car alot of times and forgot to check the oil and then it would cause problems in the performance and i would wonder why the car wasnt running at optimum proformance‚Ä¶.to feed one and neglect the other is the same as doing neither‚Ä¶without a complete circle do we never get a chance to experience homeostasis..The road I have¬† been talkin bout is full of obstacles and different brands of people on it‚Ä¶some are flowing with a goodness and some are not..its those drivers we fear the most even in love and goodness fear still creeps in at times‚Ä¶to be human we must understand that in the fear even the brightest of the haligen lights exists‚Ä¶I have had alot of turmoil in my road of life‚Ä¶and i have changed lanes alot of times to only experience the same type of bump filled road‚Ä¶i steered alot to miss em and would hit another person ..only to add to the mess of missing the bump in the first place‚Ä¶I am in a lane of weird proportion..it has no bumps or has the littlest ones that i dont fear anymore but still the road the others are on is what i see in the rearview so is the same bumps they are goin over and are in my same lane really even t here for either of us as we travel in the same lane‚Ä¶how can one feel the bumps and the other not..? as my wheels touch the ground..only when i have lost a day of faith that i feel the friction the road produces‚Ä¶if you have not understood this simile‚Äô or analogy to life and the roads we choose then ask me we can talk further ‚Ä¶and without Good orderly direction do we have the fuel to get to our proposed destination‚Ä¶..if you are unhappy then know that it is only temporary and it to shal pass if yo ustop seeing just the brights in your rearview mirror and know you can flip up that mirror and just tune it out until your vision is restored enuff to face it another mile at a time if need be‚Ä¶dont give up world‚Ä¶we must repave this road for the ones that follow behind us‚Ä¶so we may all flow along a road of smoothe proportion‚Ä¶love thyself and to thy own heart be true‚Ä¶.if you cant do this ‚Ä¶then your tank is about to tap out on empty and you may be running out of gas to the point¬† your engine dies..without reaching the optimum destination‚Ä¶HOME‚Ä¶.have a great day and hope you have a refueling of your tank‚Ä¶.Psalm 91 is a good one‚Ä¶try to read it with a open mind and heart‚Ä¶who knows where it may add some years to your engine‚Ä¶.ANgels of the world‚Ä¶sing in unison in the name of the one that guides us all along this road we call ‚Ä¶.LIFE‚Ä¶.love you all and take care of yourselves‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..clean your engines and enjoy the road‚Ä¶.and stop to see the scenery along the way because its the simple things that get you thru the day‚Ä¶.along this heated patch of aspalt‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.gotta get to work‚Ä¶‚Ä¶love ya all‚Ä¶martin ..thanks jrnl for being here for my thoughts‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..god bless my readers and may their minds be pure of serenity and love after the journey to you begins‚Ä¶.find him now‚Ä¶:)

hey journal,
I just got finished some of my duties and decided to come back and add another entry. I was thinking while listening to kenny chesney‚Äôs cd alot of things and one song stuck out to me and i couldnt let it go‚Ä¶here is¬†the song‚Ä¶.lyrics
No I ain‚Äôt had nothing to drink I knew thats probably what you‚Äôd think If I dropped by this time of night Remember way back when I promised you I‚Äôd drop in At one of those meetings down at the Y 
Well, they started talkin bout steps you take Mistakes you make The hearts you break And the price you pay I almost walked away 
You could hear a pin drop When this old man Stood up and said I‚Äôm gonna‚Äô say it again Like I do every week For those who don‚Äôt know me 
It‚Äôs the simple things in life Like the kids at home and a loving wife That you miss the most, when you lose control And everything you love starts to disappear The devil takes your hand and says no fear Have another shot, just one more beer Yah, I‚Äôve been there, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm here This ole boy stood up in the aisle Said he‚Äôd been living a life of denial And he cried as he talked about wasted years I couldn‚Äôt believe what I heard It was my life word for word And all of the sudden it was clear I know for us it may be too late But it would mean the world to me If you were there when I stand to say It‚Äôs the simple things in life Like the kids at home and a loving wife That you miss the most, when you lose control And everything you love starts to disappear The devil takes your hand and says no fear Have another shot, just one more beer Yah, I‚Äôve been there, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm here Oh, I‚Äôve been there, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm here
>
This song means alot to me in the sense of losing the simple things in life that we all take for granted til we are left without them in the pits we dig ourselves. 
I just wanted to start something new also for a topic: 
In the wizard of oz‚Ä¶what character are you feeling as you read this‚Ä¶dorothy(forgiveness)scarecrow(brain)tinman(heart)lion(courage) just a thought if you want to think deep in can be what demon you are trying to slay today‚Ä¶let me know and give me a example why you feel that way‚Ä¶laterz martin

The devil has told me to take another shot‚Ä¶drink another beer..i have spent alot of my life chasing uncatchable things and that is the devils carrot he is dangling before our very eyes..i listen to people all the time speak of what they dont have or if they were only where they needed to be‚Ä¶well here is the wake up call¬† you have been searching for..you are wherever your mind is at that second, there is never gonna be a time when you have a total calmness because of our free will and easy influence from others and from within.and most of the time my heart hasnt been here nor there‚Ä¶I was thinking of how easy it is to get sucked into the lifestyle of partying, womanizing and lieing..how they all go hand in hand‚Ä¶in class we discussed being true to yourself and your convictions to allow others to see you in a positive true light that you crave to live in‚Ä¶well for alot of us that light is makin as much money as we can in as short of time as we can‚Ä¶and losing all the wonderful things money cant buy‚Ä¶ a tear comes along the face

hey journal,
I have had¬† a great day thus far and am full of feelings that i must dump. I was thinkin bout closure on the drive home because someone talked bout it in class. Is there really such a thing or do we ever do it correctly ?we say that we move on from situations but then we are left with the rebound effect after a situation comes back to trigger that reaction,that is why i guess there is such relapses in addictions facilities around the world‚Ä¶we have issues we deal with and as long as we are flying high off the right thing to do..in this world then things are great but once we get caught up in the negative part of life again thinkin that as long as we are feeling good at the moment we can partake in it again then we will be safe from harm..but that is the big illusion god only follows us to the door..once we cross it it is on us and we forget that. This is what gets us in trouble with old familiar stomping grounds‚Ä¶we think we are cured and we are not..we are only as cured as the last issue we tackled and gave up to god‚Ä¶You know what‚Ä¶i have spent alot of my life feeding into the negative part of life and allowing others to enable the same behavior in me that i am fueled up on the goodness i am feeling at the moment, I cant half step this in no way or no how..i gave the other life all i had so why can i just give this goodness a half effort? i dont really understand that‚Ä¶as long as its negative people love it thrive on it ‚Ä¶lose their lives for it‚Ä¶but if its positive and could help them get out of the madness‚Ä¶they dont want any of it..for fear of being shunned or not liked‚Ä¶or seen as weird for standin for what they believe..i have been weird all my life..tryin to fit into the madness the world told me would enable me to be more sociable more attractive‚Ä¶more popular‚Ä¶when all in all..i had all these attributes already just wanted others mixed up ideas to tell me it was okay to be a follower in their dysfuncion. I always said im not a follower but for alot of years i have been‚Ä¶followed the wrong people things and situation when in my heart all i wanted was goodness and love. I hate the fact that as a society we fall prey so easily to what is easy and evil‚Ä¶we turn from the right thing even if our heart screams out dont‚Ä¶.we run from the kids that need us the elderly that need help‚Ä¶the least fortunate because they arent as privalaged as us‚Ä¶im not on a crusade in this journal yall..just tryin to be more aware of the wrong i do to others‚Ä¶its a reality check when you see people dying from things that are far worst then what you are dealing with‚Ä¶even in my mayhem in life‚Ä¶others have had it worst‚Ä¶.we dont know til we humble ourselves to their cause‚Ä¶.stand up against the fear that is allowing them to live this way‚Ä¶.and shield them as i have been from those that care bout me‚Ä¶from evil‚Ä¶.and from the persecution of outcast projection ‚Ä¶.in the arms of the angel yall..angels were never human‚Ä¶we can be angel like‚Ä¶but never a true angel ‚Ä¶.until we are off this place‚Ä¶and that is a great thing‚Ä¶because i want my wings untarnished from the life i lead on this planet‚Ä¶i want to live in serenity..and peace‚Ä¶and sometimes i feel selfish for not wantin anyone negative round me‚Ä¶because i know i can help them with that‚Ä¶but at the time..im learning the goodness techniques from god as well..so kinda stingy bout that‚Ä¶one day i will be able to give it all the time..but for now‚Ä¶learning and understanding that if it is bad you dont have to like it to be liked‚Ä¶if you continue in the situation because its what you think will get you thru on this planet‚Ä¶jesus came alone and left alone‚Ä¶.and never fell to cliques and what others thought of him‚Ä¶i know that i am long winded on this but i believe it with all my heart and the fear is gone from my heart at this moment‚Ä¶the insecurities are gone‚Ä¶.i want to give more then i receive because i know then truly am i makin a difference and that is all i want to do‚Ä¶god calls‚Ä¶so much evil in the world..we feed it with out doubts and questions ‚Ä¶when we know the answer it beats loudly in our chest‚Ä¶.follow it..it will never let you down when god is flowing thru those veins‚Ä¶not bout religion yall‚Ä¶GOOD ORDERLY DIRECTION>‚Ä¶‚Ä¶we all need it and want it‚Ä¶and anyone that says otherwise is just masking their feelings‚Ä¶we all have demons‚Ä¶.what we do with that negativity to become productive is what defines us‚Ä¶..take care of someone today‚Ä¶let it be you:) love you all ‚Ä¶martin

hey journal,
I am sittin here thinkin bout things mostly stuff that is around me and I dont understand how chaos and being miserble could ever be a part of everyday living. I used to dabble in the obscure and melancholy lifestyle of the poor me life sucks yadayada‚Ä¶when i look around and dont feel the same kind of energy negativity used to provide me it tells me something‚Ä¶the devil definately has lost his grip and that this stuff i am feeling is definately real‚Ä¶i had my revelation the other day in the video on eating disorders to the people i want to help its the weak the ones that cant walk on their own the ones that cant fight the addiction of whatever‚Ä¶it is excess that drives us to the insanity we self medicate from‚Ä¶we need a common ground to gain wisdom to overcome these obscurities‚Ä¶in our lives‚Ä¶a old sayin goes..you dont know me til you walked in my shoes‚Ä¶maybe not but we smell what is on the bottom of those shoes and it never smells good does it folks? so we may not be in those shoes..but we still smell all that they have been in‚Ä¶:P so the next time someone tells you ..you dont understand or you dont know what i am goin thru..tell them..its bout the exterior that shines thru their pores not the end product they think you see‚Ä¶.lol ..its not fun and games folks its your life we are talking bout..its the very fibers of our future that we all possess in great mental health ‚Ä¶we need to be aware of the dysfunction we all live with‚Ä¶and know it isnt normal to be in pain all the time to hurt and be in despair‚Ä¶we have a way out‚Ä¶i speak on it in every entry‚Ä¶good orderly direction‚Ä¶find it‚Ä¶it works..and doesnt cost a thing‚Ä¶for a daily memeber ship just a shout out and sincerity with your organ that beats in your chest‚Ä¶.so the last entry asked if your heart was polluted ‚Ä¶and unpure‚Ä¶well most are mine was and good lord did i tear alot of the lining out of it‚Ä¶along the way in this walk i call my life‚Ä¶notice i say walk..i have realized that i dont need to run anymore ‚Ä¶can stroll and enjoy the road instead of burning up the pavement for the destination ahead of me‚Ä¶now i realize that the destination is right in front of me‚Ä¶right where i need to be..in the here and now‚Ä¶today is all i have to give to this world and i know that it is enuff because of the intense feeling i get when i wake up usually after sleeping..no more night mares or dreams of the past‚Ä¶well maybe bout football my love of my life‚Ä¶lol but other then that‚Ä¶i take the time to understand that if my mind isnt in check then the whole day will be spent chasing the chaos of others expectations and desires of me‚Ä¶and cant live like that no more‚Ä¶i wont and wont allow others to treat me as such. I have the power i lost along time ago in the tears i shed for a human loss‚Ä¶a loss of self caused me to disassociate from this goodness that i knew always was there‚Ä¶.project it on..and if you want to be negative stick with that ‚Ä¶i am not here to save you..just guide you..in the direction that leads north‚Ä¶its south that the heat turns up a notch‚Ä¶..so live as you may and know i wont judge you ‚Ä¶but understand this isnt a game either its real and we are all being watched to see if our free will is exactly what the life he planned for us at birth if we are loving enuff of his greatest sacrifice to find that purpose out and follow it without shame and without having to hide ‚Ä¶to love the unseen is the most insane thought the world thinks..of us‚Ä¶a bunch of crazy people prayin to something that they cant see‚Ä¶.well thru prayer it appears to you in the mirror when you look deep within yourself ‚Ä¶you will see what we all see‚Ä¶.and you know what that is‚Ä¶its pure love‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.love ya all..gotta get back to work‚Ä¶martin;)

hey journal,
I just got home from work and it is early in the morning. I didnt have to stay the whole eight hours because this guy that usually comes in early showed up and allowed me to get out of there. I worked with a guy that may be my boss soon i dont know but he is kewl i guess he gives off a weird vibe, he is nice nuff just kinda weird..in a good way i guess? hell i dont know what im sayin‚Ä¶.anywho I decided to update this thing even though i should be in bed sleeping by now. I had a very long day yesterday between coming home and speed sleeping and goin to night class, and then off to work..i think i will cut out the lil two hour thing i try to get before work because it seems to just hinder my alertness instead of cater to it.I cleaned the kitchen last night in record time thinkin oh god please let me get out of herrre im sooo sleepy. its a mental sleepy tho, not physical so while your body gets the beauty of being wide awake your darn mind wants to be asleep and restoring itself for another day of intense thought process. Well the voices from the woods‚Ä¶we are located on top of a indian burial ground and there are woods all around our facility‚Ä¶well at night as your doing your rounds you hear all kinds of things that come out of those woods‚Ä¶even a faint chainsaw sound i was certain one night ‚Ä¶.lil kids screaming‚Ä¶cats howling‚Ä¶you name it it comes from the woods‚Ä¶.i wouldnt go in those things if my life depended on it..isnt that silly‚Ä¶tho how afraid we are of woods ..and isolated areas where all it is is a bunch of trees growing close together‚Ä¶hehehe‚Ä¶its what lurks within those things that keeps us afraid‚Ä¶i mean¬† how many times has jason or leatherface came out of your woods? uh‚Ä¶NONE..lol thats what i thought..the worst that is out there is a homeless man with no where else safe to make his cardboard mansion made of box‚Ä¶.and his lil campfire of dreams and desires as he is trying to be shielded from the cold.Voices are strong journal i tell ya this much..if they were not bad thoughts i just might listen‚Ä¶.I am so glad that i only have two months left of school oh praise the man that be‚Ä¶hehehe‚Ä¶sick sick of school and the things that are being taught‚Ä¶time to learn new material in the process‚Ä¶i am cravin pancakes and sausage links‚Ä¶and scrambled eggs..but i have to break this cycle as well..eating then goin straight to bed..not healthy and gets you those lovely things on your sides‚Ä¶that there is nothing lovin bout them..ick! i have got to get severly diciplined bout working out and losing weight‚Ä¶first of all im not obese yall just overweight to the point i feel myself grounded more then be4 if that makes sense to you. I have tried alot of methods..binge and purging‚Ä¶laxatives‚Ä¶etc..you know the good stuff‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶and not glorifying that..but im joking k? I dont do none of that..maybe puke a lil on occasion and i think that is due to the food content i ingested just didnt go well with my tummy. halloween has came and gone and all was well‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..ready for xmas i am‚Ä¶turkey day has to do with food and eating..and jeesh‚Ä¶dont need any right now‚Ä¶lol¬† how bout them gifts folks‚Ä¶.let them ring ‚Ä¶hehehe‚Ä¶well im delirious and really tired and goin to find my bed and get intimately reaquinted with it‚Ä¶.hehehe if your giggling your a perv..:P but anywho ill update something lata on‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..this is just something to get your journal blood a flowing‚Ä¶down that stream of good orderly direction‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.towards the clouds and the purest of the rain‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶may your day be full of passion without the pain‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..love ya all and GOD may bless your mightly souls‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..MARtin ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶0:o)¬†¬†¬†

A man is standing at the register of a hardware store while a clerk rings up his items.
¬ìExcuse me, sir,¬î says a woman in line behind the man. ¬ìBut I couldn¬ít help but notice back in the plumbing supplies aisle that you were calling your wife Crisco. Is that really her name?¬î 
¬ìOh, no,¬î says the man. ¬ìThat¬ís just a pet name I use for her in public.¬î
¬ìWhat do you call her at home?¬î asks the woman. 
¬ìLard ass.¬î

Returning home from work, a blonde is shocked to find her house burglarized. She telephones the police, and a nearby K-9 unit is the first to respond. As the officer and dog approach the house, the woman storms out onto the porch and shouts, ¬ìI get robbed, I call the police for help, and they send me a blind cop?¬î

Virgo Profile
by Astronet
Virgo is an Earth sign, with a need for solid ground and form. Ruled by shape-shifting Mercury, Virgo works hard to stability. This sign analyzes and organizes life; the goal is to build a firm foundation. A good educational background is important to the Virgo. Mutable‚Äô motivation surfaces in the form of helping, teamwork and cooperation. Humbleness and the ability to work behind the scenes, without complaining, often cause Virgos to miss more opportunities than they should. A dose of self-confidence helps Virgo promote what he or she has to offer. Virgo gets stuck if he or she expresses too much earthy energy. He or she may try too hard. When frustrated, Virgo can get trapped in that notorious perfectionism. Because of the desire for security, Virgo may worry constantly about work: ‚ÄúWhat if they don‚Äôt need me anymore?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat if I make a mistake?‚Äù Balance comes with trusting that he or she will be OK and that imperfection is only human!

Dear journal,
I am sitting here at good ol‚Äô sante center for healing it is currently three in the am and not much is goin on.just thought i would get on this thing and write.I have been having a bit of writers block because i just dont really know..lol well I was thinking today bout goin to san angelo this weekend. I was thinking bout all the things and people i knew back there. In five years san angelo was my playground for a lot of different avenues in my life. I met alot of people there and saw alot of different things. I miss my friends at times because you ever make those friends that are so hard to replace? well i have some of those back in angelo and it kinda drives me crazy that i only have a limited time to see these people when i go to angelo.I was thinking bout a couple people that were very special in my developement about my spiritial road. One her name was Jennifer and we worked together at rivercrest and we never really dated but we were really close friends. Jen was the type of girl that was not all that eye poppin with beauty but she had something bout her that made guys notice her it was the goodness she possessed. well we would always talk bout spiritallity and up to that point i had never met someone that understood the concept that always played in my head but i didnt have a name for‚Ä¶well then i started learning bout it being okay to be yourself regardless of what others thought of you and to pray to a¬† higher power higher then yourself and to just live life on your terms ..well all this happend the first time for me quite easily and the ‚Äúpink‚Äù cloud as they call it lasted for awhile, i couldnt get enough on hearing bout god‚Ä¶well then it happend as it is now..for some reason ‚Ä¶the goodness kinda fades into the background and that pink cloud disappears and it seems as though the goodness that was so strong‚Ä¶just went away again..and this is the point where drug addicts‚Ä¶alcoholics‚Ä¶this is the point where they relapse usually because its not there‚Ä¶:( well i know its still there‚Ä¶just not as hot as it was a couple weeks ago and for the most part i have been worrying that ma ybe it was a temp thing‚Ä¶or what not‚Ä¶even though i know in my heart it wasnt..i talk about good orderly direction and stuff of that nature..well the¬†direction i have been goin is straight..just feels like im alone on this walk for now‚Ä¶.before it felt as tho my feet werent touching the ground‚Ä¶.now i know they are‚Ä¶and kinda worries me‚Ä¶before i felt love so freely now it seems as though it has to high of a price to really let it go‚Ä¶its like a void that is not even there anymore but still a hole that cant be filled if that makes any sense..i am surrounded by great support people and i feel their love for me..it makes me guilty for some reason that i cant give mine in return..i think it goes back to as long as its not real to my heart it cant leave‚Ä¶.and hurt me ‚Ä¶but that is a cowards way to go bout things‚Ä¶without risk there would be no progress and at this point every other aspect of my life is goin forward but the love that is just on idle in my heart‚Ä¶and that saddens me‚Ä¶and the rest of my life is on such high gear ..almost feels as though im not doing enough for happiness to stay with me..if that makes any sense?so my head is full of questions and on top of it all‚Ä¶school and work‚Ä¶more drama..lol well that is all for now‚Ä¶martin

hey journal,
I just woke up not long ago and decided to come write something in this that makes sense and not to use my journal as a way to just pass the days ‚Ä¶my dumping ground and i havent been using it daily like i once did.I went to san angelo this past weekend and I saw my brother and some of the remainders of my life there. I went by my old house and wanted to just sit and cry, all the time and things that that place had for me in the five years i lived in angelo cant be put on paper or on computer screen. I guess sometimes things happen and you end up where you dont think you could ever go..i left san angelo twice to come here to denton and the first time i shut down six months and couldnt eve muster the energy to find a reason to live..i didnt drink that time away though cause i wanted to feel the pain of the reason i came. I went back to san angelo that october and started to get some simbulance of living again. I lost my job that next august and decided to come back to denton ‚Ä¶and here I am a year later. I havent been to san angelo but a handful of times but yet still holds a dear piece of my heart. I found god on the lake of nasworthy and talked to him nightly out there. I know its silly to think he only lived there..but he sure doesnt seem to be round here much.I have tried to find a god spot like i had there and either A. is a place that cops run you off from or cant visit at your leisure without the sounds of traffic or sirens ruining the calm time that god and i used to share. Now i pray on the way to school or work‚Ä¶and seems so rushed and just a ritiual. I miss the nights we spent for hours talkin as the waves took my tears and shortcomings away‚Ä¶I miss alot of things that the simple life of a small community offer. I miss the ability to go walk alone and think without the people tryin to run you over on a bike or rollarblades..people live so fast here that its a miracle church lasts a whole hour because of the rushness of stuff. I meet people in passing but as far as ‚Äúreal friends‚Äù i have a select few and am used to being surrounded by a flock of people. I am just so lost in the mist of all this progression and positiveness that is goin on around me. Am i happy? i dont think happy would be the right word for it‚Ä¶i need god so much that when it comes to the rest of my life i want to keep it all out and just live with him..and not worry bout people‚Ä¶is that selfish? cause i know he wont ever leave me or that i dont have to be anything but me around him and it makes me feel so good to be in that light that shines down..its when i start to live as a human that things get blurred and the light goes away because so much takes away from his time and then boom..it goes and feels like you have to start over‚Ä¶im crazy i think to be so structured that only certain things can be in my life at certain times and not have the ability to have more then that goin simutainously in it. I fear alot of things that i never cared bout be4, i used to just live for the day not the feelings of others or the emotions that come along with tryin to be the best at my job and school. I have messed up in college before always because something in my life tried to be more important and just gave up on it. IM not tryin to give up now..and in the back of my mind..i miss closeness..i always had different people to hang with in angelo..where here it is the select few and to much of one thing becomes redundant..so i sit in front of this damn thing and wonder how did my life get this way? how did i go from the free spirit to the so structured person that feels chained to his life right now..i may be progressing down the path of positive but with that..you lose the ability to be carefree and unwind‚Ä¶you gain and gain and lose the simple things that made you want to progress in the first place‚Ä¶a catch 22. IM just really confused right now and i feel like my hands are slippin on that rung of success and hanging on by a grip that wont let me to fall..i dont want to hurt people as i get well..but seems like as you grow people around you grow as well or you lose them too.I just want to try to be as normal as my messed up mind will allow me to be‚Ä¶whatever that means..we shal see..without fight we have no reason to be..just reason to grieve that things pass without us knowin we had them‚Ä¶this to shal pass‚Ä¶im out for now‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.song: i remember when you were mine‚Ä¶by dixie chicks‚Ä¶later

Hey journal,
I had to get back on and write another entry because i was going thru my music and came upon this song and thought omg ‚Ä¶some of the things i have been feeling have alot to do with my father as you can or have read in the past entries..he didnt realize he was leading me and draggin me right behind him and through all the things he did..he hurt me and embarrased me as well. He didnt drink but had the same behavior that a alcoholic exibits..he wasnt a straight walker and drug me thru the mud on his unsteady gait in life..and didnt really treat me the way a lil kid is supposed to feel ‚Ä¶which is love and a great leader to look up to and to idolize..not a unsteady walking person that is pullin you down everytime he falls or stumbles and you have to take the blame for all he cant do well and is projected to you.I used to come in and wish that he was asleep because my small footsteps were scared to wake him because of all the evil that dwelled within him.I realize how a life of torment can kill your soul..he wasnt there when i graduated‚Ä¶he wasnt there to watch me play football and to hear them call my name in the stands to be proud..he wasnt there to see the man i have become to this day‚Ä¶all he knows is the little boy he left behind so long ago .. as he was being taken away..there has been so many times that i wonder how life could have been if he were never taken away the way he was would life be the same as i have experienced it? I talk of pain and the past in my jrnl because of all the demons that come back to me on a daily basis that it all confuses me because i have worked on martin for so long and thought that i had dealt with alot up to this point but for some reason it always goes back to my father and how i never got the love from a father figure and somehow just ended up in life looking and searching for that‚Ä¶and then i found my G>O>D and then all the good ness that brings still is so good that it scares me to take it all in at one time..so i get scared and go hide for a bit but tryin not to do so as much.I know that alot of people had someone in their lives that leaves them or doesnt want to be there for them and just seems to walk away‚Ä¶but doesnt leave anything but pain in the path that you were walking with this person up until they chose to walk away‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.we never know whose life we are inpacting til we are told hey its you that brought me here and so on‚Ä¶and if you live your life so off the line and swaggering back and forth who knows what you are draggin thru all the mud and shallow ponds of tears you are leaving‚Ä¶and all the lost years‚Ä¶..I think that sometimes we quest so much for something we call sanity and peace but it is enbedded in us deep within the soul of our heart that causes it to arise and conquer all‚Ä¶but we have to be able to lead a straight walkin person‚Ä¶..and for the most part i have lead my own shadow which was always either two steps ahead or two steps behind me and i never really knew which way was real and which way was right‚Ä¶so i chased the last image i saw‚Ä¶.and ended up dark‚Ä¶now i live in a place where there is no such thing as simple pleasures ‚Ä¶just fast speeding cars and no real waves of gracious love finding emotions‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..the candle i drug thru all that mud and tears still burns ‚Ä¶and the guy i try to follow now doesnt walk on the earth‚Ä¶he makes the road smoothe‚Ä¶but i still remember how i fell so many years‚Ä¶..hard to walk when you arent used to walkin straight behind a person that doesnt stumble‚Ä¶but keeps you safe..from all‚Ä¶that isnt love‚Ä¶.well‚Ä¶.goin to go for now‚Ä¶.be back soon‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶martin:)

hey journal,
I was on the deck out at work this morning when i had a epiphany‚Ä¶a vision that was clouded in my head for the last couple of entries..i have spoke of it in the past entrys but never grasped the concept fully..i was talkin with a client this morning bout his losing his wife of forty years..and he was shaken so badly that he was having anxiety due to living with the thought of not being with this person whom he had made a life with for so many years. we spoke and i did the councelor training thing but for the most part did the martin heart i care for people thing‚Ä¶and he opened up slowly at first and then god grabbed him and i in the same embrace and showed me what i have been asking for days weeks‚Ä¶.the beginning of how to hang on and still let go‚Ä¶at the same time‚Ä¶sounds impossible cause most think if you let go of a life saving ring..from doom you will fall and be parished but to let go and be free and believe you will be saved from the damnation of the embers of dispair that is truly the ticket ‚Ä¶well in his case as i saw it‚Ä¶he had to let god take over the thought of him losing this earthly person for his growth and salvation in order to grow as a person and truly get his priorities in order. He spoke to me and kept ducking the questions i was asking..but he eventually started talking more and more..til the moment hit..i told him..James(not real name to protect the innocent) you have to be strong nuff to be able to hang on to what you can deal with for as short of period as it takes to breathe‚Ä¶breathing is essential in survival..and also to let go of all that causes you pain at this moment to be able to build a foundation for the future and to learn to feel again and not try to regress this and actually realize its emotions that drive the soul to cleanse in tears‚Ä¶without them we would never heal and be totally cold and frigid‚Ä¶i saw the tears in this mans eyes welling up where i knew he wanted to cry‚Ä¶and just as i was gonna let him know it was okay to do such‚Ä¶he smiled thanked me and went on to the morning group..i saw him a couple seconds be4 and i said james..hang on to that rung for five ten minutes til you read your devotional and then let god have it‚Ä¶dont take it from him‚Ä¶let him keep it ..cause at this moment it is causing you more pain then good‚Ä¶..he thanked me and walked away‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶i shared this with you guys not to toot my own horn and say o martin how great art thou‚Ä¶but to show you that in the darkest times it takes a small amount of ear power to over come even the heaviest pain and despair‚Ä¶that man had something he didnt have be4 at least for those six or seven minutes we spoke‚Ä¶.FAITH‚Ä¶‚Ä¶faith in the word of someone else that was guiding him to his heart healing‚Ä¶he told me he couldnt feel much right now and i do know this mans pain‚Ä¶.but i remember exactly what i should have done and didnt..i held on to that rung of my pain for dear life out of fear‚Ä¶..whereas now i know he needs to let it go‚Ä¶knowing god will be there to catch him as he falls‚Ä¶.and cleanses‚Ä¶.where he will realize that it wasnt really a rung of life he was tryin to keep but just a barrier of insecurities that were holding him there like a prisoner‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶well im off to bed ‚Ä¶gotta get up later on ‚Ä¶take care of the ones you love and try to touch those you dont..know‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.it could be your kind word that starts the goodness in someone new‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶love you ‚Ä¶world‚Ä¶be good to each other‚Ä¶in gods smile we see ourselves ..:) martin

hey journal,
I just got home from school and i dont have that long to write because i have to go to work. I dont know up from down anymore and right now feel so freakin crazy in my mind im gonna hide out for a bit and just do what i have to do to get thru class and work. I had a semi arguement with britt earlier and things got out of hand and now she is not writing in her jrnl and stuff which i think is just crazy. I am not all there mentally right now and just want to get away and hide and maintain with stuff that doesnt allow me to think and feel just to maintain and its driving me crazy cause its what i have to do‚Ä¶not a option and therefore its like running from stuff. I know that in my entries i sound positive at times and those times usually are full of happiness but then as soon as it comes boom it goes because i get so run down and tired with so much i have to get right in my day. I know that i did these choices and have to live with the consequences..but in the way it will go it will go..school is so close to fininshing i am just so stressed with anxiety of finishing up strong and doin right and good at work..i fucked up this morning and gave a person a controlled med that they shouldnt have had because the order ended after five days ‚Ä¶a damn incident report had to be made and i felt like such a dumbass because i know better and seems like i have so little energy and brain power thruout the day i try to hurry things by so that i dont have to think so hard all at once..i dont know what im thinkin or feeling right now all i know is im hiding out so dont take it personal i must do this‚Ä¶im off tommorow and still have school so not much of a day off‚Ä¶then not off til next week sometime. I really dont hate my jrnl and dont give a shit if people read it like it hate it‚Ä¶laugh at it‚Ä¶its all for me and i dont need to help anyone up emotionally right now because its all i can do to keep martin going‚Ä¶..if you only knew how hard it is‚Ä¶to juggle so much and want to do it all right and not fail at the important things..in the past i would have quit all this shit and made excuses for why i havent made it further down the road‚Ä¶well you know what all those days are gone and im thinkin bout martin and him alone‚Ä¶i have to do this or i wont finish and i will hate the reasons why i didnt and end up ridding them as well as the task at hand‚Ä¶so please bare with me‚Ä¶i need this time ‚Ä¶god help me maintain and do what i have to do to make it all go away and somehow make it normal enuff to breathe..i cant breathe and it hurts to try to juggle so much when you cant even take a fuckin breath of air in this stress filled world of disappointments‚Ä¶oh well enuff of this i had to update at home be4 work because the stupid fuckin girl at work messed it up for all of us by talkin dirty to some guy and then tryed to blame it on others stupid fuckin hoe‚Ä¶i tired of people tryin to sabotage my way ..people at work..always lookin for a reason to get me fired‚Ä¶blameing me for shit i have nothing to do with‚Ä¶.IMagine all this‚Ä¶how can something that is supposively moving as positive and growth make you almost lose so much..it dont make sense..you have more when you are idle then when you try to do what you think is best for you‚Ä¶because no one really understands your thinkin but you‚Ä¶and causes problems ‚Ä¶oh well im late for work‚Ä¶.later‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..and ps‚Ä¶prayer isnt working‚Ä¶i give it up and all that‚Ä¶.maybe he will listen when he is rested as well‚Ä¶later

mOod: stuffy and congested full of anger
song: calling all angels by train
¬†
Hey journal,
I am sitting here stuffy and kinda sick, the intro to my title leads me to something this guy told me this morning that is no truer it seems..the only thing in doing something good for someone is that there is always repercussion for it. He told me bout a rattlesnack story that he had heard. A rattler was out in the desert freezing near death when a guy stumbled upon it and the snake was asking please mister save me i am near death, and the cowboy was like why should i ..you will just harm me and thought bout just cutting the head off., well the snake was like oh please i need a chance to live i have just hit on some hard times and gotten almost froze to death, well upon persuasion the cowboy picked the snake up but it in its sleeve and took it into his pickup near the heater, after a couple seconds he peeked down in his shirt cause he could feel the ice running down his arm so he knew that he had thawed the snake out‚Ä¶upon opening up his sleeve the snake reared up and bit him‚Ä¶OUch, why did you do that? the cowboy asked‚Ä¶cause im a rattlesnake what did you expect me to do‚Ä¶.the moral of this story is that if you assist people in their search or quest for themselves then be prepared to accept their failures and stumbles..because just because you have great intentions people or whatnot will act the way they are supposed to be regardless of your great heart.I learned this lesson to be true just a couple minutes ago after talkin to a friend of mine that just seems to like what i say when it benefits her and when there is a reality check that i state for her she gets angry and just starts being defenseful. I care bout people and their feelings for the most part, but if i am gonna take the time to listen to things that go on in your world ‚Ä¶dont expect me to enable you in your dysfunction but to try to guide you in the direction toward sanity. So, if you want to stress worry bout stuff that isnt happening at this moment, dont ask me or even let me hear bout stuff that is going on because as a loyal friend i always tend to try to help you to see that all the negativity in your world isnt all that is there‚Ä¶if you dig long nuff and hard nuff..I just should learn restraint and set my bounderies better because i started to get upset bout this person reacting to me as she did..then i had to stop and say martin‚Ä¶NO one can make you feel anyway that you dont plan or want to feel‚Ä¶NO one , no matter how much they think they are getting under your skin‚Ä¶in the end you are the one with the final say on how you are gonna deal with life‚Ä¶on its terms and in your own sane way..not to dabble in the idiocries of humans‚Ä¶i dabble in my own disane questions enuff‚Ä¶the things bout this one and that one are they the one‚Ä¶yada yada..you know another thing i learned this morning in my brief convo..is that without a stable me foundation in you‚Ä¶all that you think you give is only a portion of all the goodness you could expel because somewhere deep down ..something is driving you and if its not good..you will fail and then start the blame game‚Ä¶you know what you do..so at a particular point in your life be an adult and stand up and take the consequences..that have bestowed you. If it rains and you run out of gas‚Ä¶and have to walk in it..dont curse the clouds curse yourself for waitin so long to put gas in that tank..if you have a flat and its freezin outside dont curse your mom, dad, bf, humankind for it‚Ä¶its your car its your duty to keep it going ‚Ä¶dont curse the elements..life seems to throw you lemons quit bitching and make lemonade and distrubute it to the neighborhood and keep going straight‚Ä¶quit sittin on your thumbs and makin your priorities the ones that keep you in your rut‚Ä¶you have a lousy outlook bout life‚Ä¶well whose fault is that? its your life..if its so bad make a change‚Ä¶but i tell you that change doesnt happen overnite and definately doesnt happen alone‚Ä¶for all those that you push away that try to help you‚Ä¶they will quit because no one likes to continually help when you make the same dumb choices over and over..you live in your own insanity and before anyone that reads this gets pissed i am talkin more bout my life because i live in that insanity bout things daily‚Ä¶im tired of bitching and crying over this and that‚Ä¶it is what it is‚Ä¶and no one can make the change but martin‚Ä¶and that statement is not all the way true only god can truly make it for me..i have to allow it to happen..so if you hate your world‚Ä¶its the devils world you may be living in and if you hated living in hell right now and hurting and burning..just think if you dont let god in and something was to happen to you be4 you were ready..? those angels you push away are being there to guide you..to safety and calmness‚Ä¶but keep pushing‚Ä¶they to will go away..and after all its you walkin away from the goodness not the other way round‚Ä¶fruit for thought‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..take care of the angels they keep us all safe‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶martin

song: i will remember you by sarah mcglaughlin
¬†
hey journal,
I just woke up and feel really weird like im not in my body right now, its like a out of body thing to a extent i guess. I am listening to this song and reminds me of a time i was out by the lake in san angelo and was thinking of all that has been lost in my short world. I just sat there and started crying and thinking of all the things that I just let go as well. The trend kept going and that is why its so hard for me just to let go and let god, because of all the great things i walked away from because i just let them be as they were and they just slowly vanished out of my life. I have had some great mentors in life and am thankful for all their teachings‚Ä¶.does the rain really end? 
Walk along this track in life where the
leaves sometimes turn and fade,
to a color we can never get again,
just watch them wither in the winds of time,
to flow across the imaginary lines that in our
minds we draw to protect us from pain,¬† we 
color in the bricks from our own bloodied stains,
keep walking down the road that never ends and 
eventually comes to a cross in the road, there we 
look for shelter from the cold, when a blanket is handed 
to you lillte boy why must you push it away? why must you
run when i go to straighten your hair from all the years of 
windful nights and sand riddled days,that have taken its toll
on your face, a perminate line etched that goes downward 
on those lips that havent tasted a waterfall of rivers in a long time,
as you sit before me i stare into those eyes and see that day you 
were born and died in that battered souls hands, when a person is
left behind like that days are full of sleepless nights and a calm
never stirs but engulfs the air that is so full of questions, dont let up 
on the quest of the being born again thats all that can be truth in this time
of grim, a meloncholy etched breath flows from your mouth of tasted desire,
trying hard to watch it leave your mind as you want to hold it and push it down
into the graveyard of yesteryears deceased shatter panes of life, those
colors are all so blurred and twisted into a grey that cant be made bright again,
because in the eyes of that little child a life that never was is left for him to relive
daily in his own prison of doubt, rejection, and sadness, when life is so slow 
it burns a hole in your head from all that you feel and see, just not to know its 
really you that your tryin to be, its a person that was never around that had to be 
made from scratch, ingredients of beatings and blood flowing as your pattern to 
cut from..as it oozes out your veins all that left is the souless remains, we continue the walk 
then hit a bump in the road and those cards you hold from yesteryears gold, scatter 
and hit the ground, all that you hold dear doesnt have a reason or sound, just alot more 
questions of who you are‚Ä¶when in time you look so hard in the mirror that it just blurs in the 
colors that are gone from your face..so all that is left is a crater filled battlefield of scars,
so next time ask me again‚Ä¶do you know who you are? 
¬†
im outta here‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.have a great day‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.

OH well im outta here tryin to get back in the swing of writing‚Ä¶.when all we want to do is be good humans..sometimes just seems like more trouble then its worth‚Ä¶to try to guide people the right way to have them fight you because you are good ..and they arent used to that‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ill nver change to the evil again‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..ever‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.and to the ones that have a problem with god‚Ä¶.you shalt not leave without seeing the evil you put upon others‚Ä¶.just because you think you will live forever‚Ä¶.one day you will have to pay for all the bad you do unto others as we all will‚Ä¶.so keep writing that filth on here‚Ä¶.to the ones that use this as a therapy tool‚Ä¶.to bad your not to the level of conciousness that most are‚Ä¶.may god be with you at this moment‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.night‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..

excert from the dragon doesnt live here anymore: 
‚ÄúYour awareness of God is the healing you offer to your brethern. The light you see is a¬†gift given to be shared. What God gives to you belongs to you, and through you it belongs to all. Those who live the Truth can never lose it. If you feel diminished in rejection, you face only your learned insecurity. Do not expect to be accepted by those that see you as a part of an old world. When your faith gains the firmness of a rock, resistance can find no place in your experience. Stand for the Truth, and those that love Truth will stand by your side. Your creative words and simple deeds are shining stars in a dismal night. We charge you with glorifying the Truth in the world that hates the Truth, and we ask you to live for Love¬† in a world that flees from Light. You yourself have chosen this work, and we hail you for so commiting your acts. The days to come shall challenge you to your mettle, but through the Holy Spirit, that selfsame Spirit to Whom you have dedicated your life, you shall emerge unscathed. This is our dauntless promise to you. Go forth, Children of light, as did the origional diciples and as all who truly love God must do, and ignite the fire of Truth by living it. Be true to yourself, for only in such simple honesty is Peace confirmed. The light of the world shines through your faces and your hearts, and blesses through your hands. You are the song that I sing to the world‚Äù. 
To forgive is to transcend our lower nature and to release a force of Light that can heal the universe and purge it of all suffering. When we forgive anyone, including ‚Äî and especially‚Äìourselves, we are lifted up by the very thought of forgiveness to our highest angelic potential. Nothing can be more pleasing in the eyes of God. To love ourselves for our goodness is easy. To love ourselves, in spite of our errors, is downright HOLY. 
I read these two things in this book I have been reading and somehow these two things stuck out to me and I guess that even in the time of emotions and right and wrong we all get caught up in things that we cant really control. I have made some bad decisions as of late, and I could sit here and beat myself up about them, but as the support that I have been following I decided to pray and to read. I know that I am not perfect and things that happen arent always the right things or even intentional but may cause pain, I am sorry is all I can say..I have read that to love thyself is to be able to look into the mirror of wrong and still not let the doubts of a failed attempt at life and let it cripple you to the point of giving up. I dont know alot bout this stuff and learning as I go along, but seems like it gets to easy to hurt those you care bout so its always easier to stay away. I always think I am doing the right thing or read into it a wrong way and for some reason always gets twisted and wronged and someone gets hurt. I have come to a conclusion that instead of planning or doing things that enable others feelings or high expectations, I just will pass and spend the time alone. Im not playing victim or anything of the sort, just tired of feeling so bad when I didnt want to cause any harm and seemed that it all got twisted in communication. Thanks for the invite to your families day of thanks, I hope that you understand that I miss my family as well. The holidays are here and so many great things happening for the tight knitted units of the world, then there is the ones that sit and count the ticks for the festivities to be over. Just another constant reminder of yet another thing that isnt normal. I am feeling to good inside to feel negative so i will leave it at that. Well im off to read somemore, and then maybe write a little later journal, if cold is what it must be then the ice has yet to meet the sun..in this cloud filled day‚Ä¶of rays‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..*m*

Hey journal,
its eight fifty five in the am and I just got home awhile ago, I havent been able to write in awhile because of stuff that i have been feeling inside and then it vanishes, before i can bring it on here. I dont really feel to chatty right now but have some to say. I am about to get out of school and to start giving people the direction that we all need to follow, and in the addiction mindset of things‚Ä¶most dont want. if you have read my journal up to this entry you have seen a change in me that i doubted would ever come and in time, it has happend. I dont hang on to things any longer then i should these days‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..i let them go to somewhere i made for god to pick them up. I talk bout letting go now because i can actually feel it leaving me. I seem like im not in my body most of the time, I feel so serene and loved, makes me teary thinkin bout it. I just hope that I am emitting the same feeling that i feel on the inside of me. I know how to laugh now and how to enjoy a good cry, and dont mistake my niceness for weakness, i can still get in there with the best of em. I guess when you talk bout so much pain and stuff for so long‚Ä¶when that goes ‚Ä¶what do you talk bout? LOve.

hey journal,
Sup? not alot here just got home awhile ago and am really in the inspired type of mood. I finished reading the Notebook by nicolas sparks‚Ä¶it is so awesome. I strongly recommend it.It is the most influental love story i have ever read without the whole girl meets guy and bladablada‚Ä¶this is real and genuine because it has the god theory in the writings..LOve is a weird but sensational feeling when the heart starts to beat in purity and in a non human like control over it. In my previous writings there has been so much pain and suffering that it is hard to comprehend that love still is in my soul and in my heart but i tell you that in time it has been turned back on and now the flame that goes in my soul is one of pure and undying love, a flame that god fuels‚Ä¶a flame that my guardian angel protects from the evil that try to blow it out‚Ä¶I walk now in a light that is on constantly without the pressures of a racing mind ..the insecurities of a life that never was‚Ä¶but one that was able to be salvaged from the ruins of the past‚Ä¶dont tell me that it cant be done or that god doesnt exist‚Ä¶he only does not if you cant see beyond your own mortality to know that one day you wont be here on earth‚Ä¶then what? just fertalizer? or that thing that beats in you that is connected to your heart can live forever in a place that is lined with nothing but purity and love‚Ä¶pure love that we all seek in all things on this planet‚Ä¶but sometimes can never catch or look in the wrong places for‚Ä¶we see it in the eyes of the newborn that stares at us thru innocense‚Ä¶we see it in the children that play without prejudice or pain‚Ä¶we see it in the leaves that fall to the ground as another season begins‚Ä¶that is the truest form of love when a heart beats again after being shattered in the ruins of a human love gone bad‚Ä¶.we all want to call it quits and demand on our own will to free us from pain that we have received due to sin‚Ä¶it doesnt have to be that way.when the world seems cold and like you cant go on or dont know how to‚Ä¶call for your angel to lead you while you are down and out ‚Ä¶but leave your ears open to his words as you walk down that path of darkness to the light that he sends to protect you from the devil and his temptations ‚Ä¶we can save ourselves but its the unselfish thing to do is to pass along the gift that we have had since the beginning of time‚Ä¶.belief in the unseen and reap the benefits of true love and a calm heart‚Ä¶.from lookin above and givin him your soul and your love‚Ä¶in return for a calm serene life..Just think of all the ones you have loved but so easily forgotten after a new one came along‚Ä¶that wasnt love‚Ä¶that was disposal‚Ä¶..love doesnt end and it doesnt have a real start ‚Ä¶.it happens and you dont know where it started ‚Ä¶and when it ends if it is real‚Ä¶it stays with you forever‚Ä¶just so you dont mark it up and become the love martyr‚Ä¶but the passer of a feelin that if never felt‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶is so incredible‚Ä¶and this doesnt have to do with another human being yall‚Ä¶.love is in the grass in the birds chirp‚Ä¶.as the dogs run in the park‚Ä¶true love is living today without the worries of tommorow stealing the goodness of calm thought. i dont know all the answers‚Ä¶all i know is that god is great when that direction you choose is his‚Ä¶and not the path that weakens you‚Ä¶but makes you strong as the angel leads the way‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶so the next time you feel down and out‚Ä¶and all alone‚Ä¶listen to that inner voice and call for gods help and a angel to carry you as you are down‚Ä¶.cause in time you will walk again and love again without the attachments of expectations ‚Ä¶but the benefits of total unconditional gratification‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.til we see each other again my friend‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..take care of your smile and always keep your heart clean‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..without a heart the soul has no connection to goodness:) ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.martin

¬ìOne day I will wipe away every tear from your eyes‚Ä¶‚Ä¶and I¬íll take away all the pain you have suffered on this earth‚Äù 
The death of Jesus enabled the entire world to come back home to God. This was the Father¬ís plan from the beginning¬Öto be reconciled to us and to restore all that had been lost as a result of man¬ís fall in the Garden of Eden. 
Through the work of the cross, we now can come to the Father in Jesus, through Jesus, and by Jesus. We are not His slaves, but His sons. The curtain that once separated us from a Holy God has been torn in two from the top down. We are no longer His enemies, but have an open invitation to become His children! Many people think that Jesus is the buffer between us and God. Many believe that Jesus is even shielding us from His Father¬ís wrath. The truth is that it was the Father who sent Jesus to the world in the first place so that we might be fully reconciled to His heart. And Jesus came willingly in order that He might provide the way for us to come home to His Father (John 14:6). 
If we have believed in Jesus Christ and accepted His gift of salvation, we can be assured that we are fully reconciled to our Father. 
¬†¬†PRAYER
Father I thank You that Jesus made a way for me to be fully reconciled with You. As a wayward child makes the journey home, today I return into Your loving arms of acceptance and restoration. This is where I belong and this is where I was destined to dwell all the days of my life. In the name of Your beloved son Jesus I pray, AMEN. 
The apple of the Father¬ís eye was His one and only Son. Jesus was the only begotten of the Father¬î and laid upon His breast from the beginning of all things (John 1:18). The Father lived to please the Son, and the Son lived to please the Father. Nothing could ever separate them from the love they had for each other.¬†Yet there came a time when they were indeed separated. 
The beloved Son of God left the safety of heaven and His Father‚Äôs right side to take on the form of a helpless little baby. While there was now a physical separation from His Father, they still remained one in heart and in spirit. Then the unthinkable happened. The pure Son of God who knew no sin, voluntarily took upon Himself the cumulative sin of the entire world. In the darkest moment in all of history, Jesus bore the weight of humanities¬í ugliness.¬† 
Since sin cannot dwell in the presence of a holy God, the beloved Father had no choice but to turn away from His beloved Son. Jesus¬í response to His Father was the agonizing cry ¬ìMy God, why have you forsaken me?¬î Their unity was broken for the first time and the Father was left to watch His son die alone on a cross. Father God gave up all that He loved in order to gain our love. If He did not spare His dearest treasure in order to win our freedom, how much more is He willing to graciously give us all things? ¬†¬†¬† Father I,¬†thank You for loving to celebrate when a lost child comes home. I was once one of these lost children and you cared enough to throw me a party upon my return home. Help me to feel your heart for each prodigal who returns home so that I can join in their party! In the name of Your beloved Son, Jesus, I pray. AMEN.Father, I know You are in control of the world even when I feel that my life is out of control. Help me to trust in Your incredible ability to care for each detail of my life. Thank You for taking the time to count all the hairs on my head! I know You love me, and I believe that my worth to You is of greater value than many sparrows. I pray that the reality of this truth will seep deeper into my heart today. In the name of your beloved Son, Jesus, I pray. AmenFather I know that You are not willing that one of Your offspring should perish. Help me to see people through Your eyes.¬† Help me to feel Your pain for all of the lost children who still haven¬ít found their way home. Please give me Your heart for Your wayward offspring, and help me to be an ambassador of Your love, not judging people, but simply calling them home to their original purpose. In the name of your beloved Son, Jesus, I pray. Amen.
>Father, I thank You for choosing me to be part of Your family. I thank You that I am accepted and predestined to be Your child, a co-heir with Jesus according to Your wonderful plan. Help me to fulfill the special purpose that was determined especially for me on Your glorious team! In the name of Your beloved Son Jesus, I pray. AMEN.Father, I thank You that Your eyes saw my unformed body when You made me in the secret place. Thank You that I have a special purpose in life and that all my days are written in Your book. Help me to always remember that it was You who planned my creation and not my parents. You wanted me to come into this world, and you have planned each day that I live. In the name of Your beloved Son, Jesus, I pray. AMEN.</DI< body

Your New Relationship With GodAs you begin your new life as God‚Äôs child, you will have the privilege of getting to know Him as your Father. You are now part of His incredible family! By faith in Jesus Christ, you can be assured of the following truths‚Ä¶
 
1.You Are God‚Äôs Child ‚Äì John 1:12-13‚ÄúYet to all who received him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God ‚Äì children born not of natural descent, nor of human decision or a husband‚Äôs will, but born of God. (NIV Bible)
2. God Loves You ‚Äì 1 John 3:1How great is the love the Father has lavished on us, that we should be called the children of God! And that is what we are! (NIV Bible)
3. You Have The Assurance Of Eternal Life ‚Äì John 3:16For God so loved the world, that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. (NIV Bible)
4. He Put His Holy Spirit In You ‚Äì 2 Corinthians 1:21-21‚ÄúNow it is God who makes both us and you stand firm in Christ. He anointed us, set his seal of ownership on us, and put his Spirit in our hearts as a deposit guaranteeing what is to come. 
5. You Can Talk Directly To God ‚Äì Matthew 7:7-11 ‚ÄúAsk and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives; he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks, the door will be opened. Which of you, if his son asks for bread, will give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a snake? If you, then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask him!‚Äù (NIV Bible)
6. Nothing Will Ever Separate You From His Love ‚Äì Romans 8:38‚ÄúFor I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
¬†I am sitting here thinking of all that i have read on gods love and his forgiveness and things of that nature and at times it is just hard to get your mind to stop wandering and the calmness to really come across your soul. I dont really understand alot of it and I am sittin here edgy and feel like im crawling in my skin at this moment even though i want to think the right things and believe the right things it is just so hard at times when ever the things that you are supposed to believe in are at the hands of other people and their projections upon you arent the greatest things in the world. I went to see my mother yesterday and the visit was really bad because I couldnt stop long enough to think of anyone but me. I am like a wigged out junkie right now cause all my emotions are so heightened and in the same sort kinda numb or at least i want them to be. I am just having so many thoughts and i hate whenever i feel like this. I look in the mirror and want a avenue to slow down these things and it doesnt happen. I feel like im dying of thirst and im sooo tired but unable to sleep comfortably and just wired for sound. I hope that you enjoy the blessings that i am passing on to you ‚Ä¶even though i am racing in my head‚Ä¶.there is calmness in this world i promise you that‚Ä¶.i just need sleep and need to delete some people out of my circle of life‚Ä¶‚Ä¶well god bless you and laterzzzzzzzz‚Ä¶.martin

song: are you happy now? by michelle branch
Hey journal,
if your wondering why the song on there..well i broke into the internet thingy and just had to use that one. I am at work and dont know if this is being monitored or not but I really dont care at this point. I am sick and have alot of things going thru my head and had to get on here and write bout it. I was wondering as i was cleaning about love and all that it brings‚Ä¶and a question came up‚Ä¶I was thinking that if we are truly in gods world and stuff why when we try to help others or people of less fortunate statures that it seems like our goodness never gets in and in many instances that seems to be just a waste. if we are to love everyone and turn them on to god and his goodness why is it that we often feel like failures in doing this because it never seems that it works and there is alot of negative fighting against you. its like when you take three forward steps in gaining ground on the devil he always steps in and deminishes all the goodness you supply the less fortunate. oh well food for thought ..i gotta get off here cause i dont know if it is monitored or not‚Ä¶.so later‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.martin

hey journal,
Its been forever since i really sat down and wrote bout martin. I have been in a whirlwind of things in my life, trying to finish school, get my practicum started and keep moving forward in the mist of being nocturnal in my job and lifestyle.I just finished cleaning the kitchen here at work and even though its a tedious monatanous job someone has to do it. I live on a daily basis of not chaos and question but of a weird kind of mindset. Its like i dont fret on things like i once did and in not doing so it seems like i am somehow disconnected from life. I miss being dysfunctional sometimes‚Ä¶it was kinda fun because i could always use dumb excuses for my actions and kinda front on the moment but all the while i was crying for sanity and serenity. its funny that what you ask for comes in so many degrees. It is christmas time and even though im not really bah humbugging it, I still have to work and not have the chance to see my brother whom lives in san angelo.I have things straight as far as school is concerned it is just set up tenatevely. LOVE that is the statement of all these entrys my eternal quest to feel that with no fear and no holdups. well i have been allowing that emotion to filter thru my jaded heart. I may not be in chaos or miserble as i once was‚Ä¶sometimes it is to calm to understand exactly what i am supposed to be doing with all this goodness, I have been trying to help people turn on to god and his greatness but like my last entry stated it is a battle of upmost preportion.In which most of you can and should understand thru my entries in the beginning. I didnt want to change or was ready for it . i didnt care bout martin or his insides or his will to be a part of the world again. I am still on the bubble even though i dont fear as much anymore. i guess since i got it and seem on a different spectrum i expect others to get it as well, even if they dont want it yet.In gods time i guess. I just hate the thought of people that you care bout not gettin it and then suddenly something tragic happening to them and they die and go to hell unsaved. why do we not get to save them thru our faith in the lord? I just think as long as i pray and have faith it is enuff but as in all things its better to give then to receive. the difference in me today is that i dont care if it comes back my way i get so much good stuff that i have to give it away. Like that clay walker song that in it the lady has a flat and then clay changes it for her, she offers money he denies, she goes to the diner the waitress is pregnant and the lady all she has is a hundred and leaves it and that is clay walkers wife‚Ä¶..the circle of goodness is complete. That is kewl and all but what happens when you are fighting the devil and his stuff that has been in that circle for so long, doesnt gods love conquer all?its like a fight that is brought to you that you dont want to lose. most of my life i have been faced with these fights and i tryed and when i couldnt i walked away‚Ä¶now i cant walk away and sit and fight with all i have and all im worth‚Ä¶‚Ä¶to thy own heart be true‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.one day the clouds will cease and the sun shall shine‚Ä¶..then you will rejoice in the light of the sun ‚Ä¶..jesus loves us all‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.
¬†
today as i was walkin down the street
i saw a boy with hardend eyes, i tryed 
to help him but he couldnt even try,
he wanted it easy with no effort from him,
then i asked‚Ä¶do you know the lord? 
he stated‚Äù oh yeah‚Äù he hurts me all the time
i said how can you say that is the lord 
when he doesnt dabble in pain, but erases 
the blemishes from our hearts and makes us
pure with eyes as clear as the rain from the sky,
and souls as shiny as the brightest ray of the sun,
as i was talkin the boy started to cry, and he 
said is this true? can he make all that is dark
turn to light and make it new again? I told him 
yes indeed, the lord has the power to lead and
to make it all new again, with our hearts we can 
start the journey and our minds we let it go,
thats when the greatness starts to overflow into our
veins, and we feel the rush of the darkness subsidingi,
the miracle happens as we blink our eyes, and as the darkness
was there now all we have is sunshine tides‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶god bless you little boy with the hardend eyes‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.hit your knees and pray to the sky‚Ä¶.for the lord gives us all the rain to cleanse even the darkest lost souls‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶to your eyes you will see a new you‚Ä¶.just have faith in god because he does in you‚Ä¶.:) love yourself little one‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶i will help you if you truly want the miracle of life to come into your heart mind and soul‚Ä¶‚Ä¶to erase the darkened troll‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
Hope you enjoyed that I just thought it up as i was writing‚Ä¶..well im gone for now ‚Ä¶.but remember martin is not hardend anymore‚Ä¶just trying to understand what to do with all his blessings‚Ä¶.Merry Christmas the lord has come‚Ä¶.:) 
martin‚Ä¶.= )

Hey journal,
I dont know if that is really the correct name of the song but that is the basic rythm to it. I sometimes think that I have every idea who I am then boom! Im clueless again. I thought all this would end at puberty and somehow disappear. I guess im a eternal dreamer for all the things that have to have a place in my life and purpose, if they dont it makes me uneasy and want to place them in a catagory even if they dont fit. when you mix apples and oranges you know what happens‚Ä¶..you get a mess. I am a control freak and i know that about myself. If it isnt like i think it should be i do my damndest to make it like i think it should be like or what is the best for all involved. that is all i am thinkin bout‚Ä¶im sure this will get deleted ‚Ä¶.so later‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.

hey journal,
I just finished a slice of pizza and sitting round the house thinking.I have been in the house all day and man its killing my insides. I am listening to that song because of all the things that song helped me thru. I have been on a journy of self discovery for almost seven months and one thing that i still cant kick. that is patience and letting go at the right time.The song is talkin bout a girl, well in my previous entrys i have touched on that topic and for the most part was never clear on alot of things concerning my ex‚Äôs. I dont sit around and live in the past about them but at times their memories stir and naustalgia kicks in. I definately need friends in this area and cant wait til it warms up because I will be able to be outside alot more. I sat around today and watched football and just a blah day. I miss people but want to be in this house alone isnt that weird? agoraphobia at its finest. I think im crazy most of the time. I am a shuffling back and forth mentality of desire and reality. I want what i cant have and what i can i dont mix well with it and therefore dont appreciate it til its to late. well that is the 411 of my relationships‚Ä¶i thought that if i fixed martin that to would shorten the bridge between complacency and insanity of the mind. well, for the most part all that has happend is im gettin out of school and starting on the next level of my job blada blada‚Ä¶.you know i should be more excited‚Ä¶but im not really ‚Ä¶.its like ok now what‚Ä¶.more hours‚Ä¶.okay. I have a thing inside me that has been programmed to be short term and to give as much as i can at that moment and never was programmed for the long duration of the marathon. I guess that is why i havent been married..or even close. I dont think i really want to get married or have kids‚Ä¶at times then i do‚Ä¶goodness such a back and forth battle of will over what will be. is it natural to feel a battle of your own will and the forces that be. i am appreciative of all that has been brought to my foreground and the sanity i experience on most days‚Ä¶but the constant mind juggling effect that goes on in my head kills me. I cant just see things for what they are‚Ä¶.if they are calm i want to speed them up‚Ä¶or if they are fast and chaotic i want to slow them down. I never see it for what it is i guess‚Ä¶.scared that it wont be what i made up in my mind i guess. alot of people think im a great person, but one person didnt and he ruined it i think for the rest of my life no matter how much people tell me otherwise..i still hear those words those feelings when what i really want at the time doesnt happen ‚Ä¶its like a slap in the face‚Ä¶.ugh do we ever get satisfied in our own skins? shit ‚Ä¶.its like a crawling worm that eats at your soul when it is the richest‚Ä¶sleep hurts me‚Ä¶i dream to much‚Ä¶the past creeps and everything is okay in my dreamland then i wake up and im here‚Ä¶..somewhere caught in between yesteryear and tommorow‚Ä¶.sad for the people i miss the most‚Ä¶and tryin to find peace in the fact that we all lose special people in our lives‚Ä¶.i can pray i can read i can hear others‚Ä¶.but in my mind a silent hell rages on and i run to the seclusion of my hearing to rid the pain of the unknown uncontrollable requiem of life. to the drug addict that is always jonesing‚Ä¶well that is my life‚Ä¶always jonesing while the concensus says that peace is slow a different life‚Ä¶.i lived life so messed up so long‚Ä¶and im sick of using that phrase‚Ä¶im sick of it‚Ä¶oh well my life sucked now what‚Ä¶why does the feeling never rid itself? all the good stuff in my world‚Ä¶.where i seem to want to dwell in the unhappy and choas of the ones that arent happy and well‚Ä¶the addicts the alcoholics‚Ä¶the insane‚Ä¶i feel at home here‚Ä¶.does it make me one? a fine line between greatness and insanity they say‚Ä¶why do i always seem to stray to the one that isnt great‚Ä¶.but in my mind‚Ä¶its frozen in calmness while my brain burns a million thoughts a second‚Ä¶.so god‚Ä¶.i am today as i have been without the bandaid to hide my wounds as they seep today‚Ä¶‚Ä¶please help me make it one moment at a time‚Ä¶to achieve the sanity that most have naturally‚Ä¶as i sink further in this field all the physcho babble gets me so torn inside‚Ä¶the good the recover the right and the wrong..the simplicity‚Ä¶while the part of me that isnt in that‚Ä¶.just exists‚Ä¶.where does life begin where we can know stuff‚Ä¶and still live without it consuming our every being‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶later journal‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶in the words of creativeness‚Ä¶.do we ever learn to thy own will be done unless we wake up and its already done? the wait kills the eternal soul‚Ä¶..peace and god bless my mind to slow down today‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.goin to clean or something to make it stop i cant sleep ‚Ä¶only hurts when i dream‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶martin

I am fixin to start counting pills here at good ol sante‚Äô I dont hate being here tonight as much because i have kinda tuned my mind out to all that goes on here and not be so indulged in the ‚Äúno no no‚Äù that goes on here. oh well, I miss my journal and feel like i have neglected it somehow because for the most part i write in it and just doesnt seem as fun anymore because all the mess isnt in my life as much. so i kinda have to struggle to find a topic to write about. my life isnt that exciting because i work alot and sleep alot so there isnt much time for much else‚Ä¶‚Ä¶song check‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Jewel :intuition‚Ä¶‚Ä¶theres another good one. my neck has been killin me for days or weeks now‚Ä¶.i guess stress does get deep rooted if ya let it.

hey journal,
I thought i would come back and write something that really ment something to me because the obsessive compulsive individual that i am. This song just gets to me so much. As you can probly tell I listen to alot of music and the thinker that I am I disect it. I have some friends that tell me Martin dont think so much‚Ä¶just let it be as it is. Well, tell that to the ones that always were striving for that extra advantage to the mediocre chap in this thing we call life. I want to be famous one day for inventing or finding a reason for something great. I am happy with who I am for the first time in my life but I just feel that this journey has been the way it has to prepare me for the hardest times¬† yet ahead. I want to talk bout something I have been thinking about. I was remembering a time in my life when I didnt know how to just be me. I have spent so many years re-inventing myself that i got lost in the chameoleon effect of my life.I had to turn the music off because the devil was messing with the connection speed of this internet service. I just dont¬† understand why when you are feeling good about yourself that the satanic presense always has to be strongest. I have testified to people¬† my story and of course if you are reading this surely you have read other things in my journal that have told you a little bit about me. well i will come back and edit this and add more to it‚Ä¶.later this connection at work is sucky‚Ä¶later haters..! martin

¬†
hey journal,
whats goin on today? I just woke up not long ago and for the most part dont feel to talkative and energetic but there is nothing wrong with me at all. I was just thinking about this song, if you havent heard it then download it its a great song. The part of sittin for hours listening to the rain‚Ä¶i used to do that in san angelo, just sit in the rain and think man, this is some good stuff‚Ä¶watchin it trickle down your nose and off your body and know‚Ä¶god must be tired of the dirt and cleaning his house. I love rain and can live without the dreary days though, they just make ya sad. Im not sad though not really any emotional state today. I slept a long time and just kinda vegging..it feels damn good. I will probly write a letter to my mom and clean some more.Next week im gonna pull up the carpet in my room and lay some new floor down. I got a call this morning from a counceling center here in denton and they are gonna see if they can fit me in to do my practicum and then possibly my internship there. I was so excited and happy bout that. I dont seem to really slow down enough to enjoy the small things lately and somehow gotten swept away in the goodness of life. I worry bout living , and living well now‚Ä¶i used to not care how i lived and lived for the moment. I was told i was imature the other day and it really hurt. But you know what journal, I dont give a damn really cause people can say what they want to me and for the most part‚Ä¶doesnt matter to me anymore. I am so numb to the bad stuff it just washes away from me as soon as the rain hits it. In time the rain cleanses your soul and leaves the body full of vibrance and closure. I think that things do happen for a reason and you cant make people in your life what you think they should be because they will just come back and hurt you in the end‚Ä¶i had a good friend call me last night and tell me that one of our other friends went off on him, and that he acted as if we were all never good friends. I tell ya we all went out of our way to help this guy and boom that is how he wants to come back on us after all this time? that is just life aint it? nothing to do with the devil at the moment or the lack of parental care or none of that pyshco babble stuff i read everyday..it is just someone in life being really shitty. I wish i could take a vacation and just go back there for a bit to square somethings away that i left unfinished when i moved here to denton. I have some avenues that i should have not left so wide open and unfinished. I have a friend in kentucky¬† that in the beginning of this journal i mentioned and havent since cause they got mad at the thought of the world reading bout them. well, bad choices tend to lead us all back to the moment in time we never rid our minds of‚Ä¶this person was my best friend for along time and then we had a fallout and lost touch and after that only sporadically talked again. Anger and resentment just haunt the soul doesnt it? I feel anger on rare occasion now and when i should i somehow just want to walk away and say fuck it..i dont want any of this mess.I have been living life so fast its just that in the last week it has slowed down for me again.I have missed this sooo much. I dont have to worry or procrastinate bout the inevidable. I dance to that beat of a different drummer, for certain. if it all comes unraveled so what? in life we lose to make us aware that we only had control in the vision we thought we had of the situation. You know i just thought of something. I dont have to be vocal bout gods word and how his will is guiding me on a daily basis to anyone but martin, and just cause i dont talk bout it or seem different there is nothing wrong with me other then tired of analyzing life so much. IT IS whaT it is‚Ä¶.nothing more. Face value tells you alot about situations and people. its our own perception that makes these into things that they arent. if you have a bad feeling bout something‚Ä¶well hell more then likely it is bad. It never lies and your heart never is that off. its fighting the inevidable that gets us all in trouble. we fight thinkin we can change things‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..where they will always go back to what they know or how they deal. if you read this read it with a open mind and if you cant then stop reading my stuff plz‚Ä¶because it is not full of anything other then things i cant say to people or want to. it doesnt make me a bad person or a person to beaware of‚Ä¶if people think that then‚Ä¶.well deal with it how you will‚Ä¶.i wish i had my honda loaded down and fifteen pair of shoes and that american express‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..i need some waves‚Ä¶‚Ä¶~~~~~~~~~~~ to rinse away the rain‚Ä¶:) if people would truly see me for the person that is deeper then the therapist deeper then the nice guy‚Ä¶deeper then the funny person‚Ä¶.deep enough to find that heart in my chest you would see it still has some bricks around it and those are the deepest rooted and for the life of me i dont know how they got so in place so thickly‚Ä¶.oh well, is it normal to want to spend so much time alone and let people in in increments? i dont think so but that is something that always pops up in my head‚Ä¶.and just tryin to deal with that‚Ä¶:) so i hope journal you have a great day and god please rinse my soul today and clinse the world from all its inperfections and fears‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶we all need you‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶LAter

hey journal,
whats up? not alot here just been praying off and on tonight and listening to the rain hit the street and the roof as it trickles down and finds some emotions in my mind that cant keep away from the drops as they roll down my face. I had a rough day today and got some insultive words thrown my way that really didnt make me feel good at all. I feel like all that i used to know just doesnt come as easily and at times i stammer over my words. I miss the easyness of rivercrest and its patients and councelors and staff. I am surrounded by uncaring money hungry people here. I used to think at times at rivercrest did we ever do any good for them? Now looking back i say yes we did a lot of good in the short time those folks were with us.I wonder if the longer i wait the less i will want to do this. It isnt supposed to take a act of congress to get this done ‚Ä¶sheesh. I feel like the people that are supposed to meet me halfway are droppin the damn ball and fumbling over time. I dont know what im gonna do, i just think about it daily . i turned in my hours for this past week and faxed them to my teacher but who knows how much of those hours i will actually get credit for. Hell the way im feeling right now, all i want to do is sleep. I hate cloudy rainy days‚Ä¶makes for a terrible lake in the trunk in my car. I hang on to the branch as it swings in the wind, but who knows how much more the branch can take before it to breaks and succombs to the nature of things.Im not tryin to sound negative in the least just so confused right now that i dont know what to do bout this‚Ä¶having unfinished or unstarted buisness floating in the air is one of my biggest pet peeves.I also have income tax coming up and you know that is when poor relatives hit you up for money especially if they know you are gettin a good return. I want to run away and hide in the alps and come down in a couple of years when all seems clear‚Ä¶and the dust no longer lingers in my lungs.I came to work tonight with a clean sense of redemption and it slowly takes the life out of you to read all that you dont have the energy to become a part of. I have regretted ever walking out of rivercrest that day in 2002 ..a moment that has haunted me to this day. I loved my job there..what was I thinking? what stand was worth where i am today? lookin back on the past isnt healthy but it is five am and some self gloating in my cereal sounds okay to me‚Ä¶i dont know if i have the patience ot gumption to continue on this quest‚Ä¶of having to work here at sante while i find a practicum site. I HATE NIGHT WORK. I cant do it anymore and I really realize that I have experience as a cna or something of that nature i think i will start to look for that type of work as well‚Ä¶to find a place to get $$$ and then do my practicum and not be tainted with a bad taste in my mouth for what the awful places i have visited or worked at to leave a bland taste in my mouth about the career choice i plan on going into. I dont really know what to do or say‚Ä¶.I just am lost and think i will go home and crawl up in my blankie and call it a day‚Ä¶..get up go to a movie and then go home again and sleep. I hate the thought i may be letting this get me but for some reason it hasnt been to friendly to me and those voices are strong‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶later ya‚Äôll catch u when the sun shines‚Ä¶again‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..martin

hey journal,
I am sitting here listening to songs from my youth and thought man what a time that was. I remember that rebellion and non conformity ruled.People think that times have deteriotated and such well, it has always been this way. Fear drives the driven insane‚Ä¶and therefore causes you to think that all you need is gasoline to fuel the anger from within!~..I still revert back to those times in the times of insecurity and times of uncontrollable denial of the situation.I am listening to this other song that was very popular to me called In a darkened roomby the same band‚Ä¶well the name tells it all‚Ä¶to feel like you are trapped in a room without light of anykind and scared to death to move because of the unknown‚Ä¶.quicksand jesus‚Ä¶well, all these songs used to get my by because they somehow told me in my head that it was okay to feel ‚Äù on the outside‚Äù of the circle of life and to live it on my terms no matter the extremity of life i thought was revelant to survival. I have always known god and in various increments sat and cried waiting for him to appear and listen and answer my prayers like asking a magical jeannie to do so. He was always there and kept me strong and for the most part all that slow time I never understood was happiness. one verse to this song ..goes ‚Äù forgive me father for i know not what i do‚Ä¶how can i keep the hurt inside that i know is true‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶beyond the reach of gods faith lies the wounded the shattered remains of life betrayed‚Ä¶.the fear of running into you keeps me feared in this darkened room*‚Ä¶I never knew how deep this song was.., but i know i loved it and played it nonstop for a clue to see what life was supposed to teach me in the times when i was wandering the streets alone with nothing but anger in my soul. I never knew how to love , how to care, and in the midst of all this time‚Ä¶didnt really care one way or the other. My mind felt so numb to the feelings of others and the craving to know god was there even in the earliest times‚Ä¶ but i felt that if i let him in then i would have to give up my ‚Äúfun‚Äù. well, I lived for fun and chaos and thought that was life at its finest, while i cried on the inside to let the boy breathe and exhale from all the flames and ice that gathered in the darkest trenches of my wounded soul.I always wondered why am i so intriqued by things that are on the outside of happiness and tranquility? the sadder or more intense it was the more i wanted to conquer and win at it. I loved football for this reason.I played on a mediocre team where i quickly became a star. I have never wanted to walk among the living or even really appreciate their naivete‚Äô . this book i was reading spoke of our self centeredness and how we all act is if we own earth, well we are visitors here, the true home is yet to be seen. I understand now that in order to obtain that visa back there, i need to quit being so rebellious and worrisome that i dont fit in here. WHO cares really? its a walk in the park, a stroll thru the windless aura of desire,all things lead to god‚Ä¶we live for him ..he doesnt need us only to love us and to show us that this is temporary and the time we spend acting as if we need to make a stake in this place humors me now..after readin some things‚Ä¶all the time we say..‚Äù i have time for god‚Äù but we really dont make that time..to busy with the monotanous goal setting we have placed for ourselves. If you have the time to sin..you should have the time to ask for his love and forgiveness. I am still learning on this book but for the most part, it states that we are preoccupied with more then we need to be. Humans are humans‚Ä¶.all the stupid things we stress over is amazing‚Ä¶when god gives us all we need‚Ä¶.and what do we do? never thank him for the good stuff he allows us to receive in his name‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..its all bout what we think we have accomplished.I live in the moment of humanity right now and want to plant the seed of god‚Ä¶ask yourself this question..if i died today at this moment..what home will i go to in place of this tent i have used all these years? will you go to heaven or hell‚Ä¶.that is the only two options‚Ä¶have you lived life as if you are ready for eternity? do you do it daily? it doesnt matter that your a sweet great person‚Ä¶.without praise , love, hope and faith in god‚Ä¶.you do nothing that really matters on this earth. all the money cant get you in‚Ä¶all the beggin cant get you in‚Ä¶.we die daily without knowing it‚Ä¶i think that its time we all measure what the true importance of life is‚Ä¶we can be a part of the earth..to worship god..but dont let that confuse you with being for the earth‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..we arent perfect and we sin‚Ä¶but its okay as long as you have the shield of god protecting your heart and soul. well, take care of the time you have today‚Ä¶.dont fear death iit is inevitable‚Ä¶.and just think this is the airport for now as we wait on the plane of eternity to carry us away‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶what will you pack while you are getting ready for that plane? and not everyone gets on board‚Ä¶so be cautious of what you do while you are getting ready‚Ä¶..cause what you do now‚Ä¶its a reflection of how you will act when you arrive to your destination‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.if you arent ready you wont board the plane‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶so pack light and love god‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.:‚Äùmartin‚Äù

mood: spiritially delicious
song: I could sing of your love forever by Mercy Me
Hey journal,
whats up? as you can tell by the title i have alot of thinking goin on. I believe that i have been climbing up on that cross for the last couple of weeks and playing the martyr. It is so funny that that name has a former nickname i used to go under‚Äùmarty‚Äù kinda fits at times tho. I want to climb on the cross and die a million deaths for all mankind when things arent goin good or fast enough for me. I have to manifest events in my life to match the sadness in my heart at the time. I forget how i got to the salvation or even rediscovered god again. He never left me and i walked on him for a long period in my life. While all the time, he was whispering to me‚Ä¶..Martin Martin‚Ä¶.im here quit being so stubborn and let me in. I tend to want to take on everyone elses pain and suffereing when it just overflows into my own life‚Ä¶and i go and hide to shed the added skin i take on. I have to get better at not takin things so personal and tryin to fix it because we all knows only god can do that thru his son jesus christ. I know that alot of people hate the thought of god existing or even being the cure to all their ills, because after all we were taught as kids not to believe in ghosts‚Ä¶and to many he is a ghost that we are supposed to give our lives over to and have faith that he will fix our lives‚Ä¶but listen up ‚Ä¶he is a ghost a spiritial ghost the holy ghost, that can unchain you from your turmoil your pain your suffering, its your own self gradification of the devils plan for you that keeps you in the dark, I can say this cause for a long time as you have read probly in this jrnl that i to lived in that dark, and played the victim and stated that god dont love me or care. If he did he wouldnt let bad things happen to me, or that i would never feel hurt‚Ä¶but i had to realize that is what heaven is for‚Ä¶a journey of pain and suffering to be prepared for the eternal love and greatness of eternity. He doesnt make it so bad we cant take it here, but the devil is rampent in everyone and everything. If you had issues as a child and never resolved them‚Ä¶the devil is in your kids..showing you your life day by day‚Ä¶.if you bought your kids love, he is in the money that they use for their drugs‚Ä¶that is your love that is being tossed into the wind, if you were to protective and claimed it in the name of true love‚Ä¶it is in the rebelious teen that is pregnant with no father for her child‚Ä¶that is the devil showing you look ‚Ä¶.all that you think is good or that your doing good on this earth‚Ä¶can come back to make you hate god because of the outcome of these events. When we go without god into the field of our lives‚Ä¶we are out there without the shield to protect us from satan and all his temptations and evil. Imagine life without pain, life with true love and no more longing, just knowing. Knowing that you are loved already, you are where you should be, and no time is it to late to start anew. This planet is temporary and will die off as all things do. Will you be in heaven as this happens or remain in your daily hell? unbreak those chains and let the tears of the king cleanse you. Let his love fill your heart of hope and strength. I can only speak on what i have witnessed, this is not superstiion or myth. This is real and remember we all sin, we all fall, and like to live but its the overall picture of our life and its foundation that matters. You want to stand be4 god and be smiling in the sense you know and feel his love on earth..so that when you get be4 him it will only be so much more intense. we get caught up in bills, stress of living, and the bog down of my messed up life, but remember. you stay there because you are trying to run it. Its a struggle because your not living in his life that he has planned for you. Your life has already been written and like a blind person lookin for the curb with the walkin stick‚Ä¶you keep goin into the gutter because your not listening to the beepin sound that is teelling you to walk a little to the left‚Ä¶.our own self will and stubborness keeps us where we are off gods page. It keeps you in the question of the world and satans grasp. I testify the key for god‚Ä¶his son jesus christ. Break those chains..and start to enjoy the life you were trully supposed to have. let the past end in the past‚Ä¶.its gone we cant be that age again when pain happend‚Ä¶.we can heal slowly and then let god finish up the wound to never break again‚Ä¶we cant¬† live in tommorow its not here yet‚Ä¶so why worry bout it‚Ä¶.we cant live our lives for our kids‚Ä¶they grow up in gods book or they dont and then when they leave then if we dont know us‚Ä¶then we feel even more empty and lost‚Ä¶find yourself thru god im saying. he has the answer to that burning question you have been asking yourself all these years‚Ä¶‚Ä¶alll that pain all those doubts‚Ä¶.he has the answer‚Ä¶swallow your pride and ask him to come down in your head to get to know him better..put on the headphones to gods station of love and forgiveness and enjoy the station to heaven‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶you should know the only purpose we have is to get a soul from the devils grasp and on to god‚Ä¶.for the love the glory and the better well being of humanity‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.god bless you all‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.may you find him today‚Ä¶if you want i can help you ‚Ä¶here is a webpage that states somethings‚Ä¶www.fathersloveletter.com‚Ä¶but you have to have a open mind and forget all you have been programmed to know‚Ä¶.about god..he is no religion he is not a mean god‚Ä¶.he is caring and full of love..just waitin for you to start enjoyin it thru him‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.god bless you all‚Ä¶.may love be with you

song: living and living well by George Strait
Hey journal,
whats up? not alot just sitting here at work in deep thought bout nothing and everything all at once. I have the ability to think about the future the present and the past‚Ä¶all in one. I had a good week because I kinda slept and had time to me and also made some time to spend with britt when we both werent sleeping. I got a new game that just became a addiction in itself. I love it. I guess the title of this just kinda speaks the insanity that I have been lookin at my life thru lenseless glasses. I have a lot of energy to think and see stuff that isnt there or is and I have trouble focusing on it because it is something i have either ..A. have never seen or experienced or B. just by the signs and thru thourough examination come up to a conclusion on my own self analyzing. I have not thought bout addiction, right and wrong, and or if Im doin either right. I have just been my life catch up with my work I have done on getting to this point of my life. I have just been preparing preparing,,,, and not living. Just still livin in the fear of what¬† if‚Äôs and the commitees of stupidity thinking that goes on in my brain. I have been blessed so much¬† that I have just been so cautious that I have been in a corner I have backed myself into because I want to keep this and have been scared to venture outside of this glass house that i still live in‚Ä¶.it just doesnt have a glass ceiling anymore.I feel good because I dont have to have the pressure of failing or not knowing what im goin to school for. If i fail i fail, if i succeed i do, IM tired of being so analytical in my life and not having any emotion or living at all. I have been living but not well at ALL. To possess good, you must enjoy and get out and get some dirt on it to understand the lesson behind to STay out of the mud puddles, so next time when you get that urge‚Ä¶.you wear your old dirty pair ‚Ä¶instead of that new pair you ruined before‚Ä¶hahaha‚Ä¶.life is about laughing and loving your life not dreading you will mess up or not be loved or appreciated. Most of my life I have lived this cycle and fight it so much but i wind up sooo tightly that I have to totally isolate to defrag‚Ä¶and sleep. I love all the things i have in my life now and wouldnt trade them for the world‚Ä¶I just understand now that I can be who i want to be and dont have to live up to anyones expectations, but you know‚Ä¶? sometimes martins are so high up there and i have the compulsion to win at all costs that i exasperate myself even after i have won‚Ä¶.insanity of the heart. Mine beats so hard and fast that it was a miracle when i was born it had¬† a hole in it at all. must have been the intensity that god made me with. I came out early‚Ä¶.and have never been good at waiting since‚Ä¶lol. Today I am good..and tommorow i may have a breakdown, who the heck knows but its this moment of sanity that makes the whole journey worth while. I dont have to be so hard on martin‚Ä¶but its hard to love yourself all the time every day every moment, especially when you have tried to hard to succeed all your life. I have been held out of all that is simple to most and have gotten thru perserverance and unpatience and element of suprise. True addict form‚Ä¶of disfunction. I am human and i will sin‚Ä¶.oh well does god still love me? well of course and i dont abuse being a christian ‚Ä¶i just try hard to do what i say and make them match..but sometimes i forget i was not one for so long that i sway to that end of the field at times‚Ä¶..oh well god loves me right? ‚Ä¶.well i have to get off here and talk with george‚Ä¶Recovery? maybe‚Ä¶heck im at work what else would i talk bout and it not bore‚Ä¶..in the imortal words of brooks and dunn‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.The road to heaven is full of sinners and believers‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶i have never been in that yellow line between right and wrong ‚Ä¶it has been one or the other‚Ä¶..well im not that bad of a person if i was‚Ä¶would i still be here? Just gimme three days‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶GO PAT!!! to all you that wonder why i have ups and downs..its a game of my own mind..if i didnt realize it or hadnt been screened‚Ä¶.i would think i was bipolar‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶its a control thing with me..i have to be on top of the thing at all time‚Ä¶to always do the right thing or think the right thing or i feel like i have failed myself and someone else. I live by very strict structure but am lact on some details i should be more mindful of‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..good gosh man‚Äù gimme a break will ya? lol oh well, I hope you guys have a great one and im off to bed as soon as i get outta here‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..no group for me today‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶By the way‚Ä¶SOy milk is great for energy and the cereal Smart Start‚Ä¶by kelloggs is good too i hope that i spelt the right‚Ä¶oh well who the heck cares‚Ä¶..Jesus and god love me still‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶*slowly backing out the corner for today* to much darkness leaves the skin to white‚Ä¶and i was born with a tan..lol‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.later Martin~

hey journal,
anyways, I just got home from work and got a very upsetting memorandum from the owner of the place i work at and do my practicum at. I was booted off from my practicum because I spoke up for the truth of the whole thing and trying to get some clarification on the matter. I am not to upset about it because I thought as soon as it¬† happend, God will take care of this and I have faith. The whole thing was she made it sound like i was trying to overstep my boundaries and she obiously thinks cause she has a PH.D she knows all. I just wanted to get some room to explore new areas of rehab and recovery other then sitting in group..i felt it was a waste of the money i have to pay back for my education non the less not covering what they promised my teacher would be done. So, i have a problem with deception and lies, so I told her oh well, bon voyage..I still have a job there but I think now the magnafying glass definately is on me.I was prepared to take it as it came because when you talk the truth on something you have to be ready to step up and own it as my teacher says. I dont care bout what deb thinks is right or that if she is winning in this situation because you know what? Its about martin and not her.Its bout what makes me or molds me into the best I can be and guess what? That place is so full of uncertainty and unstructure they will be loosing a great employee when i leave there. God will guide me..
I know that all will be well. I have that much faith. I applyed at MHMR here for a crisis intervention advocate and think that I have enough ambition to make a great one at that as well. I have been set back before and something greater always comes my way in the end. I will survive. I am just sitting here because I cant sleep right now‚Ä¶so enjoy some of these faces that I found on here‚Ä¶lol‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶love ya all martin

This song was on my mind because of this site this girl told us about at work last night. I have never seen such madness in all mylife. To be taken out of the world at such a young age. To be thirty hours from rescue and to see your life slipping away as you breathe that last breath of dust filled air, as your trapped in a homemade coffin that is just enough to see out of and to know your that close to freedom but no one can hear you. To be holding on to life by a strand of courage and fight. I cant imagine how she went on as long as she did. The site is http://www.purityknight.com if you are interested in seeing this stuff. I had to put it in here, man there is some sick people in the world. To never know a sibling and then to meet one after a couple of months and then her sister was murdered so she exiled into isreal for a couple months then came back to where her sister lived to get some closure to only get stalked,abducted and then killed.¬†she is with him now and his father. well hope it dont freak you out to much i cant get this thing off my mind for some reason, maybe its because i want to do that for a living. Profile the mentality of people and why they commit senseless acts of violence against people‚Ä¶.well later on yall >

Hey journal,
I am sitting here at work like so many of these entries have been written in the dead of the night or early mornings. I was just thinking of all the things that I am thankful for as well as all that has yet to be blessed upon me yet. I want to talk on somethings that have been bothering me lately. My job has really been weird because I dont really fit in here with most of the techniques and procedures they try to get us to implement. I just pray and go on one more day.I didnt do anything today producitive because I was hurting and my head felt like it wanted to explode. I want so much for my practicum to be over but the nights still go on. I want to cry because of all that i feel today. I dont like pain and hate to not be able to breathe. I miss some of my old friends and wonder how they are doing. I have thought of all the people that touch your life and how somehow they all seem to fade in the hands of time.¬†Time controls even the breath you take and counts it without pause until¬† your heart no longer goes. I have written in here when i have been happy and have been lost. I am in a moment of neither these days for the most part. Its like sitting back and letting someone do for you, something you could never do and know its coming and gonna be positive. I havent really read my jrnl entries of the past because i want to eventually go back and see the progression. Well today and the last couple of days i have felt like sadness steals the sunshine from the vine. I seem to be sad all the time‚Ä¶..and dont know why? its a feelin that always is there. All the counceling and thought journals in the world cant fix it‚Ä¶and it saddens me to think i will never really ever be under the thumb of this huge boulder of sadness. I am happy most days dont get this wrong. But on those days of the darkness‚Ä¶it cripples me with all it has and is like a muscle mind relaxer..all i want to do is sleep and hide away.Oh well, all for now‚Ä¶i gotta get back to work‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶later Martin

hey journal,
I am sorry that i only typed what I did the last time but I was running low on time and so decided to get my praise to jesus as quickly as I was feeling it. I am at work and thinking on how the bridges of the times have just been gapped in most of our minds even though somehow in our souls we know and feel the right and wrong button as we are about to do something. I am still thinking on the beating portion of that movie how intense that was. I felt every hit, every cut. I died in there as well, a portion of me that had the question if eternity is real or a myth. I understand fully the implications of my juggling the balls of belief and faith & confusion and doubt. I love this song called here am i‚Ä¶.about sending someone to help pass the word of jesus to those that have never heard his name or story of his great sacrifice for all of humanity. I told a co-worker tonight that i am truly humbled to the point of being unable to get off my knees. It took a film to get me to believe the truth, the light , the answer. I am thankful that I was able to get into that theatre to witness the child of god, and his story. I will never forget it. I am going to see it again and read the scriptures where I can start to really be a christian instead of the false pretense that I have been struggling with. I want to go to heaven. I want to live for eternity. I dont want to burn in hell or to live life in question anymore. I see people that only care about money, and this and that., but never do you hear his praise or thank you lord for blessing me.I have also been hit to a point of my own mortality while viewing this film. I urge you if you havent been saved or even if you dont know the truth or the light of eternity‚Ä¶find it today please! All those things you base life on they are all gonna be lost in time, only true paradise awaits in heaven. I have had ugly notes put on my jrnl by cowards that I have prayed for their ignorance and unknowing behavior. The devil trys to get you when you are taking a stand for the lord. I will not denounce his name anymore even though I thought I was a sound christian I had no idea the extent of my naiveness. True love was displayed on the cross, the love for the world that has never been shown again,ever. All the flags we fly in the name of the mighty US‚Ä¶then to murder all that opose. We condemn, the innocent the speakers of the truth, the true believers, we are quick to call these episodes physchological ‚Äúdelusions‚Äù. If this is being crazy in someones eyes‚Ä¶.i dont care call me as you will. ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..I love Jesus christ and God almighty‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.Find them today before its to late‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..isnt it time to clean your soul for eternity? praise glory to the real king? How great is your love? He bled on that cross, he got whipped, punched, kicked, denied, ridiculed, all for you..and I. What price to we pay to know him? it is free, his suffereing enabled us to find him and start loving him and his father. Salvation of the heart rids the tortured mind, there is nothing you can ever go thru that will top the ultimate sacrifice‚Ä¶SO HOP off the cross and defend it from being attacked again starting with you‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..and from within‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.live it ‚Ä¶love it‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶own it‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.may god bless you truly‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..amen>

Hey journal,
I was just sitting up here at work and decided to write some things down in you since we havent had much one on one time as of late. Well, to update I am thru with my hours for my practicum and now all i have to do is turn them in and send off the paperwork, then walah! Im a CI and on to greener pastures away from this place I am currently. I have just been hanging out at my house yesterday laying around. I dislike this job so much because it doesnt allow me to hang out with the people i trully want to because of the constriction of time. I have just been thinking about some of the things that have gone on in my life and reflecting positively to them. I am not on the ‚Äúpink‚Äù cloud i was on a couple weeks ago, but that is okay because I know I still have a seed growing inside me. I have just been living lately, not really reading and praying daily, but enough to be at peace. I am a christian but not a hard core one. I just want so much out of life right now its not like im putting god second, just trying to get things in order so that he can make it all work and i can appreciate it. I was thinking how can you allow god to put all the good stuff in your path, but if your not able to accept goodness or constantly clean your closet out it can come and you wont recognize it and push it away.I had a talk with my friend H today and we were discussing how much we have both grown after going to pci and how we are both about to start our internships. I no longer fret over the trivial things or waste energy on things that i cant change. I know the true ticket of living and for the most part it has to do with me not running my life. Letting others do as they will, and sit back and know that if they need help, ask for it. I will do whatever I can to help out. I need to stay out of the way of life and the track that has already been layed out. I talked to brittany earlier and she told me bout her friend melanie & how she did her. I told brittany she could have asked me for the money i would have given it to her to go to 6flags. I dont understand how some people in your life, you live in the past great times and somehow miss them growing either away from you or the rose just doesnt seem as bright to the eye anymore. I think that is what has happend to britt and mel. They have grown apart and somehow live in the past most of the time to try to keep a friendship alive that has died slowly‚Ä¶..but neither refuse to let go‚Ä¶of something that just is ‚Ä¶.at surface. It is okay to not have any friends brittany, we all have one that truely never leaves us. In the lonely times we all feel so alone and lost.We arent though. its the times we feel alone that we are being carried and sheltered the most.¬†I dont hurt like my friend H does, I dont live in the moments of my past of pain, this journal it has saved my life from the despairity of feeling in a circle of dysfunction. I used to chase my tail and wonder why i never caught it. I listend to sad music and was always in a pit of some kind of chaos. I dont need all that anymore. I look for the light in the day‚Ä¶.and if there is none, I wait and it always comes in the smile of a stranger, the calmness of the winds‚Ä¶the lovely sound of music blaring from the speakers in my car or the greeness of the grass as i roll my toes in the dirt as i walk. The simple things keep you all grounded and willling to accept life on lifes terms!‚Ä¶it is what it is.. you are what you are‚Ä¶the secret of life as faith sings‚Ä¶is NO secret at all. Its the relationship with your god (good orderly direction) that gets you thru the quiet times in your relationship. Oh well ,‚Ä¶..im tired and dont feel all that well. I could sleep for a week straight i think . Plan for the week is to get sleep and then try to get back in shape and get some energy‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.well later ya‚Äôll stay good to each other cause who knows who is watchin(*wink*)‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.

Mood: antifungal for the mind
song:The blues man by alan Jackson
Hey journal,
I decided to sit down and write because I have so much on my mind but nothing at all if that makes sense.I am just sittin here at home and about to do some laundry and then be productive. Positivity is a huge effort today because I just havent felt it in a couple of days. I had a hella great weekend, then boom the devil struck. I am so lucky to be blessed with the great people in my life. I just am taking it all in like its brand new, ya know? This portion in my life is a part I have never known and so making it up as i go along. I hate the way I used to live, the insecuritys, the doubts, the shallowness of my heart. I dont want to go back to that, and sometimes worry bout it because sometimes I hear that im not living because Im scared to take risks. I think I have taken plenty in my life to see that when I demand them for me, then all i do is mess them up, so it is better to be patient and wait for them to present themselves.From you guys that have kept up with this journal, You have seen the ups and down pattern of my heart. I dont have those doubts anymore. I just wake up numb. I have no real feelings inside me now, on certain things I feel em so strong, but on others it is just ice cold. I want those that I never tell how much I care for them and I hope you understand that it is my fear of some sort that keeps me from getting any closer and just put all that in to god. I can identify with this song. I have lived so fast, and like all i had was at that moment. Now, it is much slower and seems like all the luster is gone out of my day most of the time because I just try to do and think the right thing. If it isnt thinking bout my job, its bout how am i doing at the moment. I am caught up in the new job possibilities and the dedication paying off. I dont know what to really think about it all. I want to be happy but at the same time, its scary.

In the ocean of pariless hearts,there is the stumbled
and numb feeling of the waves crashing slowly
on the crest of the worlds eyes. Often we allow,
the motions of the waves to take us where it will,
but alot of times we fight the current of the soul.
A innocent child smiles and is happy with out fear,
then we teach them to be lenient when all is born brand 
new,we break the kindered kind soul of a heavenly gift,
and replace it with doubt, and fear of the unknown. 
a homeless guy sits in the gutter of humanity and asks,
for a crumb from the social structure of all we hold dear,
we shun him and throw dirt in his filty ears of yesterday.
A demon that made him lose his wife, his children, his life,
now we echo those in his fallen tears. Instead of helping 
him up from the ground we help put him in it, with every
spit from our lips, he just smiles and stays on his knees,
he has learned a little late that the demon wasnt his to own,
but to slay in the name of salvation and love, but its to late to 
the wife, the child, and his life, all he has is the dirtied crate 
in which he sleeps. A crumb from our moments as we walk
by, would maybe lift him from the salvation of his knees to the light 
from up above, watch him cry, watch him cry, hands aimed towards the 
sky, asking why? why? why? Please take me today as I have lost all faith in
life‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶from the sky comes a rainbow and a drop that cures his eyes,
let the demon die, let him die. 
¬†
¬†
¬†
¬†
¬†
have a great day ya‚Äôll‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.god bless the wounded, god bless the unbelievers, and most of all god bless us all that are true believers of the demon being slayed today:)

song: Independence Day by Martina Mcbride
¬†
Hey let freedom Ring! throw those stones away. For those of you that dont know bout the salvation of throwing the stones away‚Ä¶hmmm think bout it. All the mean things you say unto others, those are stones, all the ill you do unto others, those are stones. I wonder really if you read these things to find guidence or to make fun of those that dont have it like you do‚Äù miserble souls‚Äù. I am not throwing stones or casting judgement but it is a title that has been used to describe the mentality of the less fortuanate.I believe there is no such thing as a lost soul though. Even in your deepest darkest moments of insanity and uncertainty salvation is around the corner. Just have to wait on it and know it is coming. When you are laying there in bed and asking yourself, why am i here? am i loved? that is your day of recognition~! when those questions arise answer them with his love and guidance.Some will have hateful things to write in my notes but you know what? all you do is already written and when you write those things it is the devils ink that you are taking yourself out of the book of life. So, write away or learn that your shortcomings are all forgiven even if in the closets of the darkness you have heard drunken testimony or fearful revelations. I tell you ‚Ä¶if you continue to live life in fear and with I dont give a damn attitude‚Ä¶.the lost see no more. I can tell you, there is a strand of goodness even in the deepest darkest souls, we were created after someone great. So, how could his image be tarnished by our own self stupidity and will? You wonder oh why am i not like this person or that? hmmm do you really want to be them? or envy your situation because it is your own self worth you hate. Let me tell ya something that person you idolize has blemishes as well as darkend veins of passion that dont cure your desires.I have drank, i¬† have cheated, i have caused emotional pain to others without recognition at the time. I hated martin so badly that i would soon have walked dark and lost then to admit i was a part of society. I have had notes on here to shoot mysellf, to rid the pain of these entrys but you know those people need to go back to college and rid the negativity in their eyes to see this is a progression not a end. Life is a journey not a destination‚Ä¶.oh so true. Thru others love and guidance we learn to fall and hit our knees and truly understand that the pain that burns within you..is fueld by the devil to get you to the eteranal damnation of hell. Why fear it? the way to turn it around is there in front of you..if you can read this‚Ä¶.i tell you the simple way to‚Ä¶.ask jesus to come into your heart and soul and for forgiveness to the sins of your mortality. I am a wave above the martin i used to know. It is scary at times because of alll the greatness that is attributed to my life now. more then money, more then prestige, more then bling bling‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..but for the burning cool desire of love from up above. We all lose, we all get mad, we all do humanly things‚Ä¶‚Ä¶but do you really want to live on earth forever? do you really want to dwell in the pain of humanity forever.? why not learn to live as you are gettin ready to board a trip to the biggest celebration the world has ever known‚Ä¶.heaven waits the kind the loved and the willing‚Ä¶.not the darkend burning hearts that cant accept love and acceptance from all. you make fun of so much on this planet‚Ä¶.you judge so deeply‚Ä¶.why? you hate those that arent in your image‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..but did you create yourself? all the questions you hold dear to your heart‚Ä¶all have a common answer‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.may you find him now!~‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.is today the day you die? where will you go? will you want to shun jesus again and make him dying on that cross in vain? will you spit on his face again and think you will go to heaven anyways? you really dont have to do anything but accept him‚Ä¶and understand that as a christian living is living‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..not fearing sinnning‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..its all been paid for‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.in his blood drop for drop‚Ä¶.you were on his mind..on that cross‚Ä¶..give up the fight of insanity‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶all this shal pass‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..may gods will finally be done on you today‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..Martin

hey journal,
Its been forever since i have wrote in you and sitting here thinking bout it i thought what the hey. I have went back among this journey of my days and read some of the earlier entries. I¬† used big words and even insaner sentences all to say hey ..im pretty F‚ÄôD up. I am no closer to a cure of the insane demon but the demon doesnt come out to play as much anymore. Thanks to the grace of god and wonderful people that pray for my soul and mind daily i can make it thru without the pity party of yesteryear. I have been looking for a internship for my practice of LCDC. I have three that look really great. It is the waiting game that i have yet to master, but do we ever really? I have to make a concious effort to get in touch within myself today to really learn to tell martin that i love him today. I dont do that enough. I dont tell myself that im okay and great just the way i am. üôÇ The tears are dried up the pain has subsided in my soul. I am a walking miracle of the grace of our holy father. He took away from me things t hat i have not been able to control or things that i thought i desired. well im easing back into this so not as long as they used to be‚Ä¶..but ill be back for more mind blabbage‚Ä¶..later on‚Ä¶haha‚Ä¶later journal‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.I have missed you my blinking cursor of a friend‚Ä¶.we have had some great talks‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶bye for now‚Ä¶..*(m)*

hello.
I was standing there on the bridge as rain softly, hit my face and rainjacket. I could hear the sounds of birds off in the distance. Also, to my front there were three people off in the water in front of me. I was thinking as I stood there,about the whirl of emotions that incrusted my inner being. I could think of nothing at the time other then wow‚Ä¶it is really cold. I was thinking of the fish that I had caught that morning. It was quite a experience. I have been battling some inner sadness the last couple of days and I dont for the life of me know why. I dont think of anything sad to feel that way. I often wonder if the whole newness is overwhelming and at times, since sadness is the feeling that I knew for so long and the first on the list in my brain then that is why it comes first. I wasnt upset or anything, i was just staring as the raindrops filtered from the sky and landed gently on my soul. I wanted so badly to talk to god as i was standing there, but my mind wouldnt turn on at all. I often think that instead of helping the calmness has taken away a edge to my personality. I know its not common to be in chaos all the time, but at times it helped me in the crunch of life. I¬†often analyze things a little to much i guess. I am sittin here listen to john meyer‚Ä¶its okay. It is sunday and the rest of the week starts tommorow, so i guess ill just embrace it as it comes. I dont want to think that everytime something good comes my way that sadness is the first emotion that i feel. I want to someday be at peace with the emotional thing and not have to decipher it all and just let it come. I wonder why things at times seem so foreign to me, when its what everyone does and somehow i feel so lost to it all. I had a great time flyfishing, i just cant wind down ever enough to slow it all down in my mind to really ‚Äúenjoy‚Äù it. LIfe is never that way either‚Ä¶.always a fear, sad..at first‚Ä¶then as i ease into it‚Ä¶then the warmth comes. I hate that‚Ä¶i want to feel good first not after i have analyzed it to death. I guess when you have known nothing else for so long‚Ä¶.it is bound to come first. I want to sit and rest my mind for awhile and let all the stress of the internship just come and go‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..let it go let it gooo‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.sometimes the biggest demon we fight is within our own minds‚Ä¶..we often see, and hear things before others say them or dont ‚Ä¶so used to the bad‚Ä¶.i know that i am further from the past‚Ä¶but recently dreams in my mind have been playin a movie in which its like a dam has burst‚Ä¶..so its hard to take all this in at once‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.will the movie be a hit or a miss‚Ä¶..i guess only god truely knows‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..the beginning of another week and the story line thickens‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..thank you lord for all my existance today‚Ä¶.can ya take away this madness that ticks in my head one breath at a time‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.?¬† ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶*(M)*

song: solitare by clay aiken
hey journal,
whats up blinking cursor of a illuminating of my soul waits to spill onto the screen.I have had a better day today. I think of this song and wonder how many games of solitare i have sat and played in the existance of a desperation to be in a full house. I have hidden myself from martin for so long in the past that at times he still runs and hides from me and i often think that it is a easy way out. I was thinking today do the rich ever really know how indeed they truly have? I read in this magazine about how some of the wealthiest in hollywood are young or not out of their thirties. I wonder how different i would be if i could have that kind of monetary stability. I think that everytime you think you want something that the inner soul is lacking something that all the exterior shining lights cant buy. I have always wanted a life that I didnt have to run and hide from. I happy smile that i could show off proudly and not ashamed of. I glance at the mirror and see a minut glimpse of what i have always wanted and wonder. How many years ago i could have started this transformation. I always ran so fast that I couldnt feel the wind in my lungs much more the people in my life. I tend to transend back to a moment in that time at times and it gets quite scary because i dont know how it comes in so easily. Im not sad or depressed. Like this song says‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶solitare is the only game in town‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..but do you ever win? while life goes on around me ‚Ä¶i played for so many years.I talked to my brother today and he told me that his transmission gave out on him. instantly my heart sank for him. I know in my mind i can tell how¬† hard he tries, but in reality does he? when it comes to the rest of my life right now it is really unidentifiable. I am a bf, a brother, a friend, but i look at that face in the mirror and ask‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Martin where is the light today? is it gonna come? how long will it last? I have always been a risk taker and now that i dont take as many seems like this life is so ‚Ä¶.still? mine has always been in chaos‚Ä¶and at times i have to pinch myself to remember it is i‚Ä¶.that lived the pages of this journal. I dont miss those days‚Ä¶i just miss me sometimes. I have never liked labels and they teach you in recovery that when you label something you have instantly put expectations on it. Thus, setting yourself and them up for failure or disappointment. I never wanted to be in recovery. I want it now, but hate the labels and the moments where i cant even understand where i am. How can i tell you where or what is goin on? lol. I myself am brand new to the clean air, the bluest skies, the leaves in the trees. I watch my dreams in my mind unfold the gentle images of yesteryear and i go back as me now and wonder why didnt i learn this so long ago? why was i always so slow‚Ä¶‚Ä¶TO long in the past and the brain stales.. I often ask myself is it wrong to be silent among the raging in my mind cratered enigma of flames. I was reading some of this(my journal entries) and its so amazing that i dont think the same way..even t hough at times ‚Ä¶..wish i had the happy times without all the pain of the outcome. I miss some of my old friends, wish they could see how much better I am today. I wish that i could make amends for all the painful things that i did in the name of pride. I never wanted you to know ME. I never wanted you close‚Ä¶But i could never be alone‚Ä¶was the prison of a mental insanity. I since started writing in here again. I want to remember where I have came from and not forget I was and at times just as sick as the rest of the world mentally. I suffer from FINE sydrome at times. In these times enough is never enough, the days are not long enough, you are not enough, and frankly alone is the best place i can be in these times. I relapse into the thinking of the insane and the drunken lyrics of¬† yesteryear even though i dont run to it. I need you lord, I crave you. I just wish alot more of my friends knew you. I wish they could see the light that shines from my eyes as my creator does. when i see someone h urt i get scared. i identify those tears with those i could never cry. I dont understand that it is normal to cry when you are hurt or in pain other then beatings. I am learning though. when the hungry..learn to feast in his flesh, then we all will really understand why his blood was shed for our hunger to live in eternity. thanks for you that have endured my ride on this day i call my life‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶lots of love and appreciation‚Ä¶‚Ä¶*M*

Hey journal,
just thought i would sit and air some of the mind baggage going on in my head at this moment. I have won the lottery so to speak.I have a opportunity to start a job in west texas. I spent a whole month waiting on my fingerprints to get scanned by dps and now they have, only one problem. This other place in the dallas;ft worth area called and this job offers more money, benefits and sounds great. I dont know what to do or which way to turn really. I feel guilty because of the job in odessa is already expecting me to start on monday and the other job doesnt really interview til that wed. I have tried to stall odessa, but they only gave me a week. I dont want to let one go and not get the other and vice versa‚Ä¶so im like in a mind cluster *F* I am tired of waiting for this oppurtunity and bam im stuck with making the decision and so scared that i may end up loosing both. I have been praying on this and the answer is not coming any quicker. i hate deceite and lying so probly i will go to the odessa one and then ask if i can get the wed off to interview at the dallas one. ugh‚Ä¶.anyways‚Ä¶if you guys can pray for the answer to hit my knoggun then absorb quickly‚Ä¶.well im off of this for now‚Ä¶later‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..*M*

song: sometimes love aint enough by Patty Smythe & Don Henley
¬†Hey Journal,
I have had a tough day today but, its all good. I have thought on this topic all day long. The true nature of letting go is not ever thinking bout the topic again. I wanted to discuss this with you . I have had a problem with acceptance and then allowing god to do for me what i cant‚Ä¶which is restore my sanity. I try not to be so down and emotional at times but for¬† the longest time it is all i ever knew. TO HOLD ON‚Ä¶with all i had because if i ever let go‚Ä¶destruction surely came. I even try to control the littlest things. I try to control the mindset of everyone around me because why? I am CODEPENdent. I listened to this song on the way to work and was thinking you know love is alot and love is kind but is it really enough to keep the positive mindset going?‚Äù My clients dont know what love is and could care less about it. I see so much of them in me that it is really quite scary. I just made the choices that they chose not to allow to happen. I love my job today and understand the true nature of my kindness depends on the mindset martin is in. I try not to think of the negative things today but it seems to be around every corner i turn. I use god on the things i can not change and have faith in him enough to change them for me in his time. It still does not mean that I have to stop living while the miracle takes place. I need to let go‚Ä¶.let go of my insecurities‚Ä¶.let go of my anger‚Ä¶.let go of my pain‚Ä¶.let go of the stress‚Ä¶.let go of things that dont have my name on them. I try not to allow others to step into my world of serenity but then i feel so selfish for being protected from the evil so many have to endure. I want to get to a point of spiritial awareness where i can live in tranquility and leave the anger out of my day‚Ä¶leave the dangers off my road of life‚Ä¶learn to let go‚Ä¶learn to let go‚Ä¶.if in time the true nature of letting go‚Ä¶means that i myself once again cant control‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.so back to one‚Ä¶.later*(M)

song: whiskey lullaby by Brad Paisley and Allison Krauss
Hey journal,
I am back yet again to indulge some of my shortcomings for the black and white blinking of insanity. I just finished a group on relapse prevention with my clients and it went pretty good then i put on a video of Father Martin..a catholic priest whom disects the twelve steps and brings the semblence to christianity. You could feel the instant tension arise in the room when the video first came on. I was like oh god please keep their minds clear and open.I was sitting there wondering ..‚Äùwhy is it when god is brought into the picture , even if not about religion but the upmost mention of him or his presense that people get all tense.‚Äù I kept my seat and waited and waited for the seeds to plant before i stopped the video. It may have only been twenty five minutes but seemed like longer to those that claim ‚Äù he is part of their recovery‚Äù and in reality didnt seem like he is at all. I can not judge or even speculate who really has it or who doesnt all i can do is make my own inventory and stay true to the love from my heart that I shal keep coming back to plant the seeds of a better way of existance. I see the insanity of living a life without the care of god at the center. The problem is living in insanity for so long it is hard to truly give in to the solution.I still find myself fighting goodness for the sake of the insane mindset and frustration. I dont want it but I sure dont do the right things to keep from it. I should pray more, I should read more on gods love for me and compassion that has been bestowed upon me due to my believing in him. My journal has been full of ups and downs and in and outs‚Ä¶.but one thing is constant as behavior is all that either stays the same or changes‚Ä¶.my self hatred‚Ä¶‚Ä¶due to someone elses perception that started so many years ago. I have not been able to shake that‚Ä¶.my fathers hatred for me. So, in turn i view my heavenly father at times to be just as my earthly one was..inconsistant and at times cruel and unforgiving. I know this is not true but at times I tend to strap on the gloves and literally try to abomish martin. I still can not look in the mirror for along period of time‚Ä¶I still dont enjoy the view for very long. I want so much to love me that i run from the notion‚Ä¶because it is so unknown because so long in my life not many have‚Ä¶and those that do..i always think why? no one else has for very long‚Ä¶they too will tire of me as well. This job has got my mind racing and turning‚Ä¶no real serenity for real long‚Ä¶and the moments i do find it‚Ä¶i run and endulge in it and try to pass it on to the cold of the frigid..tuff job to try to get people that dont love themselves to see some good in themself‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.hmmm like looking in a mirror of self‚Ä¶..I am not this down i promise ..these are just random thoughts that build up during the week and i have to explore them. I to must be cleansed from the torches of the insane‚Ä¶..please god bless me and those i care for and about‚Ä¶‚Ä¶we cant live without you‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Your son, Martin

song: how far by martina mcbride
mood: confused and afraid to feel anything
I am at work and have a wave of emotions going on in my mind. I am trying to be empathetic to my ex‚Äôs feelings and be understanding but it is hard when everything seems to be blamed on you. I loved her but was unable to show her if that makes any sense. I have been trying to understand my own emotions for all my life so how could i expect anyone to understand them in a year and months. I got a phone call last night that really threw me for a loop. I was being told how i felt or dont feel. How can anyone know‚Ä¶.and then you say actions‚Ä¶but you know¬† we all deal differently. I did care for brittany and I talked to her about her moving all the way out here for me and that it showed tremendous love. I never planned on us being here where we are, her hurting and alone. I am hurting as well but blocking it differently. I know that every time I feel pressured to move faster or to feel something some way¬†i get all weirded out. I can only take things in small intervals and all of a sudden im told yes we understand and care bout you no matter what., and boom i get a phone call and sounds to me like i am gettin all the blame for our relationship not working. How can a relationship be that one sided? I am not blaming britt in anyway, but she was the one that was hurting due to my inadequesies, so i felt that if i couldnt go any faster in development then i wanted her to not hurt so i would isolate myself from her and that decision wasnt a good one either. I am lost as what is right and wrong because the only one that i hear is hurting and¬† all is brittany. Is it really ever that one sided? I thought she wanted to be out of this because of the pain‚Ä¶.and then she still wants to work it out?¬† Miracles dont happen overnight i have spent all my life in turmoil and pain‚Ä¶stuff they dont even know about or as it seems matters ..all im told is that im hurting the whole family. I dont want to hurt anyone so ill do what was asked and ill fade away into the darkness with god ‚Ä¶at least i cant hurt him and he accepts me for my flaws and all the pain i lived thru. ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶be back.
Okay im back had to do a group, I am so hurt inside as well as brittany is. Two people were in this relationship not just one. She has told me that is what she felt but you know‚Ä¶no one planned that we would break up ‚Ä¶no one planned that she would be this far from home. I have been told i dont take any risks‚Ä¶well coming out here was a risk..i knew that there was a possibility i couldnt do it all..but i still came and so did britt. Now we are both at a spot we didnt plan on and it seems everyone is slinging the blame at me‚Ä¶all at me‚Ä¶im not that powerful. My past is my past and no one will ever know it totally because i h ave felt no one truly understands it and want me just to disassociate from it that quickly. Most in my life say they understand and love me for me but when i act a certain way or not‚Ä¶they want me to do as they do like its that easy.¬† I have made strides but for some reason no one thinks they should take that long. I am all i am and if i cant be the image you think you want me to be im sorry. I can only give all i have and what isnt there just isnt there and wont be til i truly find time to do the steps i need to take to finally get well. but rushing me and accusing doesnt help the cause just turns me off more. I loved her and think the best for her is to move on and know i did love her and i cant grow as fast as she or her family wants me to. and to get to the good there must be alot of pain and i was causeing that so i took myself out. doesnt mean i was playin a role i was just going at a pace and then was thrust in this where i had to slow that part down to exist at this job.¬† Please dont hate me or think i used you guys‚Ä¶.you taught me more about life then i have ever learned but at this point i feel pressured and hurt at the accusations of feelings i truly did feel..just because i dont deal with situations like you do..does that mean i dont deal with them at all? i am my own¬†person and deal with¬†things as i know how‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.i love you guys and hope that god erases all the blemishes you¬†may think i have caused britt or your family‚Ä¶ill give back all¬†you asked for and you will never hear from me again‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.bye.¬†

hey journal,
I am sitting here thinking bout some emotions and thoughts that just came up in my head during group. The topic was over parenting skills. I took three stages in a persons life..infancy(1-5yrs) childhood(6-12) adolescence(13-18+)¬† and told a story of a abused child and the stages of its upbringing. During the infancy stage lots of abuse and neglect happend to take the child into a shell that was hard to crawl out of. The result was a isolative, hidden child with no coping skills other then survival. Then the child goes thru childhood being darker and darker‚Ä¶then the pain turns into anger and resentments and lack of trust and love. Then the child goes into adolescence‚Ä¶angry and disassociated from society only taking what it needs from others to survive and get by. This individual is angry and has a wall a mile high‚Ä¶no coping skills so takes out feelings any way they know how‚Ä¶then introduce..drugs, alcohol..and here we go. A fire being fueled by rage and resentments and a feeling that ‚Äúlife should have been like this‚Ä¶‚Äù but instead of learning how to live it ..or heal‚Ä¶it became a ball of fire that burned everything up in sight.Then the why arent you? why dont you.? questions start mounting u p from those that get in to the individual‚Ä¶.and more resentments mount more anger at the past‚Ä¶stages‚Ä¶infancy‚Ä¶adolecence‚Ä¶and then now‚Ä¶.always trying to catch up while life becomes a monkey on his/her back‚Ä¶.carrying loads that dont need to be carried‚Ä¶.and the question i asked my group was‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..HOW do you help this individual change‚Ä¶.how do you allow them to calm the fire that rages inside‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.alot of good answers were called out‚Ä¶.but just a fruit for thought. If it doesnt change..then the children they are raising are only gettin gaps of what they had as children and if they dont know how to fill those with positive attributes‚Ä¶.the dysfunction continues..well, i learned that there is a infant in me a adolescent, and me all wrapped up inside me and i need to be good to all those that didnt get the love, nurture, the kindness ‚Ä¶but i cant get it from others‚Ä¶i need to make it a part in me first to allow those areas to heal and be truly healed so that i can grow to be me who i am today and quit being tied or stuck with all those attirbutes of my past that always hinder my growth and inability to truly understand natural emotion. I said today in the mirror‚Ä¶.martin be good to martin‚Ä¶:) i have always chose to please or rescue others hoping to learn to love me that way and didnt ever work. I know with gods help and some searching and understanding i can do this‚Ä¶takes time and alot of nurturing that baby‚Ä¶loving that baby‚Ä¶holding that baby‚Ä¶.talking kind to it‚Ä¶showing it love‚Ä¶.and then moving to the next step‚Ä¶sometimes you gotta crawl to walk‚Ä¶.i am still stumbling around even though i know how to run‚Ä¶never learned how to do it when its slow‚Ä¶i stumble and fall:P well have a blessed day yall‚Ä¶..martin

hey Journal,
Just sitting here chillin‚Äô listening to the sounds of the season as the snow falls outside and the cocoa warms the dampered soul‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.lol jk. It is not snowing outside, quite warm for tis time of the year. We just hung up lights and are going to attempt to put together a gingerbread house with all the attachments‚Ä¶.got a fire burning in the fireplace though;)¬† I have had a lot to be thankful for this year and it is only when i slow down like tonight to see all the simple things that god truly does for me that i cant do for myself that then i realize i am trully blessed:) Amist the turmoil of the world, the chaos of the lost, and the pain of the unfortunate the season goes on in full swing. I am not dreading this year like last because I am A: not in that mindset at ALLL‚Ä¶I am in a peace driven entity that I must feed on a daily basis otherwise the beast listens and starts to attack the positivity I dont feed. I wish it would snowwwwwwww‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶at least just snow not ice because the radials are wearing thin‚Ä¶.think santa delivers tires? hahaha‚Ä¶.Santa is a great guy he wears red and white and is happy all the time‚Ä¶.what a way to be when in the image of happiness and love for the less fortunate the guy brands reindeer and a sleigh‚Ä¶.hehehe‚Ä¶what i have learned at my job is this‚Ä¶..YOU cannot give something you dont possess‚Ä¶.and so many times if someone is angry‚Ä¶hateful and disrespectful ‚Ä¶its due to the frontal lobe being damaged‚Ä¶so all the ignorance and disrespect people write on here‚Ä¶.its not their fault that they were damaged by someone as¬† a child‚Ä¶.and they didnt care enough but to live in misery‚Ä¶and do bring negativity all in the name of ananimity‚Ä¶.so, we all must pray for all the less fortunate because its not their fault someone didnt care enough to raise then correctly..I was reading amanda‚Äôs journal and it amazes me not to be mean manda‚Ä¶but really when you pray and trully let go‚Ä¶.of the prayer‚Ä¶.does god put things before you that you would really be able to notice like a genie? It is my understanding that when you push hard for a move like that or that you are never content very long where you are and have to constantly be moving‚Ä¶‚Ä¶what are you running from>? what is it that is not right in TEXAS!‚Ä¶lol I have known you for a minute and know this‚Ä¶.. you look for the perverbial sign to live your life by‚Ä¶god speaks but often its after the situation has passed‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.if he spoke first‚Ä¶.would you have faith in his running your life ? Faith in the unseen‚Ä¶faith in the unknown‚Ä¶.when we try to see our way thru it‚Ä¶god has no hand in it‚Ä¶and that is called control. No matter what sign you and David get i will be pulling for you guys‚Ä¶just dont look so hard and learn to let go at times‚Ä¶.and let it happen‚Ä¶.doesnt happen in¬† your time but gods‚Äù) WEll im back to the christmas festivities.! ‚Ä¶Happy MErry Christmas to all and all a festive good night!‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.Martin

song: dip it low..by christina milan
hey journal,
I come to you in the sanity that i can vent and somehow allow you to understand the mindset in which i sit. I am upset with myself and my past. I can only get to a certain point in a relationship and then boom‚Ä¶its over. All the i love you;s in the world dont soothe a heart that hurts especially when they usually move on so quickly. one thing someone wise told me‚Ä¶if its real you dont get over it that quickly..its like losing a love one..you must grieve it. well all the girls i have known that move on‚Ä¶here is the record..one married a year after our breakup..with kid‚Ä¶another within a year‚Ä¶in a ‚Äúseriuos‚Äù relationship‚Ä¶and the current ‚Ä¶.out dating‚Ä¶.so you have to ask‚Ä¶what if this had happend reverse? how would these females have taken it and how would their self esteem have taken it? due to my occupation i have learned that cliche‚Äôs are mear objects to take head in‚Ä¶if you dont love you‚Ä¶how can you give love..if you dont trust yourself‚Ä¶how can you trully trust others‚Ä¶and if you dont open up with others‚Ä¶how can you trully expect them to be open with you‚Ä¶i am speakin in the scheme of my profession. alot of people that i know will probly read this‚Ä¶like i tell my clients if it doesnt concern you it wont trigger¬† a emotion. i miss brittany like crazy‚Ä¶but is it trulely her or the fact that she is no longer here? i do love her and just wonder why its not enough to look past all the things that come up between us‚Ä¶so its probly in the best that we arent together anymore. sittin in denton on a sat night‚Ä¶with nothing but the music and my thoughts to pass the time. i guess i live in denial alot of the time because i think that i am progressing with feelings and emotions‚Ä¶i look for consistancy and caring and true feelings..a real people pleaser the enabler‚Ä¶thats when the problem starts‚Ä¶when i realize i enable and want out of it‚Ä¶and want to hold them accountable‚Ä¶then all of a sudden i dont love them enough or i am emotionally unavailable. I am relationship retarded‚Ä¶and i know who to point the finger at‚Ä¶.the parents. i try to keep things simple‚Ä¶but in that i keep it all complicated to maintain control. there is only one thing i truely have faith that wont change‚Ä¶that one is god‚Ä¶.hasnt failed me ever. they say if you look for someone or something to fulfill and be your everything that you dont possess‚Ä¶‚Ä¶if it isnt god‚Ä¶that expectation is to great for any one person to live up to. hell what do i know? im a dumpee‚Ä¶.and sittin here writing about it‚Ä¶..pathetic‚Ä¶and sad..it is..so the true nature of the beast is this‚Ä¶.no one has it all together‚Ä¶no one is perfect and normal‚Ä¶and if you dig deep within you will find those skeletons‚Ä¶i have talked on masks people wear with different people‚Ä¶.the pretenders as a society we are‚Ä¶.and we always look for the safe exit‚Ä¶because like i said earlier‚Ä¶if it is that important to you‚Ä¶.you dont give up on it..and you try to find a way to keep it going‚Ä¶.but once again i say‚Ä¶what do i know i didnt do that‚Ä¶im the dumpee‚Ä¶so all i have is the cursor and my insane thoughts of relationship confusion‚Ä¶.do i feel better? it never really is better to think that someone your heart still cares for is out with someone else that is tryin to replace you‚Ä¶and be the one that has what you dont have‚Ä¶.i think its better to be honest and say hey im f**Y*& up‚Ä¶but no one wants damaged goods‚Ä¶because then they see their inadequacies when they look at you‚Ä¶.almost like looking in a mirror‚Ä¶.oh well ‚Ä¶just a venting spot and once again what do i know? just writing down my scattered thoughts‚Ä¶and emotions‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶later old friend journal‚Ä¶.looks like you and i wil be spending some more time ‚Ä¶.together‚Ä¶.bye

hey journal, 
It is nine fourteen in the am and im sitting at work wondering why my heart hurts, why my stomach is in knots and why the person that was just around a week and half ago no longer wants anything to do with me. women move on as they hang around you with a smile and make you think everhting is alright. then one day boom‚Ä¶they find a replacement and a rebound and boom‚Ä¶they drop you and all the baggage of the relationship. is this a learned behavior? or just a survival skill‚Ä¶the small things you get used to‚Ä¶.all just seem so far away now. the stupid thoughts that cross your mind‚Ä¶the pain that angles from you deepest crevices‚Ä¶thinking of all the people that you thought would at least talk to you before dropping such a huge bomb ‚Ä¶and then they want the word love to come so freely‚Ä¶well its female memories such as this that¬† overshadow all the happiness in your heart‚Ä¶you know i know i hurt her as well..but i have tried to become a better person and grow into the man that i thought i can be..unfortunately‚Ä¶im not the man that she thinks she needed. well only time and years can tell her whether she made the right decision‚Ä¶as far as my years and time..i think this one was the final chapter on my relationship life. If i can lose someone like britt and mess that up then you know‚Ä¶i need to try to keep the world from my hideious existance. im so fuckin mad‚Ä¶so hurt‚Ä¶and so why wont it all end and go away‚Ä¶i just need to go away‚Ä¶.far away from me where ever that is‚Ä¶.later ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶:(

howdy! its finally friday and the end of¬† a long , emotional week. I am sitting here thinking of what im gonna do with myself until the roomie gets home. I used to want time with martin. I am overwhelmed with lots of questions and feelings that i have never experienced before.I am not taking good care of myself for the simple fact i am good one moment then i hit the wall the next. i hate it. I guess deep down i am holding on to the possibility of being with britt again as her bf. the more the days go by‚Ä¶..seems less like fiction then reality. I am to messed up mentally to be a stable boyfriend but at times i feel like i have it all together. I just really dont know what to do or to be patient enough to wait on it to happen. oh well, ces la vie. someone called addcition as a craving for the unknown and what you dont have and its like meat feeding the bear‚Ä¶.need more and more‚Ä¶so sad i tell ya. oh well , i need to leave work at work and i cant get counseling right now so i do with what i have‚Ä¶.i just need to sleep‚Ä¶to much overload going on‚Ä¶.i hate this‚Ä¶.and i pray one day it all ends maybe the end of me will be that day‚Ä¶‚Ä¶oh well‚Ä¶‚Ä¶bye‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..

¬†Hey journal, 
Not much time to pick a song or even a mood because I am at work and thinking on what i heard last night and wondering why and where did it all come from? If you have read in my journal the individual I was and the one I am today there is no doubt a transformation has occured. To truely understand me is to see beyond the surface and look deep within the pages that have preceded this one. I just read susan;s diary and once again the obious is there‚Ä¶.her daughter has been torn by this monster of a person and at such a young age‚Ä¶.well I am the person she is referring to. In the beginning of this relationship that she is referring I was that person‚Ä¶ruthless, uncaring and overall lost. I did not use, hurt or demean britt in any way. I closed down, I hid away‚Ä¶I didnt want to feel ‚Ä¶but then I found god. In the past someone telling me what britt told me last night would have infuriated me‚Ä¶because you know it was probly because I had something to hide‚Ä¶but you know? I dont recall ever having a conversation that sounded anything like what britt told me‚Ä¶i recall talking to chris‚Ä¶but not in the sense that was relayed back to me. In recovery we learn‚Ä¶no one can get us to feel any way unless we allow them to have that power over us. Last night i was neither angry or upset or exibited any old behaviors because I am not guilty of anything that I was told I supposibly said. Like I told britt‚Ä¶how can you tell someone‚Ä¶trust trust‚Ä¶have faith have faith‚Ä¶and then‚Ä¶when you hear something..instantly‚Ä¶believe it all..without even hearing their side of it? Isnt that a little bit hypicritical? I love this family to death and they have led me to the answer‚Ä¶but one thing i never understand‚Ä¶is why so quickly do all the good things they do or say get overshadowed by the accusations and lack of trust ? I agree I was not the best boyfriend but I am human and most of my life I have trialed and errored til recently I have learned new coping skills‚Ä¶Brittany has moved on‚Ä¶good for her‚Ä¶.I told her i would write how quick it was and yada yada‚Ä¶because you know in the end‚Ä¶we both are at fault for our relationship failing‚Ä¶BOth of us. I wanted to get better to be with britt‚Ä¶.while brittany was fed up and thru‚Ä¶so she has moved on‚Ä¶I also am accepting that and moving on as well‚Ä¶not to another for a rebound effect‚Ä¶but for me. Susan dont beat yourself up for all that has happend to brittany‚Ä¶and god will protect her and see her thru all the hard times in her life. I think that talking to brittany as i have‚Ä¶.we both lacked being together because we both wanted the other to be something they werent. Instead of seeing that what we are is the best we will ever be‚Ä¶.I still love brittany‚Ä¶i always will‚Ä¶I just wanted the oppurtunity to speak on my bahalf since clearly you took another persons words over even confronting me with any of it and making up a conclusion‚Ä¶thats fine your allowed to do such. You guys brought me to god‚Ä¶.showed me how to find him and rely on him and not to want to be so earthly‚Ä¶You may be angry at me or even not like me anymore‚Ä¶but I still love you guys‚Ä¶You showed me there is light in the darkened room. I didnt come in your family to cause pain..or to hurt anyone. At the beginning i didnt even know who i was pretty much‚Ä¶but knew i saw a light in your eyes that i wanted‚Ä¶that light was god‚Ä¶.and in the process i ended up losing brittany. That is the truth of it all. I found god so overwhelming that I quit being codependent on my gf and wanted to be in his grace and scared that if i strayed ‚Ä¶i would be back where i came from. stupid..i know..but you know alot was goin on then‚Ä¶no sleep‚Ä¶long drives‚Ä¶.and in the mix had two people in a relationship trying to make it work amist all the chaos‚Ä¶one craving love‚Ä¶like the pat green song she put on her diary‚Ä¶.the other wanting it to but not knowing that love was god‚Ä¶.and thinking that warped love he had‚Ä¶.was not right..and still wanting this girl in his life to be able to love someday‚Ä¶and you know what? someday came and went..because the girl got tired of waiting. ‚Ä¶be back to conclude‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

hey journal,
stay with me you‚Äôre the one i need you make the hardest things seem easy keep my heart somewhere drugs dont go where the sunshine slows always keep me close 
if only you could see the stranger next to me you promise you promise that you‚Äôre done but i can‚Äôt tell you from the drugs
¬†
You know for so long I was that stranger this song speaks about‚Ä¶not that i had or have a drug addiction ‚Ä¶mine was alcohol. It took the soul the life out of martin and all i was around‚Ä¶and for days i would look up and ask please dont let me go..i dont want to burn in hell‚Ä¶.please let me be able to kick this habit i have to harm myself and everyone around me. I never wanted love‚Ä¶i never wanted risks‚Ä¶.i just wanted sure things‚Ä¶..and if it wasnt so then i drank‚Ä¶and drank‚Ä¶i would look in the mirror‚Ä¶and see empty a face full of swollen nights and drunken promises and hungover lies‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.I am back in denton and you know for a while i was in this madness here also‚Ä¶going in and out of insanity just trying to maintain the lifestyle i thought i needed‚Ä¶the one of lies‚Ä¶and the one of self hatred. I thought i was in control of all and didnt need anyone or anything‚Ä¶.but you know what? god is strong enough to pierce the strongest steel‚Ä¶.and i had asked him in my heart‚Ä¶once‚Ä¶.and he came calling over and over to try to keep me from the flames of uncertainty and demise. I am stronger now because of my faith and belief in the unseen and i am open, honest and willing to see new things other then the old wreckage of my past. i believe today in me and my abilities to be able to make it daily without the ‚Äúother shoe falling‚Äù. i have learned to tie that thing tight and if it does get lose to get aware of the moments and relace it instead of treating life like a trackmeet that is all on sprints‚Ä¶i must slow it down in order to maintain the balance a life seeks‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..we only give what we have‚Ä¶and i know today i am able to give more then i once did‚Ä¶..life is short‚Ä¶why worry about everyonr else instead of putting priority on the one and only‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.GOD‚Ä¶.without him first all else gets taken away or you lose it due to being himan and tring to live in the flesh of the world‚Ä¶..may god bless you today‚Ä¶and be good to you‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶your worth it.! ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.love ya all‚Ä¶..martin

mood: full of charisma
song: She talks to angels by the black crowes..
Hey Journal,
I just thought I would stop by and pay homage to the thoughts of the mind of martin. I am sitting here listening to this song and if you havent heard it..go dl it:) Update: I am living in the dallas/ft worth area once again after being gone for about seven months or so. I am working at a womens shelter/treatment facility for now PT due to the FT job being discontinued. I like my job and it certainately isnt as hard as the last one..but I still miss having that responsibility. This song reminds me of the days when I had no clue what addiction really was or how could people actually become dependent on something to feel better‚Ä¶or to leave reality for awhile. I totally understand it now.! I have been talking to god alot more lately and actually keeping my mouth shut to listen. I have a little problem of wanting to take things on to much or not being grateful for things being what they are. I have to let god intervene or I will make a mess out of everything. I talked with a friend of mine the other night on god and all his greatness‚Ä¶he had no idea i had come around like that he said. I told him yes‚Ä¶in time we all must surrender when we see the truth the light and the glory. I guess after living a life full of mistakes and trial and error I was bound to ""surrender"". I dont work the steps, I dont go to al-anon, and I havent had any professional help‚Ä¶.I owe my sanity to the almighty..:) Oh praise his name! I am not saying that all those things set up for recovery dont help you‚Ä¶I just have been to stubborn to go and actually become a member. I also have stubborn issues‚Ä¶I am a control freak‚Ä¶I let fear get the best of me at times and on occasion‚Ä¶I have anger and resentment issues‚Ä¶I am planning on going to church this weekend since my brothers not getting married and I havent been able to get a hold of him. I hope all is okay with him and his wife to be and that baby she is carrying.:) You know I was reading the other night that addiction has been so widely used it is watered down and you can be ""addicted"" to anything? The proper terminology is dependence now. Are you dependent on this to make your mind or body ‚Ä¶.feel better? or just not feel at all? Drugs or me‚Ä¶‚Ä¶I love that song‚Ä¶but so sad‚Ä¶..it tells my life story as I have wrote in the past entries‚Ä¶.I was so sad once ya‚Äôll‚Ä¶I was once so full of frustration and no empathy for the human race. I hated all that is holy‚Ä¶I was among the lost and the weary where it seemed like my life was one big domino effect waitin to happen‚Ä¶it seemed like I could never do anything correct. I always felt that once the first domino started falling‚Ä¶.I couldnt keep them all from falling‚Ä¶.and once they all fell‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.time to re-align them all over again‚Ä¶.I dont do that now‚Ä¶:P I dont have dominos! I cleared the table and just lay the bible on there‚Ä¶..when all is lost or confusion takes my mind‚Ä¶.I dont speed it up..i try to slow it down and ""give it to god"". I am almost at my 2000 hours of my internship‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..I can remember when I had no hours‚Ä¶and how I felt like I would never start‚Ä¶.this. I felt like I knew all and everything on addiction and life. I knew nothing‚Ä¶.I had no coping skills other then anger and resentments. I didnt like me enough to worry about you..or how your tears fell down your face‚Ä¶and why they even fell at all‚Ä¶.I never knew how to cry‚Ä¶or why people cried other then having pain. I tried so long not to feel pain or even to feel at all so the tears never came‚Ä¶so when people cry so freely at times‚Ä¶‚Ä¶wow‚Ä¶takes me by surprise and when i did have tears usually it was my world was all blown up. I never knew you could cry out of happiness‚Ä¶or out of joy! I look in the mirror today and actually look deep within and try to point out the one thing i like about me today‚Ä¶.today it is the smoothe shave and the twinkle in my eyes‚Ä¶.to the ones that hate that sight in the mirror start slow‚Ä¶.identify the thing in that mirror that needs acknowledgement‚Ä¶..we are made in gods image‚Ä¶so when we scoff at the image we are saying‚Ä¶.god you made a mistake ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.or rather god you are a mistake‚Ä¶your image isnt as good as i think it should be. I was like that before‚Ä¶.hated that image in the mirror‚Ä¶hated the thought of anyone liking it either‚Ä¶‚Ä¶cause how could you tell me im attractive or handsome when all i saw was disfigurement? how could you say‚Ä¶.martin i like your smile ‚Ä¶when i would see unstraight ones? insanity man i tell ya‚Ä¶we let everything in the world program us if we arent in touch and aware‚Ä¶..where long we dont like anything about us‚Ä¶.and if we stop to think about it‚Ä¶whose voice are we really listening to? The devils‚Ä¶he doesnt like positive‚Ä¶he doesnt like sunshine in the midst of darkness‚Ä¶all he wants is pain chaos‚Ä¶and discomfort‚Ä¶..he thrives on our insecurities‚Ä¶our inability to love ourselves‚Ä¶he thrives on the littlest insecurity we may have. Do yourself a favor ‚Ä¶if you dont love you‚Ä¶.ask yourself why? why is it that i cant say that to me‚Ä¶.why is it that i cant feel it‚Ä¶why do i run and hide when others try to love me‚Ä¶.why do i feel incapable of receiving it..?

hey journal,
It is three forty three in the morning and I cant sleep. I was awoken by a violent dream of the devil trying to grab me from my bed and take me away. I kept calling out for jesus to save me and for jesus to protect me and the violence stopped. I woke up. I was watching the butterfly effect earlier and got to thinking. Is it possible that having a traumatic upbringing can make you into the person that only lives out the violence in his dreams? For so long I hated to sleep at night because of all the bad things I would see in my dreams or the memories I guess i repressed. I was remembering something earlier of a time when I was like ten or so and I remember going to bed, we had bunk beds at the time and my bed was the top bunk, well I could hear my father in the other room and he worked nights so it was almost time for him to go to work. I remember drifting off to sleep and waking up naked and sweating purfusely. I just sat there in a daze like is this real..? is this a dream‚Ä¶i put my pajamas back on and went back to sleep and in the morning thought nothing more about it. I also have been thinking on a time that my father was going thru his hyptnosies stage. Well, he would try to hyptnotize the kids and my cousins. This one time I wouldnt give in to his stupid notions. So, he chained me up to my bed and covered my head and occasionally he would come in there and knee me in the stomach or slap me along side the head. This went on all day and then my mom came home that night from work and saw this‚Ä¶and didnt do anything about it. He eventually took the hood off my head and unchained me but he thought it was all funny and a joke. He said I bet your mind isnt as strong as you thought it was did ya? I can remember more of my childhood as the wall of fear and anger come down‚Ä¶alot of it is more like a movie or something of that nature. I hated my childhood. I guess that is why I grew up so quick so I wouldnt have to remember it. I read about abuse now and totally understand all that I went thru. I think I too blacked out in instances..one time we were all at my house and it was the five of us‚Ä¶my two female cousins‚Ä¶and three guys. Well it was hyptnoses time again‚Ä¶well, I dont know if it really worked on them but one by one they fell asleep and in the mode of not wanting to get the crap beat out of me later I too faked it. Well, it wasnt until years later that I found out what happend that day. My female cousins accused my father of touching them. Nothing happend‚Ä¶to him. He thought that as long as he could cover his tracks‚Ä¶he would never be caught. One of my earliest memories of my childhood was me standing in the backyard‚Ä¶next to a hydrant‚Ä¶and my father coming back there and slapping me repeatily for not turning the water on as he said he yelled. I didnt realize then I had a hearing problem and im sure the slaps and kicks to the head didnt help either. I dont know why im thinking about all this but that movie triggered something in me I had to come write about it. Another moment was I was awakend and whispered in my ear go blah blah blah in the next room and then come in ‚Ä¶well I didnt really hear him just nodded‚Ä¶Well he obiously thought i was being defiant‚Ä¶and came in the next room and yanked me up by my pj‚Äôs and threw me across the room‚Ä¶he started beating me like a man would beat another man‚Ä¶over and over kicking me in the stomach, with his belt hitting my head with the buckle‚Ä¶he was hurting me so badly and my mom jumped up and started to try to intervene then she started getting it. By this time my pj‚Äôs were all shreds..i was standing there fully naked next to my mom while he went on his tangent‚Ä¶..I was lost. I would go to school and no one did anything. If the heat got to bad‚Ä¶we just moved. On to another school. I never made friends that lasted that long or that I would bring around because I always thought they would either see my fathers demonic side or witness his own sickness first hand. I would start looking in my mirror and hate the guy I saw‚Ä¶.I would go to school and get made fun of because my hair wasnt cut or it stuck straight up because no one cared to comb it. My clothes never fit right. My teeth were never brushed‚Ä¶I would wake up so groggy after getting in a deep sleep that I was out of it all day. These were the years of 1st thru 5th grade. I was the smelly kid i guess. My dad worked nights so on the nights he was gone I would sleep so good., but on the ones he was off I hardly slept a wink‚Ä¶its awful to think at any second you could be yanked from your bed in a deep sleep and to hit the ground being accused of what ever his sick mind fabricated. Once I started to get out of the little boy phase..that is when the abuse intensified‚Ä¶he kept alot of pornography around and if he would misplace any of it ..I would be the first to blame and it happend usually in the middle of the night. I would get beat until I confessed to taking a magazine or a book. Then days later‚Ä¶oh i foound that book under some others‚Ä¶but you need to stay out of my stuff. I didnt like any of that crap‚Ä¶much less girls I hated life in general. I came in one time after a day with my uncle, well my dad was waiting there. I walked in and he smarted off something and I just kept walking. He got pissed because he thought i was ignoring him..he said oh your to big to listen to me ill show you who is boss‚Ä¶he kicked me in the back‚Ä¶and i fell down by this point pain had no feeling to me..none. He wentin the other room grabbed his rifle and came back in the room, I seriously thought he was goin to shoot and kill me. You know duriing all those times, I never feared death or anythng of that nature. I felt dead I guess so that would have just rid my soul of my earthly body. He swung that butt of the gun and instead of gettin hit in the face I turned my head and he caught me in the back of the head‚Ä¶that scar is still prevelant today. I didnt cry I didnt do anything‚Ä¶I learned¬† you know you may try to control me but I have control of my mind‚Ä¶You cant have that. I stood up and he hit me again‚Ä¶I was 12. During this time I found football. I was a time bomb. I dont know how i made it thru school I had already started with the abandonement issues. Didnt want to be around anyone..but didnt want to be alone. My only real friend was my brother. Sitting here I am just thinking‚Ä¶all that and im still here. My mind may not be so well at times but god got me thru it. I have had welts that were so deep on my rear that I couldnt sit for days‚Ä¶I would wince in school to sit down‚Ä¶.the twisted thing is..once I started making it thru the pain‚Ä¶i craved it. I got rid of the physical on the football field..but the emotinal stayed‚Ä¶One summer we were all messing around three guys‚Ä¶and we had found some round rocks ..and we had a slingshot. Well, we busted out these windows in this tractor and thought nothing of it. Well, one day¬† i walked outside and there was this old truck my dad had in the backyard. I see this perfect hole in the windshield. I freaked‚Ä¶did I do that? why cant i remember doing this? who did it? oh crap what is gonna happen when he gets home and sees this. I blacked it out, the next thing i remember is getting blamed for it‚Ä¶and getting beat severly and my slingshot broken..in a million pieces‚Ä¶speed up to my 14th year‚Ä¶i was gettin into music as a escape‚Ä¶and i really wanted a jambox‚Ä¶portable stereo..well my bi
rthday is in septemeber and my grandma was going to buy me one. I was so excited then he stepped in and said no..he will just blast that music and harm his ears somemore. So, she just bought me a watch ‚Ä¶she was so dejected:( needless to say we moved and I got a home stereo for christmas that year‚Ä¶i knew what had happend. He wanted to be the one to get it for me‚Ä¶and it had to be bigger and better then anything my grandma could afford..i was hurt but had to act like i loved it. I had one tape it was slippery when wet by bon jovi. I played that tape nonstop. One day around report card time, I came in and gave him mine‚Ä¶and all hell broke lose‚Ä¶.I ended up with a busted lip and a cut on my forehead. Why are you so stupid marty..! are you retarded? well, you dont deserve anything i give you‚Ä¶.you just spit in my face with these grades. I try and be nice to you and this is what i get? its not like you have to work for anything‚Ä¶all you have to do is go to school and get a education‚Ä¶that next day i come home to my grandmas watch shattered on my room floor and the stereo as well‚Ä¶.and all my stuff in my room cleared out. I didnt cry‚Ä¶Ididnt feel‚Ä¶I just kept going..my cousin came to visit that summer and he molested her again. I tried to get her not to come but she said it would be okay. He tried telling me i know your a man now if you want to experiment go ahead and do it on her..just dont get her pregnant. I was sick of my stomach at the thought. We took her home and not long after I found out she had started dating women. Still does. I couldnt stand it much more ..football wasnt doing it‚Ä¶not enough practices‚Ä¶games..and it eventually ended. So i got some friends and just started withdrawing from the crowd even more. I had always wanted to fit in‚Ä¶I was going to a rich school where everyone;s parents got them all the nicest stuff and the kids had cars and stuff‚Ä¶the latest fashions‚Ä¶I wore hand me down wranglers from good will and the shoes I got during the year before or some that my uncle had given me. I did the best I could I started wetting my hair in the morning and brushing the best I could‚Ä¶i hated my teeth they looked so crooked to me. I cleaned up the best I could. he had this thing about the water ‚Ä¶one bath a day was sufficient it didnt matter if it was that night before bed‚Ä¶you didnt take one that morning ‚Ä¶ugh stupid! Thank god the kids at this school were nice. I didnt feel so out of place because I could play ball. In any school in america you may not have anything but if you can play football, your socially accepted. I hung with the no bodys‚Ä¶of the school but was the most noticeable due the football. so i could do that and not be picked on. I failed out that year‚Ä¶one more setback and punishment. I hated it. I got placed in the backyard that year and made to dig a hole and then fill it bak up in the sweltering west texas sun‚Ä¶I had a video recorder monitering every move. no one was home‚Ä¶just that recorder taping every move. I got fed up and said F this‚Ä¶I walked in the house busted the door in and got some clothes and some water and my bike and rode off‚Ä¶first taste of independence. I rode so far then ditched my bike I thought I would be easier to spot riding a bike. I was in the woods of abiline‚Ä¶tryin to make it anywhere i could i had a friend named jerry who i knew where he lived but that was like ten miles or so away‚Ä¶i hiked thru the woods stoppin to hide down if i saw a car. I made it in the shelter of night to that apt complex about one or two in the morning. I was so hungry and out of it I walked right into the swimming pool ‚Ä¶I got out and didnt know his apt number so was stuck. I found a place in this wooden playground thing and slept while the rain hit outside. I woke up and went to ask the manager his address‚Ä¶his mom just happend to be in the office and took me there. she left for work and let me stay there all day‚Ä¶we hung out..we ate i took a shower and he gave me some of his clothes. i told him my story..he said good job! we hung out met girls..and then night came‚Ä¶his mom didnt want me there‚Ä¶so i had to leave then my parents called all the kids i hung with at school‚Ä¶my dad threatened jerry but jerry never caved in‚Ä¶real friend:) i was lost‚Ä¶thought bout hikin it to coahoma to my aunts house‚Ä¶but i was tired so went to sleep in a pool restroom. At about four in the morning i felt this push on the door‚Ä¶i pushed back‚Ä¶then later on a cop came and arrested me‚Ä¶well took me in..not arrested‚Ä¶I didnt spend time in juvy‚Ä¶went back to hell. he didnt hit me much after that‚Ä¶then one day he lost it‚Ä¶and i went thru walls‚Ä¶.he was choking me so hard i thought this is it..im dying‚Ä¶a calm feeling came across me‚Ä¶and all of a sudden he stopped. god intervened‚Ä¶.these are just some instances that have been goin on in my head..and when times are tough or i dont understand why i act a certain way‚Ä¶its moments like these that i truly understand where all the issues came from‚Ä¶‚Ä¶well, I am better today‚Ä¶but it isnt until i face all these demons with god that i will ever truly rid my mind of nightmares. over the last year¬† and monts almost two years‚Ä¶god put me in the hands of great people..I hope I didnt hurt them a hint. I love them and really knew what a real family was. Susan, Im not taking this well,,but you know sometimes when pain strikes you pray on it and keep going otherwise the devil wins. I love you guys so much I wish I would have started getting better sooner, and that it was faster. its not commitment i fear..its loss‚Ä¶all over in my journal..loss loss loss‚Ä¶..and how do you regain all that in time you fear the most? well god doesnt leave..but my actions have made people mad at me‚Ä¶‚Ä¶and this demonic ass‚Ä¶.of a father to hurt me. all you guys have shown is love and i really thank you for it. I hope one day to show you too it wasnt all in vain‚Ä¶love you so much bell family.:)

hey Journal,
I am sitting here thinking how bad and unmanageable my life has gotten in just three weeks or so‚Ä¶I feel so lost and alone‚Ä¶I have no one to talk to anymore and it really wigs me out. I did all this to myself and rightfully deserve the consequence of my poor decision making. You know I think in trying to protect me for so long as a child‚Ä¶i died and havent really noticed it til lately. I am so down lately and tonight I was so out of it i was doing 65 in a 45‚Ä¶and you know what? I dont care. I dont care about it‚Ä¶because I feel so hanging on daily by a string and im drowning tonight, sometimes i just fill like giving my car back giving away all my stuff and running off to the desert and wait til i die. All that I have in this world never makes sense and people dont either. I am crazy in my mind and feel so out of place. Never have i felt like i belong here. I feel like who would really miss me? Before you think journal that i have given up hope and havent been praying‚Ä¶I have. I just am not good when god steps back ..i guess it shows me really where i am in my spiritality. I am depressed at this situation I made. I am barely working and one more stupid thing to budget in on a fricckin measley check. I am not very grateful tonight‚Ä¶I am angry and dont know how to display it any other way or who really isnt tired of hearing it so ill write it here. I am so stupid and put everything before god at times and try to help people when they call me for advice. I am sick of helping those that cant help themselves. I am bombarded with phone calls about how bad they have it‚Ä¶why cant i help them‚Ä¶hell i can barely help myself‚Ä¶.and you know‚Ä¶im not doing a very good job of that. Instead of getting out of this rut I am regressing‚Ä¶i.e. the ticket. #$*#@$‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.I have just wanted to sleep. I feel like shit..most of the time‚Ä¶life has lost its real purpose‚Ä¶.its definately unmanageable. I dont eat‚Ä¶i wake up off and on‚Ä¶i think about every coin ‚Ä¶my mind is racing nonstop and im drowning in it‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..no wonder sometimes old people are ready to die‚Ä¶.hell especially if their lives were really hard for a long time. Im no where near old age‚Ä¶but feel man‚Ä¶.i am a weakling‚Ä¶i can barely run my life‚Ä¶.oh my head feels like its going to explode‚Ä¶.$%#@ make the pain go away lord. ‚Ä¶.whatever i did to make you think i was ready for you to walk away for a bit‚Ä¶.i have faith in you‚Ä¶..i really do.this up and down just makes me sick‚Ä¶.oh well i should be used to this‚Ä¶.did it ever leave? or was i just shielded from it while i was with britt due to her not wanting any of this around? she was really great. well who knows ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶if i die tommorow‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..im tired of fighting..for what‚Ä¶.i cant seem to love the one person in the world that should matter‚Ä¶..me‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.i guess he really did die‚Ä¶.in all that abuse and this is the¬† @#$#@ up mess that came out of it. ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.out.

song: gods will and concrete angel., i have been blessed..by martina mcbride
*met gods will on a halloween night‚Ä¶dressed as a bag of leaves‚Ä¶‚Ä¶*
hey journal,
I just got home not long ago and thought I would come in and write some good stuff. I was driving to work this morning and concrete angel came on this cd i burned last night. I almost broke down crying I had this tugging at my heart that was like I have never felt. I rewound it over and over‚Ä¶.it was me. Brittany had left a note once on that but i heard the song and never really heard the words. I am definately that ‚Ä¶ Also, once I got to my new job they had me go to the other place where the women are. I ran a group over inner child and how to overcome the obstacles of re-enactment. I shared with the whole room I was abused as a child and even went into graphic detail on some of the things I have wrote in here. I am not ashamed. I told them, god makes no mistakes. All, the times we sit and bicker on what we dont have or look how my life has been‚Ä¶.look where we are at this moment.! God lead us to this very spot in time. No mistakes. I told them that in time abuse follows a pattern and at times very hard to get out of unless you are trully honest and able to understand as a child‚Ä¶.it wasnt your fault no matter who told you what or how you have felt. I told them that all i child really needs is love and nurturing‚Ä¶not expensive clothes‚Ä¶shoes‚Ä¶.a child doesnt know what all that is‚Ä¶.dont try to compensate and ‚Äù give my child a better life then i had it ‚Ä¶because in all the trying..you do and failures along the way‚Ä¶..guess what? YOU become your parents the one thing you swore you never would be. We have all said that. As children whether we had a great upbringing or a miserable one‚Ä¶.it all lead us to this point in our lives‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..to understand the grace and the undying love of our savior Jesus Christ. I was thinking on my way home that I want to open up a child abuse center for abused individuals to lead them to god. There is so many that feel that god abandoned them in the darkest hours as children‚Ä¶.but dont see that if it wasnt for god they wouldnt have made it this far. I dont know all there is to know about all..but i do know this‚Ä¶i had a great weekend and a church service that cleaned out my dirty soul. I feel so refreshed and inspired‚Ä¶i feel like going out into the streets and just testifying. I know at times i get on here and write the Poor me crap..and no way i can make it yada yada‚Ä¶I was talking with a friend of mine amanda last night on the phone and it hit me‚Ä¶I am around so many that dont know god that dont understand the light of the world‚Ä¶.that I feel compelled to gel with them even if I dont want to. I cant fake it anymore I know the answer! I know where to go..I know where to turn to for answers! I need to say great things about myself and quit repeating the negativity that was the past. I am a great person I am made in gods image‚Ä¶how can i be less then great? I told the group today‚Ä¶.everytime you look in that mirror and hate that image ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶its like spitting in gods face because we were created in the image of his son‚Ä¶jesus christ. I said love the smallest things and allow them to gradually grow into the tree of life that was planted by someone that believed in you so much to bury a seed in you. I just wanted to get on here for a second and write some of this down‚Ä¶.was so excited and no one to really share it with. I will be back soon‚Ä¶love ya all in christ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶martin:)

Looking back at me I see that I never really got it right I never stopped to think of you I‚Äôm always wrapped up in things I cannot win You are the antidote that gets me by Something strong like a drug that gets me high

Cold to you 
I‚Äôm sorry about all the lies Maybe in a different light You could see me stand On my own again Cause now I can see You were the antidote that got me by Something strong like a drug that got me high

I never really wanted you to see The screwed up side of me that I keep Locked inside of me so deep It always seems to get to me I never really wanted you to go So many things you should have known I guess for me there‚Äôs just no hope I never meant to be so cold

Well I don‚Äôt know what to say Because there‚Äôs truth to what you say I know it kills you I‚Äôm this way There‚Äôs something different everyday Chorus Could it be that I never had the chance to grow inside? Could it be that my habit is to find a place to hide Could it be that sometimes I say things just to disagree? Could it be that I‚Äôm only being me? 
Not easy living in my mind A little peace is hard to find My every thought is undermined By all the history inside 
Chorus 
Bridge I know I hear the words you said Over and over again I just can‚Äôt get them through my head There‚Äôs just too many voices Must be like living with the dead Waiting for me to begin To do the things that I have said And for this I‚Äôm sorry 
So there‚Äôs some truth to what you say

i loved this poem so much and kinda goes back to the mindset i foretold‚Ä¶I used to be so full of inspiration..now just hanging on by a branch‚Ä¶mind is so messed up right now dont know where or what to think on anything. have a great day¬† journal‚Ä¶‚Ä¶love me
In time we meet people along the way 
those that come, go or just fade into 
space, and in time we wonder if they really 
existed at all‚Ä¶just a vision of light 
not expected to be seen in the darkness filled 
hall. I look up and wonder where has my years 
gone, am i really that further down this road 
of life we take as minutes on a clock, but who 
pays is it hourly or just in stock.,mostly in stock 
of a unfullfilled dream or quest, we often try to be 
the best, if we fall we blaim him for that, 
instead of knowing we dropped the hat, if a person 
thinks that he or she gets out without paying 
some along the way‚Ä¶pain is a token that the devil 
takes on a daily basis, we are to ignorant to acknowledge 
or even fight for our sanity or happiness,just rolling thru life on that darkend bus, we use all sorts of things to fill the void of a jaded heart, never really erasing but allowing it to try to stop. one day it will and then we will be faced with the light that was never seen in the darkness then what do we do, laugh and say this is a illusion too? love exists in the purest of the pure, its the expectations of others that causes us to never see or feel the joy‚Ä¶.if a drop of rain can erase the blemishes of the world, then how could a tear not bring the same kind of joy to the soul?some confuse kindness for weakness and i ask you this‚Ä¶.if it didnt exist‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.would you be here to be missed? the clouds are rolling away from the sunshined horizon of a delicate heart‚Ä¶.waitin for the blood to flow again for a moment of pureness to start‚Ä¶it may be a prayer or a nice warm smile,,,,more of these things might warm the world and somehow make it thaw‚Ä¶..so the jaded pieces of my heart are scattered and tryin to make them make sense‚Ä¶.i think ill sit back and just let the rays hit me‚Ä¶and the drops of rain to cleanse my soul‚Ä¶

mood: running on a daily dose of carrots
hey journal,
whats up my dear friend? I am just sitting around the house and decided to write down some of my thoughts and emotions. I have had a stressful week at work and some unresolved issues as well. I called brittany yesterday and we talked for like a couple minutes‚Ä¶it was just casual and felt so strained. I was in bed by nine thirty last night to recharge the mind. I had a phone call back from her. I dont know why it seems like we are both scared to come out and talk. I know everytime we talk seems like we are further and further from who we were when we met. Time does allow wounds to heal and allow you to finally move on i guess? or just recycles the pain over and over..i dont know. I dont like how it feels like there is no connection between us anymore and i think we both have given up to some extent no matter what we try to tell ourselves. I wish i wasnt a counselor because it interfers with my logical side the side that allows me to feel naturaly and understand. I always analyze things and see if they have a hidden meaning or what is it really meaning. That is a defense mechanism for me‚Ä¶to keep the control and be in charge. I get so many mixed messeges lately I dont know what to do. SO, i stay put and just try to make it thru another day. I talked to susan and she spoke on the truth and to be honest‚Ä¶well honestly‚Ä¶i feel that our relationship ended in november‚Ä¶we just have been holding on out of fear‚Ä¶i love her i just dont know how to go back to the beginning especailly all that has been said on both sides and all the beat downs from both of us. This time is idle because I dont want to just jump back in out of being alone. It would only hurt her more then if I didnt let all the past heal it self. I am a good person, she is a good person‚Ä¶just seems like in all the goodness we just are just alike and the things that we fear the most or the things we dont like or trust in ourselves surface in each other and therefore causes us to either cling on to the other or to push away. I hate it. I am not writing this for no other reason but to clear my mind a bit from all that runs thru it. And I know you ask how can you say you love her when you cant even give it another chance? Control ‚Ä¶.and fear. does not mean that love never was there or is not right now‚Ä¶i just know how strained it feels when we talk ‚Ä¶we walk on eggshells trying to just be cordial. I did alot to her..and with good reason she has to be angry and resentful and guarded. history does repeat itself if some closure on issues does not occur. I am looking back to see what made us click in the first place. we are both so guarded right now. Maybe that is why she said detachment is what she needed to do‚Ä¶see even that i took as a personal attack‚Ä¶when it just is something she needs to do to heal and protect herself. She is such a dear person, man why is this so hard? why does pride get in the way? why does it just not go away..? I hope one day we can talk and not feel like we are doing it for nothing more then respect for the other. I do care about her but like i told her if she felt that i was holding her back that to do what she thought was best for her. That does not mean anything other then she needs happiness‚Ä¶not all this turmoil and pain. Im sorry britt‚Ä¶you are such a great person, please do what you need to get over the pain i have caused.¬† someone told me yesterday in my group‚Ä¶when two people see two things differently‚Ä¶there is nothing but confusion‚Ä¶well journal, im gonna go do some laundry‚Ä¶.i want to just speed up gods time and understand why i do what i do..and stal when i should go forward in faith‚Ä¶¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† later journal‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..martin
One more thing i re-read this and I dont know what she feels‚Ä¶.can only talk for me‚Ä¶.one of the major reasons there is confusion‚Ä¶trying to think i know what the other is thinking. (ugh!)

the rose 
Some say love, it is a river, that drowns the tender reed Some say love, it is a razor, that leaves your soul to bleed 
Some say love, it is a hunger, an endless aching need I say love, it is a flower, and you, its only seed 
Its the heart afraid of breaking, that never learns to dance Its the dream afraid of waking, that never takes the chance Its the one who won‚Äôt be taken, the one who can‚Äôt seem to give And the soul afraid of dying, that never learns to live 
When the night has been too lonely and the road has been too long And you think that love is only for the lucky and the strong Just remember that in the winter, far beneath the bitter snow Lies the seed, that with the sun‚Äôs love in the spring becomes the rose

Dear journal,
I am sitting at this desk surrounded by noises that seem to never go away. I am tired of all the self help stuff I give to people to remove themselves from situations and do live a better life. I believe in it, but you know sometimes you get so caught up in it. If you arent like that..you all of a sudden become a negative problem. I have felt really angry lately and full of rage. It is because you know I am learning a lesson of patience. I have none. I have control issues that go beyond the norm. I had a great person in my life and it was no game, no hidden agendas‚Ä¶i just didnt know how to be a bf. I still dont. I¬†am one of those that just is emotionally not there, when it comes to being in a real relationship. I love her because I know what love is..but you know how to do so comes so foreign to me. I left a note on her diary out of impulse and the state of mind I am in. I am hurling thru space praying and hoping I make it day to day. Her mom and I had a bad conversation one day and just took me back to where i grew up from‚Ä¶even if not the same still the way it was being said‚Ä¶i hate when people tell me im not feeling correctly or if i really felt it it would be like this‚Ä¶..how really do you know how anyone feels? or should act in a situation? I love this person as well..so i had to just sign off and go throw myself in my pillow. I get so overwhelmed at things that i dont understand or things that seem out of my control and you know what ya‚Äôll. relationships the real ones‚Ä¶..no one has control really‚Ä¶.god does and that is the fuel and the gas for it to grow and go‚Ä¶.not either person involved. Well britt and i didnt have that in the beginning. I didnt know god like I do now. I didnt trust in him or her.. I wanted it so badly‚Ä¶and went after gods love‚Ä¶when I ignored brittanys. I am such a one dimensional person‚Ä¶seems like i cant do two things with the same intensity‚Ä¶im only great at one thing at a time‚Ä¶like learning it and doing it. I was scared that if i stopped going towards the light i would lose it and then be back in the miserble state i have always been. So , i choose god and knew since britt believed in him she wouldnt go no where and we would go towards it the same‚Ä¶didnt happen that way.¬† read previous to find out what did. I moved back to denton to go to work on my internship. Here I am‚Ä¶with everything I never thought would happen‚Ä¶.and no one but me to share it with. Is it sacrifice or stupidity? I will letcha know in five years‚Ä¶..My old boss from odessa wants me to come back to midland and run a facility if she gets a grant from the government ‚Ä¶to run a whole facility for the federal government. wow‚Ä¶.and my one dimensional mind says‚Ä¶okay. but my feelings and heart say‚Ä¶.no one to be proud of me or to share this with. I guess I need someone that is secure with themselves and not feel inferior to my job‚Ä¶cause lets face it i spend alot of time with it‚Ä¶and want to be the greatest i can. i am only in it for nine months now and have came so far. I am a child of abuse. grown man..of fear..and uncertainty ‚Ä¶a person who thought I would someday get all ‚Ä¶.and you know what? YOu do..but at a price‚Ä¶.you cant have it all‚Ä¶you always lose something that is dear to you‚Ä¶but at the time your not strong enough to be good at your job and good to that person‚Ä¶she doesnt need me ‚Ä¶she does need to finally put me behind her‚Ä¶everytime i talk to her or her mom its if you cared really‚Ä¶..you would‚Ä¶..or you should‚Ä¶..or i feel‚Ä¶‚Ä¶im sorry guys‚Ä¶i have feelings also‚Ä¶maybe foreign to anything you have felt but i still have them and the most important one is to do no harm‚Ä¶and i seem to have done plenty‚Ä¶britt writes about it ‚Ä¶..susan writes about relationships and verses‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.i love you guys always will‚Ä¶‚Ä¶maybe someday god will put some reality to go with what you think i am‚Ä¶‚Ä¶i am broken‚Ä¶a broken child of god..who wants to know there is no pain gonna be there for me or that i will cause none for being the way i am‚Ä¶.and you know i did it‚Ä¶is it fear‚Ä¶no‚Ä¶its knowing who i am‚Ä¶.obiously you guys cant talk to me because of it‚Ä¶without forgetting it. all the detachment theories work‚Ä¶and i see why britt would and has done so. I am a addict without the craving for the drug‚Ä¶i crave a drug that i only trust one person can give witout condition‚Ä¶.LOVe. that is why you hurt‚Ä¶when i fail you..i think i am giving all i can and you think i should give more‚Ä¶‚Ä¶instead of seeing that it is a miracle i can even give any at all‚Ä¶.oh well..i love you guys..and wish nothing but the best for you. ‚Ä¶I am in a town where i am just with me‚Ä¶is it by choice? I dont drink anymore i dont go to clubs‚Ä¶i dont chase women‚Ä¶i dont look for anything other then god on¬† a daily basis‚Ä¶.i know that people will always let you down imist the best intentions‚Ä¶but do you walk away from them? i guess when it becomes to hard you do. gods love has no boundaries‚Ä¶.and i do read the chorinthians 13:1 daily‚Ä¶.that is true love‚Ä¶no insanity no questions‚Ä¶just what it is‚Ä¶..humans could have been like that if sin had not taken us from the garden. SO, if you place a definition on giving ‚Ä¶are you doing it correctly? only my interpetation..though‚Ä¶what do i know im new to it‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..i live daily to make a difference‚Ä¶to give something back for all god has given me in my life‚Ä¶.but you know it caused losing some people to be where i am‚Ä¶and if i didnt lose them‚Ä¶why dont they talk to me‚Ä¶why must i be the first to call? oh well , like i said i am full of questions and theories‚Ä¶does that make me a expert? no! I am just a human who lives day to day without the best of the world‚Ä¶but i dont want it‚Ä¶.i want gods love and to keep my eyes on him‚Ä¶.everyone else is in charge of their beings‚Ä¶..but dont tell me I didnt know how to love before because you know‚Ä¶I DIDNT!‚Ä¶.but i do know what gods love feels like‚Ä¶and if you are a christian‚Ä¶.we are not to have boundaries when we give his grace‚Ä¶.we are to show the less fortunate and the lost and weary‚Ä¶not to write on a journal to guide but to do the footwork to let the world know we are unashamed by loving something that is seemed unloveable by society!‚Ä¶.peace out yall‚Ä¶..may god guide your heart and your mind to sanity‚Ä¶.find yourself then you will find what others are about‚Ä¶.til then you remain clueless‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.bless you all‚Ä¶.martin
PS god loves the bears!! he gave us a longhorn!!!‚Ä¶‚Ä¶gonna be a great year

song: drugs or jesus‚Ä¶by tim mcgraw‚Ä¶
mood: calm and serene.
hey journal, 
sup? I am just sitting here listening to music as my head turns round and round. I wanted to write a entry on letting go and trully understanding the meaning of taking your hands off something you cant control. I have had so many instances where I have tried to hang on with dear life for the inevitable to happen. I get tired and end up letting go eventually‚Ä¶. I have learned when you have faith, hope , love‚Ä¶in your existance then you have a unseen presense of someone doing something for you that you yourself can not do. That entity is jesus.¬† I know that alot of times we think we need to get it started and that if we do nothing god will not take over‚Ä¶.he may need us‚Ä¶.lol . not.!¬† The only thing needed is faith in the unseen. I have struggled with this concept for a minute‚Ä¶but I think im getting better at just allowing and understanding that I am not that big and god is. I have to let go of situations that cause me fear‚Ä¶situations that cause me anger‚Ä¶and situations that cause me pain‚Ä¶.I forever used to dwell in the negativity of these things because if it wasnt this‚Ä¶then I had no clue how to act or how to even understand that life was calm. I always had to have it fast‚Ä¶.and confusing‚Ä¶.well, I have found that god does not dabble in confusion, fear or failure. He is in the light, the rightiousness and the love of the world. The devil is the perverser of the universe. It only takes a second for the devil to get in your mind and make things seem unmanageable and unbearing. Without faith‚Ä¶..you stay in your head and replay that tape over and over‚Ä¶..like a button jammed‚Ä¶.replays over and over‚Ä¶.til the insanity of codependency overtakes logic‚Ä¶it is so fearful that it cripples you to even breathe correctly.¬†I wonder why we spend so much time on things that we dont have a hoot in controlling? Its about the genuine powerthrust we need to feel important? or is it just in the nature of the loveing that overtakes the godly intention? I know that in time god will take from me if i am patient enough to wait and seek him and to keep my eyes on him. Its when i take my eyes off him that i get in trouble. I obsess‚Ä¶.i procrastinate‚Ä¶i barter and i manipulate myself. I have to keep myself out of myself if that makes sense‚Ä¶.its when i take over and think i can control my life that i get into trouble. I am so grateful for the great people in my life that have seen me at my worst and my best and still are around‚Ä¶.well, just thought i would update‚Ä¶‚Ä¶later ya‚Äôll‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..martin

hey journal,
sup lil one? just thought I would drop by and pay homage to the page that brings out the deepest emotions of my heart and soul. I have just been chillin today. I had jury selection and was not chosen which was really cool. I didnt want to serve anyways‚Ä¶I dont like the courtroom or the justice system at times due to the fact that if you arent wealthy alot of times you get attorneys that are overworked and often times just want to plea with the judge. That happend with my mother, she had a terrible attorney and the best he could do was twenty years. I wonder how can human beings play with someone elses life like that and go home at the end of the day unscathed. I wonder if they would have listened to her story if it would have mattered. The judge today kept saying‚Ä¶In this land innocent til proven guilty‚Ä¶well i really doubt that due to so much publicity a case gets. I wonder if people are really able to go in there and have a open mind when it comes to hearing facts and deciphering it into reality. I just couldnt and hope that I never get that oppurtunity again. I see the end result of life with the individuals I work with. They dont have money like micheal jackson, o.j. or any other famous face to beat the raps that are handed to them. I am not saying that they arent guilty of breaking the law‚Ä¶but at what point do we take it out of our hands and place it in gods? interesting question..eh? I have strong feelings about this today‚Ä¶.I just have alot of empathy for humans‚Ä¶.now adays where before I couldnt care less for my fellow man‚Ä¶I wonder what if that was me‚Ä¶how easily it is to be innocent one day and on trial for your life the next‚Ä¶does education play a factor or is it the environment? do you really believe that all that grew up without are out there commiting crimes and with no remorse? I just wonder how society can not come up with a alternative to treat the afflicted of society to try and reform them. I dont know all there is to know on everything I just have some strong feelings on this for some reason..;) I also have alot of time to think today‚Ä¶doing laundry and just being lazy‚Ä¶so I had to write something down on here‚Ä¶.well I hope you guys have a great one‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.peeeeeeeeeeace out ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.one time‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..martin:)

Loving behavior is personally accountable behavior that nurtures and supports our own and others‚Äô spiritual growth and highest good. It is behavior that is consciously intended to give something helpful ‚Äì like support, compassion or understanding ‚Äì to ourselves and others. Controlling behavior, which is often unconscious, attempts to get something (like safety, love or attention) or to avoid something (like rejection, disapproval or loneliness). Loving behavior is satisfying in itself and is not attached to an outcome, to getting something back. Controlling behavior always has an expectation of a certain outcome attached. 
For example, you can give to your children because it gives you joy to do so, or you can give because you want them to love you, take care of when you are older, or have others see you as a good parent. You can have sex with your partner for loving or for controlling reasons, too. You may want to share and express your love, or you may want to get loved, distracted or affirmed, or avoid your partner‚Äôs anger or disappointment. You can donate money to worthy causes purely for the satisfaction it gives you, or to get publicity, a tax break or a place in heaven. While the action of giving to your children, having sex or donating money is the same, the energy behind a controlling intent feels totally different to the receiver than the energy of a loving intent. Loving behavior feels nourishing while controlling behavior feels lonely, smothering or draining to the receiver. 
In the same way you attempt to control the outcome with others, you may attempt to control the outcome with God. You might pray, go to church or temple, tithe or do volunteer work in order to make God love and protect you, rather than for the pure joy of doing so and from the deep desire to serve God. Religious dogma is often based on an attempt to control God? If you belong to the right religion you will go to heaven. This gives people a sense of control over God: I only have to believe the ‚Äúright‚Äù thing and I am safe. Each religion has its rules ‚Äì don‚Äôt work on Saturday, give away a certain percentage of your earnings, don‚Äôt divorce, sacrifice yourself for others ‚Äì to ensure God‚Äôs grace. The problem is that none of these rules has anything to do with love and compassion. Worse, they teach you that you do, indeed, have to give yourself up ‚Äì that is, deny your own inner truth and follow someone else‚Äôs teachings ‚Äì to be loved by God. In fact, they teach that it is only in giving yourself up that you will be loved by God. While this may give you a sense of safety, it does not move you along your spiritual path toward becoming more loving and compassionate. 
The doctrines and dogma of religion have nothing to do with opening to God, which is what spirituality is all about. Opening to God does not mean giving yourself up in the sense of ignoring your own needs and your own truth or going along with what other people want or what they tell you God wants. Opening or ‚Äúsurrendering‚Äù in the spiritual sense means that you release the will of your wounded, false self and invite in the will of love, compassion, truth and wisdom ‚Äì the will of God. You cannot surrender and attempt to control the outcome of things at the same time. Letting go of the outcome does not mean that you do not decide what you want and do everything in your power to get there. It means that you come from the faith that your soul is being supported in your highest good at all times and that you cannot always know which outcome is best for your soul‚Äôs growth toward wholeness and oneness with God. 
When compassion has a higher value than control, we do not judge things in terms of right and wrong. Instead, we look at our own and others‚Äô behavior and try to understand the values and preferences behind this behavior. We try to understand the very good reasons we all have for feeling, believing and behaving the way we do. We try to learn and understand rather than judge. To be on a spiritual path is to accept that you need to put aside your concepts of right and wrong, good and bad, and embrace instead compassionate learning, understanding and acceptance as your way of being. Sadly, control rather than compassion has become the most prevalent way of life. 
Control issues is one of my biggest things to deal with on a daily basis. I often times try to control the outcome or to manipulate it out of self perservation. I often times read that when you grow up in a abusive family or relationship it becomes a defense mechanism that turns into a coping skill. I had to have control over the pain that was inflicted upon me from another human being. I could not control him because I was not big enough and therefore I became a master of the mind. I was able to shut off my emotions and feelings at the drop of a hat. I no longer allowed to feel the awful things that i went thru all in the name of self perservation. I today try to be in charge or control of all. I have to have my clothes a certain way‚Ä¶drive a certain way to work‚Ä¶get the same food at restaurants‚Ä¶and even try to determine the ‚Äúright‚Äù person in my life. I have so many rules and guidelines that I have made for myself over time that instead of taking away from I just added to every time pain was a part of the outcome. I hate the control card, but out of pattern and habitual abuse of it‚Ä¶it has become ingrained in my head as part of me. I try to pray and let go to god. I even have to think that thru. With control issues come the fear of failing or not doing something correctly so I try extra hard to overcome my shortcomings. I used to drink to feel a sense of normality to slow down the compulsive thinking. I dont do that now and just rely on prayer and self talk. I try to be more aware when I am in a position where I can either let go or not even get the mind going on such. I feel crazy with all the changes I am undergoing in my life. I know they are all for the best and to finally live a meaningful and caring life you must learn to let go and be flexible. I suffer with this so badly‚Ä¶its like to be secure I must be sure of all angles. I must know the excape route out the restaurant in the event something happens and that moment calls for it. I dont want to sit with my back to the door because if i need to see something coming i want to be the first to see it. I just had a thought also..I am hard of hearing so maybe instead of control it is a sense of security being able to see where I can not hear that well. I do love me today more then I ever have in my life time. I just struggle with issues of codependency on those that could care less about me and its so hard to break free because negative energy at times is the same as positive even if the outcome isnt. I wonder daily the tingle in my skin the weird feelings that i have daily ‚Ä¶they are not racing thoughts not obsessive on what if‚Äôs they are new feelings that i have never had before. I am gonna be okay‚Ä¶god has me when i dont try to dictate to him what i need or what would be best for me. I am loved by many‚Ä¶i have close friends that care‚Ä¶.i just at times go back into my head to hide out because its safer then facing a new situation without control of it. I am so thankful for this diary thing‚Ä¶has been a lifesaver many of nights‚Ä¶.oh well, I close with this. If you are adding more to the problem then
taking away from it‚Ä¶how can you gripe whenever the water becomes more then the boat can hold‚Ä¶.and you drown? I need to keep my eyes on god and listen to the voice of truth instead of the lies‚Ä¶.of the devil‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶thank you jesus for giving me the oppurtunity to live free most of the time from the bondage of satans voices‚Ä¶.I am your child‚Ä¶love me hold me and never let me go‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..love martin

hey journal,
It is five twelve in the am and I finally get to use the computer after one of the housemates has been on the damn thing all evening and most of the night. I have a problem tonight and it is anger. I am angry at so much that happend yesterday that I dont know where to begin. I got to work and it seemed to be one of those blaze‚Äô type days where nothing really exciting was going on then boom* here come the clients wanting me to sign something that had nothing to do with me or what i had not conducted. I am being torn right now and i know i really shouldnt be because i have choices, but my integrity for knowing what is right and being asked to do another just gets me enraged. For a long time, i had no integrity or honesty. I did what i thought would get me the best outcome, now it seems daily I am being asked to do or to sign something that I did not facilitate or something that has nothing to do with me. I go to my boss about it and like yesterday..you know what her answer was? why didnt you call me when you found out ..one of the counselors was not there. I was furious!! I thought you¬† are the boss surely you would know someone wasnt going to be in that morning and have the decency to tell the rest of us. It is things like that instead of coming up with a logical solution it is always either thrown back at you or seems to be like you are the inadiquate one. I get out of work and am fuming usually‚Ä¶i cant believe i dread to do what i love ‚Ä¶it is really hard right now. I know that jobs are not ment to be easy or that you always get great bosses‚Ä¶but you know when you try to do the right thing and get made feel like you are just trying to be defiant or do things your own way‚Ä¶doesnt sit well in your stomach. I feel so alienated right now and dont know how to change this‚Ä¶or even accept it. I just want to go in and do the best job i can do and get out‚Ä¶i dont want to get caught up in the bs of the job‚Ä¶im not there for that. oh well‚Ä¶almost time to go back there‚Ä¶..later‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..martin

When the night has been too lonely and the road has been too long 
And you think that love is only for the lucky and the strong 
Just remember that in the winter, far beneath the bitter snow 
Lies the seed, that with the sun‚Äôs love in the spring becomes the rose 

I was thinking on this song the other day on my way to work. The seed that lies beneath the bitter snow ‚Ä¶..that is the seed that god is waiting to harvest and in the spring becomes the rose. The sunlight is gods love for us and the seed is planted when we are the darkest or the most lost. I was like wow! I am a thinker by nature and I listen to music alot and it always talks to me on some medimorphical way. I am just sitting around waitin on my laundry to finish and so i can go to get some food. I work my late shift today and have to go at it again tommorow. I am not in the same mindset I have been ‚Ä¶The voice of truth has spoke to me‚Ä¶i have realized i am a highly sensitive person‚Ä¶and that is not a self diagnosis..Susan sent me the link to that website and it is all me. I am not codependent‚Ä¶nor have any real problems it is a natural occurance in the nervous system that plays havoc with us. http://www.hsperson.com/index.html¬†there is the link if any of you want to check it out. I always thought I was crazy how i felt or how i took things in well, since reading this book i totally understand why things are the way they are. I feel free from the chains of doubt, the chains of self fear, I feel that I am trully free and alive. I went to see my mother this past weekend and got somethings out with her and came to some understanding of forgiveness. I also had a great weekend with britt and susan. We met up there in waco and just hung out was good times‚Ä¶I am still gonna do some research on the relationship part‚Ä¶because I dont really know all they suggest for that. I am just happy that I have finally found the answer to the insanity of the mind. when i feel that i am over stimulated i stop and do the suggested things she speaks of in that book. I see alot of journals that people feel so lost and out of sorts‚Ä¶take the test may be you too? I just have a new outlook on life and want to be all i was ment to be in gods idea of my soul creation. I am tired of the aame ol same ol. I trully feel free and open to be honest and me. I love the fact that there are others like me in the world and i dont have to be ashamed of being ""different‚Äô. I just want to thank all of you for all the encouraging notes and love that you have given me thru all the insanity of my search‚Ä¶.daily i shed theskin of the old me‚Ä¶..lord let me be risen up to you to finally be the man you have always wanted me to be. I am yours almighty please bestow me with your grace and glory. I am not fearful because I know you make no mistakes and you place people in my life for the glory of you and to show me that there is a different way‚Ä¶to allow me to finally feel outside my inner wall of protection and isolation please let me finally tear it down and run to the sunshine and let the seed finally bloom into the rose you created in your image and grace. heavenly father please protect me today and protect the ones i love I glory all in your name‚Ä¶..bless me indeed with the simple fact i have to not carry the awful sounds of the devil in my head one more second. oh , father in your gracious love and understanding i pray to you ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.and in your sons name‚Ä¶.jesus christ‚Ä¶..help me love me today a little more then i did yesterday‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶clean these hands of the past‚Ä¶.and keep me in today‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶amen!‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

Mood: unsure of the breaths i am breathing.
song: incomplete by backstreet boys.
I decided to stop by and write a bit because I always tell my clients hey if something is bothering you write it down even if it doesnt make sense or have meaning.I am in a spot tonight that I dont understand or even know what to think about it. I dont want to get physological or analyze it. I just want it to rid my brain as it came. I am really tired of thinking so much all the time. I try to let things go as they go and alot of times never seems enough. I started this diary to really have a place to dump and feel free to speak on anything that is going on with me without fear of ridicule from the readers or rude notes. I am telling ya im really flying today. I know I am more confused on who i am today then I ever have been in all my life. I know who i am ‚Ä¶but doesnt mean i really know how to be me. I am very simple and not as complex as im made out to be. I know that now them im older I just seem to have faded into a place where I have built a barrier for some reason. It is easier not to get hurt, not feel any kind of voices telling me that I am not ..whatever ‚Ä¶ I guess im happy being a hermit and keeping the rest of the world out. Is it healthy? probly not. How did i get here? I dont know. I feel that it is so methodical the way I live my life. I am a robot with no feelings or wants or needs, just methodical. I used to have faith in love and all that but it comes with to much expectations or questions of why arent you‚Ä¶why dont you‚Ä¶..the question is‚Ä¶why cant i just be‚Ä¶me‚Ä¶.no other person. I have not known myself for so long..this new journey is a darkened path filled with things that just take my breath away. I dont even know if I will even continue counseling in the criminal justice system., it takes so much out of you and you really dont have nothing more to give anyone., not even yourself,. I definately have given up on life. I live but im not living. I look at myself and I have forgotten what its really like to be happy. I just exist because I dont want to feel right now. I dont want to hear anything from anyone regarding me. I want to keep it off me, im sick of talking about me.! The more i hear about what i do or dont do it just keeps me sinking back to the person who hasnt learned to deal with these things. I have come along way yes‚Ä¶i show hints of greatness, but in reality moments like this‚Ä¶no one knows about because its times like this when you dont want to be told what you are‚Ä¶or where you should be or what ever. I am cloudy‚Ä¶I am tired‚Ä¶I am wore out ‚Ä¶I have not much to give myself daily‚Ä¶I try to be friendly., I try to be real, and at the end of the day‚Ä¶.im empty. I leave work at work, but by the time im out of work‚Ä¶.I dont carry a ounce of energy i went in with. I know no one thinks my job is that hard‚Ä¶or that draining‚Ä¶say that til you work in it for a day. I am rethinking the love i had for it., today i had no counselor terms, no feeling, no care about doing a good job, i just wanted the day to end. I am not who¬† i was when i moved here‚Ä¶.im lost, im hazey and im ousted. I can change this, but you know‚Ä¶where do i begin, ? climb up martin‚Ä¶..for what? climb up martin‚Ä¶you can do it‚Ä¶..why should i? climb up martin‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶im slippin in the mudsoaked creavace of humanity. God if you hear me today‚Ä¶i am mad at you..for some reason, i stopped talking to you. I dont want to talk to you when i feel so lost and alone. I dont want anyone to be around right now. but, i know i cant live alone‚Ä¶..FUK‚Ä¶.delirium of a mad mind gone array‚Ä¶.where do i start where do i stop‚Ä¶‚Ä¶why is it all a question‚Ä¶..tired of laying down and trying to sleep it away‚Ä¶tired of looking at the sad faces with no hope‚Ä¶.tired of the faces with smiles while they to have no clue‚Ä¶‚Ä¶where is the reality and where is the falseness of insanity‚Ä¶..where do you go when your mind wont go right and where your vision never sees clear‚Ä¶in the heat you drown in sweat‚Ä¶in the night you cry yourself to somberness of calm..while your insides shake and crumble when you laugh as the jester steals another round from your hand of uncertainty‚Ä¶and life.None of this is ment to make sense‚Ä¶just thoughts‚Ä¶.dont try to decipher it or personalize it‚Ä¶.im lost‚Ä¶.and i have a wall ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶two things that are not good when you are trying to be honest and open‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..the faces burn a hole in my heart ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..why arent they real? why arent they clear‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.are they all full of fear?god if you hear me‚Ä¶..i havent walked away‚Ä¶..just dont feel you right now‚Ä¶.where are you? where are you? ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..incomplete‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..bye

song: cold and empty by kid rock
I woke up this morning with alot going on in my mind.

Maybe I‚Äôve been on the road too long 
Livin‚Äô my life through these songs 
I guess lovin a music man 
Really wasn‚Äôt in your plans 
Does it matter if I‚Äôm sorry again 
And why should I apologize 
You knew all along this was my life 
You know my ins and outs 
All of my fears and doubts 
It‚Äôsthe life I love 
But it‚Äôs you I can‚Äôt live without 
And this whole world seems 
cold and empty 
Someone please turn on the lights 
Lord if there‚Äôs an angel you could send me 
I could use one here tonight 
Now where am I supposed to go 
My only home was in your soul 
I know that I can‚Äôt stay here 
And drown in a pool of tear Should I pack my pride 
And face this life alone 

And this whole world seems 
cold and empty 
Someone please turn on the lights 
Lord if there‚Äôs an angel you could send me 
I could use on here tonight 
Maybe it‚Äôs me who‚Äôs cold and empty 
And in my darkness I cannot see the light 
Please God if there‚Äôs an angel you could send me 
Cause there‚Äôs one missin from my life 
You are my heart, you are my soul 
Wherever you are that‚Äôs where I go 
You know my ins and outs 
All of my fears and doubts 
It‚Äôs the life I love 
But it‚Äôs you I can‚Äôt live without 
Yea it‚Äôs the life I love 
But it‚Äôs you I can‚Äôt live without 
Baby it‚Äôs the life I love 
But its you I can;t live without 
The life I love 
The life I love 
But its you I can‚Äôt live with

Look at me 
You may think you see 
Who I really am 
but you‚Äôll never know me 
Every day 
It‚Äôs as if I play a part 
Now I see 
If I wear a mask 
I can fool the world 
But I cannot fool my heart 
Who is that gurl I see 
Staring straight back at me? 
When will my reflection show

Have to hide my heart 
And what i believe in

mood: better since the cold symptoms subsiding
song: how do i deal with it by frankie j
hey journal, 
I thought I would stop by and write some things down to unload them from my mind. I am really just thinking back on where all this started and I think it started the moment I moved to midland and started working with criminal offenders, the isolation of the mind, the escape to the ps2. I was under a stressful part of my life and had no coping skills. I didnt want to talk about my work, didnt want to act as if I had nothing wrong with me. I took that all the way up here. I thought that since I was learning how to be a better counselor that I was overcoming the things that seemed to be taking me further and further from the ones that love me, and first and foremost away from god. I have been in a mindset that so much comes at me I retreat back to my wall for protection and I dont want anyone around because I dont have the copacity to deal with anytype of disagreement or anything else. I am very open and hard to get anytype of negative statement directed at me when I am around it all day long. I have been so selfish, thinking my job could be the one thing that could make me feel better about me.I know all these things I am saying may seem like rational but its honest. I feel so overwhelmed by life today unlike I ever have in my lifetime. I used to drink, chase unmet stuff to get some kind of sanity and I know now that I dont want that, or need it. I need to have faith and to trust in god. I have some great people that care about me but since I have been trying to hide out when Im not at work, I have been pushing them away as well. Its a very hard field to be in and you wouldnt understand it unless you trully understand the disease process. It goes beyond the everyday addict, these are criminal offenders as well, so double the addict mentallity and then add the criminal mind to it. I am almost at my 2000 hours and I am wondering man, did I make the correct choice. Look at all I have lost, and when it comes around its like I dont know how to be me anymore, I am a sunken down emotionless person today, I somehow forgot how good I used to feel. I left him here in denton before I moved to midland. I hate confrontation and seems like that is all that is around these days‚Ä¶the why‚Ä¶..the why dont you‚Ä¶‚Ä¶and I need professional counseling for this to really learn how to cope when it happens in my daily life because if I dont get it, I will never be able to be a part of my life trully. I dont like any kind of sarcasm or anytype of rejection type behavior aimed at me. I do that enough to me, it only amplifys it. Unfortanately I cant afford it right now to go to a dr for help. I just sit here and look in the mirror and ask myself who are you? where did that glow go? where did that shine in your eyes go? I have always depended on my self so to say its because I am alone without a gf¬† is it isnt the truth. I have always been able to keep that, with or without someone. I just am at a point where I dont want nothing, dont know why I am feeling the way I am. I dont like bringing others in my life when I am feeling like this because they take things so personal alot of times better to go thru this alone. I am a product of abuse, a product of unlearned coping skills, I havent trully learned nothing but to write about it, pray and have faith. These lessons are great , but how do i handle stress, handle anger, handle disappointment, handle relationship problems, handle the feeling of not doing everything perfectly, handle the confusion of my identity. all these things go on in my mind, money doesnt make them all go away, material things dont rid them, in the end its only temporary. I dont like me most of the time, and thats only being honest. Regardless if i listen to the voice of truth or not, i have days when i say man‚Ä¶.why am i here? I am just at a point where I know i cant go on like this. I cant. progression happens slowly‚Ä¶to a person who wants and needs to be in control seems like a crawling space. This is my personal honesty, so to say I am not this doesnt do any good with me‚Ä¶this is what i see in the mirror, this is the feelings that beat in my chest..this is the person i live with daily, this isnt because i dont want to not be this, its because i dont know how to take the steps to stay away from this person. like learning to walk‚Ä¶you need to remember the steps to get up when you fall down, because you will fall down eventually. if you never learned you would never know how to get back up. Praying helps and belief helps but what do you do when you are waiting for the miracle to happen? talking to others helps, but what if you have had comments made in the past about ‚Ä¶this is all you do is be negative? see it takes a way to get yourself going‚Ä¶cause in reality there is no nonconditional help out there. oh well, like everything else‚Ä¶i will find the answer to this eventually and in the mean time i will write and write til i get the solution that i am looking for. talk to you later journal‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

song: blues man by alan jackson
hey journal, 
I come to you today not in pity, not in the pain of my life but in the pain I have caused in someone else‚Äôs life. I talked to britt the other night and finally told her what i viewed as the truth. It has not been all her at all. Im¬† sick, all the symptoms of the abuse over the last two years‚Ä¶hurt people do hurt people and I guess I was so caught up in my problems that I never saw all that I was doing to her or her family. I dont mean to be so self centered. Re-enactment (history repeats itself). I dont have the right to feel anything right now but try to accept the consequences of my poor choices and decisions. It is not anyones fault but my own, whether relevent or just viewed as all out disregard I did them. The why‚Äôs and why not dont matter. To be honest means to finally take accountability for all that has happend. I read susan‚Äôs entry while ago and I cant believe all this is happening or has happend. It is like standing back as someone else is or was doing this. Disassociation from the truth in the easiness to do things that are not with feeling. I am sad for them, I know all the disappointment they see in me. I am not a victim, I am the one that did it. Did I do it intentional? No, I didnt set out in the beginning to hurt anyone. I felt that I had moved on from my last relationship and could embrace this one with new hopes and desire.I hate that anyone must feel hurt and disappointment because of my actions. We talked about re-enactment yesterday and until today I have been thinking on where all this started.All I can say is that sorry dont cut all I have put you guys through. I dont play the victim here, I take accountability for my actions, but I have only done what I have been taught. Im¬† sorry and I will put mine on favs only as well, thanks for bringing me to god, I love you guys and always will please dont hate me. martin

The wounding that needs to be healed is the result of being raised in a shame-based, emotionally dishonest, Spiritually hostile environment by parents who were raised in a shame-based, emotionally dishonest, Spiritually hostile environment.¬† The disease which afflicts us is a generational disease that is the human condition as we have inherited it.¬† Our parents did not know how to be emotionally honest or how to truly Love themselves.¬† So there is no way that we could have learned those things from them.¬† 
We formed our core relationship with ourselves in early childhood and then built our relationship with ourselves on that foundation.¬† We lived life reacting to the wounds that we suffered in early childhood ‚Äì and the defenses our egos adapted because of those emotional wounds and the dysfunctional intellectual programming we were subjected to growing up in dysfunctional cultures with wounded codependents as our role models.¬† Living life in reaction to old wounds and old tapes is dysfunctional ‚Äì it does not work to help us find some happiness and fulfillment in life.¬† 
It is possible to feel the feelings without being the victim of them or victimizing other‚Äôs with them.¬† It is possible to change the way you think so that your mind is no longer your worst enemy.¬† It is possible to become empowered to have choices in life at the same time you are letting go of trying to be in control.¬† Life can be an exciting, enjoyable adventure if you stop reacting to it out of your childhood emotional wounds and attitudes. ~ Robert Burney May 2002
¬† It is the framework and perspectives of this approach that can help you to see your self more clearly and objectively so that you can learn to intervene in your own internal process to change dysfunctional mental programming and compassionately heal emotional wounds.¬† You can learn to have some Loving control over your own inner process instead of trying to control your behavior and feelings with shame, judgment and fear.¬† Codependency both feeds on, and creates magnified levels of, shame, judgment and fear ‚Äì and the only way to break out of the vicious, self-perpetuating, self-destructive cycles of the disease is to start learning to be Loving to self. 
Love is a verb ‚Äì it needs to be manifested in action not just contemplated intellectually.¬† You can not learn to Love yourself ‚Äì or be capable of having healthier relationships ‚Äì without taking action to change your core / foundation relationship with self and life into one that is more aligned with Love.¬† This inner child healing work is an effective and powerful formula that allows you to learn:¬† to be more Loving to self;¬† to gain some freedom from the past;¬† to develop inner peace and serenity;¬† to own your response-ability as co-creator of your life so that you can become a positive co-creator instead of negative (learn to be your own best friend instead of your own worst enemy);¬† to start relaxing and being present for your life in a way that creates a more balanced and enjoyable experience.¬† I highly recommend it. ~ Robert ‚Äì February 29, 2004 
""Inner child work is in one way detective work.¬† We have a mystery to solve.¬† Why have I have I been attracted to the the type of people that I have been in relationship with in my life?¬† Why do I react in certain ways in certain situations?¬† Where did my behavior patterns come from?¬† Why do I sometimes feel so: helpless; lonely; desperate; scared; angry; suicidal; etc."" 
""That is the purpose of inner child healing ‚Äì to stop letting our experiences of the past dictate how we respond to life today.¬† It cannot be done without revisiting our childhood.¬† We need to become aware, to raise our consciousness.¬† To create a new level of consciousness for ourselves that allows us to observe ourselves."" 
""It is necessary to own and honor the child who we were in order to Love the person we are. And the only way to do that is to own that child‚Äôs experiences, honor that child‚Äôs feelings, and release the emotional grief energy that we are still carrying around."" 
""We all have an inner critic, a critical parent voice, that beats us up with shame, judgment, and fear.¬† The critical parent voice developed to try to control our emotions and our behaviors because we got the message there was something wrong with us and that our survival would be threatened if we did, said, or felt the ""wrong"" things.""
¬†Inner Child Healing ‚Äì How to begin
""Recovery involves bringing to consciousness those beliefs and attitudes in our subconscious that are causing our dysfunctional reactions so that we can reprogram our ego defenses to allow us to live a healthy, fulfilling life instead of just surviving.¬† So that we can own our power to make choices for ourselves about our beliefs and values instead of unconsciously reacting to the old tapes.¬† Recovery is consciousness raising.¬† It is en-light-en-ment ‚Äì bringing the dysfunctional attitudes and beliefs out of the darkness of our subconscious into the Light of consciousness.
On an emotional level the dance of Recovery is owning and honoring the emotional wounds so that we can release the grief energy ‚Äì the pain, rage, terror, and shame that is driving us.¬† 
That shame is toxic and is not ours ‚Äì it never was!¬† We did nothing to be ashamed of ‚Äì we were just little kids.¬† Just as our parents were little kids when they were wounded and shamed, and their parents before them, etc., etc.¬† This is shame about being human that has been passed down from generation to generation. 
There is no blame here, there are no bad guys, only wounded souls and broken hearts and scrambled minds."" 
(Quotations in this color are from Codependence: The Dance of Wounded Souls)
Inner child work is in one way detective work.¬† We have a mystery to solve.¬† Why have I have I been attracted to the the type of people that I have been in relationship with in my life?¬† Why do I react in certain ways in certain situations?¬† Where did my behavior patterns come from?¬† Why do I sometimes feel so: helpless; lonely; desperate; scared; angry; suicidal; etc. 
Just starting to ask these types of questions, is the first step in the healing process.¬† It is healthy to start wondering about the cause and effect dynamics in our life.¬† 
In our codependence, we reacted to life out of a black and white, right and wrong, belief paradigm that taught us that is was shameful and bad to be wrong, to make mistakes, to be imperfect ‚Äì to be human.¬† We formed our core relationship with our self and with life in early childhood based on the messages we got, the emotional trauma we suffered, and the role modeling of the adults around us.¬† As we grew up,

we built our relationship with self, other people, and life on the foundation we formed in early childhood. 
When we were 5, we were already reacting to life out of the emotional trauma of earlier ages.¬† We adapted defenses to try to protect ourselves and to get our survival needs met.¬† The defenses adapted at 5 due to the trauma suffered at earlier ages led to further trauma when we were 7 that then caused us to adjust our defenses, that led to wounding at 9, etc., etc., etc. 
Toxic shame is the belief that there is something inherently wrong with who we are, with our being.¬† Guilt is ""I made a mistake, I did something wrong.""¬† Toxic shame is:¬† ""I am a mistake. There is something wrong with me."" 
It is very important to start awakening to the Truth that there is nothing inherently wrong with our being ‚Äì it is our relationship with our self and with life that is dysfunctional.¬† And that relationship was formed in early childhood. 
The way that one begins inner child healing is simply to become aware.¬† 
To become aware that the governing principle in life is cause and effect.
To become aware that our relationship with our self is dysfunctional. 
To become aware that we have the power to change our relationship with our self. 
To become aware that we were programmed with false beliefs about the purpose and nature of life in early childhood ‚Äì and that we can change that programming.



To become aware that we have emotional wounds from childhood that 
it is possible to get in touch with and heal enough to stop them from dictating how we are living our life today.¬†That is the purpose of inner child healing ‚Äì to stop letting our experiences of the past dictate how we respond to life today.¬† It cannot be done without revisiting our childhood. 
We need to become aware, to raise our consciousness.¬† To create a new level of consciousness for ourselves that allows us to observe ourselves. 
It is vitally important to start observing ourselves ‚Äì our reactions, our feelings, our thoughts ‚Äì from a detached witness place that is not shaming. 
We all have an inner critic, a critical parent voice, that beats us up with shame, judgment, and fear.¬† The critical parent voice developed to try to control our emotions and our behaviors because we got the message there was something wrong with us and that our survival would be threatened if we did, said, or felt the ""wrong"" things. 
It is vital to start learning how to not give power to that critical shaming voice.¬† We need to start observing ourselves with compassion.¬† This is almost impossible at the beginning of the inner child healing process ‚Äì having compassion for our self, being Loving to our self, is the hardest thing for us to do.¬† 
So, we need to start observing ourselves from at least a more neutral perspective.¬† Become a scientific observer, a detective ‚Äì the Sherlock Holmes of your own inner process as it were. 
We need to start being that detective, observing ourselves and asking ourselves where that reaction / thought / feeling is coming from.¬† Why am I feeling this way?¬† What does this remind me of from my past?¬† How old do I feel right now?¬† How old did I act when that happened? 
One of the amazing things about this process, is that as one starts to become more aware of our own reactions, we also start to become more aware of others.¬† We start seeing when the people in our lives are reacting like a little kid, or adolescent, or teenager, or whatever.¬† The more we become aware of their reactions, the easier it becomes to stop taking their behavior personally ‚Äì which then makes it easier to detach from our own reactions and observe ourselves. 
It is an amazing, miraculous process, that can help us to change our relationship with our self, with other people, and with life.¬† Becoming more aware, becoming conscious of a new way of looking at ourselves and life is the beginning of a process of learning to forgive and Love our self. 
A detective always looks at cause and effect.¬† By becoming a detective, solving the mystery of why we have lived our lives as we have, we can start to free ourselves from our past.¬† By doing the inner child healing, we can start to learn how to really be alive instead of just surviving and enduring.
This is all for one day‚Ä¶.off to re-read and take god with me. To finally understand how to incorporate this in my life. I need to, I lost someone dear to me.

song: Don‚Äôt by shania twain
hey journal,
I am sorry that i only typed what I did the last time but I was running low on time and so decided to get my praise to jesus as quickly as I was feeling it. I am at work and thinking on how the bridges of the times have just been gapped in most of our minds even though somehow in our souls we know and feel the right and wrong button as we are about to do something. I am still thinking on the beating portion of that movie how intense that was. I felt every hit, every cut. I died in there as well, a portion of me that had the question if eternity is real or a myth. I understand fully the implications of my juggling the balls of belief and faith & confusion and doubt. I love this song called here am i‚Ä¶.about sending someone to help pass the word of jesus to those that have never heard his name or story of his great sacrifice for all of humanity. I told a co-worker tonight that i am truly humbled to the point of being unable to get off my knees. It took a film to get me to believe the truth, the light , the answer. I am thankful that I was able to get into that theatre to witness the child of god, and his story. I will never forget it. I am going to see it again and read the scriptures where I can start to really be a christian instead of the false pretense that I have been struggling with. I want to go to heaven. I want to live for eternity. I dont want to burn in hell or to live life in question anymore. I see people that only care about money, and this and that., but never do you hear his praise or thank you lord for blessing me.I have also been hit to a point of my own mortality while viewing this film. I urge you if you havent been saved or even if you dont know the truth or the light of eternity‚Ä¶find it today please! All those things you base life on they are all gonna be lost in time, only true paradise awaits in heaven. I have had ugly notes put on my jrnl by cowards that I have prayed for their ignorance and unknowing behavior. The devil trys to get you when you are taking a stand for the lord. I will not denounce his name anymore even though I thought I was a sound christian I had no idea the extent of my naiveness. True love was displayed on the cross, the love for the world that has never been shown again,ever. All the flags we fly in the name of the mighty US‚Ä¶then to murder all that opose. We condemn, the innocent the speakers of the truth, the true believers, we are quick to call these episodes physchological ""delusions"". If this is being crazy in someones eyes‚Ä¶.i dont care call me as you will. ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..I love Jesus christ and God almighty‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.Find them today before its to late‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..isnt it time to clean your soul for eternity? praise glory to the real king? How great is your love? He bled on that cross, he got whipped, punched, kicked, denied, ridiculed, all for you..and I. What price to we pay to know him? it is free, his suffereing enabled us to find him and start loving him and his father. Salvation of the heart rids the tortured mind, there is nothing you can ever go thru that will top the ultimate sacrifice‚Ä¶SO HOP off the cross and defend it from being attacked again starting with you‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..and from within‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.live it ‚Ä¶love it‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶own it‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.may god bless you truly‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..amen>

I didnt go to work today because I felt that I couldnt go and be the person I feel like today. I feel like I need a day to be good to myself and finally get back to what I know is where I need to be instead of saying ill do it tommorow, ill pray in a bit, ill do this and that. In essence everything became more important then the goodness I was a part of. I let all the lies , the negativity and the ability to go back to the inner child , in essense was a easy way out because I know who god is and how to allow him back into my life. I am a coward allowing all the stupid crap that I have done and hurt the people that I have. I am not writing to put up a front. I am being honest and tired of wearing a mask. I am a child of god, I am not that person I have become. I am not of the world, I just let myself be for this long. Here is a poem I wrote a while back and I was trully led by the voice of god. I didnt know it at the time, i do know now that god has always lead me thru all that I have been thru.,He placed the bell‚Äôs in my life not to get hurt as they have by me, but to show me that belief in the lord is the most important thing and with that nothing can not be without love. I know a sorry doesnt cure the hurt and pain and disappointment I have brought to you brittany, but I am trully sorry. I dont know if you even read this anymore but I have to say it for my sanity. the devil is not going to have me, i have allowed him to do so and justified it. NOt stood for the truth I know exists! ugh i make myself sick how easily I have been swayed to place a profile¬† on a dating site, to make new screenames to act as if i was single, to deceive brittany and to lie, why? because I was lost in the world of the lies. The devil was whom I have been listening to. Not god not jesus, I do have my flaws, and my character defects. I am taking this minute by minute. I am trying to stay in the word‚Ä¶.trying to read back on what susan used to write to me and how i listed to her. I am trying to understand my ignorance and to know it was the devil tricking me. to think you can do this. you dont need this or that‚Ä¶.look at what it is doing to you‚Ä¶.blada blada UHHHHH!!!! all Freaking lies@!‚Ä¶..oh well, ill be back‚Ä¶later to type more. 
here is my poem‚Ä¶.read it martin;)
In the ocean of pariless hearts,there is the stumbled
and numb feeling of the waves crashing slowly
on the crest of the worlds eyes. Often we allow,
the motions of the waves to take us where it will,
but alot of times we fight the current of the soul.
A innocent child smiles and is happy with out fear,
then we teach them to be lenient when all is born brand 
new,we break the kindered kind soul of a heavenly gift,
and replace it with doubt, and fear of the unknown. 
a homeless guy sits in the gutter of humanity and asks,
for a crumb from the social structure of all we hold dear,
we shun him and throw dirt in his filty ears of yesterday.
A demon that made him lose his wife, his children, his life,
now we echo those in his fallen tears. Instead of helping 
him up from the ground we help put him in it, with every
spit from our lips, he just smiles and stays on his knees,
he has learned a little late that the demon wasnt his to own,
but to slay in the name of salvation and love, but its to late to 
the wife, the child, and his life, all he has is the dirtied crate 
in which he sleeps. A crumb from our moments as we walk
by, would maybe lift him from the salvation of his knees to the light 
from up above, watch him cry, watch him cry, hands aimed towards the 
sky, asking why? why? why? Please take me today as I have lost all faith in
life‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶from the sky comes a rainbow and a drop that cures his eyes,
let the demon die, let him die.

""We are set up to be emotionally dysfunctional by our role models, both parental and societal.¬† We are taught to repress and distort our own emotional process.¬† We are trained to be emotionally dishonest when we are children.
This emotional repression and dishonesty causes society to be emotionally dysfunctional.¬† Additionally, urban based civilization has completely disregarded natural laws and natural cycles such as the human developmental process.¬† There is no integration into our culture of the natural human developmental process. 
As just one blatant example of this, consider how most so called primitive or aboriginal societies react to the onset of puberty.¬† When a girl starts menstruating, ceremonies are held to celebrate her womanhood ‚Äì to honor her coming into her power, to honor her miraculous gift of being able to conceive.¬† Boys go through training and initiation rites to help them make the transition from boyhood to manhood.¬† Look at what we have in our society: junior high school ‚Äì a bunch of scared, insecure kids who torture each other out of their confusion and fear, and join gangs to try to find an identity. 
This lack of integration of the natural human growth process causes trauma.¬† At each stage of the developmental process we were traumatized because of the emotionally repressive, Spiritually hostile environment into which we were born.¬† We went into the next stage incomplete and then were retraumatized, were wounded again."" 
(Quotations in this color are from Codependence: The Dance of Wounded Souls)
For all of the so called progress of our modern societies, we still are far behind most aboriginal cultures in terms of respect for individual rights and dignity in some kind of balance with the good of the whole.¬† (I am speaking here of tribal aboriginal societies ‚Äì not urbanized ones.)¬† Nowhere is this more evident in terms of our relationship to our children. 
Modern civilizations ‚Äì both Eastern and Western ‚Äì are no more than a generation or two removed from the belief that children were property.¬† This, of course, goes hand in hand with the belief that women were property.¬† The idea that children have rights, individuality, and dignity is relatively new in modern society.¬† The predominant and underlying belief, as it has been manifested in the treatment of children, has been that children are extensions of, and tools to be used by, their parents. 
A very telling insight into the basic beliefs underlying Western attitudes towards children is shared by inner child pioneer Alice Miller in her book The Drama of The Gifted Child.¬† She shares how the 19th Century German Philosophers who laid the groundwork for modern psychology, emphasized the importance of stamping out a child‚Äôs ""exuberance.""¬† In other words, a child‚Äôs spirit must be crushed in order to control them. 
Children are to be seen and not heard.¬† Spare the rod and spoil the child. 
It is only in very recent history, that our society has even recognized child abuse as a crime instead of an inherent right of the parent.¬† The concept of healthy parenting as a skill to be learned is very new in society. 
Any society that does not respect and honor individual human dignity, is going to be a society that does not meet the essential needs of it‚Äôs members.¬† Patriarchal societies, that demean and degrade women and children, are dysfunctional in their essence. 
We form our core relationship with our self and with life ‚Äì and of course with other people ‚Äì in early childhood in reaction to the messages we get from the way we are treated and the role modeling of the other people in our lives.¬† We then have no training or initiation ceremonies, no culturally approved grieving process, to help us let go of the old programming and learn a different relationship with our self and life.¬† So, we build upon the foundation laid in early childhood. 
As adults, we react to the programming of our childhood. To contend that our childhood emotional wounds have not affected our adult lives is ridiculous.¬† To think that our early programming has not influenced the way we have lived is to be in denial to an extreme. 
Because societies standards for what constitutes success are dysfunctional, many people can be pointed out who ""have risen above"" their past to be a success.¬† It is those people, who are supposedly successful, that are running the world.¬† How good a job do you think they are doing? 
It is our world leaders, reacting out of the fear and insecurity of their inner children, and the dysfunctional belief systems underlying civilization, who give us war and poverty, billionaires and homelessness. 
My book, Codependence: The Dance of Wounded Souls, evolved out of a talk that I first did in 1991.¬† In the talk, I stated that I would like to one day make up a bumper sticker that said ""Work for World Peace, Heal Your Inner Child.""¬† I did have these bumper stickers printed when I published my book.¬† It is, I believe, an essential Truth.¬† We will never have world peace, or a civilized society which is based upon respect and dignity ‚Äì to say nothing of Love ‚Äì unless we can heal our relationships with ourselves enough to learn to Love and respect our self. 
We cannot Love our neighbor as our self, as long as we are judging and comparing our self to them in order to feel good about our self.¬† We cannot have a society that meets the essential emotional and spiritual needs of it‚Äôs members as long as we are reacting to life in alignment with rules of interaction that we learned in junior high school. 
We are all connected ‚Äì not separate.¬† We all have worth and deserved to be treated with dignity and respect ‚Äì instead of earning societies version of worth by stepping on and over our fellow humans, to say nothing of destroying the planet we live on. 
It is through healing our inner child wounds that we can learn to respect and Love our self so that we can know how to treat others with respect and Love.¬† It is through healing our inner children that we can save our planet and evolve into a society that does meet the essential needs of it‚Äôs members. 
Inner child healing is not some fad or pop psychology.¬† Inner child healing is the only way to empower ourselves to stop living life in reaction to the past.¬† We have been ignoring history and repeating it for centuries.¬† If we are going to have a chance to reverse the self destructive patterns of human kind, it is going to come from individuals healing self.¬† By healing our inner child wounds, we can change the world

Learning to Love our self
by Robert Burney M.A.
""Codependence is an emotional and behavioral defense system which was adopted by our egos in order to meet our need to survive as a child.¬† Because we had no tools for reprogramming our egos and healing our emotional wounds (culturally approved grieving, training and initiation rites, healthy role models, etc.), the effect is that as an adult we keep reacting to the programming of our childhood and do not get our needs met ‚Äì our emotional, mental, Spiritual, or physical needs.¬† Codependence allows us to survive physically but causes us to feel empty and dead inside.¬† Codependence is a defense system that causes us to wound ourselves.""
""We need to take the shame and judgment out of the process on a personal level.¬† It is vitally important to stop listening and giving power to that critical place within us that tells us that we are bad and wrong and shameful.

""We need to start observing ourselves and stop judging ourselves.¬† Any time we judge and shame ourselves, we are feeding back into the disease, we are jumping back into the squirrel cage."" 
(Quotations in this color are from Codependence: The Dance of Wounded Souls)
Codependence is a dysfunctional defense system that was built in reaction to feeling unlovable and unworthy ‚Äì because our parents were wounded codependents who didn‚Äôt know how to love themselves.¬† We grew up in environments that were emotionally dishonest, Spiritually hostile, and shame based.¬† Our relationship with ourselves (and all the different parts of our self: emotions, gender, spirit, etc.) got twisted and distorted in order to survive in our particular dysfunctional environment.
We got to an age where we were supposed to be an adult and we started acting like we knew what we were doing.¬† We went around pretending to be adult at the same time we were reacting to the programming that we got growing up.¬† We tried to do everything ""right"" or rebelled and went against what we had been taught was ""right.""¬† Either way we weren‚Äôt living our life through choice, we were living it in reaction. 
In order to start being loving to ourselves we need to change our relationship with our self ‚Äì and with all the wounded parts of our self.¬†¬† The way which I have found works the best in starting to love ourselves is through having internal boundaries. 
Learning to have internal boundaries is a dynamic process that involves three distinctly different, but intimately interconnected, spheres of work.¬† The purpose of the work is to change our ego-programming ‚Äì to change our relationship with ourselves by changing our emotional/behavioral defense system into something that works to open us up to receive love, instead of sabotaging ourselves because of our deep belief that we don‚Äôt deserve love.¬† 
(I need to make the point here that Codependence and recovery are both multi-leveled, multi-dimensional phenomena. What we are trying to achieve is integration and balance on different levels. In regard to our relationship with ourselves this involves two major dimensions: the horizontal and the vertical. In this context the horizontal is about being human and relating to other humans and our environment. The vertical is Spiritual, about our relationship to a Higher Power, to the Universal Source. If we cannot conceive of a God/Goddess Force that loves us then it makes it virtually impossible to be loving to ourselves. So a Spiritual Awakening is absolutely vital to the process in my opinion. Changing our relationship with ourselves on the horizontal level is both a necessary element in, and possible because we are working on, integrating Spiritual Truth into our inner process.) 
These three spheres are: 
1.¬† Detachment 
2.¬† Inner Child Healing 
3.¬† Grieving 
Because Codependence is a reactive phenomena it is vital to start being able to detach from our own process in order to have some choice in changing our reactions.¬† We need to start observing our selves from the witness perspective instead of from the perspective of the judge.¬† 
We all observe ourselves ‚Äì have a place of watching ourselves as if from outside, or perched somewhere inside, observing our own behavior.¬† Because of our childhoods we learned to judge ourselves from that witness perspective, the ""critical parent"" voice.¬† 
The emotionally dishonest environments we were raised in taught us that it was not ok to feel our emotions, or that only certain emotions were ok.¬† So we had to learn ways to control our emotions in order to survive.¬† We adapted the same tools that were used on us ‚Äì guilt, shame, and fear (and saw in the role modeling of our parents how they reacted to life from shame and fear.)¬† This is where the critical parent gets born.¬† It‚Äôs purpose is to try to keep our emotions and behavior under some sort of control so that we can get our survival needs met. 
So the first boundary that we need to start setting internally is with the wounded / dysfunctionally programmed part of our own mind.¬† We nee


d to start saying no to the inner voices that are shaming and judgmental.¬† The disease comes from a black and white, right and wrong, perspective.¬† It speaks in absolutes: ""You always screw up!""¬† ""You will never be a success!"" ‚Äì these are lies. We don‚Äôt always screw up. We may never be a success according to our parents or societies dysfunctional definition of success ‚Äì but that is because our heart and soul do not resonate with those definitions, so that kind of success would be a betrayal of ourselves. We need to consciously change our definitions so that we can stop judging ourselves against someone else‚Äôs screwed up value system. 
We learned to relate to ourselves (and all the parts of our self ‚Äì emotions, sexuality, etc.) and life from a critical place of believing that something was wrong with us ‚Äì and in fear that we would be punished if we didn‚Äôt do life ""right.""¬† Whatever we are doing or not doing the disease can always find something to beat us up with.¬† I have 10 things on my ""to do list"" today, I get 9 of them done, the disease does not want me to give myself credit for what I have done but instead beats me up for the one I didn‚Äôt get done.¬† Whenever life gets too good we get uncomfortable and the disease jumps right in with fear and shame messages.¬† The critical parent voice keeps us from relaxing and enjoying life, and from loving our self.¬† 
We need to own that we have the power to choose where to focus our mind. We can consciously start viewing ourselves from the ""witness"" perspective.¬†¬† It is time to fire the judge ‚Äì our critical parent ‚Äì and choose to replace that judge with our Higher Self, who is a loving parent. We can then intervene in our own process to protect ourselves from the perpetrator within ‚Äì the critical parent/disease voice. 
(It is almost impossible to go from critical parent to compassionate loving parent in one step ‚Äì so the first step often is to try to observe ourselves from a neutral position or a ""scientific observer"" perspective.)¬† 
This is what enlightenment and consciousness raising are all about.¬† Owning our power to be a co-creator of our lives by changing our relationship with ourselves.¬† We can change the way we think.¬† We can change the way we respond to our own emotions. We need to detach from our wounded self in order to allow our Spiritual Self to guide us.¬† We are Unconditionally Loved.¬† The Spirit does not speak to us from judgment and shame.¬† 
One of the visualizations that has helped me over the years is an image of a small control room in my brain.¬† This control room is full of dials and gauges and lights and sirens. In this control room are a bunch of Keebler-like elves whose job it is to make sure that I don‚Äôt get too emotional for my own good.¬† Whenever I feel anything too strongly (including Joy, happiness, self-love) the lights start flashing and the sirens start wailing and the elves go crazy running around trying to get things under control.¬† They start pushing some of the old survival buttons:¬† feeling too happy ‚Äì drink; feeling too sad- eat sugar; feeling scared ‚Äì get laid; or whatever. 
To me, the process of recovery is about teaching those elves to chill out.¬† Reprogramming my ego-defenses to knowing that it is ok to feel the feelings.¬† That feeling and releasing the emotions is not only ok it is what will work best in allowing me to have my needs fulfilled.¬† 
We need to change our relationship with ourselves and our own emotions in order to stop being at war with ourselves.¬† The first step to doing that is to detach from ourselves enough to start protecting ourselves from the perpetrator that lives within us.
I love you martin‚Ä¶.today this moment is all you have‚Ä¶.god is listening , go talk to him‚Ä¶

Loving the Wounded Child Within¬†
by Robert Burney MA¬†
""It is through having the courage and willingness to revisit the emotional ""dark night of the soul"" that was our childhood, that we can start to understand on a gut level why we have lived our lives as we have.
It is when we start understanding the cause and effect relationship between what happened to the child that we were, and the effect it had on the adult we became, that we can Truly start to forgive ourselves. It is only when we start understanding on an emotional level, on a gut level, that we were powerless to do anything any differently than we did that we can Truly start to Love ourselves.¬† 
The hardest thing for any of us to do is to have compassion for ourselves.¬† As children we felt responsible for the things that happened to us.¬† We blamed ourselves for the things that were done to us and for the deprivations we suffered. There is nothing more powerful in this transformational process than being able to go back to that child who still exists within us and say, ""It wasn‚Äôt your fault.¬† You didn‚Äôt do anything wrong, you were just a little kid.""""¬† 
""As long as we are judging and shaming ourselves we are giving power to the disease. We are feeding the monster that is devouring us 
.¬† 
We need to take responsibility without taking the blame. We need to own and honor the feelings without being a victim of them.¬† 
We need to rescue and nurture and Love our inner children ‚Äì and STOP them from controlling our lives. STOP them from driving the bus!¬† Children are not supposed to drive, they are not supposed to be in control.¬† 
And they are not supposed to be abused and abandoned. We have been doing it backwards. We abandoned and abused our inner children. Locked them in a dark place within us. And at the same time let the children drive the bus ‚Äì let the children‚Äôs wounds dictate our lives.""¬† 
(Quotations in this color are from Codependence: The Dance of Wounded Souls)
When we were 3 or 4 we couldn‚Äôt look around us and say, ""Well, Dad‚Äôs a drunk and Mom is real depressed and scared ‚Äì that is why it feels so awful here.¬† I think I‚Äôll go get my own apartment.""¬†
Our parents were our higher powers.¬† We were not capable of understanding that they might have problems that had nothing to do with us.¬† So it felt like it was our fault.¬† 
We formed our relationship with ourselves and life in early childhood.¬† We learned about love from people who were not capable of loving in a healthy way because of their unhealed childhood wounds.¬† Our core / earliest relationship with our self was formed from the feeling that something is wrong and it must be me.¬† At the core of our being is a little kid who believes that he/she is unworthy and unlovable.¬† That was the foundation that we built our concept of ""self"" on.¬† 
Children are master manipulators. That is their job ‚Äì to survive in whatever way works.¬† So we adapted defense systems to protect our broken hearts and wounded spirits.¬† The 4 year old learned to throw tantrums, or be real quiet, or help clean the house, or protect the younger siblings, or be cute and funny, etc.¬† Then we got to be 7 or 8 and started being able to understand cause and effect and use reason and logic ‚Äì and we changed our defense systems to fit the circumstances.¬† Then we reach puberty and didn‚Äôt have a clue what was happening to us, and no healthy adults to help us understand, so we adapted our defense systems to protect our vulnerability.¬† And then we were teenagers and our job was to start becoming independent and prepare ourselves to be adults so we changed our defense systems once again. 
It is not only dysfunctional, it is ridiculous to maintain that what happened in our childhood did not affect our adult life.¬† We have layer upon layer of denial, emotional dishonesty, buried trauma, unfulfilled needs, etc., etc.¬† Our hearts were broken, our spirit‚Äôs wounded, our minds programmed dysfunctionally.¬† The choices we have made as adults were made in reaction to our childhood wounds / programming ‚Äì our lives have been dictated by our wounded inner children.¬† 
(History, politics, ""success"" or lack of ""success,"" in our dysfunctional society/civilizations can always be made clearer by looking at the childhoods of the individuals involved.¬† History has been, and is being, made by immature, scared, angry, hurt individuals who were/are reacting to their childhood wounds and programming ‚Äì reacting to the little child inside who feels unworthy and unlovable.)¬† 
It is very important to realize that we are not an integrated whole being ‚Äì to ourselves.¬† Our self concept is fractured into a multitude of pieces.¬† In some instances we feel powerful and strong, in others weak and helpless ‚Äì that is because different parts of us are reacting to different stimuli (different ""buttons"" are being pushed.)¬† The parts of us that feel weak, helpless, needy, etc. are not bad or wrong ‚Äì what is being felt is perfect for the reality that was experienced by the part of our self that is reacting (perfect for then ‚Äì but it has very little to do with what is happening in the now).¬† It is very important to start having compassion for that wounded part of ourselves. 
It is by owning our wounds that we can start taking the power away from the wounded part of us.¬† When we suppress the feelings, feel ashamed about our reactions, do not own that part of our being, then we give it power.¬† It is the feelings that we are hiding from that dictate


our behavior, that fuel obsession and compulsion.¬† 
Codependence is a disease of extremes.¬† 
Those of us who were horrified and deeply wounded by a perpetrator in childhood ‚Äì and were never going to be like that parent ‚Äì adapted a more passive defense system to avoid confrontation and ""hurting others.""¬† The more passive type of codependent defense system leads to a dominant pattern of being the victim. 
Those of us who were disgusted by, and ashamed of, the victim parent in childhood and vowed never to be like that role model, adapted a more aggressive defense system.¬† So we go charging through life being the bull in the china shop ‚Äì being the perpetrator who blames other people for not allowing us to be in control.¬†¬† The perpetrator that feels like a victim of other people not doing things ""right"" ‚Äì which is what forces us to bulldoze our way through life.¬† 
And, of course, some of us go first one way and then the other.¬† (We all have our own personal spectrum of extremes that we swing between ‚Äì sometimes being the victim, sometimes being the perpetrator.¬† Being a passive victim is perpetrating on those around us.) 
The only way we can be whole is to own all of the parts of ourselves.¬† By owning all the parts we can then have choices about how we respond to life.¬† By denying, hiding, and suppressing parts of ourselves we doom ourselves to live life in reaction.¬† 
A technique I have found very valuable in this healing process is to relate to the different wounded parts of our self as different ages of the inner child.¬† These different ages of the child may be literally tied to an event that happened at that age ‚Äì i.e. when I was 7 I tried to commit suicide. Or the age of the child might be a symbolic designator for a pattern of abuse/deprivation that occurred throughout our childhood ‚Äì i.e. the 9 year old within me feels completely emotionally isolated and desperately needy/lonely, a condition which was true for most of my childhood and not tied to any specific incident (that I know of) that happened when I was 9. 
By searching out, getting acquainted with, owning the feelings of, and building a relationship with, these different emotional wounds/ages of the inner child, we can start being a loving parent to ourselves instead of an abusive one.¬† We can have boundaries with ourselves that allow us to:¬† take responsibility for being a co-creator of our life (grow up);¬† protect our inner children from the perpetrator within/critical parent (be loving to ourselves); stop letting our childhood wounds control our life (take loving action for ourselves); and own the Truth of who we really are (Spiritual Beings) so that we can open up to receive the Love and Joy we deserve. 
It is impossible to Truly love the adult that we are without owning the child that we were.¬† In order to do that we need to detach from our inner process (and stop the disease from abusing us) so that we can have some objectivity and discernment that will allow us to have compassion for our own childhood wounds.¬† Then we need to grieve those wounds and own our right to be angry about what happened to us in childhood ‚Äì so that we can Truly know in our gut that it wasn‚Äôt our fault ‚Äì we were just innocent little kids.
I love you martin. 
be good to yourself today, it isnt selfishness, its about relearning to really know you. Keep going, God makes no mistakes , and has all the answers. Of earth there is nothing but tribulation of god, there is nothing but love. Love yourself today a little more.

""Emotions are energy that is manifested in our bodies.¬† They exist below the neck.¬† They are not thoughts (although attitudes set up our emotional reactions.)¬† In order to do the emotional healing it is vital to start paying attention to where energy is manifesting in our bodies.¬† Where is there tension, tightness?¬† Could that ""indigestion"" really be some feelings?¬† Are those ""butterflies"" in my stomach telling me something emotionally?""
""We are all carrying around repressed pain, terror, shame, and rage energy from our childhoods, whether it was twenty years ago or fifty years ago.¬† We have this grief energy within us even if we came from a relatively healthy family, because this society is emotionally dishonest and dysfunctional."" 
""Our emotions tell us who we are ‚Äì our Soul communicates with us through emotional energy vibrations.¬† Truth is an emotional energy vibrational communication from our Soul on the Spiritual Plane to our being/spirit/soul on this physical plane ‚Äì it is something that we feel in our heart/our gut, something that resonates within us.""
Feeling the Feelings¬†
by Robert¬† Burney MA
""Attempting to suppress emotions is dysfunctional; it does not work.¬† Emotions are energy:¬† E-motion = energy in motion.¬† It is supposed to be in motion, it was meant to flow.¬†
Emotions have a purpose, a very good reason to be ‚Äì even those emotions that feel uncomfortable.¬† Fear is a warning, anger is for protection, tears are for cleansing and releasing.¬† These are not negative emotional responses!¬† We were taught to react negatively to them.¬† It is our reaction that is dysfunctional and negative, not the emotion."" 
""The way to stop reacting out of our inner children is to release the stored emotional energy from our childhoods by doing the grief work that will heal our wounds.¬† The only effective, long term way to clear our emotional process ‚Äì to clear the inner channel to Truth which exists in all of us ‚Äì is to grieve the wounds which we suffered as children.¬† The most important single tool, the tool which is vital to changing behavior patterns and attitudes in this healing transformation, is the grief process.¬† The process of grieving. 
We are all carrying around repressed pain, terror, shame, and rage energy from our childhoods, whether it was twenty years ago or fifty years ago.¬† We have this grief energy within us even if we came from a relatively healthy family, because this society is emotionally dishonest and dysfunctional.""

Emotions are energy that is manifested in our bodies.¬† They exist below the neck.¬† They are not thoughts (although attitudes set up our emotional reactions.)¬† In order to do the emotional healing it is vital to start paying attention to where energy is manifesting in our bodies.¬† Where is there tension, tightness?¬† Could that ""indigestion"" really be some feelings?¬† Are those ""butterflies"" in my stomach telling me something emotionally? 
When I am working with someone and they start having some feelings coming up, the first thing I have to tell them is to keep breathing.¬† Most of us have learned a variety of ways to control our emotions and one of them is to stop breathing and close our throats.¬† That is because grief in the form of sadness accumulates in our upper chest and breathing into it helps some of it to escape ‚Äì so we learned to stop breathing at those moments when we start getting emotional, when our voice starts breaking. 
Western civilization has for many years been way out of balance towards the left brain way of thinking ‚Äì concrete, rational, what you see is all there is (this was in reaction to earlier times of being out of balance the other way, towards superstition and ignorance.)¬† Because emotional energy can not be seen or measured or weighed (""The x-ray shows you‚Äôve got 5 pounds of grief in there."") emotions were discounted and devalued.¬† This has started to change somewhat in recent years but most of us grew up in a society that taught us that being too emotional was a bad thing that we should avoid.¬† (Certain cultures / subcultures give more permission for emotions but those are usually out of balance to the other extreme of allowing the emotions to rule ‚Äì the goal is balance: between mental and emotional, between intuitive and rational.) 
Emotions are a vital part of our being for several reasons.¬† 
1. Because it is energy and energy cannot just disappear.¬† The emotional energy generated by the circumstances of our childhood and early life does not go away just because we were forced to deny it.¬† It is still trapped in our body ‚Äì in a pressurized, explosive state, as a result of being suppressed.¬† If we don‚Äôt learn how to release it in a healthy way it will explode outward or implode back in on us.¬† Eventually it will transform into some other form ‚Äì such as cancer.¬†
2.¬† As long as we have pockets of pressurized emotional energy that we have to avoid dealing with ‚Äì those emotional wounds will run our lives.¬† We use food, cigarettes, alcohol and drugs, work, religion, exercise, meditation, television, etc., to help us keep suppressing that energy.¬† To help us keep ourselves focused on something else, anything else, besides the emotional wounds that terrify us.¬† The emotional wounds are what cause obsession and compulsion, are what the ""critical parent"" voice works so hard to keep us from dealing with. 
3.¬† Our emotions tell us who we are ‚Äì our Soul communicates with us through emotional energy vibrations.¬† Truth is an emotional energy vibrational communication from our Soul on the Spiritual Plane to our being/spirit/soul on this physical plane ‚Äì it is something that we feel in our heart/our gut, something that resonates within us.¬† 
Our problem has been that because of our unhealed childhood wounds it has been very difficult to tell the difference between an intuitive emotional Truth and the emotional truth that comes from our childhood wounds.¬† When one of our buttons is pushed and we react out of the insecure, scared little kid inside of us (or the angry/rage filled kid, or the powerless/helpless kid, etc.) then we are reacting to what our emotional truth was when we were 5 or 9 or 14 ‚Äì not to what is happening now.¬† Since we have been doing th



at all of our lives, we learned not to trust our emotional reactions (and got the message not to trust them in a variety of ways when we were kids.) 
¬†4. We are attracted to people that feel familiar on an energetic level ‚Äì which means (until we start clearing our emotional process) people that emotionally / vibrationally feel like our parents did when we were very little kids.¬† At a certain point in my process I realized that if I met a woman who felt like my soul mate, that the chances were pretty huge that she was one more unavailable woman that fit my pattern of being attracted to someone who would reinforce the message that I wasn‚Äôt good enough, that I was unlovable.¬† Until we start releasing the hurt, sadness, rage, shame, terror ‚Äì the emotional grief energy ‚Äì from our childhoods we will keep having dysfunctional relationships.
I became willing to do the emotional healing in the summer of 1987 when I set myself up to be abandoned on my birthday one more time.¬† I called a counselor that I had been told was good with the emotional work.¬† It turned our that he was in the middle of moving to Hawaii and wasn‚Äôt doing counseling anymore.¬† But he said I could come over and talk to him as he packed.
I don‚Äôt remember anything that he said to me that day ‚Äì what I do remember is that as I sat in his house watching him pack I had a feeling, and a visual image, that I had just opened Pandora‚Äôs Box ‚Äì the monsters were loose now and I would never be able shut that box again. 
Doing the grief work is absolutely terrifying.¬† The word I came up with to describe how I felt was terrif***ingfying.¬† It felt like if I ever really owned the pain, I would end up crying in a rubber room for the rest of my life.¬† That if I ever really owned the rage, I would just go up and down the street shooting people.¬† That is not what happened.¬† The Spirit guided me through the process and gave me the resources I needed to release great quantities of that pent up, pressurized emotional energy.¬† To release enough to start learning who I really am, to start seeing my path more clearly, and to start forgiving myself and learning about love.¬† 
I still need to do the grieving/energy release work from time to time.¬† There is still a hole in my soul ‚Äì a seemingly bottomless abyss of wish-to-die-pain, shame, and unbearable suffering.¬†¬† But it is a much smaller hole and I don‚Äôt have to visit it very often.¬† 
The wounds don‚Äôt go away.¬† They have less power to dictate my life as I heal.¬† I needed to own that wounded part of me in order to start getting to know, and have compassion for, me.¬† I also needed to learn to have a balance because we can‚Äôt live in those feelings.¬† We need to own them and honor them in order to own and honor ourselves ‚Äì but then we need to learn to have internal boundaries that will allow us to find some balance in our life, allow us to to trust the process and our Higher Power.¬† 
We are on a Spiritual journey ‚Äì and the Force is with us.¬† It will help and guide us as we face the terror of owning how painful our human experience has been.¬† The more we are able to feel and release the feelings / emotional energy, the more clearly we can tune into the emotional energy that is Truth ‚Äì and Love, Light, Joy, Beauty ‚Äì coming from The Source Energy

Co-Creation: Owning your Power to Manifest Love ‚Äì codependency recovery
""The single most important step in this inner healing work is detachment.¬† It is developing a detached level of consciousness ‚Äì and observer / witness perspective ‚Äì that allows us to start practicing discernment in relationship to both our inner and outer process.¬† This facilitates the process of learning how to have internal boundaries so that we can start having the wisdom and clarity to integrate a Loving Spiritual belief system and intellectual knowledge of healthy behavior into our emotional relationship with life.¬† Then we are able to start achieving some emotional balance, and start owning our power to be a positive, conscious co-creator of our life experience ‚Äì a Loving, mature, empowered force in our own lives, instead of an unconscious co-creator out of the negative, self abusive, self sabotaging reactions that are caused by our emotional wounds and the codependent behavior patterns adapted in childhood.""
""The critical parent voice is rooted in the subconscious intellectual paradigm that is defining and dictating our life experience.¬† It is the play by play commentator that is providing running commentary on how well we are playing the game of¬† life ‚Äì and it is judging our performance based upon false beliefs about the nature and purpose of life, based upon a black and white perspective that dooms us to be the victim of being imperfect humans.¬† It dictates how we react to life and then judges us for those reactions. 
It is very important to start learning how to take power away from that critical parent voice so that we can start developing a witness perspective with a compassionate level of consciousness.¬† So that we can start learning how to be our own best friend ‚Äì instead of our own worst enemy."" 
""Detachment allows us to start taking some Loving control of our own internal process.¬† It allows us to start taking control over, and responsibility for, our thoughts and our feelings to the extent that is possible.¬† It allows us to create a space in our lives to start learning how to be Loving to ourselves instead of feeling like a victim of self and life. 
Detachment ‚Äì learning to observe our selves so that we can become more conscious ‚Äì is an act of Love.""
Codependency Recovery: Wounded Souls Dancing in the Light
by Robert Burney
A ""state of Grace"" is the condition of being Loved unconditionally by our Creator without having to earn that Love.¬† We are Loved unconditionally by the Great Spirit.¬† What we need to do is to learn to accept that state of Grace. 
The way we do that is to change the attitudes and beliefs within us that tell us that we are not Lovable.¬† And we cannot do that without going through the black hole.¬† The black hole that we need to surrender to traveling through is the black hole of our grief.¬† The journey within ‚Äì through our feelings ‚Äì is the journey to knowing that we are Loved, that we are Lovable. 
It is through willingness and acceptance, through surrender, trust, and faith, that we can begin to own the state of Grace which is our True condition. 
We are all beautiful swans who exist in a state of Grace, in a condition of being unconditionally Loved.¬† The dance of Rec

overy is a process of learning to accept and integrate the Truth of Grace into our lives. 
The goal in this Age of Healing and Joy is integration and balance.¬† To integrate the Spiritual Truth into our physical experience so that we can fill the hole inside and find wholeness within.¬† As we integrate our True Spiritual nature into our relationship with our physical being we can begin to achieve some balance and harmony with and between all of the parts of our being.¬† 
This age is a time for growing and learning, a time to become conscious of the True nature of the Source Energy, a time of Spiritual Awakening.¬† We have been given the wonder-full gift of having the ability and the tools to start integrating the Truth of a Loving Universal Force into our day-to-day experience of life.¬† We now have the knowledge and guidance that we need to start bringing some balance to our relationships ‚Äì with ourselves and our God/Goddess, with other people and the planet ‚Äì so that we can live in a way that allows us to experience some Peace and Love on our life path. 
We can heal our wounded souls enough to change the dance of life from a dance of endurance and suffering to a dance that celebrates living.¬† We now have access to the power to transform the dance of Codependence to a dance of healing and Joy. 
(Text in this color are quotes from Codependence: The Dance of Wounded Souls by Robert Burney)
Codependency Recovery: Wounded Souls Dancing in the Light is what I have been calling my next book.¬† This is to be a process level book ‚Äì a ""how to"" book ‚Äì explaining the approach to inner child healing that I discovered in my desperation to change my life.¬† I have been guided to develop and refine this approach in my work with others to facilitate my recovery and healing.¬† It is a formula, a blueprint, for integrating Spiritual Truth into our inner process so that we can achieve some emotional balance in this human dance we are doing. 
The material in that book will be based upon the writing that I have done for articles on my web site.¬† I haven‚Äôt withheld anything on the web site in terms of trying to explain how the process works ‚Äì it is just that in that book I might be explaining things in slightly different ways, and adding some things that I use in my counseling work that for one reason or another I have just never written about.¬† I did start to publish a draft version of that book in my Joy2MeU Journal several years ago ‚Äì but that process became stalled as I was writing articles for my web site that lead me to deeper and fuller understanding of different aspects of the process, and of the energetic dynamics that govern the process.¬† I have been trying to get the time to focus on that book for quite awhile now ‚Äì and in fact wrote the following to my Joy2MeU Journal subscribers in July of this year. 
""So, I will get back to this Journal when I get back to it.¬† I don‚Äôt think that it will be too long after I get back, because these issues that are stirred up need to be worked through.¬† And I really want and need to get back to my process level book.¬† It was over a year ago when I wrote this about it. 
Wounded Souls Dancing in The Light
My concept of this book is changing pretty dramatically ‚Äì and will probably include a name change.¬† As I said back in the beginning of this Journal, this book is a first draft and as such it is definitely a work in progress.¬† The reality of the book ‚Äì as I stated back then ‚Äì is that probably 80% of the material that will go into this book is already on the web site. .. . . 
I haven‚Äôt been able to get a clear vision of how this book will come together since I haven‚Äôt had any free time to focus on it. 
Joy2MeU Journal Mini-Newsletter ‚Äì May 8, 2000

My vision of this book is getting clearer all the time.¬† And it is happening because of my phone counseling.¬† That has proven such an effective way of helping people to implement my approach to inner child healing and Spiritual integration, that it is showing me the way that the book needs to be organized.""

Co-Creation: Owning your Power to Manifest Love is one of the alternative titles I have been considering.¬† I was in fact, planning on focusing on that process level book in September.¬† Then the events of September 11th occurred and I started publishing what turned into an online book Attack on America: A Spiritual Healing Perspective.¬† This page is in fact being written as part of that online book.¬† I am now starting to see that I will be combining the material from that process book with the online book ‚Äì but am not sure when I will have time to get to that, as I first need to finish the online book.¬† Hopefully in January, I will find some time to start exploring that material. 
In the meantime, I wanted to publish this page as a regular web article ‚Äì as opposed to a chapter of my online book ‚Äì because this material is so important to the process.¬† I wanted it to be readily available to anyone who is interested. ‚Äì RB 12-23-01 
(I actually ended up writing another online book after the Attack on America book.¬† I incorporated the material from the ""next"" book with that online book in May 2003. I will add a link to that work which I am calling Codependency Recovery: Wounded Souls Dancing in the Light Book 2 A Dysfunctional Relationship with Life at the bottom of this page. ‚Äì RB 1-2-04) 

Co-Creation ‚Äì Empowerment through Response-ability
The single most important step in this inner healing work is detachment.¬† It is developing a detached level of consciousness ‚Äì and observer / witness perspective ‚Äì that allows us to start practicing discernment in relationship to both our inner and outer process.¬† This facilitates the process of learning how to have internal boundaries so that we can start having the wisdom and clarity to integrate a Loving Spiritual belief system and intellectual knowledge of healthy behavior into our emotional relationship with life.¬† Then we are able to start achieving some emotional balance, and start owning our power to be a positive conscious co-creator of our life experience ‚Äì a Loving, mature, empowered force in our own lives, instead of an unconscious co-creator out of the negative, self abusive, self sabotaging reactions that are caused by our emotional wounds and the codependent behavior patterns adapted in childhood. 
By developing detachment we can start practicing discernment ‚Äì having the wisdom to know the difference between the things we cannot change and the things which we can ‚Äì which will allow us to develop internal boundaries so that we can stop being the victim of our wounds and dysfunctional intellectual p
rogramming.¬† Developing some detachment from our own internal process is necessary so we can stop reacting and learn to respond in the moment in a healthy, mature manner ‚Äì as an empowered, Spiritually enlightened adult, instead of a frightened, wounded child.¬† 
""As long as we keep reacting out of black and white polarized thinking, we are powerless to change our patterns.¬† Recognizing we were powerless out of ego self to do anything but react, creates the space to allow us to start changing our relationship with ourselves and stop being our own worst enemy.¬† Recognizing our powerlessness to control life out of ego, helps us to begin to take power away from the feeling of toxic shame and start forgiving ourselves.¬† Awakening to the futility, the inherent dysfunction, of allowing our early childhood ego programming to define us and run our lives ‚Äì and our powerlessness to change that until we became conscious that it needed to, and could, be changed ‚Äì begins the process of learning to Love ourselves, and creates the space to start being open to relaxing and enjoying life.¬† By learning to stop empowering polarized reaction to the toxic shame, we can start being honest enough with ourselves to own our responsibility in how our lives have unfolded so that we can make amends to our self and others ‚Äì and that allows us to start changing our behavior and relationship patterns substantially and significantly.""
Attack on America ‚Äì A Call for Higher Consciousness¬† Chapter 5

As long as we are reacting to old wounds and old tapes we cannot respond to the now.¬† The more we heal, the more responsibility we have ‚Äì that is, ability to respond.¬† The ability to respond in the moment.

Awakening to Higher Consciousness
On January 3, 2002 I will celebrate 18 years of being clean and sober.¬† I have actually been clean and sober now for longer than I drank and used.¬† An amazing miracle that has unfolded one day at a time.¬† Some of those days were excruciatingly painful ‚Äì full of hopelessness and despair.¬† In early recovery, I didn‚Äôt make it through those days sober because I wanted to be sober ‚Äì or because I wanted to be alive.¬† I made it through one day at a time because I was terrified of returning to, and getting stuck in, the hell I had been living in for the last 4 or 5 years of my drinking.
There is an old AA saying that: Alcoholics Anonymous doesn‚Äôt open up the gates of heaven and let us in ‚Äì it opens up the gates of hell and lets us out.¬† When I got released from my alcoholic hell, what I found myself experiencing was life.¬† The very thing I had been drinking to cope with! 
What I realize now, is that I was released from alcoholic hell and found myself in codependent hell.¬† My relationship with my self and with life condemned me to codependent hell ‚Äì and alcohol and drugs had given me a vacation of sorts from dealing with the fact that I did not have a clue of how to live life in a functional way. 
I am very, very grateful now that I am a recovering alcoholic.¬† If I had not found alcohol and drugs, I would have killed myself in one way or another in my late teens or early twenties.¬† My 17 plus year drinking career kept me alive long enough to be present when planetary conditions changed so that the New Age of Healing and Joy could dawn in human consciousness.¬† Long enough to have available to me, the tools and knowledge to be able to heal my wounded soul and learn to live life in a way that works.¬† Long enough that first Adult Children of Alcoholics, and then Co-Dependents Anonymous meetings, were available to help me in my healing process. 
The dysfunctional dance of Codependence is caused by being at war with ourselves ‚Äì being at war within. 
We are at war with ourselves because we are judging and shaming ourselves for being human.¬† We are at war with ourselves because we are carrying around suppressed grief energy that we are terrified of feeling.¬† We are at war within because we are ""damming"" our own emotional process ‚Äì because we were forced to become emotionally dishonest as children and had to learn ways to block and distort our emotional energy. 
We cannot learn to Love ourselves and be at peace within until we stop judging and shaming ourselves for being human and stop fighting our own emotional process, until we stop waging war on ourselves. 
Detachment and Delayed Gratification
I can see now, that the reason I was able to stay sober was because of two concepts that are invaluable to any healing or growth.¬† The first one made the second possible.¬† It is the first of these concepts that is the single most important step in the inner healing process ‚Äì the one that I stress so much to anyone I am working with on how to change and improve the quality of their lives.
That concept is detachment. 
Codependence is a compulsively reactive condition.¬† I had gone through life like a pin ball ‚Äì bouncing / reacting from one point to the next, from one person to the next.¬† It was never my fault.¬†¬† Someone, or something else, was always to blame for how messed up my life was ‚Äì for how awful I felt inside.¬† I focused on blame and resentment because the only alternative that I knew was to blame myself.¬† I was at war inside of myself ‚Äì and because I was taught to look outside for definition and worth by the society I grew up in, I tried to assign the blame externally for that internal war. 
At the core of codependency is shame about being human.¬† This shame was caused by a polarized, black and white intellectual paradigm that empowered the perspective that the only alternatives for evaluating worth, for determining value, are right and wrong.¬† Human beings are incapable of being perfect based upon a perspective in which the only alternatives are right and wrong. 
Codependency is a dysfunctional relationship with life, with being human.¬† It is the dance I learned to do as a little kid.¬† It is a dance whose music is generated from fear and shame, to a rhythm dictated by black and white thinking.¬† It is a dance characterized by movement between extremes ‚Äì blame them or blame me, overreact or underreact, less than or better than, success or failure, win or lose, etc., ‚Äì which makes balance impossible.¬† There is no middle ground in a dance that can only be done right or wrong.¬† There can be no inner peace. 
Since I was continually attempting to do life perfect (or rebelling by going to the opposite extreme) according to false beliefs about the nature and purpose of being human, I could never have any inner peace.¬† I judged my self and my life experience, both consciously and unconsciously, out of a dysfunctional polarized belief system ‚Äì so that it was not possible to stop being at war within.¬† At the core of my being I felt like I was a defective monster, some kind of shameful, unlovable loser ‚Äì and I tried to deflect some of that pain by blaming others. 
No wonder I drank.¬† Alcohol ‚Äì and later drugs of various kinds ‚Äì

Grief, Love, & Fear of Intimacy

""It is necessary to own and honor the child who we were in order to Love the person we are.¬† And the only way to do that is to own that child‚Äôs experiences, honor that child‚Äôs feelings, and release the emotional grief energy that we are still carrying around."" (Quotations in this color are from Codependence: The Dance of Wounded Souls by Robert Burney)
I am not sure at exactly what point in my recovery that it took place ‚Äì but it was probably around 2 and a half years.¬† It was years later before I would understand its‚Äô huge significance in my life.¬† At the time it was just a blessed relief.¬†
I went to a meeting at my home group in Studio City.¬† I was feeling a little crazy.¬† Wound too tight and ready to explode.¬† It was a familiar feeling.¬† It was a feeling that I had drowned in alcohol or taken the edge off of with marijuana in the old days.¬† But I couldn‚Äôt do that anymore so I went to a meeting.¬† 
My friends name was Steve.¬† He hadn‚Äôt been my friend for very long although I had known him for years.¬† He had been my agent years earlier and I had disliked him intensely.¬† I was in the process of getting to know him, and like him, now that we were both in recovery.¬† 
He saw how up tight I was and asked me to go outside with him.¬† He asked me one simple question:¬† ""How old do you feel?""¬† ""Eight,""¬† I said, and then I exploded.¬† I cried in a way I didn‚Äôt remember ever crying before ‚Äì great heaving sobs wracked my body as I told him what happened when I was eight.¬† 
I had grown up on a farm in the Midwest.¬† The summer that I turned eight I had my first 4-H calf.¬†¬† 4-H was to us rural kids kind of like boy scouts was to city kids ‚Äì a club where farm kids had projects to learn things.¬† I got a calf who weighed about 400 pounds and fed him all spring and summer until he weighed over a thousand pounds.¬† I tamed him and taught him to allow me to lead him around on a halter so I could show him at the county fair.¬† After the county fair there was another chance to show him at a town nearby and then sell him.¬† Local business people would buy the calves for more than they were worth to give us kids incentive and teach us how to make money.¬† 
By the time I was eight, I was completely emotionally isolated and alone.¬† I grew up in a pretty typical American family.¬† My father had been trained to be John Wayne ‚Äì anger was the only emotion he ever expressed ‚Äì and my mother had been trained to be a self-sacrificing martyr.¬† Since my mother could get no emotional support from my father ‚Äì she had very low self-esteem and no boundaries ‚Äì she used her children to validate and define her.¬† She emotionally incested me by using me emotionally ‚Äì causing me to feel responsible for her emotions, and feel ashamed that I couldn‚Äôt protect her from my father‚Äôs verbal and emotional abuse.¬† The shame and pain of my father‚Äôs seeming inability to love me coupled with my mother loving me too much at the same time that she allowed herself and me to be abused by fathers anger and perfectionism ‚Äì caused me to shut down to my mothers love and close down emotionally.¬† 
And then into the life of this little boy who was in such pain, and so isolated, came a shorthorn calf which he named Shorty.¬† Shorty was the closest thing to a personal pet that I have ever had.¬† On the farm, there were always dogs and cats and other animals ‚Äì but they weren‚Äôt mine alone.¬† I developed an emotionally intimate relationship with that calf.¬† I loved Shorty.¬† He was so tame that I could sit on his back or crawl under his belly.¬† I spent uncounted hours with that calf.¬† I really loved him. 
I took him to the county fair and got a Blue Ribbon.¬† Then a few weeks later it was time for the show and sale.¬† I got another Blue Ribbon.¬† When it came time to sell him, I had to lead him into the sale ring while the auctioneer sang his mysterious selling chant.¬† It was over in a moment and I led Shorty out of the ring to a pen where all the sold calves were put.¬† I took off his halter and let him go.¬† Somehow I knew that my father expected me not to cry, and that my mother expected me to cry.¬† By that time, I was very clear from the role-modeling of my father that a man did not cry ‚Äì ever.¬† And I had so much suppressed rage at my mother for not protecting me from my fathers raging that I was passive ‚Äì aggressively doing things the opposite of what I thought she wanted.¬† So, I slipped his halter off, patted him on the shoulder, and closed the gate ‚Äì consigning my best friend to the pen of calves that was going to the packing house to be slaughtered.&n

That poor little boy.¬† It wasn‚Äôt until almost 30 years later, leaning up against the side of the meeting room, that I got the chance to cry for that little boy.¬† With great heaving sobs, tears pouring down my cheeks, and snot running out my nose, I had my first experience with deep grief work.¬† I did not know anything about the process at the time ‚Äì I just knew that somehow that wounded little boy was still alive inside of me.¬† I also did not know at the time that part of my life‚Äôs work was going to be helping other people to reclaim the wounded little boys and girls inside of them.¬† 
Now I know that emotions are energy which if not released in a healthy grieving process gets stuck in the body.¬† The only way for me to start healing my wounds is to go back to that little boy and cry the tears or own the rage that he had no permission to own back then.¬† 
I also know that there are layers of grief from the emotional trauma I experienced.¬† There is not only trauma about what happened back then ‚Äì there is also grief about the effect those experiences had on me later in life.¬†¬† I get to cry once again for that little boy as I write this.¬† I have been sobbing for that little boy and the emotional trauma he experienced ‚Äì but I am also sobbing for the man that I became.¬† 
I learned in childhood, and carried into adulthood, the belief that I am not lovable.¬† It felt like I was not lovable to my mother and father.¬† It felt like the God I was taught about didn‚Äôt love me ‚Äì because I was a sinful human.¬† It felt like anyone who loved me would eventually be disappointed, would learn the truth of my shameful being.¬† I spent most of my life alone because I felt less lonely alone.¬† When I was around people I would feel my need to connect with them ‚Äì and feel my incredible loneliness for human relationships ‚Äì but I did not know how to connect in a healthy way.¬† I have had a great terror of the pain of abandonment and betrayal ‚Äì but even more than that, the feeling that I could not be trusted because I am not good enough to love and be loved.¬† At the core of my being, at the foundation of my relationship with myself, I feel unworthy and unlovable.¬† 
And now I know that the little boy, that I was, felt like he betrayed and abandoned the calf that he loved.¬† Proof of his unworthiness.¬† And not only did he betray his best friend ‚Äì he did it for money.¬† Another piece of the puzzle of why money has been such a big issues in my life.¬† In recovery I had learned that because of the power my father and society gave to money I had spent much of my life saying that money wasn‚Äôt important to me at the same time that I was always focused on it because I never had enough.¬† I have definitely had a dysfunctional relationship with money in my life and 8 year old Robby gave me a glimpse at another facet of that relationship.¬† 
Robby has also helped me to understand another piece of my fear of intimacy issues.¬† I have been going through a transformation one more time in my recovery.¬† Each time that I need to grow some more ‚Äì need to surrender some more of who I thought I was in order to become who I am ‚Äì I get to peel another layer of the onion.¬† Each time this happens I get to reach a deeper level of honesty and see things clearer than I ever have before.¬† Each time, I also get to release some of the emotional energy through crying and raging.¬† 
Through clearer eyes, and with deeper emotional honesty, I get to look at all of my major issues again to heal them some more.¬† I used to think that I could deal with an issue and be done with it ‚Äì but now I know that is not the way the healing process works.¬† So recently I have gotten the opportunity to revisit my issues of abandonment and betrayal, of deprivation and discounting.¬† My issues with my mother and father, with my gender and sexuality, with money and success.¬† My issues with the God I was taught about and the God-Force that I choose to believe in.¬† My patterns of self-abusive behavior that are driven by my emotional wounds ‚Äì and the attempts that I make to forgive myself for behavior that I have been powerless over.¬† And they all lead me back to the core issue.¬† I am not worthy.¬† I am not good enough.¬† Something is wrong with me.¬† 
At the core of my relationship is the little boy who feels unworthy and unlovable.¬† And my relationship with myself was built on that foundation.¬† The original wounding caused me to adapt attitudes and behavior patterns which caused me to be further traumatized and wounded ‚Äì which caused me to adapt different attitudes and behavior patterns which caused me to be further traumatized and wounded in different ways.¬† Layer upon layer the wounds were laid ‚Äì multifaceted, incredibly complex and convoluted is the disease of Codependence.¬† Truly insidious, baffling and powerful.¬† 
Through revisiting the eight year old who I was I get to understand on a new level why I have always been attracted to unavailable people ‚Äì because the pain of feeling abandoned and betrayed is the lesser of two evils.¬† The worst possible thing, to my shame-based inner children, is to have revealed how unworthy and unlovable I am ‚Äì so unworthy that I abandoned and betrayed my best friend, Shorty the shorthorn calf that I loved and who seemed to love me back.¬† It is no wonder that at my core I am terrified of loving someone who is capable of loving me back.¬† 
By owning and honoring the feelings of the child who I was, I can do some more work on letting him know that it wasn‚Äôt his fault and that he deserves forgiveness.¬† That he deserves to be Loved.¬† 
So today, I am grieving once more for the eight year old who was trapped, and for the man he became.¬† I am grieving because if I don‚Äôt own that child and his feelings ‚Äì then the man will never get past his terror of allowing himself to be loved.¬† By owning and cherishing that child, I am healing the broken heart of both the child and the man ‚Äì and giving that man the opportunity to one day trust himself enough to love someone as much as he loved Shorty.

hey journal,
I am about to get ready to go to work this morning and just thinking on where my mind set is this morning. I am okay. The tremendous high of the weekend is somewhat dimenished but Im still working thru it. I am alright. I love myself, I am a good person, I am a child of god, I have good qualities. I just had to get on here to write a bit because I miss brittany. I know its over but still doesnt mean that I am over it. I know that doesnt make sense in the bit but it does to me. I have been so angry at my friends and such that I have just isolated myself from the world. I dont want to be of the world, I dont want to think that this is all there is. It is really strange, I dont like going to the job I do very much anymore, even though it is something that used to define me. I am more then that stupid job, I am more then a counselor, I am full of endless possibilities. I was writing on self sabatoge and stuff of that nature in the last entries, it is so true. To listen to that inner parental voice that tells you‚Ä¶.""hey your not good nuff today, your not worthy of this or that, or you failed once again."" Its like starting off the day in a bad state and only gets worst. I know I am rambling, but it makes sense to me. I am gonna go pray, I need it‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..later‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..martin

Psalm 1
Blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel
of the wicked or stand in the way of sinners, or at the seat 
of mockers. But his delight is the law of the lord,and on
his law he meditates day and night. He is like a tree planted
by streams of water., which yields its fruit in season.,and whose 
leaf does not wither., Whatever he does PROSPERS.
Not so wicked! They are like chaff that the wind blows away,
therefore the wickd will not stand in the judgement, nor sinners
in the assembly of the righteous. For the lord¬† watches over the way 
of the righteous but the way of the wicked shal parish‚Ä¶.:)
This psalm spoke to me because I heard a preacher‚Äôs messege on this. It talks on expanding your capacity to receive the lords blessings. I can totally relate on this because my cup was small, it was running all over and nothing was being able to soak in anymore. I was running over and if you dont know how to maintain it or are ready for the lord‚Ä¶you destroy it! One thing I am learning is that all in this diary, I have read dont dwell, I hear you find happiness, I have had it! , but not known or seen it because I was running all over the table cause I stopped growing or having the capacity to have more. I have been one of those believers‚Ä¶the ones that take a stand, raise the flag and preach the word, but I heard this messege say‚Ä¶.believers believers‚Ä¶.with no blessing in your life to show for it because the glass runneth over‚Ä¶THat was mE!!‚Ä¶running all over the table, making a mess‚Ä¶he said sinners are messy‚Ä¶yup that is me‚Ä¶.getting all the blessings but unable to comprehend after the cup was full‚Ä¶turned myself off to the good. Instead of getting a bigger cup, I did what I have always done, sabatoged it. Destroyed it! This preacher said ‚Ä¶you can be given a brand new home, manicured grass around it‚Ä¶.within a couple months you can drive by this same house and if the person is unable to maintain or ready for the house‚Ä¶the screen door will be off the hinges, two junky broken down cars will be in the yard, and the grass will be dead and gone due to the person not being able to maintain the goodness because they are only so far along to be able to get gods Greatness! What we dont understand we destroy‚Ä¶..! God is infinate, he knows no boundaries, our little world of problems or insecurities is totally uncomprehendable to him, he keeps blessing and blessing‚Ä¶but do we ever listen or see the blessings he gives us‚Ä¶as humans we are selfish, we want what we want in our way‚Ä¶not the way the lord sends it to us. As sinners we walk into church all out of sorts sit in someone elses""seat"" and the whispers start‚Ä¶..God please send us the holy ghost right now ‚Ä¶..help us with this situation use us‚Ä¶..and god is saying I DID>‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..open your eyes. Just because it doesnt happen the way we are accustumed does not mean it is wrong, because we make all small and comfortable. When we dont know about something we destroy it. We dont allow god to work and we try to do what is comfortable for us to get thru the situation. This preacher was amazing! I have the tape in my car I listen to daily..to work and from work. Expand my horizon lord. I expect greatness from you. You give us not unfinished products but you give it to us the way it is intended. I have had so many great people planting seeds in my life‚Ä¶well look ya‚Äôll whether you believe or not‚Ä¶..the tree has started to sprout from the harded ground where the water of the lord was repelling off of because I was not ready to receive anymore blessings‚Ä¶.but NO MORE! I have gotten me a bigger cup, I am telling myself good things today. I am worthy I am love I am a child of christ! I need no validation to understand these things. I dont need you to tell me I am worthy‚Ä¶..I believe the face in the mirror. I love him today‚Ä¶he is smiling again‚Ä¶..and not because of all that has happend the last two years and this is the ""new "" me‚Ä¶NO! I was running over all over the place making a mess of the blessings brittany was trying to give me. I could not hold anymore at that time, I didnt know how to, its like a person walking in with a handful of grocerys, all full of stuff trying to open the door, to get in the house‚Ä¶you go up and say here you go‚Ä¶..hold this‚Ä¶..Where is this person gonna hold on to it? where? they arent so they lay it down and say ill come back for it later‚Ä¶and never do. I did that with my relationship, with my life, so much was on my plate, trying to be perfect for god, trying to be a ""loyal"" follower‚Ä¶.well you know what, if I curse myself GOD will eventually curse me also! I should not look at myself and demean myself due to someone elses perception. If you dont believe what god is saying‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..then he will start believing what you are saying‚Ä¶.oh god i can oh god i dont know‚Ä¶oh god‚Ä¶..we cant do that‚Ä¶‚Ä¶then god says your right‚Ä¶..you cant‚Ä¶..let me give it to someone else‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶who knows they are ready to hold what I have the capacity to give them. Jesus asked the diciples‚Ä¶..""will you be whole."" He asked this why? because he wanted to make sure they had the capacity to maintain what he was about to give them!‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..I love this sermon this guy spoke just love it. I miss brittany, susan and the rest of the family because I wanted to call and share and let them know all their prayers were not in vain, that I didnt lie about gaining a relationship with god. If you guys read my stuff, I got a bigger cup‚Ä¶.see? I want to continue to not let it get full but to give it and receive‚Ä¶I must love me to do so, today I do. God is bigger then earthly problems‚Ä¶.god is bigger then all. He puts us thru situations to handle the blessings and appreciate them more when we see them coming our way. I never knew the blessings‚Ä¶.I saw them‚Ä¶.I tryed to hold them‚Ä¶.but I was full and running over‚Ä¶..I had a very small cup‚Ä¶..not big enough for much‚Ä¶but I was trying to get it. I love martin today! oh man‚Ä¶jesus thank you for being able to love me so much that you died so I wouldnt have to feel all that you died for‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..I hope you guys have a great day. Thanks for the notes‚Ä¶.I am happy! there is no hope you find it‚Ä¶blada blada‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶GOd is love, god is happiness, when you stop talking the negative and believeing in the blessings then truly will you get what it is all about. I have, I dont want to hear I cant ‚Ä¶.I wont,‚Ä¶‚Ä¶I dont know‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.cause the more I say those to god‚Ä¶..well then he will start saying them also‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶love me today‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.may god bless you also‚Ä¶keep it simple and cherish the things you have daily ‚Ä¶.they are sent down from god‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..and ps‚Ä¶a very smart person told me once‚Ä¶..YOU act like you have forever martin‚Ä¶‚Ä¶life is short, take the opportunity to get it now‚Ä¶.well you know what Britt, I am and thank you so much for all you have said and done in the name of a better life for me on this earth‚Ä¶i love you for it., you are truly a blessing to me.

Hey journal,
I am doing good today, I got my car keyed at work today. I called the cops and they took a report. I was thinking on all I have been writing and reading. You know its only a car, I am bigger then letting them get the best of the serenity I am trying to obtain. In the book of job‚Ä¶I have learned that our god is a sovereign god, he gave satan the permission to do as he would with job, Satan is not even that powerful to do anything without god, god cast him out of heaven. God is infinate. He cannot comprehend our little problems and vices. I have struggled so long with the concept that god wont understand or cant be that loving if he let happen to me what has happend. In this day in time i realize that all that has been allowed to happen shaped me into who I am today.I would not appreciate it any other way. I would have no wanted to take a look at myself really‚Ä¶if britt had not cut me loose‚Ä¶I may have never really expanded my capacity without it happening..did she deserve all i put her thru? no‚Ä¶.but you know we all are unperfect in all areas right? You know all the love that has been given to me‚Ä¶..I could not receive it because..I didnt know how to handle actually being loved with no issues so severe I would not be beat for. So, instead of growing with the love‚Ä¶I turned on myself and sabatoged it. Anything we dont understand‚Ä¶.we try to kill!‚Ä¶I love me today:) I keep it simple and when I start to feel something going on inside me‚Ä¶I stop, back up and breathe., because usually we hold our breath whenever there is some uncomfortable situation that happens‚Ä¶.we turn on ourselves if it doesnt happen the way it is supposed to be in our minds‚Ä¶.what if god comes back like that‚Ä¶we understand it in a song‚Ä¶but when its a human being we know‚Ä¶.we put condition on it..instead of seeing it as it is..from god‚Ä¶broken, unclean, dirty, or not perfect‚Ä¶.it is fear because we may see ourselves in this person and then we would have to be honest‚Ä¶.and admit we have issues also. Often we look at ""people"" in the way we want them to be‚Ä¶.I work with criminals and have been guilty of this. I often have not bothered to look deeper‚Ä¶to see the true area where the pain is‚Ä¶where they are really seeing‚Ä¶instead of what I ""think"" they are seeing. often I tried to force things on them they werent ready or understood what i was bringing to them., so they turned on it and tryed to kill the goodness:)I‚Äôll be honest with ya journal, I dont read books on addiction daily‚Ä¶i dont do groups like the other counselors, I rely on god‚Ä¶otherwise I am lost. I have no confidence when I dont stay in the word. The previous entry talked on prospering‚Ä¶.a man should expect to live well and have blessings‚Ä¶..now i understand when britt used to say‚Ä¶I deserve‚Ä¶..she expected because that is what god told her:) The miracle happens‚Ä¶.maybe alot of times after we think its to late‚Ä¶or after we have seen all the ugliness in a person‚Ä¶but then the seed you planted one day a long time ago‚Ä¶.starts to bloom‚Ä¶..when you take your hands off of it‚Ä¶.when you are angry that it started without you..but be honest‚Ä¶.without the time you took to love it‚Ä¶.you gave it life‚Ä¶.and it tryed to give you some back as well, maybe not the way you thought it should be‚Ä¶.but god brings it in all ways‚Ä¶..I love you martin‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.keep expanding your capacity‚Ä¶your worth it‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..LOVE ME()

Hey journal,
Whats up? I just thought I would come and relieve some issues that are going on with me currently. I got a letter today from my mother and it really scared me because she told me that a dr. told her her heart was enlarged and it was because of her blood pressure. Her legs have been swelling and she has to go to a cardiologist this week. In the letter was really a reality check in all accords because I am trying to really get a grip on it. I have pushed people out, and its only in times like this when you trully need someone that you realize your stupidity. I can keep the drama going on from what I have done or created but you know, I choose to not indulge in it any further. I am no longer involved in any ones life, for my reasons and my poor decisions. So, what if I am 33 and single, not the only one in the world that is. I am not gonna go round and round with the issues and keep hurting people with them. I am sure it is because I did them that it may seem I want the easy way out. I dont. I just realize that my mom is sick, not cold sick either, but this is serious stuff. I feel so powerless over this right now. I know I have done alot of wrong, I have done alot of things that are hideious and assingned. I am praying to god right now. I dont know what to do or think. I face so much daily on issues of others, when it comes to dealing with my own. I guess I‚Äôm just not that good at doing it. I give it to the cross‚Ä¶.I cant do nothing about it. I really dont have anyone to talk to it about. That is why im writing my feelings on here.Please lord protect my mom, allow whatever is going on to be able to be regulated and to allow her some peace of mind and calmness. I know lord I am not good at being a part of the world, but I ask that you please hear my prayer to you. I love you lord. I am a sinner, I have countless flaws and shortcomings. Please help me love the little bit of stuff I have left. I am tired, I am sick of the patterns I keep going. If no one else ever cares again or constantly needs to ridicule and attack me‚Ä¶let them do so. I am no victim I put myself in this position. I can go to you lord to remain the peace that you instill in my life. Please watch over my mom and my brother and that little baby of his. I ask that you somehow rid the evil that I have done to those who have cared about me and loved me. I am human I dont know how to do so. I have been stripped of deceit and stripped of the ability to tell the things that trully hurt me as well. Please lord. I come to you. In the mist of the evil I run to you. I am not evil, I want to live in your light. I just have made tremendous unhealthy warped choices trying to live for you and getting bored and going back to old behavior. I am a sinner. Please forgive me. I am weak, I forget about the goodness you bring and end up going back to the earthly things of the flesh, I am not a victim I am a sinner on all accords. I need you lord I dont need the world or the people in it You are all I have right now. Please shelter my soul in the times of hardache and confusion and pain. Please rid the pain from those I caused it to. , I truly want to know you without anyones relationship with you but my own. I am really trying to go to you right now when times are hard and uncomfortable. Please help me lord. I am here before you‚Ä¶‚Ä¶martin

Do not rejoice over me my enemy; when I fall, I will arise.
Noah was a just man, perfect in his generations.Noah walked with god.Then he drank of the wine and was drunk.David did what was right in the eyes of the lord, and had not turned aside from anything that He commanded him all the days of his life, except in the matter of Uriah the Hittite. You are Peter‚Ä¶.and I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven.Now Peter sat outside in the courtyard. And a servant girl came to him , saying ""you also were with jesus of Gailee"" But he denied it before them all.

Who will deliver me from this body of death? I thank god ‚Äì thru jesus christ our lord! There is therefore now no condemnations to those who are in Christ jesus, who do not walk according to the flesh, but according to the spirit. For the law of the Spirit of the lord is. there is liberty.Stand fast therefore in the liberty of which Christ has made us free and do not be entangled again with a yoke of bondage, Jesus said to them. Loose him , and let him go"".
These two pages spoke to me this morning as I read them before getting ready for work. I fit in both.I talk¬†the talk, but fail to live up to the expectation of living for god. I am a sinner of all accords. I have been viewed in many eyes as the epitamy of evil and hate. I do not want that life, I never have. I have always wanted to walk with god. I remember going to that movie and instantly feeling his presense as I felt wiped clean, then what did I do. I craved the stupidity of the world, its like oh here I feel better, no longer lost, so gives me a permission statement to deceive, lie, and cause pain upon others. I hate myself for that, for listening to the stupidity of my brain the voices of sin. I put myself in situations that were not condusive to anything but evil. I knew better but still I walked in the face of evil ‚Ä¶to test my faith? but succuming to the earthly demons. Its like the addict that is overcoming a addiction and thinking that in secrecy he can do drugs or drink without being caught. I thank god that I was caught, that I can try to apologize in any way possible. To the people I need to apologize to I called britt all weekend and her phone kept not letting my call thru. I have not apologized to her family, I am ashamed of my self. I want to so badly but I have shame and guilt. I am not writing this for anyone but myself today and hope that god heals the mess that i have caused. I can walk with goodness today., In time Ilost all due to the fact I was keeping secrets as a addict does. Well, now all the secrets are out. I cant run I cant hide, I did and am tired. I dont want to live life in a sinners mind, body and soul. I want peace, love and serenity without having to go back to stupidity and mess it up. God please here me, I want you here I need you here.You are all I have right now, I am lost please light the way, please hold me for all i have touched i have destroyed. I love you lord,. I have not lied about that..youdid something in that movie that night‚Ä¶..you gave me a breath of life, while in time I have started to try to kill myself andeveryone around me with sin. Please forgive me father, I need you . Please watch over my mom and my brother, and Brittany and her family in these times of discord. I know your mercy is endless, so that i come to you to lay upon us your grace. In your name I pray with all my heart and tattered soul, jesus name ‚Ä¶amen.

If Heaven was‚Ä¶by andy¬†Griggs
¬†
If heaven was an hour it would be 
twilight, 
when the fireflies start their dancing on the lawn, 
and suppers on the stove and mamas laughing, 
and everybody‚Äôs working day is done. 
If heaven was a town it would be my town, 
oh on a summer day in 1985, 
everything I wanted is out there waiting, 
and everyone I love is still alive. 
CHORUS 
Don‚Äôt cry a tear for me now baby, 
there comes a time we must all say goodbye, 
and if that‚Äôs what heavens made of, 
you know I I ain‚Äôt afraid to die. 
If heaven was a pie it would be cherry, 
so cool and sweet and heavy on the tongue, 
just one bite would satisfy your hunger, 
and there would always be enough for everyone. 
If heaven was a train it sure would be a fast one, 
that could take this weary traveler around the bend, 
If heaven was a tear it would be my last one, 
and you‚Äôd be in my arms again. 
CHORUS 
Don‚Äôt cry a tear for me now baby, 
there comes a time we must all say goodbye, 
and if that‚Äôs what heavens made of, 
you know I, 
I ain‚Äôt afraid to die. 
Yeah if that‚Äôs what heavens made of, 
you know I, 
I ain‚Äôt afraid to die! 

This song is so cool. I was thinking about this song today for some reason. I may have found a apt in forth worth so Im kinda physched . I dont know if it is gonna happen but im sure excited about it. I am so thankful for the loving god i have he makes all make sense when ever it comes at me in a jumbled mess. I talked to someone this weekend that was just out for info, oh well, if people dont have more to do then dig up dirt‚Ä¶what a waste of a day. I am moving on with this. I cant change it, I cant make it better, I cant let it run me down. I have to move on and keep going. I have to stop beating myself up over all this mess that has happend. Jesus speaks in the language of those that are quiet and calm enough to listen. I must get to the point where I listen to his positive voices rather then the negative voices of satan. So, many times when things are going good we praise the creator, we take a stand for the right, but when things instantly go beyond our control, we curse, we hold on to, and we judge. All in the name of shame and guilt. I have shame I have guilt, but I am still worthy of love no matter what mistakes I make. I am human, not near perfect. I speak on god because I try to self talk myself in the good stuff. To try to keep my eyes on him., its when i take my eyes off for a second, that trouble arises and I succomb to it. I dont trust anyone right now, not because of what has gone on, just hard to know who is real and who is not. So, I am moving on ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶moving on towards the main objective planting seeds, learning daily to live for god, and to constantly keep my eyes on jesus. I can talk negative about myself all I want. What would that do? Life is short, we either embrace what is given to us as it is‚Ä¶or we lose it and continually try to recreate it. I am 33 and single because I make mistakes far from the ordinary. I am still worthy of love though.One thing I know its the self hatred of others that makes me turn on me., I am my biggest enemy‚Ä¶.Please lord forgive me;) help me love myself today‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..continue to bless me in the capacity I may receive it..thank you holy father‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..your son‚Ä¶martin

You know for so long these two songs played nonstop in my head and in my car. I loved the thought of jesus and all his wonder, well something happend in me that made me think that since I believed in jesus or god that somehow my life would never be the same, that i would be ""cured"" of bad choices and behavior. I put myself in situations I guess not to actually do them, but to see if somehow somewhere a bolt of lightning would come from the sky to stop me. It did not and I still kept on in my destructive old behavior. I love this band. They are so genuine and true to the word, something I have always craved to actually match feeling with action. I am still working on that;) I have learned alot thru the last couple of months about that. All I can say is thank you jesus for placing such wonderful people in my life and leading the planting of the tree of oak that I know you are preparing. Something fast, sometimes slowly‚Ä¶gods miracle is happening. Progression rather then perfection. Help me tell myself I love myself today‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.lord keep all those that I love safe from evil and harm, allow them to heal with your love and peace, Please allow me to finally give up the internal fight I have raged within for so many years to finally cease, to let go, to let you clean up the wreckage. I am not you. I am not. Thank you lord, amen.

Fear of Intimacy ‚Äì the wounded heart of codependency
by Robert Burney¬† M. A.¬†
I mention fear of intimacy often in my writing.¬† It seems to me that in most of the articles I write for my web site I mention it in passing or for a few paragraphs.¬† And it is the predominate theme that I deal with the personal processing I share in my Update Newsletters ‚Äì and in my personal online journal in the Joy2MeU Journal.
I have been doing some slight rewrites of several of my web pages in early 2002, to accommodate a change in the major marketing tool I use to help make my web site available to people searching the internet.¬† In doing so, I realized that I had never really explained fear of intimacy in a simple, straight forward manner.¬† The article of mine that people find when searching for ""fear of intimacy"" on the web is Grief, Love, & Fear of Intimacy ‚Äì the story of my first experience of doing deep grief work.¬† That article is really focused more on deep grieving as a way of healing fear of intimacy, than on the phenomena itself.¬† Thus I realized the need for this article explaining why we have a fear of intimacy. 
Fear of Abandonment, Betrayal, and Rejection
Fear of intimacy is at the heart of codependency.¬† We have a fear of intimacy because we have a fear of abandonment, betrayal, and rejection.¬† We have a these fears because we were wounded in early childhood ‚Äì we experienced feeling emotionally abandoned, rejected, and betrayed by our parents because they were wounded.¬† They did not have healthy relationship with self ‚Äì they were codependents who abandoned and betrayed themselves ‚Äì and their behavior caused us to feel unworthy and unlovable. 
""We exited the warm nurturing cocoon of our incubator into a cold, harsh world.¬† A world run by Higher Powers (parents and any body else bigger than us ‚Äì siblings, grandparents, hospital or orphanage personnel) who were wounded in their childhood.¬† Gods who were not emotionally healthy, and did not know how to Love themselves.¬† Our egos were traumatized ‚Äì and adapted programming to try to protect us from the pain of emotional trauma that felt life threatening.
The people we Loved the most ‚Äì our Higher Powers ‚Äì hurt us the most.¬†¬† Our emotional intimacy issues were caused by, our fear of intimacy is a direct result of, our early childhood experiences.¬† Our lives have been lived in reaction to the intellectual paradigms our egos adapted to deal with emotional trauma. 
The part of a child‚Äôs brain that is logical and rational, that understands abstract concepts (like time or death), that can have any kind of an objective perspective on self or life, does not develop until about the age of 7 (the age of reason.)¬† As little children we were completely ego-centric and magical thinking.¬† We did not have the capacity to understand that our Higher Powers were not perfect.¬† We watched their role modeling, experienced their behavior as personal, and felt the emotional currents of our environments ‚Äì worry, frustration, resentment, fear, anger, pain, shame, etc. ‚Äì and were emotionally traumatized.¬† 
Our ego adapted itself to the environment it was experiencing.¬† It developed emotional and behavioral defense systems in reaction to the emotional pain we experienced growing up with parents who were wounded codependents.¬† 
If you have ever wondered why it is so much easier to feel Spiritual in relationship to nature or animals, here is your answer.¬† It was people who wounded us in childhood.¬† It is people who our egos developed defense systems to protect us from. 
I have told people for years, that the only reason to do inner child healing work is if we are going to interact with other people.¬† If one is going to live in isolation on a mountain top meditating, it will be fairly easy to feel Spiritually connected.¬† It is relating to other human beings that is messy."" 
Inner Child Healing ‚Äì Part 16 ‚Äì Reprogramming our ego defenses (link below)

Relating to animals or nature is safe because we will not be judged.¬† Our pet will not abandon us because we are inherently defective.¬† Nature will not reject us because we are personally shameful.¬† People will ‚Äì or at least it feels like that is what has happened in the past.¬†
The Truth is that the ways that our parents treated us in childhood did not have anything to do with who we are ‚Äì was not really personal.¬† They were incapable of seeing themselves clearly.¬† They certainly could not see us clearly ‚Äì could not see our unique individuality from a perspective that allowed them to honor and respect us as beings separate from them.¬†¬† Their perspective of us was filtered through a prism of their own shame and woundedness.¬† They projected their hopes and dreams, their fears and insecurities onto us.¬† They saw us as the fix for their feelings of unworthiness, an extension of them that gave their life meaning ‚Äì or perhaps they saw us as an inconvenience and a burden holding them back, preventing them from making their dreams come true.¬† For some of us, a parent(s) was so caught up in their alcoholism or survival drama or career that most of the time they didn‚Äôt see us at all. 
And both our parents and society taught us very clearly ‚Äì through direct messages and role modeling ‚Äì to be dishonest.¬† Our parents taught us that keeping up appearances, worrying about what the neighbors think, was more important than our feelings ‚Äì because it was so important to them.¬† Or, some of us experienced a parent who went to the other extreme, where they acted like they didn‚Äôt care what anyone thought ‚Äì which caused us to feel embarrassed and ashamed of their behavior because it was so out of balance, and caused us to worry about what the neighbors thought.¬† They taught us to give power to other people by wearing masks and keeping secrets.¬† 
Even more importantly, our role models taught us to be emotionally dishonest.¬† Because it wasn‚Äôt safe to be emotionally honest we lost our self ‚Äì did not know how to be emotionally intimate with our self, and instead constructed a false self image to survive.¬† We learned to wear different masks for different people. 
As children we were incapable of seeing ourselves as separate from our families ‚Äì of knowing we had worth as individuals apart from our families.¬† The reality we grew up in was the only reality that we knew.¬† We thought our parents behavior reflected our worth ‚Äì the same way that our codependent parents thought our behavior was a factor in rather they had worth. 
""We live in a society where the emotional experience of ""love"" is conditional on behavior.¬† Where fear, guilt, and shame are used to try to control children‚Äôs behavior because parents believe that their children‚Äôs behavior reflects their self-worth. 
In other words, if little Johnny is a well-behaved, ""good boy,"" then his
parents are good people.¬† If Johnny acts out, and misbehaves, then there is something wrong with his parents.¬† (""He doesn‚Äôt come from a good family."") 
What the family dynamics research shows is that it is actually the good child ‚Äì the family hero role ‚Äì who is the most emotionally dishonest and out of touch with him/herself, while the acting-out child ‚Äì the scapegoat ‚Äì is the most emotionally honest child in the dysfunctional family.¬† Backwards again. 
In a Codependent society we are taught, in the name of ""love,"" to try to control those we love, by manipulating and shaming them, to try to get them to do the right things ‚Äì in order to protect our own ego-strength.¬† Our emotional experience of love is of something controlling:¬† ""I love you if you do what I want you to do.""¬† Our emotional experience of love is of something that is shaming and manipulative and abusive. 
Love that is shaming and abusive is an insane, ridiculous concept.¬† Just as insane and ridiculous as the concept of murder and war in the name of God. 
(Quotations in this color are from Codependence: The Dance of Wounded Souls by Robert Burney)
Rather our parents made us their reason for living ‚Äì which is a form of toxic love in which the child is the drug of choice (causing a child to feel responsible for an adult‚Äôs self worth is emotionally incestuous and abusive);¬† or a burden to be carried, the scapegoat they blamed for ruining their lives;¬† or treated us like we were an inconvenience in the moments when they even seemed aware of us;¬† it wounded us.¬† We felt betrayed ‚Äì by our own unworthiness, because we were incapable of knowing they were not perfect. We felt abandoned and rejected by the gods in our lives. 
We were wounded in our first relationships with other people.¬† We were tiny, innocent, little beings who were completely dependent upon wounded people who did not Love themselves ‚Äì and therefore were incapable of Loving us in a healthy way.¬† 
Feeling unlovable to the gods in our lives as tiny children was life threatening.¬† It felt life threatening.¬† 
Our fear of intimacy is based upon painful, traumatic experience.¬†
in to me see
The simplest and most understandable way I have ever heard intimacy described is by breaking the word down: in to me see.¬† That is what intimacy is about ‚Äì allowing another person to see into us, sharing who we are with another person.
Sharing who we are is a problem for codependents because at the core of our relationship with ourselves is the feeling that we are somehow defective, unlovable and unworthy ‚Äì because of our childhood emotional trauma.¬† Codependency is rooted in our ego programming from early childhood.¬† That programming is a defense that the ego adapted to help us survive.¬† It is based upon the feeling that we are shameful, that we are defective, unworthy, and unlovable.¬† Our codependent defense system is an attempt to protect us from being rejected, betrayed, and abandoned because of our unworthy, shameful being. 
We have a fear of intimacy because we were wounded, emotionally traumatized, in early childhood ‚Äì felt rejected and abandoned ‚Äì and then grew up in emotional dishonest societies that did not provide tools for healing, or healthy role models to teach us how to overcome that fear.¬† Our wounding in early childhood caused us to feel that something was wrong with our being ‚Äì toxic shame ‚Äì and our societal and parental role models taught us to keep up appearances, to hide our shamefulness from others. 
Toxic Shame ‚Äì defective, unlovable
It is very important in recovery to start making a distinction ‚Äì drawing a boundary ‚Äì between being and behavior.¬† Growing up in dysfunctional societies taught us to equate our worth ‚Äì and judge the worth of others ‚Äì based upon external appearances.¬†¬† We experienced love as conditional on behavior.¬† Someone who behaves badly ‚Äì i.e. not the way we want them to ‚Äì is a bad person.¬† Someone who behaves the way we want them to is a good person.
It is very important to stop judging our worth based upon the dysfunctional standards of societies that taught us it was shameful to be imperfect human beings.

""When I use the term ""judge,"" I am talking about making judgments about our own or other people‚Äôs beings based on behavior.¬† In other words, I did something bad therefore I am a bad person; I made a mistake therefore I am a mistake.¬† That is what toxic shame is all about:¬† feeling that something is wrong with our being, that we are somehow defective because we have human drives, human weaknesses, human imperfections.
There may be behavior in which we have engaged that we feel ashamed of but that does not make us shameful beings¬†¬† We may need to make judgments about whether our behavior is healthy and appropriate but that does not mean that we have to judge our essential self, our being, because of the behavior.¬† Our behavior has been dictated by our disease, by our childhood wounds; it does not mean that we are bad or defective as beings.¬† It means that we are human, it means that we are wounded. 
It is important to start setting a boundary between being and behavior.¬† All humans have equal Divine value as beings ‚Äì no matter what our behavior.¬† Our behavior is learned (and/or reactive to physical or physiological conditions).¬† Behavior, and the attitudes that dictate behavior, are adopted defenses designed to allow us to survive in the Spiritually hostile, emotionally repressive, dysfunctional environments into which we were born."" 
At the core of codependency is toxic shame ‚Äì the feeling that we are somehow inherently defective, that something is wrong our being. 
[And I want to make note here, that anytime I talk about shame, rather I use the adjective toxic or not ‚Äì I am talking about feeling toxic shame in relationship to ""being,"" feeling personally defective.¬† Some people in the field, notably John Bradshaw, make a distinction between toxic shame and healthy shame.¬† I find it much simpler, and more useful, to use shame in reference to ""being"" and guilt in reference to behavior.¬† I believe there is healthy and unhealthy guilt (as I talk about in Discernment in relationship to emotional honesty and responsibility 2) but any time I use the term shame I am talking about toxic shame.¬† (The example that I have heard Bradshaw use of what he calls healthy shame, is that it is what keeps us from running down the street naked.¬† I find that not only blatantly a judgment of behavior ‚Äì but also based upon cultural standards that are not necessarily aligned with any kind of Spiritual Truth.¬† Some of John‚Äôs Jesuit background showing I think. ;-)]

The emotional trauma we suffered in early childhood create
d within us the feeling of toxic shame.
""We do not need fixing.¬† We are not broken.¬† Our sense of self, our self perception, was shattered and fractured and broken into pieces, not our True Self.
We think and feel like we are broken because we were programmed backwards. 
We are not broken.¬† That is what toxic shame is ‚Äì thinking that we are broken, believing that we are somehow inherently defective. 
Guilt is ""I made a mistake, I did something wrong."" 
Shame is ""I‚Äôm a mistake, something is wrong with me."" 
Again, the feelings of that little child inside who believes that he/she deserves to be punished."" 
At the foundation of our relationship with our self ‚Äì and therefore with other people and life ‚Äì is the feeling that we will die if we reveal ourselves to other people, because then they will see our shameful self.¬† I felt deep within me (in those rare instances of breaking through my denial and blaming to a moment of honest clarity), that if I let anyone see who I really was, they would run away screaming in horror at the grotesque, deformed, shameful being that I was. 
Our lives have been dictated by an emotional defense system that is designed to keep hidden the the false belief that we are defective.¬† We use external things ‚Äì success, looks, productivity, substances ‚Äì to try to cover up, overcome, make up for, the personal defectiveness that we felt caused our hearts to be broken and our souls wounded in childhood.¬† And that personal defectiveness is a lie.¬† That feeling of toxic shame is a lie. 
It was so painful that we had to lie to ourselves about it.¬† We were forced to be emotionally and intellectually dishonest with ourselves by the codependent defenses we adapted.¬† We had to learn how to live in denial of the pain and shame at the core of our relationship with ourselves.¬† Codependency is a vicious form of Delayed Stress Syndrome, of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. (Codependence as Delayed Stress Syndrome)¬† The emotional trauma caused us to disassociate ‚Äì to not be present in our own skins in a conscious way ‚Äì and to rationalize and deny our emotional experience of life.¬† We built up a dishonest self image to try to convince ourselves that we had worth based upon some comparative external factors:¬† looks, success, independence (the counterdependent rebel), popularity (people pleasers), righteousness (better than others, right to their wrong), or whatever.¬† That false self image was not completely dishonest because it was formed in reaction to some basic aspects of who we Truly are ‚Äì but it was a twisted, distorted, polarized perspective of our self adapted in response to toxic shame for the purpose of giving us some ego strength, some reason we could feel better than others. 
That false self image, the masks we learned to wear, is something we invested a lot of energy into convincing ourselves was the truth.¬† But deep inside, in our moments of insight and clarity, we knew we were hiding a shameful secret.¬† Often we got that toxic shame about our being confused in our memories with some behavior in our childhood that felt shameful.¬† It is very common for us to have a secret that involves a way in which we were abused ‚Äì physically, sexually, etc. ‚Äì that we go to great pains to avoid because we associate the feeling of toxic shame with that incident and think it was our fault. 
We do not want other people to see in to us, because then they will learn our shameful secret.¬† We have a fear of intimacy because of the false belief that our relationship with our self is based upon. 
We have spent our lives trying to protect ourselves from a lie about who we are.¬† We have spent incredible energy in our lives trying to keep the toxic shame hidden.¬† The secret that is killing us and has made our lives miserable, the secret we have lived in reaction to ‚Äì is a lie.¬† We have been compulsively ‚Äì because we were reacting to what felt like a threat to survival ‚Äì living our lives in reaction to our need to keep secret who we feel we really are in the deepest part of our being.


""Because as small children we did not have any perspective or discernment (prior to the age of reason, which occurs about 7 as our brains develop) we were incapable as viewing our parents as anything other than perfect Higher Powers.¬† Our God and Goddess.¬† Because our Higher Powers were wounded and did not know how to Love self, we were wounded and got the message that something must be wrong with us.¬† Toxic Shame.
That shame is toxic and is not ours ‚Äì it never was!¬† We did nothing to be ashamed of ‚Äì we were just little kids.¬† Just as our parents were little kids when they were wounded and shamed, and their parents before them, etc., etc.¬† This is shame about being human that has been passed down from generation to generation. 
There is no blame here, there are no bad guys, only wounded souls and broken hearts and scrambled minds. 
Out of our codependent relationship with life, there are only two extremes: blame them, or blame me.¬† Buy into the belief that they are to blame for what I am feeling ‚Äì or I am to blame because I am a shameful unworthy being.¬†¬† The emotional pain of feeling unlovable to our parents ‚Äì which is a reflection of unbearable anguish of feeling separated from The Source ‚Äì can feel like a bottomless pit of agonizing suffering.¬†¬† At the core of our wounding is the unbearable emotional pain resulting from having internalized the message that God ‚Äì our Source ‚Äì does not Love us because we are personally defective and shameful. 
Our addictions, compulsions, and obsessions;¬† our continuing quest to reach the destination, to find the fix;¬† our inability to be present in the now through worrying about the future or ruminating about the past;¬† are all tools that we used to avoid the emotional pain.¬† Our behavior patterns and dysfunctional relationships (of all kinds, with other people, with money, with our gender and sexuality) are symptoms.¬† Codependence is a defense system that was adapted by our damaged egos to try to avoid falling into the abyss of shame and pain within. 
We formed our core relationship with self, other people, and life based upon this feeling of toxic shame."" 
Chapter 2 of Attack on America ‚Äì A Spiritual Healing Perspective

Because of the feeling that we were somehow shameful, were unworthy and unlovable, we adapted defenses to protect us.¬† Those defenses caused us to keep recreating the emotional dynamics of our childhood.
Repeating Behavior Patterns ‚Äì looking for love in all the wrong places
Codependence is doubly t
raumatic.¬† We were traumatized as children ‚Äì and the defenses we adapted to protect us caused us to traumatize ourselves as adults.¬† We have experienced getting our hearts broken, our hopes and dreams shattered, again and again.¬† We abandoned, betrayed, and set ourselves up to feel rejected over and over again.¬† (Even those ""family hero"" types who achieve external ""success"" and financial abundance have to keep running from distraction to distraction and finding someone to blame so that they can deny the hole they feel within themselves.¬† Achieving some material success makes it much easier to maintain the illusion of ego control and stay in denial of one‚Äôs wounded soul.¬† Being rich and famous can be a huge block to true emotional intimacy.)
As long as we are reacting unconsciously to our childhood emotional wounds and intellectual programming, we keep repeating the patterns.¬† We keep getting involved with unavailable people.¬† We keep setting ourselves up to be abandoned, betrayed and rejected.¬† We keep looking for love in all the wrong places, in all the wrong faces.¬† Is it any wonder we have a fear of intimacy? 
""Codependence is an emotional and behavioral defense system which was adopted by our egos in order to meet our need to survive as a child.¬† Because we had no tools for reprogramming our egos and healing our emotional wounds (culturally approved grieving, training and initiation rites, healthy role models, etc.), the effect is that as an adult we keep reacting to the programming of our childhood and do not get our needs met ‚Äì our emotional, mental, Spiritual, or physical needs.¬† Codependence allows us to survive physically but causes us to feel empty and dead inside.¬† Codependence is a defense system that causes us to wound ourselves. 
Some people, when they first get into Recovery, when they first start on a healing path, mistakenly believe that they are supposed to take down their defenses and learn to trust everyone.¬† That is a very dysfunctional belief.¬† It is necessary to take down the dysfunctional defense systems but we have to replace them with defenses that work.¬† We have to have a defense system, we have to be able to protect ourselves.¬†¬† There is still a hostile environment out there full of wounded Adult Children whom it is not safe to trust. 
In our disease defense system we build up huge walls to protect ourselves and then ‚Äì as soon as we meet someone who will help us to repeat our patterns of abuse, abandonment, betrayal, and/or deprivation ‚Äì we lower the drawbridge and invite them in.¬† We, in our Codependence, have radar systems which cause us to be attracted to, and attract to us, the people, who for us personally, are exactly the most untrustworthy (or unavailable or smothering or abusive or whatever we need to repeat our patterns) individuals ‚Äì exactly the ones who will ""push our buttons."" 
This happens because those people feel familiar.¬† Unfortunately in childhood the people whom we trusted the most ‚Äì were the most familiar ‚Äì hurt us the most.¬† So the effect is that we keep repeating our patterns and being given the reminder that it is not safe to trust ourselves or other people 
Once we begin healing we can see that the Truth is that it is not safe to trust as long as we are reacting out of the emotional wounds and attitudes of our childhoods.¬† Once we start Recovering, then we can begin to see that on a Spiritual level these repeating behavior patterns are opportunities to heal the childhood wounds. 
The process of Recovery teaches us how to take down the walls and protect ourselves in healthy ways ‚Äì by learning what healthy boundaries are, how to set them, and how to defend them.¬† It teaches us to be discerning in our choices, to ask for what we need, and to be assertive and Loving in meeting our own needs.¬† (Of course many of us have to first get used to the revolutionary idea that it is all right for us to have needs.)"" 
As children we were victims ‚Äì as adult we kept repeating the behaviors we learned as children ‚Äì in one extreme or the other.¬† The people in our lives were actors we unconsciously cast in roles that would recreate our childhood wounding so that we could try to heal it ‚Äì try to get in right this time.¬† We were energetically drawn to, and attracted to us, the people who would treat us in ways that felt familiar ‚Äì because on some deep level we believed that is what we deserved.¬† If our own parents could not love us, then we must not deserve to be loved. 
In my Update Newsletter for October 2000, I talked about a mother and daughter that I had done some work with.¬† Several times a year I have counseling sessions with one or both of them as they have opportunities for growth in their recovery.¬† Earlier this week I had a session with the mother.¬† Her daughter had once again engaged in behavior that was dangerous and life threatening.¬† She was very upset about an incident that her daughter had experienced ‚Äì and was putting a lot of energy into blaming the daughter‚Äôs boyfriend. 
She kept saying how controlling, possessive, and abusive this boyfriend was and how she just couldn‚Äôt understand it.¬† She felt that her daughter had chosen the boyfriend over her own mother and out of the deep hurt she was feeling she was blaming.¬† She mentioned several times how she had said to her daughter, ""What is wrong with you!""¬†¬† Then she would swing to the other extreme and say, ""Maybe I failed somehow as a parent.""¬† She was caught up in codependent polarized reaction to her fear, pain, and shame. 
After letting her vent for a long period of time, I brought her back to focusing on her Spiritual belief system and applying the Serenity prayer to what was happening.¬† I reminded her that the reason her daughter was in a relationship that was controlling, possessive, and abusive was because that was the only type of relationship the daughter was familiar with.¬† I reminded her that she, in her concern and love for her daughter, out of her fear of her daughters self destructive behavior, had been controlling, possessive, and abusive.¬† I pointed out that it was abusive to say something like, ""what is wrong with you."" ‚Äì because it equates behavior with being.¬† Doing something ""wrong"" does not mean there is something wrong with us.¬† The daughter was in fact, just repeating her codependent patterns ‚Äì and to me, her behavior was not only understandable, but very predictable.¬† (And repeating the patterns was not a sign that she had not grown.¬† This was a new opportunity for growth at a higher level of consciousness for her ‚Äì a perfect part of her growth process, not some regression or slip into old behavior.¬† We make progress gradually.) 
Once I got her to stop reacting to her shame, fear, and hurt, and to stop viewing the situation from a polarized black and white, right and wrong, per

Once I got her to stop reacting to her shame, fear, and hurt, and to stop viewing the situation from a polarized black and white, right and wrong, perspective ‚Äì then she was able to get back to her recovery and start using the tools she has learned to help her let go of things she can‚Äôt control and focus on her inner process which she can have some degree of control over in a Loving way. 
The reality of codependence is that we get in relationship with people who feel familiar ‚Äì people who will repeat our childhood emotional dynamics.¬† We keep getting involved with people with whom we can recreate the emotional dynamics from our childhood in some way. 
A large part of the tragedy of codependency ‚Äì the insidiously dysfunctional nature of the disease ‚Äì is that by repeating the patterns we keep setting ourselves up to be abandoned and rejected.¬† To feel betrayed by our own unworthiness.¬† To reinforce the lie that we are inherently, and personally, shameful and unlovable. 
""I spent most of my life being the victim of my own thoughts, my own emotions, my own behaviors.¬† I was consistently picking untrustworthy people to trust and unavailable people to love.¬† I could not trust my own emotions because I was incapable of being honest with myself emotionally ‚Äì which made me incapable of Truly being honest on any level."" 
We are attracted to people who are unable to meet our needs, who are unavailable on some level, as a protection from allowing ourselves to get close to someone who could be available to us ‚Äì because then they would find out how shameful we are and reject us.¬† Allowing someone to see into us, to see who we really are, feels to the disease like the last thing we want to do ‚Äì and it generates incredible fear of allowing that kind of intimacy. 
Codependency is an emotional and behavioral defense system that does not work.¬† Our defense against pain and shame actually creates more pain ‚Äì and causes us to keep repeating painful patterns in a way which reinforces the belief that we are somehow defective, that we have good reason to feel ashamed of ourselves. 
Our fear of intimacy is reinforced by the evidence of how many ""stupid"" choices we have made in the past.¬† Our experiences in childhood caused us to fear intimacy and feel that we were somehow unlovable ‚Äì and our codependency caused us to keep creating new evidence of our inherent defectiveness. 
Nasty stuff indeed! 
We have a fear of intimacy for very good reasons.¬† We have a lifetime of experiences that reinforce the original messages ‚Äì that reinforces our feeling of being terrified of letting anyone get too close to us, see into us. 
The only way to overcome our fear of intimacy is to get into recovery for our codependency ‚Äì and do our inner child healing work so that we can learn to be emotionally honest and intimate with ourselves.¬† Integrating a Loving Spiritual belief system into our relationship with self and life is an invaluable step in taking power away from the toxic shame so that we can start to Love ourselves and be open to being Loved by others. 
""Learning what healthy behavior is will allow us to be healthier in the relationships that do not mean much to us;¬† intellectually knowing Spiritual Truth will allow us to be more Loving some of the time;¬† but in the relationships that mean the most to us, with the people we care the most about, when our ""buttons are pushed"" we will watch ourselves saying things we don‚Äôt want to say and reacting in ways that we don‚Äôt want to react ‚Äì because we are powerless to change the behavior patterns without dealing with the emotional wounds. 
We cannot integrate Spiritual Truth or intellectual knowledge of healthy behavior into our experience of life in a substantial way without honoring and respecting the emotions.¬† We cannot consistently incorporate healthy behavior into day to day life without being emotionally honest with ourselves.¬† We cannot get rid of our shame and overcome our fear of emotional intimacy without going through the feelings."" 
""The key to healing our wounded souls is to get clear and honest in our emotional process.¬† Until we can get clear and honest with our human emotional responses ‚Äì until we change the twisted, distorted, negative perspectives and reactions to our human emotions that are a result of having been born into, and grown up in, a dysfunctional, emotionally repressive, Spiritually hostile environment ‚Äì we cannot get clearly in touch with the level of emotional energy that is Truth.¬† We cannot get clearly in touch with and reconnected to our Spiritual Self. 
We, each and every one of us, has an inner channel to Truth, an inner channel to the Great Spirit.¬† But that inner channel is blocked up with repressed emotional energy, and with twisted, distorted attitudes and false beliefs. 
We can intellectually throw out false beliefs.¬† We can intellectually remember and embrace the Truth of ONENESS and Light and Love.¬† But we cannot integrate Spiritual Truths into our day-to-day human existence, in a way which allows us to substantially change the dysfunctional behavior patterns that we had to adopt to survive, until we deal with our emotional wounds.¬† Until we deal with the subconscious emotional programming from our childhoods. 
We cannot learn to Love without honoring our Rage! 
We cannot allow ourselves to be Truly Intimate with ourselves or anyone else without owning our Grief. 
We cannot clearly reconnect with the Light unless we are willing to own and honor our experience of the Darkness. 
We cannot fully feel the Joy unless we are willing to feel the Sadness. 
We need to do our emotional healing, to heal our wounded souls, in order to reconnect with our Souls on the highest vibrational levels.¬† In order to reconnect with the God-Force that is Love and Light, Joy and Truth.""

Well I‚Äôm sitting here all alone wondering how you are. And the thoughts of you spin round my head, like wheels on a car. And I wish you were beside me dreaming up at the stars. Well the times we had together, well they just blew me away. And I think about your soft green eyes, every single day. How my plans for us just seemed to fall, fade into gray. 
I guess I didn‚Äôt see it coming. How could I have been so blind? And as I cry myself to sleep. I wonder do I ever cross your mind. So won‚Äôt you smile for me my Texas angel? It‚Äôll be all right. You just lay your head beside me, dream of me tonight. And I promise I‚Äôll watch over you till the morning light. 
Well I‚Äôm heading back to the west coast, looking for my soul. Trying to mend the pieces, of shattered years before. And the ocean takes my pain away, as it comes rolling into shore. So if you see me walking down the street. Baby don‚Äôt turn away. I just want to see your smiling face, looking my way. And I never want to see you go, see you go away. 
Won‚Äôt you smile for me my Texas angel? It‚Äôll be all right. You just lay your head beside me, baby just hold me tight. And I promise I‚Äôll watch over you till the morning light.

Eyes of a Woman
He was rough, he was tough 
And he drank his whiskey straight 
He would fight every night if he didn?t get his way 
She was kind She could find all the good in everyone 
And then one day she passes his way 
He felt reborn in that morning sun 
And saw her face, she called his name 
And from that moment he knew he?d never be the same 
What you can find in the eyes of a woman 
Is a reason to believe 
Look deep inside the eyes of a woman 
See the man you want to be 
I?d been down 
Kicked around 
The world had got the best of me 
Out of rope 
Little hope I?d ever get back on my feet 
She took my hand, said yes you can 
One look at her and I?m a brand-new man 
What you can find in the eyes of a woman 
Is a reason to believe 
Look deep inside the eyes of a woman 
See the man you wanna be 
When I feel the need for inspiration 
With just one look I?ve found my salvation 
What you can find in the eyes of a woman 
Is a reason to believe 
Look deep inside the eyes of a woman 
See the man you wanna be 
See the man you wanna be 
See the man 
See the man you wanna be

by Joyce Meyer 
Today, people everywhere are struggling through life with damaged emotions. They‚Äôve endured a lot of negative things in their life, which cause untold damage that needs to be dealt with. But all too often, these hurts are simply swept under the rug in an attempt to make them go away. 
Through my own life‚Äôs experience and from my many years of helping others through this process, I‚Äôve discovered that although God wants to help those who really want emotional healing, there are some very important steps that the individuals must take for themselves. If you want to receive emotional healing, one of the first steps you must take is to face the truth. You can‚Äôt be set free while you live in denial. You can‚Äôt pretend that certain negative things didn‚Äôt happen to you. 
From my own experience, as well as my years of ministry to others, I have come to realize that we are experts at building walls and stuffing things into dark corners, pretending they never happened. 
I spent the first eighteen years of my life in an abusive environment. But as soon as I got away from that situation, I acted as though nothing was wrong. I never told anyone what had gone on in my private life. 
Why don‚Äôt we want to bring things like that out into the open? We are afraid of what people will think. We are afraid of being rejected, of being misunderstood, of losing the love of those we care about who might have a different opinion of us if they really knew all about us. 
The next step toward emotional healing is confessing your faults. I think there is a place for eventually sharing with someone else the things that have occurred in our lives. There is something about verbalizing it to another person that does wonders for us. But use wisdom. Choose someone you know you can trust. Be sure that by sharing your story with someone else, you don‚Äôt simply put your burden on that individual‚Äôs shoulders. Also, don‚Äôt go on a digging expedition, trying to dig up old injuries that have been buried and forgotten. 
When I finally worked up the courage to share with someone what had happened to me early in my life, I actually began shaking violently in fear. It was an emotional reaction to the things I had kept buried within me for so long. Now when I talk about my past, it is as though I am talking about somebody else‚Äôs problems. Because I have been healed and restored, my past doesn‚Äôt bother me anymore. 
Finally, you must assume some personal responsibility. Some people are trapped in denial, afraid of what might happen if others find out the truth about them. But as long as they deny the past, they are never going to be free from it. 
Nobody can be set free from a problem until they are willing to admit they have a problem. An alcoholic or a drug addict or anyone who has lost control of their life is doomed to suffer until they are able to say, ""I‚Äôve got a problem, and I need help with it."" 
Even though our problems may have been brought upon us because of something that was done to us against our will, we have no excuse for allowing the problem to persist or to grow and even take control over our entire life. Our past experiences may have made us the way we are, but we don‚Äôt have to stay that way. We can take the initiative and start taking positive steps to change things‚Äîand we can ask for God‚Äôs help. Whatever your problem may be‚Äîface it, consider confessing it to a trusted friend, and then admit it to yourself. 
Face the truth‚Äîit can be the beginning of a happier life!

What Does the Bible Say About Forgiveness?
The Bible speaks about every person needing forgiveness and every person needing to forgive. Why? Because we are all sinners in need of God‚Äôs forgiveness. None of us is perfect. We need God‚Äôs grace and we need to extend that same mercy to others. This subject is the very essence of true Christianity. Until we understand it, we will not really understand God Himself.
Likely, if you are reading this page, you want to receive God‚Äôs forgiveness, and you want to forgive. You want your slate to be clean. The problem is how? If we do not receive this grace from God, and extend it to others, the Scriptures make it clear that we will die in our sins. God has made forgiveness so important, that all our happiness and fulfillment depend on it‚Äìin this life and in the next. 
He knew that all of us, without exception will be wronged. Furthermore, all of us will treat others wrongly. All of us will sin against God and others. These sins block and hinder our relationship with Him. Jesus spoke more of forgiveness than possibly any other topic. This is a lesson we must learn on deeper and deeper levels until the very core of our being is changed into Love.
There is no life apart from God‚Äôs love. Therefore, there is no life apart from forgiveness, for forgiveness is the seal, the mark, and the proof of Love. If we say we have love and cannot walk in forgiveness, we deceive ourselves, and our ‚Äúlove‚Äù is only a parody of the real thing. 
We All Need Forgiveness
The psychologist, Freud, accurately determined that the main source of all humanity‚Äôs woes are feelings of guilt. He came to this profound truth, but didn‚Äôt know what to do with it. Today, we are encouraged by pop psychologists to ‚Äúfeel good about ourselves,‚Äù and to do away with the troubling guilt that we all have. The Bible teaches the opposite. It says we must face our sin and deal with it‚Äìand only then can we have the peace that the world craves so badly. It can be a frightening and painful thing to face our sin, yet we will never receive healing unless we do. Our guilt will continue to torment us and wreak havoc on our lives until we receive forgiveness for our sins. The key is not to ignore our guilt or try to gloss over it, but to face it and seek God for forgiveness, through the blood of Jesus. 
When Jesus died on the cross, He took our punishment upon Himself. He took the guilt of our sins and bore them in our place. He received all the emotional pain of the abuse, betrayal, injustice, and scorn that we ourselves have given and received. In a prophetic portrait of the future Christ, Isaiah wrote, ‚ÄúBut he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed‚Äù Isaiah 53:5.
In Hebrews 9:22, it says, ‚ÄúIn fact, under the Law, almost everything is purified by means of blood, and without the shedding of blood, there is neither release from sin and its guilt nor the remission of the due and merited punishment for sins‚Äù (Amplified Bible, emphasis mine). 
The weight of sin is so great that only shed blood can atone for it. We treat it so lightly, yet all the world is reeling and stunted and dying under the consequences of it. In the days of the Old Covenant (before Jesus came), God made laws requiring specific animals to be sacrificed to atone for certain sins. The one who committed the sin, was to slay the animal himself. We look at the Old Testament and wonder why God would be so strict, so seemingly cruel, and so specific. In confusion, many of us have said ‚ÄúWell, that is how God was back then‚Ä¶‚Äù and we try to put it out of our heads. There is something we must understand about God though. He does not change. He is the same yesterday, today and forever. What He hated 2,000 years ago He hates today, and will hate 2,000 years from now. He hates what destroys His creation, and He will be merciless against all forms of sin and injustice until every last bit is purged from us. (Please note that He is merciless with the sin, but not the repentant sinner!!)
Sin has destroyed this planet far more than even the most perceptive of us can realize. Only by shedding blood can we understand the extreme consequences of the price of sin. The shedding of blood is a vivid illustration that all sin will end in death. God, in His mercy, has allowed us to see and receive a small portion of the consequences of our sin in this lifetime, so we can change while we still have the opportunity to do so. After we die it will be to late. 
When we see that the price that we must each pay for our sins is lifeblood of something or someone‚Äì and that there is no way around it‚Äìthe dept must be paid, only then we begin to have a true appreciation of what happened on the Cross. 
If we do not understand the Cross, we can never receive absolution from the guilt that eats away at us. The Cross is essential for us to have new life. It is our only path to freedom.
Walking In The Joy Of A Clean Conscience
Up to this point, you may be feeling less optimistic than you did when you started this article. If you are, it is a good sign. Believe it or not, you are closer to freedom than you have ever been! As we stated earlier, to be free from any problem, we must first recognize that we have one. Sometimes this is the hardest part. Recognizing and dealing with our sin is the only way to overcome the consequences of it. Are you ready for the good news now? 
You can know beyond a shadow of a doubt that if you were to die tonight, you could stand before your Creator with a clean conscience. You don‚Äôt have to rely on hopeful wishes or vague optimism. You can be washed clean and fragrant and sparkling. You don‚Äôt have to hide from the guilty feelings that oppress you deep inside. You don‚Äôt have to mete out penance for yourself to ease your conscience. You don‚Äôt have to feel unworthy to come before the Lord in prayer, or accept the evil things Satan would try to do to you as your ‚Äúpunishment‚Äù from God. (Satan loves to masquerade as God Himself)!
God already punished Jesus in your place. If you were to receive your true punishment, you‚Äôd already be long dead! God‚Äôs grace has kept you alive this long for a reason. Part of it is bringing you to this very place so you can hear Him calling out to you. It‚Äôs not too late! No matter what you‚Äôve done, it isn‚Äôt too late for you to repent and to change you ways! If you are willing and ready to change your life, God is more than ready to help you, forgive you and restore you.
When Jesus cried out ‚ÄúIt is finished!‚Äù on the cross, and took His last breath, the curtain in the temple was ripped from top to bottom. This curtain was extremely thick, and separated the Holy Place from the Holy of Holies. This inner sanctuary was where the presence of the Living God dwelled. No unclean thing could enter into this sacred place. A priest only went in once a year and if he had any sin in his life, he would die as he came to minister before the Lord. Yet, when Jesus finished the work on the cross, that curtain that kept us away from God‚Äôs presence was ripped open, symbolizing a new relationship that we can now have with the Living God. 
Jesus‚Äô atoning death on the cross made it possible for us to receive complete access to the presence of God. We can be forgiven of all our sins and no longer need to cower in the distance, afraid to face God. This problem has been dealt with once and for all, but we need to apply it for it to have any significance in our lives. This will not work if we agree only in theory. It must become a practical action in our lives.
Steps to Receive God‚Äôs Forgiveness 
Forgiveness is not automatic. Through the blood of Jesus, every person alive has the opportunity to receive forgiveness, but it does not happen involuntarily. The Bible makes it clear that there are some conditions we must meet to obtain God‚Äôs forgiveness. Let‚Äôs look at the following verses to find out what we must do to obtain forgiveness.
1. 1 John 1:9 ‚ÄúIf we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.‚Äù
Hosea 14:2-3 ‚ÄúTake words with you and return to the Lord. Say to him: ‚ÄòForgive all our sins and receive us graciously, that we may offer the fruit of our lips‚Ä¶We will never again say ‚Äòour gods‚Äô to what our own hands have made'‚Äù (NIV). 
From the above verses, the first thing we see is that we must confess our sins. We must recognize where we have erred, and hurt God by our actions. When confessing your sins to God, be as specific as you can. General confessions do very little to convict of sin, or to convince God of your seriousness, or to bring healing in those areas.
2. Isaiah 55:7 ‚ÄúLet the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the LORD, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.‚Äù
Ezekiel 18:21, ‚ÄúBut if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he hath committed, and keep all my statutes, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall surely live, he shall not die.‚Äù
Our next step in receiving forgiveness, is to turn from our wicked ways and change them. We may struggle with a certain sin, but if our intent is truly to change our ways and overcome that sin, God will give us the grace to do it. Many want to receive forgiveness from God without changing their ways. God knows the difference between those who are sincere and those who are using Him to temporarily ease their conscience. He is not mocked or deceived. If one comes to him in sorrow, humility and sincerity, His grace is abundant. However, He has little patience for those who would abuse His mercy. Search your heart and ask God to give you the grace for true repentance, and the power of the Holy Spirit to make the changes you need to do. His greatest joy is to help those who repent in sincerity.
This should include asking forgiveness of those you have wronged and making restitution to them. True repentance will always be accompanied by corresponding actions. 
3. Along these lines, the Bible also makes it clear that we are to ‚Äúmake right‚Äù any situations where we have failed in our responsibilities to others.
Matthew 5:23-25 Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee; Leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift. Agree with thine adversary quickly, whiles thou art in the way with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison.
Romans 13:7 ‚ÄúGive everyone what you owe him: If you owe taxes, pay taxes; if revenue, then revenue; if respect, then respect; if honor, then honor‚Äù (NIV).
If we are sincere in our repentance we must be willing to pay the penalty for our crimes against others. This could include restoration of any goods, monies, or services that were taken wrongfully, (or never given at all, if we owed them). The Lord says to ‚Äúagree with our adversary.‚Äù If we are in dispute with someone, that means we must admit to what we have done and quit trying to defend ourselves. If we are in the wrong (even partially) it is better to take responsibility for it, than to argue for our rights. 
Many of us have failed to give honor and respect to those who are due it. That includes elders of any kind. They may be our parents, those in ministry, government leaders, our employers, those who are merely older than us in general, etc. Even if we don‚Äôt agree with all their decisions, we are to honor and respect them for the office and position they hold. We are to refer to them with respect, both to their face and behind their back. Furthermore, God also commands us to treat everyone with common courtesy and respect regardless of who they are, because they are created in His image. Again, we do not have to concur with everything they do, but we owe them basic respect, out of respect for God. In fact, how much we really respect God will be evident in how we treat others. 
If you have failed to show proper respect and/or honor for someone, it is your responsibility to apologize (if applicable), and to change your ways. No one can do this for you. If you do not change your ways, you will face the inevitable slide into prideful self-deception and self-righteousness, both of which are an abomination to God.
4. Matthew 6:14-15, ‚ÄúFor if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you: But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.‚Äù
Mark 11:25-26 (Amplified) ‚ÄúAnd whenever you stand praying, if you have anything against anyone, forgive him and let it drop‚Äìleave it, let it go‚Äìin order that your Father Who is in heaven may also forgive you your (own) failings and shortcomings and let them drop. But if you do not forgive, neither will your Father in heaven forgive your failings and shortcomings.‚Äù
These verses are perhaps some of the least applied Scriptures in the Kingdom of God. Somehow, many of us are deceived into thinking that we do not have to take them literally. However, Jesus emphasized this principal over and over again in His parables and teachings. If we receive God‚Äôs forgiveness, it is our duty to forgive those who have wronged us. The two are inseparable. Jesus said plainly that God will not forgive us, if we do not forgive others. Many Christians are full of condemnation and guilt because they still feel the weight of their sins, even though they‚Äôve asked God to forgive them. Could it be that they have not been able to receive God‚Äôs forgiveness because they still have bitterness in their own hearts toward others? Sometimes, we may carry bitterness and hurt so long, that we no longer even recognize it as a problem. It becomes a part of our very nature. We may not scheme for revenge, but our souls are clouded with a quiet, persistent bitterness. 
Some of us have been betrayed in devastating ways, and have suffered profoundly at the hand of abusive people. Others have been horribly mistreated by those of other races, nations, and religions. If you are suffering with deep unhealed wounds, know the Lord has also been hurt with your pain. He loves you and wants to heal you. It is because of His great love for you that He is calling you to forgive. It is your only release from the emotional prison that you are now in. 
You do not have to live in a continual state of submission to evil emotions. You can be free of them, through the power of the cross. ‚ÄúBehold, I make all things new‚Äù says the Lord. You can be made new on the inside, and no longer staggering under a load of bitterness, hatred, pain, and depression. God wants to set you free right now! 
Forgiveness In Practice
If you have been wounded, God will take even this frustration and pain of rejection in your life and work it for something good so you can be a vessel of healing to His people‚Äìif you let Him. 
‚Äú‚Ä¶But what if they don‚Äôt even see how bad they‚Äôve hurt me?‚Äù Whether they see it or not is between them and the Lord. Your responsibility is simply to forgive them.
‚Äú‚Ä¶I‚Äôm afraid if I forgive, I‚Äôll only get hurt again.‚Äù If you call on the Lord for wisdom He will help you in your situation. If you are in an abusive relationship/partnership/friendship you need to pray about whether you should stay in it. You can still forgive them, but it doesn‚Äôt mean that you have to live with, or be closely associated with them. There is a difference. 
‚Äú‚Ä¶If I forgive them, they‚Äôll only go on hurting others.‚Äù If the person who hurt you has done it in an illegal way such as sexual abuse, theft, murder, etc., you have a responsibility to do all you can to stop others from being hurt in the same way. However, you can still forgive them, in the sense that you do not actively hate them, and can pray for God‚Äôs mercy on them. 
When God forgives us, He no longer holds our sins against us. Therefore, we don‚Äôt have the right to hold others‚Äô sins against them‚Äìnot if we belong to Jesus. If we belonged to the world, we could indulge in bitterness, but the blood-bought child of a merciful King has no such right. 
Whether we ‚Äúfeel‚Äù forgiveness in our hearts or not, we are under obligation to obey God. As we obey Him, He will supply the feelings. Obedience must come first, then the right feelings will follow. We can‚Äôt wait for a special nudge from On High to get us to do what His Word already tells us plainly to do. The longer we wait, the worse off we will be. Oswald Chambers, in his famous devotional, ‚ÄúMy Utmost For His Highest,‚Äù preaches strongly about this concept:
‚ÄúRevise where you have become stodgy spiritually and you will find it goes back 
to a point where you knew there was something you should do, but you did not do 
it because there seemed no immediate call to, and now you have no perception, 
no discernment; at a time of crisis you are spiritually distracted instead of 
spiritually self-possessed.‚Äù 
The best way to be rid of bearing a grudge against someone (or a race, nation, gender, or church, etc.), is to confess it to the Lord and seek His help. Then, begin to pray for that person as if you were praying for yourself. 
‚ÄúLord, bless so and so. Cause their way to be pleasing to You in all that they do. Lead them closer to you! Cleanse them of all sin and give them the grace and strength to repent of any wickedness in their heart. Cause them to thirst for intimacy with You, and let them be fulfilled in Your presence. Let them honor You and put You first in all their ways. Send Your Holy Spirit to minister to them, to strengthen them, and to lead them. Let them fulfill the call of God on their life. Bless their family/job/ministry/etc. Cause them to be fruitful and to be established in your love. Minister to them in the area of their deepest needs. Help me to be truly concerned for them. Let me have your heart for this person. Show me how to pray for them and love them as you want me to‚Ä¶.‚Äù
Then, bind away any spirit of deception that has come over them, or anything else the Lord may show you in prayer. This is what ‚Äúloving our enemies‚Äù is all about. It is looking past the sin they have committed against us, and honestly wanting the best for them and for God to be merciful to them. 
Matthew 5:44-48: ‚ÄúBut I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you; That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust. For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? Do not even the publicans the same? And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than others? Do not even the publicans so? Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.‚Äù
As you are faithful to pray for those who have wronged you in this way, you will see a change come about in them‚Äìand in you!!! Instead of hate, you will begin to have God‚Äôs compassion for them. There is nothing that pleases the Lord more than to see His children bearing each other‚Äôs burdens, loving each other from the heart, and living in humility toward each other. 
‚ÄúStanding on the promises of God‚Äù
Many have written us with a fear that perhaps they have ‚Äúgone too far.‚Äù They have continually struggled with a besetting sin that seems to master them again and again. They wonder if they have lost their salvation, if God has given up on them, of if they were ever truly saved at all.
Please know this: If you are crying out to Him for forgiveness, it is only because He has given you the grace to do so‚Äìand He WILL answer your heart‚Äôs cry. If you were past the point of no return, you wouldn‚Äôt even care about the concept of forgiveness. It is only because you belong to the Lord that you are still seeking Him. 
Jesus said in John 6:37, ‚ÄúAll whom My Father has given (entrusted) to Me, will come to Me and I will most certainly not cast out‚ÄìI will never, no never reject one of them who comes to Me‚Äù (Amplified).
If you are feeling weak, understand this about your beautiful Savior: ‚ÄúHe does not crush the weak, or quench the smallest hope‚Ä¶‚Äù (Matthew 12:20, Living Bible).
God loves you and He is on your side to help you overcome sin. He is not against you. He is for you. Please refer to the above (and following) scriptures as often as you feel the need‚Äìas often as the devil would whisper lies of condemnation in your ear (Satan literally means ‚ÄúAccuser‚Äù and that is what he does best). Jesus stood against the devil with scripture and we should do the same thing! These promises are true and precious, for ‚ÄúGod is not a man that He should lie‚Äù (Numbers 23:19). Even if you don‚Äôt ‚Äúfeel‚Äù forgiven, that is beside the point. God‚Äôs word is truer than our emotions. 
All of us have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God. That is why Jesus died for us in the first place! This is the most basic tenant of Christianity, yet it seems it is the primary lesson we all must learn again and again. God doesn‚Äôt love us because we are worthy. He loves us because He IS Love. 
Hebrews 10:18-23, ‚ÄúNow where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin. Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus, By a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh; And having an high priest over the house of God; Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water. Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering; (for he is faithful that promised.)
1 John 4:16-18 (NIV), ‚ÄúAnd so we know and rely on the love God has for us. God is love. Whoever lives in love lives in God and God in him. In this way love is made complete among us so that we will have confidence on the day of judgement, because in this world we are like him. There is no fear in love. But perfect love drives out fear because fear has to do with punishment. The one who fears is not made perfect inlove.‚Äù
Psalm 103: 8-13, ‚ÄúThe LORD is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy. He will not always chide neither will he keep his anger for ever. He hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us according to our iniquities. For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is his mercy toward them that fear him. As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our transgressions from us. Like as a father pitieth his children, so the LORD pitieth them that fear him.‚Äù
Psalm 34:18, ‚ÄúThe LORD is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart; and saveth such as be of a contrite spirit.‚Äù
Isaiah 44:22 (NIV), ‚ÄúI have swept away your offenses like a cloud, your sins like the morning mist. Return to me for I have redeemed you.‚Äù 
Micah 7:19, ‚ÄúHe will turn again, he will have compassion upon us; he will subdue our iniquities; and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea.‚Äù
Psalm 103:2-3, ‚ÄúBless the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits:Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy diseases;‚Äù
Romans 10:11, ‚ÄúFor the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.‚Äù
Jesus said that the one who is forgiven much will love much. We all need to be forgiven of much, but very few of us recognize it. If you recognize your sins and mourn deeply because of them, you are closer to true love than all the multitudes who are doing ‚Äújust fine.‚Äù 
However, just as there is a time to mourn for our sins, there is also a time to rejoice that we are truly forgiven and clothed in the very righteousness of Christ Himself. Once we have been forgiven, God wants us to walk free of the burden of guilt. That is why He assures us over and over in His word that He literally forgets our sins. I used to think preachers only made that up, until I saw it in the Bible. As if forgiveness were not enough, God also gives us the royal robes of holiness to wear. In Him, we are made righteousness in Christ. If that is not something to rejoice about, nothing is! Praise God!!!
2 Corinthians 5:21, ‚ÄúFor he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.‚Äù
It Is Utterly Impossible For Love To Be Defeated
In all of God‚Äôs creation, one thing can absolutely never be defeated, and that is Love. Though it has been trivialized, mocked, perverted, ignored, and trampled on, True Love will eventually change the whole order and fabric of creation. It is impossible for this not to happen. God is Love, and God will never be defeated. Love cannot fail, but it will vanquish every foe that is set against it, of which unforgiveness, bitterness, hatred and pride are a part. These things will cease absolutely one day. But we can hasten that day and speed it‚Äôs coming, by applying the parameters of love to our lives now. If we do this, we wage spiritual war with the most powerful (and essentially only) weapon of spiritual warfare that there is. 
We all love to talk about love in the abstract, but the depth of our commitment to it is revealed in our willingness and ability to forgive. It is the true measure of what sort of warrior we really are, in the kingdom of God. No matter what accusations the Enemy may make, forgiveness drowns them in the blood of Jesus, and turns the bullets of his words into butterflies. That is why forgiveness and walking in love cannot be mere options for the Christian. Either we do it, or we don‚Äôt. If we don‚Äôt, we deceive ourselves that we are Christ‚Äôs followers. If we want to follow Jesus then we must walk where He walked. We must forgive as He forgives and love as He loves. The simplicity of this gospel is the only thing that can and will transform us‚Äìand the world!
We‚Äôve all heard these words, but let‚Äôs read them again from the Amplified Bible:
‚ÄúLove endures long and is patient and kind; love never is envious nor boils over with jealousy; it is not boastful or vainglorious, does not display itself haughtily. It is not conceited‚Äìarrogant and inflated with pride; it is not rude (unmannerly), and does not act unbecomingly. Love (God‚Äôs love in us) does not insist on its own rights or its own way, for it is not self-seeking ; it is not touchy or fretful or resentful; it takes no account of the evil done to it‚Äìpays no attention to a suffered wrong. It does not rejoice at injustice and unrighteousness , but rejoices when right and truth prevail. Love bears up under anything and everything that comes, is ever ready to believe the best about every person, its hopes are fadeless under all circumstances and it endures everything (without weakening). Love never fails‚Äìnever fades out or becomes obsolete or comes to an end‚Äù (1 Corinthians 13:4-8).
If you need to pray for forgiveness, here is a sample prayer to help you:
‚ÄúDear Heavenly Father,
Thank you for Your grace and mercy to me. Forgive me for my hardness of heart which I have displayed to others as well as You. Cleanse me of all self-absorption, self-pity, anger, hatred, bitterness, vengefulness, hopelessness and resentment. Help me to walk in Your love and to know Your love in my own heart. Though I don‚Äôt have it within me, I know that You have it within You and that you share your power with the weak. I confess my weakness and I look to You to make me strong in love, patience, longsuffering and humility. I look to all the testing of my faith as something good, for You know it will make me stronger in it. You are rich in mercy and will not chide and scold forever. I‚Äôm calling on You for forgiveness and the strength to believe Your Word and to follow it. Now, Lord, please send me the power of the Holy Spirit to strengthen me so I can follow through with all You‚Äôve put in my heart. Help me not to stumble back into my old ways, but walk in the newness of life that You have promised those who are born again. Let my life be the very fragrance of grace to all I meet. Let me show others the the kind of love that You have shown me. Thank you for your faithfulness Lord. I cling to your mercy and love You with all my heart.‚Äù 
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äì

hey journal,
Its been awhile since I updated anything on here. I have been in ft worth living in my new apt. You know sometimes living alone is liberating but most of the time it is terrible. I always wanted to be living alone, but I dont really enjoy it at all. I find that when I am home I have alot more time to spend with me and really drives me nuts. I am where I used to be doing laundry and it all seems so weird. I read a book all the way thru last night called ""Its not about me."" by max lucado. The book made so much sense, I just cant seem to get my relationship with god. I do then it goes‚Ä¶I have the stress of my mother writing me telling me she needs $$$$‚Ä¶and the inpending birth of my brothers child, both of these not any of my doing, but still none the less a stressor. I have been stuffy the last week, which I think has to do with my mind set. I am so lonely, I feel like I just moved to a island in the pacific ‚Ä¶and there is no one around anymore. All, this has been done by my doing but still not a easy pill to swallow. I am listening to a song that always made me feel better.""gods will"". I want so much to finally get gods will and never look back, it just seems when I try it stays for only a minute then its gone.I really dont have much to gripe about, I just hate alone time. I am going to try to make the services at highland church tonight. I feel like crying, but it wont come and im scared that if i start, it wont end‚Ä¶for all these years thats why I have never dealt with this crap.

to standin in your presense,
for you hate all who do evil.
You will destroy those who tell lies
The lord destests murderers and deceivers.
Because of your unfalling love,I can enter
your house;with deepest awe I will worship at
temple.
Lead me in the right path,O Lord‚Äô
or my enemies will conquer me,
Tell me clearly what to do,
and show me which way to turn.
My enemies cannot speak one truthful word,
Their deepest desire is to destroy others,
THeir talk is foul,like the stench from an open
grave,Their speech is filled with flattery.
O‚ÄôGod declare them guilty
Let them be caught in their own traps,
Drive them away because of their many sins,
for they rebel against you.
But let all who take refuge in you rejoice,
let them sing joyful praises forever,
Protect them.
so all who love your name may be filled
with joy.
For you bless the godly,O Lord,
surrounding them with your shield of love.
I am saying this psalm today because I feel tired and kind of out of it. I know that the devil is trying to get in but I am doing what I know is needed to keep him at bay. He can not have me..it has been claimed. I love me today and not on a conceited way of once was. I really am gaining a understanding of what being not of the earth is really about. It is trully haveing a understanding and watching as those that choose earth live here daily, never really succeding but just almost reaching‚Ä¶and losing. Without god in all that you do, there is only temporary gain and tremendous loss. I once was told to yoke myself up with those that believe stronger then I to be able to lean on them when I wasnt feeling strong. I didnt, I chose to do it alone, and made a huge mess because of my poor choices. I know today that god doesnt leave ‚Ä¶even when we walk away he is still with us, we just must make a effort to invite him back thru the front door of our home. All praise be to god the creator of all, thank you for giving your son for all my sins, so that I may be given another chance at eternal life. I love you lord, at times when my eyes fall off you‚Ä¶so does my faith. I am working on keeping my eyes on you at all times. For my sight is bad, therefore I must use what I know keeps all clear. I love you so much father..thank you for today and all that is in it. Your son, Martin

Song: God bless the broken road, Rascal Flatts
mood: good at the moment:)
Hey journal,
Its been awhile since I really wrote a entry in here, but I am sitting here waiting on my laundry to finish and thought I would get on here and write something.I had a tough week but was able to leave at lunch on friday due to all the hours I put in. I spent the weekend just lounging and trying to keep my focus on the ""greater plan "" for me. I have been reading alot of self-help books as well as the book with all the answers MY Bible. I used to hear this song alot because we went to see this band in concert at Bossier LA. I sat there that night and thought why am I always crawling in my skin?I know today that was caused by fear of all that I was not being truthful in. I dont really feel that feeling much anymore if at all. My moods are pretty stable and I dont cause chaos when things are going good. I tend to try to help more then I ask for it. I pray for god to take all that I cant handle and step out of the way to allow it to happen. I know that all is for a reason, in Gods world there are no mistakes. I was led to a great family that taught me and cared about me enough to keep me going back to GOD. I can never repay that, I thank them every night ‚Ä¶even if they dont hear it:) I am doing it ya‚Äôll. I am living without the fear of the past binding me to misery,chaos,and pain. I was in Academy the other day and something happend to me‚Ä¶.I saw this longhorn outfit for a baby, instantly that love for my brothers child came over me, I bought that outfit, I am so happy for him. I know alot of times in my addiction of dysfunction I never cared for anyone but me or just about what I wanted or ""needed"". Well, I have a understanding today that all that is truelly needed is a relationship with christ that enables you to have a filling of the soul so that void goes away, the void that in the past used to eat me alive. I see so many mirror images of my former self every day in my office. The self sabatagers, the martyrs, the victims, the lost, the low self esteems, all due to the fact they seek the Answer ‚Ä¶the truth. It is stated time and time again‚Ä¶without love life is death, without the word, god is waiting at the door for you to let him in. I was thinking the other day about the three deaths spoke on in the bible, I thought well we die once from baptism, from freedom from being bound to the earth, and the eventul death. well, I feel that everyday as the word goes thru my brain I feel less connected to the earth or of the earth. I know that alot of people become ""religious fanatics.."" I am happy with my relationship with my creator. I know that it is thru him that I died, and was reborn to the man that I was made to be. I know that alot of times individuals with abuse or chemical problems seek people,places,things for a filler and I did that for so many years, and used and abused‚Ä¶so much‚Ä¶but my god today tells me‚Ä¶""No mistakes."" I repair what you think of as broken, I repair what your human self will does, I make anew what you total when you try to live it on your terms‚Ä¶..lay it down child, I will repair you when you have had enough. I love my life today, just have to hit your face alot of times before you realize what the love of god is trying to show you. I was trying to be taught patience, love, compassion,empathy, honesty,consistancy,leave the quick fix alone, humility of life other then myself. I have emotions today where I need them, I laugh I cry I know that I trully love me today, one day soon if not today, I can give something away to someone to maybe plant a seed for their lives. I also have learned control is nothing more then fear and anger combined to make everything as the illusion would have it seem‚Ä¶.my clarity has brought it back‚Ä¶.I feel brand new, clean, and serene, no people place or things are doing it, because I have it inside to build on..now. Please be gracious to the weak and the weary, the poor and the sick, the lost and confused, sometimes we get tired of walking around in darkness, then when we are ready the light comes on!‚Ä¶.god bless the bells, and humanity as a whole‚Ä¶.give us one more day father. love martin.:)

I am going thru a situation today that Im not sure how to deal with. I guess that is why I am writing in here. I had a situation back in july with my check. They made a mistake and over paid us in the last three checks and I thought nothing about it and today I found out that I was liable for those over sites. We were in the process of getting a raise so I thought they were just the raise amount. Well, today I found out that I was liable for 1000 of the amount. I will only get paid for like forty hours this check and next check til it is paid off.I was angry and hurt by the situation because I thought it was just a raise well, now I am stressing on my rent and bills‚Ä¶but you know I am beating myself up for this oversite.I am stressing about the fact that how could I have been so dumb and taken that and not questioned it. Once again a easy way out..ugh I never freaking learn it seems.I dont know what im gonna do with this so i had to rid my head of it. I will have to do the best I can.

Hey journal,
I am sitting here just finished facilitating a group we call enounters.It basically is when one person confronts another about their behavior. I think they are really not that confrontational but it is a good tool in the TC program. I have been just taking it easy and letting things happen the way they are ment to. Just trying not to cause anything out of the ordinary to happen.I am very thankful for so much today. I know that alot of negativity is in the world and for so many years that was me. I know the difference in keeping with positive people. I have had a lot of feelings on old behaviors I have exibited,but you know today I must live and let live. I know in times we seem to want answers and accountability,but after a certain extent the accountability seems useless due to the same thing being gone over and over. That is how the encounter is you bring the behavior,the person hears feedback and then the person owns it and states positive resolutions to the behavior. I know that this job is unique in the way that we deal with individuals but some may say confrontation is to harsh or non theraupeutic,but you know when this individual has manipulated,lied,deceived,a encounter must take place. It happens in all walks of life to show the individual enough is enough,its not about the messenger but the messege. I know alot of times I didnt like anything that I was doing to be brought to my attention,but today I feel that I can take alot more in alot of areas that I didnt even bend before. I have had a lot of things in my life go way weird wrong‚Ä¶.to say the least,but you know like I told my group tonight, at which point are you gonna let it go? keep rehashing the incident for what? the resentment is already made, to keep talking about it and rehashing doesnt get a solution any faster, just keeps you giving a reason to be miserble and angry at something that was not pleasent. I was a big one with this, I would ride out something to death, then keep it going to give me a excuse to have a pity party. my last entry was a bit of that, its done deal with it move on‚Ä¶have faith in the creator, not put it all on the earth or earthly ones. If there was only sunshine all the time and no rain would we ever have the beauty in the flowers that we see? no..I know it seems that its easier to move on when your not the one that was hurt‚Ä¶but its a coping skill that I never had, never wanted to move on..to constantly play the martyr, to keep it going because I wanted to feel vindicated or for someone to see my side of it. I am not that great only god is‚Ä¶he heals all that we destroy, he makes all anew again, he is stronger and bigger then anything we touch. To truly have faith we must let him take it, and move out the way‚Ä¶if we think we can change anything or make something better,that is when we must say are we doubting his perfection? there is a reason why all happens, and even in the mist of all that is viewed as evil there is a silver lining‚Ä¶
For god can use sorrow in our lives to help turn away from sin and seek salvation.We will never regret that kind of sorrow‚Ä¶Just see what this godly sorrow produced in YOU! You showed that you have done everything to make things right(2 corinthians 7:9-11)
I know that life isnt all about happiness but about worship and belief that this is only a stopping point in the journey to eternity. I know god is bigger then the cross we try to carry every day, I am kneeling,humility is a grace given by almighty god, GOd bless all my fellow brothers and sisters in Christ‚Ä¶.love martin

hey journal, 
I am sitting in front of this screen to relieve some of the thoughts that are going around and around in my head. I am having a hard day today, I feel really confused and lost inside. I know that pain does that in a certain way, but at times I dont know why? These two songs remind me alot of myself, and the things that have ended up happening in my life. I dont know how I used to go thru life without a pulse on what others felt or even that I couldnt care. I talked to someone last night via messenger and I really just wanted to tell her I ask for forgiveness. I know that in time we rehash things but I have wrote about it talked about it but never really told her. It is over. I assume somewhere deep in the depths of my mind I always saw this ending different. I am not regressing just venting to you my dear online friend. I am crying on the inside and I cant feel the tears on the outside because I am in shock and trying to not feel it. I really should not have even spoke with her. I just wanted to do the next right thing. I have learned this in therapy that you cant get anothers approval if they dont approve. At this point, approval isnt what I am after. I just feel so good on a daily basis that I want to do things correctly, well, what now? I am doing a feelings check: I am alot of things, angry,resentful,let down,confused,and numb. Barbara would say you are disassociating martin‚Ä¶well you know I am not being selfish in feeling these emotions. In the fantasy of holding on to her I guess I thought I will get better and time will heal the wounds and we will get back together. All is over though now as reality has since replaced ""fantasy"". What did I think? did i think it really would happen with all that went on? Is that fair to her? hell is it fair to me? Cause lets face it martin‚Ä¶.you dont have any control over anyone or their thoughts,feelings or emotions. She deserves happiness, accept this and move on. First step‚Ä¶.powerless over my illusion thoughts‚Ä¶.and therfore make my life unmanageable thinking all will work itself out and be again. I feel so damn numb right now‚Ä¶.I wish I could cry‚Ä¶.I asked her to let go of me last night ‚Ä¶the ""illusion"" part of me or the beginning of this diary me‚Ä¶well, I must let go of the ""image"" I had of her as well. Life goes on‚Ä¶people move on without you alot of the time out of self preservation‚Ä¶and why blame them? a year ago‚Ä¶.already and in my therapy started feeling all these feelings about her‚Ä¶like a uncovering of things that were‚Ä¶and never made it to the surface‚Ä¶thats all they were martin‚Ä¶she doesnt see anything in that time but pain she told you so‚Ä¶.so why not see it too‚Ä¶..the pain you caused‚Ä¶the disappointment you caused. ‚Ä¶..let go‚Ä¶give this to god‚Ä¶.jon told me today that in your mind martin you hang on‚Ä¶when your heart has already let go‚Ä¶.I do know this though‚Ä¶.I did love her‚Ä¶I did know that.

e is exactly what you live thru when you decide to lay it down. I have to see that I am all alone in ft worth, I lost all that I thought was what I needed to be happy‚Ä¶I dont have any real close friends‚Ä¶.I have god‚Ä¶I have those that hold me in their hearts‚Ä¶but no one wants to be around me still ‚Ä¶its like I have a illness that will haunt me til the day I leave this earth.

Overcoming guilt and shame does not mean not caring about your actions. It involves taking responsibility for what you did and coming to terms with it. There are 5 steps:
¬†
Assess the seriousness of the action: frequently guilt and shame means that you are living your life in a way that violates your principles or that you are judging too many small actions as serious. Questions to consider: Do other people consider this to be as serious as I do? Do some people consider it less serious? Why? How serious would I consider the experience if my best friend was responsible instead of me? How important will this experience seem in one month? One year? Five years? How serious would I consider this to be if someone had done this to me? Did I know ahead of time the meaning or consequences of my actions (or thoughts)? Can the damage be corrected? How long will this take? Was there an even worse action I considered and avoided?
¬†
Weigh your personal responsibility. How much of the violation was your sole personal responsibility? List all the people and aspects of a situation that contributed to an event about which you feel guilty or ashamed. Include your self last. Assign percentages as to who was responsible.
¬†
My chief concern this morning is Christians who are unable to put the past behind them, and the result is defeated lives, a lack of joy, and complete ineffectiveness in ministry. Our passage today conveys a most amazing truth: there is no sinner so gross or so corrupt that Jesus Christ cannot make a past tense out of his lifestyle. But it also tells us that the past must remain in the past. I encourage you to open your Bibles and keep them open, but if you don‚Äôt have one with you, our Scripture text will be on the screen.
¬†
(1 Corinthians 6:9-11)
¬†
¬†
¬†
The unrighteous do not have to stay that way. (11)
¬†
¬†
¬†
Our fate is never sealed until we take our last breath. One of the beautiful things about the Gospel is that it shows how one‚Äôs present can become one‚Äôs past. Verse 11 contains one of the truly great statements in all of the Bible. ""And such were some of you."" That is a statement of hope following a verse of despair. It is a statement of triumph following a verse of defeat. And all of its meaning is wrapped up in the tense of the verb. ""And such were some of you."" It‚Äôs sad, but you can never live down your past with some people. What you were is what you will always be as far as they are concerned. If you ever lied to them you are a liar. If you ever stole, you are a thief. If you were ever divorced, you are a divorcee.
¬†
Not so with God. He can take the ugliest present and turn it into a past. He can make a person a former idolater, a former adulterer, a former slanderer, and a former alcoholic. In fact, there is no life too gross or too corrupt that Jesus Christ cannot make a past tense out of it. The only person unredeemable is the one whose heart is too proud or too hard to accept God‚Äôs forgiveness. All others can experience transformation. In other words, a lost sinner can become a sinner saved by grace.
¬†
The radical change that takes place is described in verse 11 in a three-fold manner. ""And such were some of you, but you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and in the Spirit of our God."" The repetition of the conjunction ""but"" three times may not be very good grammar; in fact, the NIV and most modern translations include it only once. But it is found in the Greek text three times, and it expresses the strongest possible contrast in the Greek language. Paul is trying to set up the incredible difference between the past and the present in their lives. ""This is what you were but this happened, but this happened, but this happened""
¬†
All three of the verbs are in the past tense, actually a tense that in Greek generally speaks of once-for-all action. Something climactic happened to them and they would never be the same! Let‚Äôs examine each of these three actions which must take place before a lost sinner can become a sinner saved by grace.
¬†
1. He must be washed. There are two distinct interpretations of the phrase, ""you were washed."" One sees it as the washing of regeneration by the blood of Christ, while the other sees it as baptism. The problem with the former is that it doesn‚Äôt fit the grammar. The verb ""washed"" is not in the passive voice, as our English Bibles would make us think, but rather in the Greek middle voice, and it should be translated, ""you washed yourselves.""
¬†
That leads me to think that Paul is talking about the washing of baptism. I‚Äô m certainly not a believer in salvation by baptism (and I don‚Äôt think this passage teaches that), but neither do I think we should make it say something else if Paul meant to refer to baptism. Acts 22:16, I believe, throws some light on our passage. That verse says, ""And now what are you waiting for? Get up, be baptized and wash your sins away, calling on his name."" Here we find the same verb, also in the middle voice, and its connection with baptism is undeniable.
¬†
It is not baptism which saves a person, but in the NT baptism is viewed as the human side of conversion. These Corinthians had been gross sinners, but they had turned to Christ for a spiritual washing which was symbolized by being baptized. Their present became their past when they had themselves washed.
¬†
2. He must be sanctified. This second phrase turns our attention to God‚Äôs side of conversion. The verb is again past tense, but now is in the passive voice, showing that the subject is being acted upon by God. The term sanctification, like washing, has two possible meanings in the NT-one is objective and the other is subjective. The root meaning of the word is ""to set apart"" or ""to cause someone to become holy"", and normally we think of it in the subjective sense. That is, we speak of someone becoming sanctified as he becomes more mature holy in his living patterns.
¬†
But sometimes the word is used objectively or positionally to describe a person‚Äôs state before God when he believes. In other words, when a person becomes a Christian he is immediately sanctified or set apart from his old allegiances and set apart to God. Subjective sanctification should, of course, follow objective sanctification, just as maturity should follow birth, but here, because of the past tense, I am inclined to think Paul is speaking primarily of objective sanctification, or the believer‚Äôs position in Christ.
¬†
3. He must be justified. This is the third great thing that must happen if a lost sinner is to become a sinner saved by grace. This verb, too, is in the past tense and passive voice, since it is God who justifies-no man ever yet justified himself in God‚Äôs sight, though many have tried.
¬†
The doctrine of justification is a beautiful and fundamental biblical truth. The closest synonym for ""justification"" is ""acquittal."" In a criminal court the defendant may well be guilty, but if he is d
eclared ""not guilty"" for lack of evidence or for any other reason, then he is set free anyway, and because of the law of double jeopardy, can never be tried for that crime again.
¬†
Our case before God is similar on a legal plane. We stand before Him guilty of many crimes. While the evidence is perfectly clear, there is One who represents us as attorney for the defense. He says, ""My clients are guilty as charged. But their crimes have already been paid for. I died for them."" And the Judge turns to this Attorney, whose name is Jesus Christ the Righteous, and says, ""I am satisfied. The defendants are acquitted of all charges. They are free to go and can never again be charged for those sins."" Can there be a greater truth in all of Christianity than the fact that gross sinners are justified on the basis of the shed blood of Christ? I don‚Äôt know what it would be.
¬†
Now I believe the Apostle Paul has one more proposition to communicate to the Corinthians in these three verses besides the fact that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God and the unrighteous do not have to stay that way. This third proposition is not stated as such, but I think it can be read clearly between the lines. It is this:
¬†
The righteous have no business living like the unrighteous.
¬†
: Friends, let me repeat again that there is no sin you have committed that can‚Äôt become a past tense condition under Christ‚Äôs shed blood. You don‚Äôt have to be a prisoner of your past. In Christ you can rise above your past to live a life that gives great glory to God. The change that is achievable in a person‚Äôs life through Christ is remarkable. Where else can you go but to Church to find a large number of former fornicators, former adulterers, former homosexuals, former thieves, former drunkards, former slanderers. In fact, I wonder if I asked all of you who fit into one of these categories (and some not listed but just as serious, like those formerly in bondage to drugs, pornography, eating disorders, anger, etc.) to stand, how many of us would be left sitting? Well, why not? If this passage describes what you once were, will you stand? (More than half the congregation stood)
Have you known people who were prisoners of their past? Either they have done something that society or family will not let them forget, or they have done something they won‚Äôt let themselves forget, or they have suffered some trauma they keep reliving. Our mental hospitals are full of people whose inability to deal with the past has resulted in a near total loss of contact with reality. Many suicides can be traced directly to the fact that a person allowed his past regrets to control his present destiny.
¬†
Sadly, sometimes even those devoted to helping people escape their pasts inadvertently perpetuate the perception that the past defines a person. If you have ever been involved in a 12-Step Program, you are aware that each person is encouraged to introduce himself this way, ""Hello, I‚Äôm Sue, and I‚Äôm an alcoholic . . ."" or ""I‚Äôm John, and I‚Äôm a sexual addict . . ."" I know what the program is trying to do-to help a person be honest about his problem as the first step toward healing. But I disagree that anyone, least of all a Christian, should define himself that way. How much better to say, ""Hello, I ‚Äòve Dave, I‚Äôm a child of God who is addicted to alcohol.""
¬†
Saying that is so much better because no person can consistently behave in a manner inconsistent with the way he perceives himself. If we perceive of our basic identity in terms of our past behavior, we will have a strong tendency to revert to that behavior in times of pressure. On the other hand, if we perceive of our basic identity as a child of God, we will be much more likely to act like a child of God. Proverbs 23:7 reads, ""As a man thinks within himself, so he is.""
¬†
Like each of our other natural emotions, moderate shame and guilt help to regulate our daily lives. When these feelings are too intense and/or too frequent, they become toxic ‚Äì they degrade our (mental + emotional + spiritual + physical) health in significant ways. To reduce toxic guilt and shame to ""moderate"" (healthy), we first need to know clearly what they are and aren‚Äôt.
¬†
Shame is a set of thoughts, feelings, and a belief whose theme is ""I‚Äôm flawed, bad, ugly, awful, stupid, clumsy, ‚Ä¶ ‚Äì i.e. I‚Äôm a worthless, defective, unlovable person ‚Äì no matter what anyone says !""
¬†
Guilt is a related set of beliefs, thoughts, and emotions whose theme is ""I broke an important rule [a should (not)‚Ä¶, ought (not) to ‚Ä¶, or must (not)‚Ä¶]. I made a mistake / screwed up / blew it ‚Äì I did something wrong."" Remember thinking and feeling that? Probably the next inner voice you heard whispered or bellowed ""I‚Äôm bad !"" That‚Äôs how guilts helps us kids and adults nourish our core feelings of shame.
¬†
Here are some key things to know about toxic shame:
¬†
Where does shame start ? Before infants can think or talk with words and concepts, we automatically form ""good me"" and ""bad me"" senses or feelings. These come from perceptions of our caregivers‚Äô voice tones, facial expressions, and some behaviors. Repeated patterns of caregiver smiles, friendly-face and eye contact, ""cooing,"" caressing, holding, and breast feeding build core ""good me"" feelings. Repeated absence of those behaviors and experiences seed a core ""bad me"" attitude. Irregular caregiver behavior patterns promote early personality splitting: ""I‚Äôm good. / I‚Äôm bad.""
¬†
What affects our early shame ? Things like‚Ä¶
¬†
Our main caregivers being split. If we get both ""good you"" and ""bad you"" signals from one or several split caregivers (like Mom and Dad) ‚Äì ""bad me"" feelings take root;
¬†
Our caregivers ignoring us. Getting little or no attention, pre-vocal infants and young kids are apt to feel subliminally ""I don‚Äôt matter (I‚Äôm worthless.)"" Without other consistent ""good me"" messages, ""I don‚Äôt matter"" becomes as matter-of-fact as fingers and toes, which has nothing to do with logic or reality.
¬†
Our early smallness, uncoordination, and ignorance are all daily opportunities to compare ourselves to the awesome ""giants"" that tend us, and to repeatedly conclude ""(compared to them) I‚Äôm bad / stupid / clumsy / weak / ‚Ä¶"";
¬†
Our caregivers guiding (""disciplining"") us in shaming vs. loving ways (""Eloise, you are so stupid !"") ‚Äì the roots of our ""bad me"" self-image deepen. Name-calling, sarcasm, swearing, ""the look,"" degrading, and some physical punishments all fertilize our ""bad me"" attitude.
¬†
Caregivers not lovingly teaching us the difference between doing wrong and being (bad). e.g. ""Max, lying is bad. You lied to me."" (so you‚Äôre a bad person.)
¬†
¬†
¬†
If siblings, relatives, teachers, or friends often ridicule and humiliate us and our caregivers allow that ‚Äì our sham
e increases;
¬†
If the people around us often don‚Äôt listen to what we‚Äôre trying to say ‚Äì or interrupt or laugh at us for trying ‚Äì we‚Äôll probably conclude ""I‚Äôm not worth listening to.""
¬†
If people we‚Äôre around a lot do the reverse of these things ‚Äì often and regularly ‚Äì the ""good me"" side of our personality grows strong, over time.
¬†
What happens to toxic shame as we ""grow up"" ? As we develop our wisdom and vocabulary, human nature endow us with constant ""inner voices,"" or thought streams. Most (all ?) of us who were ignored or shamed too often in our early years automatically develop an ""inner voice"" who can be called our ""Inner Critic,"" or ""Inner Shamer.""
¬†
When our original shamers and blamers aren‚Äôt around so often ‚Äì this ""part"" of us diligently carries on their work for them. ""S/He"" fills our heads with uninvited harsh criticisms and comments like ""Your socks don‚Äôt match (you‚Äôre so stupid),"" and ""How could you possibly forget Jean‚Äôs birthday ?"" A common companion ""voice"" is our ""Inner Perfectionist,"" who relentlessly let‚Äôs us know of our endless set of (shameful) failures. Do you have these inner voices ? Toxic shame has been called the master wound, because it cripples or blocks the exchange of real human and spiritual love.
¬†
Recovery authority John Bradshaw calls toxic shame ""the gift that goes on giving,"" referring to parents‚Äô unintentionally passing on their own ancestral shames and guilts to their kids. Without recovery, they‚Äôre at risk of growing up and doing the same‚Ä¶ Has that invisible old bequest affected anyone you know? For more perspective, see this succinct review of the power of positive self esteem, by Dr. Nathaniel Branden.
¬†
healthy and un-healthy shame challenge yourself: which methods of coping with shame have you used?
¬†
Deep, unhealthy shame is the internal feeling that we are ""dirty"", flawed as a person, or not good enough. In some people it can result in low self-esteem. People living with underlying shame may believe these feelings are normal, and may think other people feel the same way. While these feelings may be quite common, they are not the norm, and can impede fulfilling our happiness.
¬†
Like other human emotions we may perceive as ""all bad"", there certainly is a positive aspect of shame. In a positive setting, shame is the feeling message that let‚Äôs us know we aren‚Äôt acting within our morals and values.
¬†
There are so many non-helpful messages we pick up throughout our lives that can become internal, automatic messages. We can unconsciously (unknowingly)
¬†
repeat these messages in our mind over and over again. We usually pick up, or formulate these non-helpful messages when we‚Äôre forming our self-image (how we see ourselves, and how we believe others see us). The consequence of feeling this kind of shame is devastating and always painful.
¬†
Non-helpful shame, may sound like:
¬†
""I‚Äôm a failure"" ""Nobody could possibly love me"" ""I‚Äôm not a good mother/father"" ""I can‚Äôt relate to other people"" Winning is not everything, but wanting to win is.
¬†
‚Äì Vince Lombardi
¬†
Some non-helpful ways of coping with shame may include: (Coping is the maintenance of emotional well being)
¬†
¬†
¬†
Self Abuse: self abuse either through your thoughts or with your body.
¬†
Chronic Victimization: difficulties setting limitations with other people, and don‚Äôt believe they have the right to say ""No"". Not taking care of their own needs, often not recognizing they have needs. Difficulty taking responsibility for their own life and the consequences of their behavior; usually blaming others for what is happening in their life (society, parents, boss).
¬†
Abuse of Others: taking out unresolved hurt and anger on others who are more helpless (like kicking a pet, or yelling at a younger sibling).
¬†
Depression: being weighed down by feelings (hopelessness, powerlessness, and overwhelmed).
¬†
Rage: unleashing rage is a way to keep other people away. ""People can‚Äôt see my inner self if I keep them away."" Unable to feel in control of your life: anger is a way of maintaining control through intimidating others.
¬†
Control: to control feels powerful. When a person has power they feel less vulnerable to being shamed again. It involves controlling their feelings, thoughts, and actions as well as manipulating others.
¬†
Perfectionism: Being taught to have unrealistic expectations, fear of being abandoned if we‚Äôre not good, right, perfect, constantly push to do our best.
¬†
Addictions and other Compulsions: shame is at the heart of all addictions/compulsions. Shame sets a person up for psychological dependency which can lead to physical dependency.
¬†
Compulsive relationships ‚Äì look for others to fill us up. Enmeshed relationships ‚Äì primary goal is passions and excitement. Apathetic relationships ‚Äì primary goal is avoiding vulnerability and pain. Each person walks down a parallel track with physical, emotional and sometimes social distance between them. Suicide/attempts: the ultimate act of shame. I am hopeless, unworthy and don ‚Äòt deserve or want to live
¬†
How does shame relate to humiliation and embarrassment ? Shame is a private experience. Embarrassment is the bad feeling that occurs when our shameful traits, actions, and ""failures"" are exposed publicly ‚Äì specially to those who‚Äôs admiration and respect most matters to us. We can embarrass ourselves, or others may do that ""to"" us ‚Äì if we grant them responsibility for our dignity. Humiliation happens when we or another act to reduce our (healthy) pride or self respect in public. Ridicule arrives when others (and/or our harsh Inner Shamer) express their scornful (disrespectful)
¬†
criticism of our actions, traits, appearance, ideas, or beliefs.
¬†
What are the behavioral symptoms of toxic shame and guilt ? There are many. See if you recognize any of these‚Ä¶
¬†
What‚Äôs the opposite of toxic shame ? An unshakable true (vs. phony) belief that ""I am a good, valuable, useful, lovable child / adult / person no matter what anyone else says or implies. I have talents to develop, and non-shameful human limitations ‚Äì which empower me to bring unique value and worth to our world."" The terms non-egotistical pride, Self love, and Self respect describe the opposite of toxic shame. Egotist describes a person who doesn‚Äôt have enough healthy shame, empathy for others, or humility.
¬†
Healing toxic shame is the process of replacing our infantile conviction that ""I‚Äôm bad / disgusting / damaged / worthless / no good /‚Ä¶ with some credible version of the belief above ‚Äì in all ""members‚Äô of our inner family (our personality parts). Do you believe building such a new belief is possible, over time ?</p
>
¬†
growing a solid ""good me"" core attitude (i.e. healing our excessive shame),
¬†
Break the silence. When secretiveness surrounds shame, it may be important to talk to a trusted person about what occurred. The need to keep silent is often based on the anticipation that revealing the secret will result in condemnation, criticism or rejection by others. Often the fear of how people will react is much different from how people really react and can force reassessment of the situation. Make sure you choose someone you trust and allow yourself enough time to say everything you need to and receive feedback.
¬†
Self-forgiveness. Being a good person does not mean that you will never do any bad things. Part of being human is making mistakes. Self-forgiveness may involve changing your thought from, ""I made this mistake and I am an awful person,"" to ""I made this mistake during an awful time in my life when I didn ‚Äòt care if I behaved this way"" or from ""I was abused because I deserved it"" to ""I was abused because my parents were out-of-control."" Self-forgiveness involves recognizing your imperfections and mistakes and accepting yourself, shortcomings and all.
¬†
Making reparations. If you have injured another person, it is important to make amends for your actions. This involves recognizing your transgression, being courageous enough to face the person you have hurt, ask for forgiveness and determining what you can do to repair the hurt you have caused and to avoid such difficulties in the future.

Hey journal,
I am sitting down to write because I need to get some of these thoughts out of my head. I am praying to you lord to restore my sane thinking. I was at lunch and then just started coughing and out of no where threw up!..I didnt feel sick but then it came. I have a feeling of powerlessness right now with alot going on in my life. I am not griping about being powerless because this is where I need to be. I just am trying to keep the humility and humbleness that I have aquired over the last couple months. I was thinking this morning how I allow things to roll off my back‚Ä¶but not out of my conscnience.I am still trying to lay this down father‚Ä¶here I am. I try so hard just to be still and allow you to work‚Ä¶I almost feel a guilt for being so happy at times when others seem not to be or ""just waiting for the other shoe to drop."" I was asked this morning if I was in a relationship, I was like what in the world? that is the last thing I need right now‚Ä¶it is hard nuff for me to be good to myself daily without these feelings of insecurity,overwhelming need, and all the while staying grounded and humble. I am still in the mist of getting honest with my therapist‚Ä¶.I try so hard to sugar coat things and she brings me thru the denial. I need you father‚Ä¶I am your son‚Ä¶.I just wonder why it is so hard for me during this time of re-formation. Recovery‚Ä¶.:) living thru all the madness of the past and restoring alot of the now in order to live life manageable. I run to it‚Ä¶I talk about it‚Ä¶I recommend it‚Ä¶.I just wonder when I am feeling like today‚Ä¶..am i worth this? or should i see me like alot do.(my perception) I do love myself, just like kicking the alcohol, moment by moment. I got the new mercy me cd‚Ä¶.seems like all that I am today has so much of what has been given to me by people that love me. I see that‚Ä¶mercy me‚Ä¶I didnt even know who they were‚Ä¶.the faith of the unseen‚Ä¶didnt know that either. I try journal i try not to pick up my life when I should let you father hold me closely. Like the song on casting crowns number 3 does anybody hear her? well, what if the noise we think we are making actually in our head sounds like a scream!!~~but no one hears you? I have cried wolf so much in my life‚Ä¶.why would anyone hear me? the lord hears me though‚Ä¶.and with that I feel a lot better. I guess it took me so long to get here because I always thought why do i deserve to have a better life? why do i deserve this or that? I often still feel those crazy thoughts‚Ä¶my addiction talking to me there. I know that today‚Ä¶:)please heavenly father allow me to be kind to myself and be in the light of your glory, allow the pain in my head and the heat in my heart to subside in yout time, not mine,I am to do as you wish‚Ä¶.I was created for your glory not my own. I understand that without you there is nothing we can gain.The world has always been in peril but I see first hand daily the faces of the lost and in times I to totally understand the eyes that look back at mine‚Ä¶all i can say is faith‚Ä¶faith.

Hey journal,
I am sitting at Traci‚Äôs doing some laundry. I ran across this song and thought man. I am doing well, in most area‚Äôs of my life. I am happy today with the possibility of a better more grounded life. I am trying hard to fill in the voids of the garbage I am letting go of. I know the difference between illusion and truth today. Often times, I allowed moments of good to be sabotaged and to be left alone. I picked up my first grade self the other day and now I have two little boys in my soul, and¬† I wont give up on them. With god‚Äôs help and amongst the others that believe in me I wont give up on them or myself. I have wrote in this journal thing for a long time now and it really does help. I am able to let go of thoughts, the only thing is that I would write and hold onto the feelings and emotions and never get anywhere. I have a montage of music at my disposal. I am so happy that I am at this point in life. I have finally things in my life that are manageable., but still doesnt allow my mind to stop from going into the ""what ifs"" that my addiction feeds. I think that in time I will look back on all this time and be like wow..that is why it happend. I have a addiction of the heart, and mind‚Ä¶but you know the other day when I told my mother exactly all i felt in that chair, i felt alot of my burden lesson and I started to understand why I treat females in my life like I have. I learned that my ex is in a relationship with someone else. Was this easy to hear? Nope not at all., but like everything else in life the consequence of not being the person I should have been at that time in our lives together. It causes anger in me, causes nauseuated feelings. I am happy for her though, I am not one that wishes bad on anyone that I have ever been a part of their life. She does deserve goodness in her life.I have a relationship right now that is great‚Ä¶.it is with me. I have never had that. I love myself today with all that I am and know that if I continue to grow in my self¬† awareness and love, I to will find someone again.¬† I am not sweating this at the moment, just at times when I hear how others are doing with relationships‚Ä¶..cant help but stir up emotions. You know¬† I am sick of waging war on Martin‚Ä¶.sick of harming the precious soul he has been building ‚Ä¶.I am worth alot more too.¬† I was listening to Numb by linkin Park‚Ä¶.I dont feel like that anymore‚Ä¶once was my mantra‚Ä¶.I see the difference in me today, and I think it is groovy. lol. what a stupid word. I cant wait til christmas, I want to go to the country and get a tree, and hope it snows so I can play in it. I want to go on a jetski, want to try to waterski, and do all the things I always analyzed to death before I would try them. I want to just be ‚Ä¶.no thinking involved. I always thought that if I didnt think I would get stupid‚Ä¶lmao ‚Ä¶isnt that funny? how if you dont think that in a couple minutes you would lose all your smartness‚Ä¶‚Ä¶another form of fear based lifestyle. My therapist was a god send to me , to show me that someone can decipher the crazy thoughts and get thru it and knowing that I will be okay once the session is over. I do see today that the simple things in life are what really matters, its the smile on a babies face, the twinkle in the eye of a love one, its the smile that comes when you arent expecting it and accepting yourself in the mirror when the rest of the world at times doesnt get you. It is okay, no one has to approve, but doesnt mean you have to beat yourself up either. Leave the voices of the past in the cylinders of the pain that you are learning to let go of. ""I have been there"" thats why Im here, I used to listen to this song with brittany, and I used to say Ive been blessed thats why im here, and would get corrected‚Ä¶.lol I understand today bb. I am listening to that song at the moment,¬†¬† ""thats why im here"" by kenney chesney. I totally understand when you walk into a room and admit all the things alcohol and our minds do to those that we love the most. We hide in fear of not doing it all right, and the shame of drinking to rid the pain of the former. Ugh‚Ä¶.thats why Im here. I lived a life of denial., I saw my life as a pyramid of success ‚Ä¶where in my new eyesight was a pile of crap with smoke and total desperation oozing from it. I see what I have today. A slab of god foundation and I am building on this day by day with his guidance and love. I always wanted this, always wanted things to wait, to slow down so I could finally catch up. But you know what? You must lose what you didnt realize was important to see what exactly it was that kept you going thru all that was you. I as a addict have thought about my way of dealing with people,places, and things., how I would appear and then be total opposite or just give a little of myself. I dont hold back today., if i lose, if i fail‚Ä¶.ITS OKAY. God still loves me. I was always afraid what to write in here because so many I knew read this, but you know when its honest no need to fear.¬† Thats why Im here., I am a man, who is picking up his child and learning to love it day by day. I will have a family one day with kids by the ooodle. I am saddend a bit though that it has taken what it has‚Ä¶.no mistakes though.¬† Underneath it all‚Ä¶.I am a very loving,caring, patient, and learning to be honest person. Who wouldnt want that? I do!!!‚Ä¶..hehe. Thank this site for the diary ‚Ä¶.to come here to let go of my thoughts and my insecurities. Thank you lord for all the blessings you give me daily all the thoughts you correct in my head. One thing that I probly will never understand is that even in pain‚Ä¶.we never forget what attracted us to begin with. no mistakes.¬† Next session going to pick up marty in second grade., a step by step journey to lead up to martin in counseling., or the now. I looked at myself in the mirror and I see a twinkle in my eyes today, a calmness that wasnt there before, a general okay with life today. The only thing is that to progress we must lose., therefore when we get well or on the road‚Ä¶.what we thought would be there at the other end alot of times isnt around‚Ä¶only in memory. I totally understand the alanon ladies, had to get out in order for them to live. well, now that we are living‚Ä¶.is it wrong to still feel the love that the chemicals kept us from?

I do wish she would have not gotten hurt so much by me that now that I am getting well, we could have tried again.

Proverbs 15:30-33(Amp):30 The light in the eyes (of him whose heart is joyful) rejoices the heart of others, and good news nourishes the bones.31 The ear that listens to the reproof that leads to or gives life will remain among the wise. 32 He who refuses and ignores instruction and correction despises himself, but he who heeds reproof gets understanding. 33 The reverent and worshipful fear of the Lord brings instruction in Wisdom, and humility comes before honor.
 

 
            Thoughts for the Day 
¬†
The book of Proverbs records many observations dealing with life. Among those observations, we are told in verse 30 that those who have a rejoicing heart will have light in their eyes. Another way to say this, would be that a person who has the joy of the Lord in their hearts will have a twinkle in their eyes and will be aglow with the spirit of the Lord. We can tell what is in a person‚Äôs heart by their countenance as the face most of the time reflects the attitude of the soul. People who are joyful bring joy to others. Also, the one who brings a good report and shares good news, will also benefit by experiencing a health benefit. When the scriptures talk about making the bones fat or speaks of health in the marrow of the bones, it is referring to a healthy immune system that produces healthy blood. The Bible also says that the life is in the blood. Therefore, when we keep a joyful and positive attitude it helps to keep us healthy. 
Proverbs 3:7-8: ""Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the LORD, and depart from evil. It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones.""
Leviticus 17:11a: ""For the life of the flesh is in the blood‚Ä¶""
Verse 31 of Proverbs 15 tells us one of the ways to obtain wisdom is to yield to reproof that comes from the spirit of the Lord. When we allow the Holy Spirit to show us the areas of our lives that need correction, and we yield to that correction, we will grow in the wisdom of the Lord. A stubborn and rebellious attitude will cost us dearly. If we are to remain in the company of the wise, we must yield to the advice of the wise. Verse 32 tells us that the person who refuses and ignores instruction and correction actually despises himself, as he will suffer for it. On the other hand, the person who heeds reproof will gain understanding.
Verse 33 tells us that those who have a reverent and worshipful fear of the Lord will gain instruction in God‚Äôs wisdom. When we approach God with an humble attitude, He will honor us for it. He will give us His grace and mercy in any situation we may find ourselves. 
James 4:6-8: ""But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble. Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double minded.""
These verses are about our attitude. When we keep a proper attitude, we will find ourselves receiving God‚Äôs favor and grace. We will also be a blessing to others as we maintain an attitude of joyfulness.
¬†
 

 
            Prayer for the Day 
¬†
Dear Heavenly Father, I am grateful for Your loving kindness toward me. I do appreciate Your grace and mercy in my life. When I come to You asking for forgiveness of my sins, I can feel Your mighty power cleansing me. I do want You to correct me when I need it, as I do not want to get off of the path of holiness. Lord, use me to reach out to those around me with the same love You have shown me. Guide me today in the things that I should do. Sometimes I feel overwhelmed with so many things to do. I am trusting You to show me the things that are priority and give me the grace and strength to do them. May I be an instrument of Your love today. I ask this in the name of Jesus Christ, our Lord. Amen.

186,https://www.opendiary.com/m/rebornsoldier/chapter-2-74-4537806/,2006-05-08,Chapter 2,"
Many people ruin their lives and their health by eating the poison of bitterness, resentment, and unforgiveness. Matthew 18:23-35 tells us that, if we do not forgive people, we get turned over to the torturers. If you have a problem in this area or have ever had one, I am sure you bear witness with what I am saying. It is torture to have hateful thoughts rolling around inside of you toward another person. 
Who Are You Helping When You Forgive? 
Who are you helping the most when you forgive the person who hurt you? Actually, you are helping yourself more than the other person. I always looked at forgiving people who had hurt me as being a really hard thing to do. I thought it seemed so unfair for them to receive forgiveness when I had gotten hurt. I got pain, and they got free without having to pay for the pain they caused me. Now I realized that I am helping myself when I choose to forgive. I am helping the other person also by releasing them, so God can do what only He can do. If I am in the way, trying to get revenge or taking care of the situation myself instead of trusting and obeying God, He has no obligation to deal with that person. However, God will deal with the people who hurt us if we will put them in His hands through forgiveness. It is our seed of obedience to His Word; and once we have sown our seed, He will bring a harvest of blessing to us one way or another. 
I am helping myself, because when I forgive I release God to work. I am happy when I am not full of the poison of unforgiveness. I feel better physically. Serious diseases can come as a result of the stress and pressure that bitterness, resentment, and unforgiveness put on a person. Mark 11:22-26 clearly teaches us that unforgiveness hinders our faith from working. The Father cannot forgive our sins if we do not forgive other people (we reap what we sow). Sow mercy, and you will reap mercy; sow judgement, and you will reap judgement. Do yourself a favor and forgive. 
There are still more benefits of forgiveness. When you are willing to forgive, your fellowship with God has a free flow. Unforgiveness blocks it. Paul said that we are to forgive in order to keep Satan from getting an advantage over us (11 Corinthians 2: 10-11). Ephesians 4:26-27 says that we are not to let the sun go down on our anger. Do not give the devil any such foothold or opportunity. Remember that the devil must have a foothold before he can get a stronghold. Be quick to forgive. Do not help the devil torture you. I also think it is hard to hate one person and love another. When we are full of wrong things, it is hard to treat anybody right. Even people you want to love may be suffering from your bitterness, resentment and unforgiveness. 
How To Forgive 
Like everything else, there are practical steps to forgiving people that must be taken if we are going to be successful at it. I asked the Lord why so many people seem to want to forgive and yet are not successful doing it. He said, ""because they are not obeying what I tell them to do in the Word."" As I searched the Word, I found the following instructions: 
1. Decide. You will never forgive if you wait to feel like it. Choose to obey God and steadfastly resist the devil in his attempts to poison you again with bitter thoughts. Make a quality decision, and God will heal your wounded emotions in due time. 
2. Depend. You cannot forgive without the power of the Holy Spirit. It is too hard to do on your own. If you are truly willing, God will enable you; but you are going to need to humble yourself and cry out to Him for help. In John 20:22-23, Jesus breathed on the disciples and said, ""Receive the Holy Spirit. "" His next instruction was about forgiving people. We certainly can use this as an example and ask Him to breathe on us that we might be able to forgive those who hurt us. 
3. Obey. There are several things we are told do in the Word concerning forgiving our enemies. 
a. Pray for your enemies and those who abuse and misuse you. Pray for their happiness and welfare (Luke 6:27-28 Amplified). As you pray, God may be able to give them revelation that will bring them out of deception. They may not even be aware they hurt you, or maybe they are aware but are so self-centered that they do not care. Either way, they need revelation. 
b. Bless and do not curse them (Romans 12:14). In the Greek, to bless means ""to speak well of"" and to curse means ""to speak evil of."" You cannot forgive and gossip or be a talebearer. You must stop repeating the offense. You cannot get over it and also continue to talk about it. Proverbs 17:9 says that he who seeks to cover an offense seeks love. 
Who Should Forgive? 
Forgive the person from long ago who hurt you very badly and also the person whom you did not know in the grocery store, for stepping on your toe. Take those two extremes and forgive them in addition to everyone in between. Forgive quickly. The quicker you do it, the easier it is. Forgive freely. Matthew 10:8 says freely you have received, freely give. Forgiveness means to excuse a fault, absolve from payment, pardon, send away, cancel, and bestow favor unconditionally. 
When you forgive, you must cancel the debt. Do not spend your life paying and collecting debts. Hebrews 10:30 says that vengeance belongs to the Lord; He will repay and settle the cases of His people. Let God pay you for past injustices; do not try to collect from the people who hurt you, because the people who hurt you cannot pay you. Matthew 18:25 says ‚Ä¶""he could not pay"". 
Also forgive yourself for past sins and for hurts you have caused others. You cannot pay people back, so ask God to. 
Forgive God if you are angry at Him because your life did not turn out the way you thought it should. God is always just. There may be things you do not understand; but God loves you, and people make a serious mistake if they will not receive help from the only One who can truly help. 
You may even need to forgive an object‚Äîthe post office, bank, a certain store you feel cheated you, a car that always gave you trouble, etc. Get rid of all poison that comes from bitterness, resentment, and unforgiveness; and remember Proverbs 4:23 (Amplified), ""Keep and guard your heart with all vigilance‚Ä¶for out of it flow th
e springs of life."" 
Unforgiveness is spiritual filthiness; get washed in the water of the Word and stay clean. God bless you!

If you don‚Äôt like yourself, you‚Äôre not going to enjoy life very much. People who don‚Äôt accept themselves and don‚Äôt get along with themselves have a difficult time accepting and getting along with other people. The Bible says, ""love your neighbor as you love yourself."" I personally spent years having a hard time getting along with other people and finally realized through the Word of God that my difficulty with other people was rooted in my difficulties with myself. 
The Bible says a good tree will bear good fruit and a rotten tree will bear rotten fruit. The fruit in our lives comes from the roots within us. If you‚Äôre rooted in shame, guilt, inferiority, rejection, lack of love and acceptance, etc., you will bear bad fruit in your relationship with yourself and others until you get rooted and grounded in God‚Äôs love. Once you have a revelation that God loves you unconditionally, you will be able to begin to accept yourself and eventually these new roots will produce good fruit in your relationship with other people. Stop for awhile and ask yourself, ""How do I feel about myself?"" 
I want to share 10 tips on how to succeed at being yourself. I believe they will help you. Also, I encourage you to purchase the special Tape Series we are offering this month, which is an in-depth study on ""How to Succeed at Being Yourself."" 
1. Never, Never say negative things about yourself‚Äîthings like ""I never do anything right. I‚Äôll never change. I‚Äôm ugly. I look terrible. I‚Äôm dumb. Who could ever love me? etc,"". Matthew 12:37 says, ""‚Ä¶by your words you will be justified‚Ä¶, and by your words you will be condemned‚Ä¶"" In other words, however we talk about ourselves is the way we feel about ourselves. 
2. Don‚Äôt meditate (think on) negative things about yourself. Proverbs 23:7 says, ""as a man thinketh in his heart, so is he."" 
3. Speak (as private confessions) good things about yourself. Say something about yourself in line with what the Word says about you. For example: ""I am the righteousness of God in Christ. I am made acceptable in the Beloved. God created me and formed me with His own hand and God doesn‚Äôt make mistakes."" I like to start my day saying good things about myself, the day, my future, etc., perhaps while you‚Äôre taking a shower, driving to work, or cleaning the house. I also encourage you to look at yourself in a full-length mirror and say out loud, ""God loves you, I love you, and I accept you."" Also, you might try giving yourself a hug. This is very beneficial to people who have lacked love and acceptance in their lives. 
4. Never compare yourself with other people. God must love variety or we wouldn‚Äôt all look different. We are all created differently even down to our fingerprints. You‚Äôll never succeed at being yourself if you‚Äôre trying to be like someone else. Other people can be a good example to you; but even then, good traits if duplicated will manifest differently through your individual personality. 
5. Focus on your potential instead of your limitations. I read an interesting story about Helen Hayes. She was a great actress who was told in the early days of her career that if she were 4 inches taller she would be the greatest actress of her time. Helen was 5 feet tall. Her coaches tried various methods of stretching her but nothing increased her height. She refused to concentrate on the supposed limitation of being 5 feet tall and decided to concentrate on her potential. As a result, she was eventually chosen to play Mary, Queen of Scotland, one of the tallest queens who ever lived. 
6. Find something you like to do that you do well, and do it over and over. If you spend your time doing things you‚Äôre not good at, it will frustrate you and cause you to feel defeated and unsuccessful. 
7. Have the courage to be different. Be a God pleaser, not a man pleaser. Read Galatians 1:10. 
8. Learn to cope with criticism. If you dare to be different, you‚Äôll have to expect some criticism. Going along with the crowd when you know in your heart God is leading you in a different way is one of the reasons people don‚Äôt succeed at being themselves. You won‚Äôt like yourself very much if you go against your own convictions. 
9. Don‚Äôt let the way another person treats you determine your worth. 
10. Keep your flaws in perspective. People with a high level of confidence have just as many weaknesses as people without confidence, but they concentrate on their strengths not their flaws or weaknesses. 
In conclusion, let me remind you of my opening statement. If you don‚Äôt like yourself, you‚Äôre not going to enjoy life very much.

Fear! Has it ever been a problem for you‚Ä¶holding you back from moving into areas that could enrich your own life and the lives of others? There is a solution. 
One of the many benefits available to Christians is freedom from fear. When we avoid making changes or confronting issues in our lives because of fear or dread, we need to remember that God has promised to go before us and bring us through victoriously as we obey Him. 
When we are facing a job interview, for example, instead of being afraid that we will make a bad impression and fail to get the position, we need to ask God to prepare the heart and mind of the interviewer and help us to present ourselves in the very best light. When God ""prepares the way,"" we can trust that whatever happens will turn out for our good according to His perfect plan for us. 
The Bible tells of a man named Abram who trusted God in spite of his own personal fear. Now‚Ä¶ the Lord said to Abram, Go for yourself [for your own advantage] away from your country, from your relatives and your father‚Äôs house, to the land that I will show you (Genesis 12:1). 
How would you feel if God told you to leave your home, your family, and everything that is familiar and comfortable and head out to an unknown destination? Full of fear? That is precisely the challenge Abram faced‚Äîand it frightened him. But God‚Äôs words to him were ""Fear not."" It is the same message He gave to Joshua when He called him to lead the children of Israel to take the land He had promised to give them as their inheritance (see Joshua 1:6-9). And to all who set out to follow God‚Äôs plan today, He says, ""Fear not."" 
Elisabeth Elliot, whose husband was killed along with four other missionaries in Ecuador, tells that her life was completely controlled by fear. Every time she started to step out to minister, fear stopped her. Then a friend told her something that set her free. Her friend said, ""Why don‚Äôt you do it afraid?"" Elisabeth listened and took that advice. Together with Rachel Saint, the sister of one of the murdered missionaries, they went on to evangelize the Indian tribes of Ecuador, including the very people who had killed their loved ones. 
Many times we think we should wait to do something until we are no longer afraid. But if we did that, we would probably accomplish very little for God, for others, or even for ourselves. Both Abram and Joshua had to step out in faith and obedience to God and do what He had commanded them to do‚Äîeven though they were afraid. 
I believe the words fear not simply mean ""don‚Äôt run."" So the solution to fear is simple‚Äîrather than bowing our knee and giving in to it, we must stand firm against it, knowing that God has gone before us and prepared the way. 
That is precisely what God wants us to do. Even if our mouth is dry and our knees are shaking, we need to keep asking God to strengthen us. We need to determine that our lives are not going to be ruled by fear but by the Word of God. 
As we saw before in Genesis, God gave Abram a tall order. He said, ""Pack up and leave everyone you know and everything you are comfortable with and go to a place I will show you."" If Abram had bowed his knee to fear, he never would have fulfilled his destiny to become all God created him to be‚Äîthe father of many nations. 
In the same way, if Joshua had not overcome his fear and been obedient to God‚Äôs command to lead His people into the Promised Land, they never would have enjoyed all that God had prepared for them. 
Giving in to fear alters God‚Äôs best plan for your life. So use the power of God‚Äôs Word to do what He wants you to do‚Ä¶even if you have to do it afraid! The rewards are great.

Deep inside each of us there is a river‚Äîa river of life. The river is a wonderful gift, given to each of us by God. This river refreshes, renews, and revitalizes our lives. I‚Äôm sure all of us have known people from time to time who have defied all logic and stayed alive years longer than they should have or they‚Äôve been able to keep up a positive outlook on life even though terrible things had happened to them. Their ""river"" ran strong and would not stop flowing. 
On the other hand, there are those who seem to always be down, whether physically or emotionally. No matter what they seem to try, they can‚Äôt seem to snap out of it. Their river has been stopped up‚Ä¶and only a little trickle seems to pass through. 
God places this river in every one of us‚Äîit flows with good health, a positive outlook on life, and a generous and forgiving attitude. Ideally, this river flows freely through us. When we allow this flow and keep our well from getting plugged up, there‚Äôs a peace, an ease, a current that takes us along‚Äîeverything seems easier. Good things come our way. When wonderful opportunities are presented to us, we‚Äôre ready for them. 
Many people, however, have allowed their well to become plugged up. Years of neglect have caused the river flow, which used to be strong and powerful, to become choked down to just a small stream. Everything‚Äôs hard‚Äînothing comes easy. People with a stopped-up well have to strive for things that come easily to others. It‚Äôs as if they‚Äôve become mired in a mud hole and every step is a struggle. Do you know people like this? Does this sound like you and your life? 
I once had a stopped-up well in my life. I struggled, trying to tap into the river that I knew was in me. I was constantly digging dry wells‚Äîworking on projects, chasing ideas that were disappointing and unfulfilling. I believed that if I could just make something work, I would be happy; I would find peace and fulfillment. I would strive after these things everyday, but I never found the peace I was looking for. I found, over the years, that I had allowed my well to become stopped-up with ""stones and debris."" The river no longer flowed freely, and I was miserable. 
Although I didn‚Äôt realize it at the time, I really struggled with issues in my life like unforgiveness, anger, selfishness, offense, and disobedience. These issues became like stones, dirt, and debris that had caused my well to become plugged-up. With God‚Äôs help, one by one, these issues in my life are being dealt with. It‚Äôs a long process, but the stones are much smaller today than they used to be‚Äîthe river of life in me flows much stronger now. 
Are you tired of your life being dry, confused, and without direction? Are you weary of having to strive for everything you get in life? Just remember, until you‚Äôre able to get your well cleared out and unplugged, everything will be difficult, disappointing and unfulfilling. No matter what you try, you‚Äôll be unable to taste the water from that river ‚Äì and that water satisfies like nothing else. 
Remember, God put a river of life inside each of us. We just need to tap into that stream by dealing with those things in our life that stop up the flow‚Äîthings like unforgiveness, selfishness, offense, anger, and disobedience. God can help you to forgive, to see the needs of those around you, to let go of past hurts or wrongs. He wants to help you deal with the stones and debris that are stopping up your well. 
Make a choice today to stop spending your life fighting, struggling, and trudging through the mud with every step. Stop taking inventory of what you‚Äôve lost, and take a good look at what you‚Äôve got left. Ask God to help you clear out the debris‚Äîthen enjoy the satisfying flow of the river of life!

The first day of school our professor introduced himself andchallenged us to get to know someone we didn‚Äôt already know. Istood up to look around when a gentle hand touched myshoulder.
I turned around to find a wrinkled, little old lady beaming upat me with a smile that lit up her entire being.
She said, ""Hi handsome. My name is Rose.
I‚Äôm eighty-seven years old. Can I give you a hug?""
I laughed and enthusiastically responded, ""Of course you may!""and she gave me a giant squeeze.
""Why are you in college at such a young, innocent age?"" Iasked.
She jokingly replied, ""I‚Äôm here to meet a rich husband, getmarried, and have a couple of kids‚Ä¶""
""No seriously,"" I asked. I was curious what may have motivatedher to be taking on this challenge at her age.
""I always dreamed of having a college education and now I‚Äômgetting one!"" she told me.
After class we walked to the student union building and shareda chocolate milkshake.
We became instant friends. Every day for the next three monthswe would leave class together and talk nonstop. I was alwaysmesmerized listening to this ""time machine"" as she shared herwisdom and experience with me.
Over the course of the year, Rose became a campus icon and sheeasily made friends wherever she went.
She loved to dress up and she reveled in the attentionbestowed upon her from the other students. She was living itup.
At! The end of the semester we invited Rose to speak at ourfootball banquet.
I‚Äôll never forget what she taught us. She was introduced andstepped up to the podium As she began to deliver her preparedspeech, she dropped her three by five cards on the floor.
Frustrated and a little embarrassed she leaned into themicrophone and simply said, ""I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm so jittery. I gaveup beer for Lent and this whiskey is killing me! I‚Äôll neverget my speech back in order so let me just tell you what Iknow.""
(this cracked me up!)
As we laughed she cleared her throat and began, ""We do notstop playing because we are old; we grow old because we stopplaying.
There are only four secrets to staying young, being happy, andachieving success. You have to laugh and find humor every day.You‚Äôve got to have a dream. When you lose your dreams, youdie.
We have so many people walking around who are dead and don‚Äôteven know it!
There is a huge difference between growing older and growingup.
If you are nineteen years old and lie in bed for one full yearand don‚Äôt do one productive thing, you will turn twenty yearsold. If I am eighty-seven years old and stay in bed for a yearand never do anything I will turn eighty-eight.
Anybody can grow older. That doesn‚Äôt take any talent orability. The idea is to grow up by always finding opportunityin change. Have no regrets.
The elderly usually don‚Äôt have regrets for what we did, butrather for things we did not do. The only people who feardeath are those with
Regrets.""
She concluded her speech by courageously singing ""The Rose.""
She challenged each of us to study the lyrics and live themout in our daily lives.
At the year‚Äôs end Rose finished the college degree she hadbegun all those years ago.
One week after graduation Rose died peacefully in her sleep.
Over two thousand college students attended her funeral intribute to the wonderful woman who taught by example that it‚Äôsnever too late to be all you can possibly be.

the rose 
Some say love, it is a river, that drowns the tender reed Some say love, it is a razor, that leaves your soul to bleed 
Some say love, it is a hunger, an endless aching need I say love, it is a flower, and you, its only seed 
Its the heart afraid of breaking, that never learns to dance Its the dream afraid of waking, that never takes the chance Its the one who won‚Äôt be taken, the one who can‚Äôt seem to give And the soul afraid of dying, that never learns to live 
When the night has been too lonely and the road has been too long And you think that love is only for the lucky and the strong Just remember that in the winter, far beneath the bitter snow Lies the seed, that with the sun‚Äôs love in the spring becomes the rose 
¬†
I was at work and this song came on‚Ä¶everytime I hear it I get mistyeyed.I had been this rose for a long time,didnt even realize that the seed I had inside me would someday become a beautiful being of god.I am so thankful today lord for guiding me into your path and holding me closely whenever I start to go left when I should go right. I hear you lord,I am your obediant son. Please do with me as you will. I want to just be in your light of glory. I love you so much father!. I did a group last night on HOPE. I totally see hope today as not just a magical illusion but a daily reflection from the mirror I look into. I want to run free in the flowers of the world, I really was thinking the other day, I want to take a trip to the holy land and to see where jesus walked. I have this feeling inside me that is alive again after alot of months of dormancy. I am a son of the lord, a precious being of christ. I dont run from things that come my way, I dont duck out anymore. I stay and pray‚Ä¶thru it. I have such love to give today and as the layers get peeled away‚Ä¶it is deeper and deeper..I feel so deep now not with fear but with surity that it isnt going anywhere‚Ä¶:) I told my group‚Ä¶if there is someone in the world that you need to say something to..dont wait, dont wait¬† until that moment in your mind you think you need to get to. Do it at this moment, because it may be gone forever and that thought in your mind will burn deep until you rid it. If its love never hold back but do it in kindness, patient love abiding trust. In time we try to control everything think and over analyze things‚Ä¶when we should just breathe and go thru it with the security god makes no mistakes in the moment he has placed you.I hope you dont take precious people,moments for granted because nothing is really guarenteed. Dont wait, dont hurry, soak it up‚Ä¶love them with all you are. Hold her or him close‚Ä¶fall deep in their eyes and let yourself go deep within their soul so that when they arent around‚Ä¶it feels like a piece of you is missing and you feel lost without them. I tell ya folks‚Ä¶when you are so caught up with your own crap, you miss the beauty of life in front of you‚Ä¶you miss her smile, you miss her laughter, you miss her kindness, you miss her hair blowing in the wind, you miss her donkey sound‚Ä¶.you know I realize this was the most beautiful experience of love god gave me, and I wasnt ready for that moment, and you know god said okay‚Ä¶ill take it away ‚Ä¶.you will be ready for this one day my son. I am listening to my father now. I dont look back in haste or with rosecolored glasses, I look back and see the beauty of it all. Keeps a smile on my face when I think back on all that I have seen. The clouds are gone the haze is over and the insecurity of my existance is over for the moment. I am doing all I can to get better. I am a success. I love me, and therefore with that grounded with god, I will be able to give away freely without analyzing it, talking it to death. The radio plays on‚Ä¶nick lachey is on‚Ä¶wow.~~~ whats left of me is on‚Ä¶.I dont know how he feels but I know how it feels to lose and have that part of you that is gone‚Ä¶and you miss it soooo much.

Hello father,
I come to praise in your glory all that is you! I just came to write down to let you know that I will keep my eyes on you as long as it takes to keep me grounded in your love and glory. I have seen the darker side of the world,the darker side of myself, that was not your creation father, it was a child misbehaving badly without merit without faith,without the ability to know that you dont discriminate, you dont cast judgement on the ones that trully know your son jesus christ! i may have only thought I knew what it felt like to love you father‚Ä¶I am living the feeling daily with lots of compassion and empathy for those that are just in the area I am coming out of! I see you clearly today, I focus all my being on you. I know that when my focus comes hazey or clouded it is the world that is taking all my focus away. I love you so much heavenly father and thank you so much for sending your son to die for my sins, I can not imagine a love so deep that you would give yours to save humanity.I can only taste a glimpse of the perfection your son is. I thank you for jesus christ the unmovable force that is love. I come to you father not a person lost,not a sinner at this moment,but a obedient lover of the beating of your heart that fills over to my soul. I feel you in all I do, my thoughts, the way I treat myself today, the way I want to be a face of the lamb, not a jesus killer. I dont claim to have alot today, but humility and love for myself have untapped a humbleness in me unseen ever. I see my fellow christians struggling in the flesh, well brothers,sisters I too have been there. I was a burning torch of shame,guilt, resentments,and turmoil. I never thought life was worth living in the now to acknowledge it. I today see that MY GOD has restored the ruins of my heart, the broken that was me, I am filled with the body of christ and that is me. I no longer loom for the selfpity or the neglectfulness I have tortured my soul for so long, no more my fellow christians! to stand for the devil in our actions, kills that spirit that the lord has given us. I try to be aware to say im sorry today or you were right, let me take a look at that. I know all I have done in the past‚Ä¶I can never make it all correct, but you know the angels I have had guiding me I want you all to know‚Ä¶you have strong¬† will of the lamb. I love you for never giving up on me when I could not see my father was waiting for his son to come home. I have ran from you father for so long‚Ä¶‚Ä¶that my skin has worn thin‚Ä¶.my heart h as grown tired‚Ä¶..but with you‚Ä¶I need none of this to continue living in the spirit of my father. YOUR all I need and if I shal remain alone in the world as far as you see me being‚Ä¶lord with your love‚Ä¶I have won more then a relationship I have won life! but we arent ment to be alone. I have never known myself long‚Ä¶..you make no mistakes, we arent you lord just because something ends, doesnt mean it dies‚Ä¶.it stops to catch up. I have started running where I could not even crawl ‚Ä¶you are my feet, you are my muscles, you are my mouth ,you are my love , you are my tears of joy, you are my laughter of my inner being. YOU are me‚Ä¶and I am in you. I love you heavenly father and please bless those that I hold dear to my heart, may their confusion end in clarity and love. I love today‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.I trust today‚Ä¶‚Ä¶I am my fathers son today‚Ä¶‚Ä¶I open my lungs and inhale the purity there is in my lord. Hear him fill me up‚Ä¶.hear him hold me when the world wants me ‚Ä¶.hear him fight for my soul when the devil wants to win me back‚Ä¶.my lord is strong‚Ä¶my lord has the biggest smile on his face right now‚Ä¶‚Ä¶For my soul belongs where it should have been all along‚Ä¶..HOME. When are you guys coming¬† home? Its here but no one i recognize‚Ä¶is here.

Hey journal,
Sup? I just dropped by to drop some lines and to be able to finally put some closure and goodbye on things that I have been holding onto for a long time now. Others, have since fallen in love, and have gone on with their lives so I must also.I like this song by jodee messina. It captures the emotion a person feels as they are being drawn away from something or someone that ment alot to them. I was living in a moment that I thought would be again, but as my therapist says: You cant hold on to everything,especially those things that move on while you think they are still around. We identified that the reason alot of times that I would never say things honest or open because of the fear of losing people,places,things in my life. Well, I could be angry right now, I could be playing the victim, but you know I am okay. God has me. I dont look for signs from the sky to direct my life ‚Ä¶I just know in my heart which way he is leading me. I am not bitter, I am not fragile, I do wish all those that are no longer around well, I wish them joy, peace, and everything they want eventually is in their reach. I am not the reason anymore for the present things that are happening to those I care about the most, I refuse to be blamed anymore about this is why‚Ä¶this is that. I owned my part, without getting help then you cant blame anyone but yourself. I chose to go to counseling, I chose to go to aa, to continue on when I was the sickest. I could still be well this is not that because, but I must be accountable for my actions. I have learned that there is no perfection. Those with the perfectionistic attitude usually has the biggest shame/guilt driven lifestyle‚Ä¶I know this‚Ä¶that was me. I dont get on here to continue on with ""what it was "" I know exactly what it was‚Ä¶.I lived it first hand. I am moving on towards healthiness. I dont need constant reminding of how I used to be, how I used to treat people. I know first hand. I once again for the last time am saying I am sorry for all I had a hand in destroying to just adding to the deterioration of a life long cycle. I am no longer gonna mention this. I may not be where I was before but you know what? I am happy! happy that I dont wake up doubting myself and trying to fit in a world that filled me with drinking, shame/guilt, pain and despair. I only have to meet up to my expectations of myself, not my fathers,not my mothers, but mine. I am cradling my inner child with all I have. I am not gonna let anyone come between him and I. Awhile ago, I was reading a email that was talking about detachment, well at that point I had no clue what that ment. I do today, it is necessity to continue to be healthy and allow those that arent where you are to catch up or continue to live in their denial. Well, I have chosen to start running and catching up ‚Ä¶I dont use my past now as a reason to not be, but rather a reason to learn from. I love me today. I could have gotten in a ton of relationships to hide from me, to keep the focus off me, to continue to try to save others instead of me. If I am not well, then no one around me will enjoy me very much. I know the difference between falsehood and reality of honesty. I know this, without god, and without the surrender, you never get anywhere but avoiding all in your life, just to be with someone for all the wrong reasons. Co-dependency at its finest. I get a high by you ""loving me"". God gives you that love internally‚Ä¶..and you dont need to have another step in the way to feel it. Gods love is pure, and it is never ending. I dont have to get on here and preach and always be in the light to be a christian. I am one! I dont have to prove to anyone anything anymore. I cant seek approval from anyone have to be confident god knows best for me. I will get married, I will have kids, and I will be the father that I never had, but have learned exists. Me and my wife will dance on that floor, and I will look into her eyes and know that I will never give up on the union of marraige and that no one in the world could be as lucky as I will be. God is making me new. He is giving me a soul. I am human though and still slip, but it doesnt keep me down for very long. For this I am thankful. I dont fear you or anything llife throws my way. You cant be scared of me because I am changing the way god wants me to., isnt that all we do, plant the seed and move on? water it with our love, but god does the rest. I will end with my wedding song‚Ä¶.wherever she is‚Ä¶.she will get the person that I always wanted to be, but no one thought it was worth waiting for. Well, to be reborn and new god gives you all that you never had. I am no preacher just a servant of the lord. I may not go to foreign countries, I may not be a part of the world in third worlds, and no one may not ever know my name other then in my immediate circle. But my god says that is okay son, I Know you! and that is all that matters. You continue doing my will and I will keep you safe from all the world . I feel that selfawareness is coming to terms with the lord because afterall we were created in the image of jesus. So, when we finally get to know ourselves then we are ready to let god step in and complete the trinity,but like so many others I used alcohol, women, and all other things to fill that third trinity‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..and my result was nil til I let go. I dont type this for accolade, for any praise, or to hurt or harm, I speak my thoughts today not for you‚Ä¶but for my sanity. I am getting well and my wife someday is waiting to complete our family in christ. Sometimes the newest things arent the best, but the simplest things that have been restore
d. I will do your will for me today lord not in haste,but in patience of a love that flows in me like a river that can never be dammed again. I love you father please protect those of my brother and sisters that are still caught in the mind of confusion,denial, and turmoil may they finally lay it down, not in selfrighteousness, but in true understanding that without you in all we do, there is never anything that stays very long. I love you for teaching me this. Without your son clean and knowing himself then how can I be ready for anyone that is still sick? You are of course my understanding not anyone elses but my own. I pray that you lead your flock to safety as they stand in the rain and clouds daily and only fill the voids of their hearts by a human experience. We all need you lord every moment, every day‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.without you we are but living in the flesh‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.please keep me in your arms father:) love your son¬† Martin

You‚Äôre in a better place, I‚Äôve heard a thousand times And at least a thousand times I‚Äôve rejoiced for you But the reason why I‚Äôm broken the reason why I cry Is how long must I wait to be with you 
I close my eyes and I see your face If home‚Äôs where my heart is then I‚Äôm out of place Lord won‚Äôt you give me strength to make it through somehow I‚Äôve never been more homesick than now 
Help me Lord because I don‚Äôt understand your ways The reason why I wonder if I‚Äôll ever know But even if You showed me the hurt would be the same 
Because I‚Äôm still here so far away from home 
I close my eyes and I see your face If home‚Äôs where my heart is then I‚Äôm out of place Lord won‚Äôt you give me strenth to make it through somehow I‚Äôve never been more homesick than now 
In Christ there are no goodbyes In Christ there is no end So I‚Äôll hold on to Jesus with all that I have To see you again To see you again

Dear lord,
I have had¬†a tough week, it has taken a toll on my heart.I come to you broken and in need of your gracious love and caring.I often get in my head and think man,what is going on? where am i? and why doesnt this uneasy feeling ever rid my soul.I know alot of times I cause my own turmoil and pain.But lord seriously I have been trying so hard to keep your hands on all I am. I just know you will hold me and comfort me. I just being a addict of all that is earthly, sometimes falter.I come to you on my knees,asking for salvation,to cleanse my torn flesh that is seeping out all the tears of my past.I have been going to therapy and it just takes me back to some awful situations of my childhood.I have to take myself back to the ""room"" or to the school or wherever I can remember things happening that hurt me.When I am in there it is so hard for me to sit still and go back there. I guess I still disassociate and then later on in the week it all hits me subconciously. I have had alot of anger this last week‚Ä¶sooo mad at alot. I never acknowledged anger before just stuffed it down. I am mad lord..! real mad!~I have gotten it under control a bit by doing what I know to do. communication.I have alot praying for me,and this i appreciate more then words,I know that without faith I have nothing,I have nothing but a empty cauldron of misery filled chaos.Therefore showing me that all is not real and that the enemy is in control. I miss bb alot‚Ä¶and it hurts not to talk to her,to say hello,like right now I am in the same town she lives in and cant even see her. Who am I lord to argue with your will, not because of who I am but because you have done‚Ä¶not what i have done but because of who you are‚Ä¶lord lift me up father, hold me in your arms and allow me to always keep my eyes on you. I dont hate I dont have haste, I just am lonely lord, lonliness is my killer of serenity. I dont want to go be wtih the people that live in the flesh, and I am but a infant in you. I love you, I need to say the positive affirmations my creator has created in me‚Ä¶I am love, I am worthy, I am willing to hear you o‚Äôlord‚Ä¶not to run and hide.So, many times i have seeked out the ways of the world, and not that i am a saint now,but you know my eyes definately know who is in command‚Ä¶not me‚Ä¶.YOU. I know you are my salvation, my rock. I must have faith in the ways of things not happening as fast as I think they should. I listen to this group casting crowns and think of all I have heard of you lord, all that I have seen ‚Ä¶.and I know you are trully the alpha/omega in the whole realm of things.please lord bless all those that have the same insanity of the mind that i battle with moment by moment,please continue to watch over all humanity. Please watch over those I love that dont know i still do. Please continue to repair the bridges I have burned down. THanks for you loveing me unconditionally‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶your son MArtin

Sunny days seem to hurt the most Wear the pain like a heavy coat I feel you everywhere I go See your smile, I see your face I hear you laughing in the rain Still can‚Äôt believe your gone 
(Chorus:) It ain‚Äôt fair you died to young Like a story that had just begun But death tore the pages all away God knows how I miss you All the hell that I‚Äôve been through Just knowing, no one could take your place

Sometimes I wonder, who you‚Äôd be today 
Would you see the world Would you chase your dreams Settle down with a family I wonder what would you name your babies Someday‚Äôs the sky‚Äôs so blue I feel like I can talk to you And I know it might sound crazy 
(Chorus) 
Today [3x] Today [3x] 
Sunny days seem to hurt the most I wear the pain like a heavy coat The only thing that gives me hope Is I know, I‚Äôll see you again someday

People dont have to die alot of times to feel this intense pain that never goes away. LIke a part of you has been ripped away. I know I have lost alot in my life but nothing has been this intense and hurt so deeply as I am hurting right now. I am not drinking I am not doing anything other then feeling this, people speak to me but I am like in a daze, WHO youd be today‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..I have alot of resentments and alot of shame in this area that fuels the lantren of the past. I dont live there because it is to costly and doesnt do it anymore. I do feel though alot of times when I dont want to feel‚Ä¶it cuts deep to the core, brings up a heaving of emotion that is hard to hold down even though at any moment you cant breathe for fear of losing it all over the place.I guess this is normal when you lose something that meant so much to you. It is ironic and tragic‚Ä¶.now im in therapy and can feel all these feelings that were hidden and i was afraid to feel ever~~. I know that there are plenty of songs that describe how I feel, and they hurt so much but the pain doesnt start as I hear a song‚Ä¶it is non-stop. I took two wellbutrin today cause I cant take it most days‚Ä¶I feel myself crumbling and it feels like I am dying on the inside, I cant breathe, god where did I go? who is this guy and what planet did you send me to? I know I am me,just being kinda dramatic‚Ä¶I dont like to feel pain because it hurts so damn bad‚Ä¶.like i would rather naw my arm off then to feel it hurting‚Ä¶.my therapist digs deep and pulls so much out‚Ä¶.and then i suffer as the wound closes, i go hear others like me relive their tragic experiences with loss,regret,and the drink. I cant get away from it. everywhere i turn is like a mirror of all that has been‚Ä¶when does the mirror shatter? when does it be okay to be me?I am n no way contradicting what i wrote earlier, jesus had pain,he had tremendous faith though ‚Ä¶.and the other day i just wanted to die. I feel like things are just knawing at my soul, a sadness that permiates thruout the eyes that hold my heart. god help me. jesus help me. I have never cared for myself a damn‚Ä¶.nether to less another human being. have my soul, have my will, keep me with you‚Ä¶dont let me go‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.
No I ain‚Äôt had nothing to drink I knew thats probably what you‚Äôd think If I dropped by this time of night Remember way back when I promised you I‚Äôd drop in At one of those meetings down at the Y 
Well, they started talkin bout steps you take Mistakes you make The hearts you break And the price you pay I almost walked away 
You could hear a pin drop When this old man Stood up and said I‚Äôm gonna‚Äô say it again Like I do every week For those who don‚Äôt know me 
It‚Äôs the simple things in life Like the kids at home and a loving wife That you miss the most, when you lose control And everything you love starts to disappear The devil takes your hand and says no fear Have another shot, just one more beer Yah, I‚Äôve been there, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm here 
This ole boy stood up in the aisle Said he‚Äôd been living a life of denial And he cried as he talked about wasted years I couldn‚Äôt believe what I heard It was my life word for word And all of the sudden it was clear 
It‚Äôs the simple things in life Like the kids at home and a loving wife That you miss the most, when you lose control And everything you love starts to disappear The devil takes your hand and says no fear Have another shot, just one more beer Yah, I‚Äôve been there, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm here 
I know for us it may be too late But it would mean the world to me If you were there when I stand to say It‚Äôs the simple things in life Like the kids at home and a loving wife That you miss the most, when you lose control And everything you love starts to disappear The devil takes your hand and says no fear Have another shot, just one more beer Yah, I‚Äôve been there, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm here Oh, I‚Äôve been there, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm here

I met God‚Äôs will on a Halloween night He was dressed as a bag of leaves You hear the braces on his legs at first His smile was as bright as the August sun when he looked at me As he struggled down the driveway it almost made me hurt¬†Will don‚Äôt walk too good¬†Will ¬†don‚Äôt talk too good He won‚Äôt do the things that the other kids do in our neighborhood 
I‚Äôve been searchin, wonderin, thinkin lost and lurkin all my life I‚Äôve been wounded, jaded, loved and hated wrestled wrong and right He was a boy without a father and his mother‚Äôs miracle I‚Äôve been readin, writin, prayin, fightin I guess i would be still Y
eah that was until i knew God‚Äôs will 
Will‚Äôs mom had to work two jobs watch him when she had to work late And we‚Äôd laugh like i haven‚Äôt laughed since i don‚Äôt know when Hey Jude was his favorite song At dinner he‚Äôd ask to pray And then he‚Äôd pray for everybody in the world, but him 
I‚Äôve been searchin, wonderin, thinkin lost and lurkin all my life I‚Äôve been wounded, jaded, loved and hated wrestled wrong and right He was a boy without a father and his mother‚Äôs miracle I‚Äôve been readin, writin, prayin, fightin I guess i would be still Yeah that was until i knew God‚Äôs will 
Before they moved to California his mother said they don‚Äôt think he‚Äôd live Said each day that Ill have well it‚Äôs just another gift And i never got to tell her that that boy showed me the truth And crayon read on notebook paper he‚Äôd written me and God, Love You 
I‚Äôve been searchin, prayin, wounded, jaded I guess i would be still Yeah that was until I met God‚Äôs will on a Halloween night He was dressed as a bag of leaves
I was thinking about this song also, I remember when i met gods will. it was a halloween at a haunted house, it was all around me as the night swirled in mysteriousness, and fun. We certaintly werent walking to good, we were hollaring all around. God was definatley around, he was holding my hand so tight, he was allowing me to see smiles and laughter of innocense and love. I saw gods will that night, but still wasnt sure if the earth was worth leaving behind. I fought against gods will for more then a year and a half later. I know today alot of events in my life god was present, and he was holding the boy with out much hope in life, helping the child to have some fun, and to allow him to know HE was loved. The little boy never understood , but it was gods will. My lil¬† boy didnt walk to good, didnt talk to good, and he had been struggling so hard to live that he was sucking the life out of all he encountered never staying calm long enough to be touched and kissed and loved. i started this diary in 03 and still almost three years later have come full circle, the only difference is i know god and i live with him daily even if it hurts even if his will doesnt seem comfortable‚Ä¶it is his will that has taught this boy how to walk, to talk, and to know love‚Ä¶its the family that the boy has and misses its the touch of a gentle kind heart‚Ä¶but the child is in my care today, til god wills it again to be okay to allow myself to love not in haste,not in fear,but in purity and care. ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶my valentine‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.you rock!~ martina mcbride. I think that life is so simple that survivors still cant slow down enough to enjoy the small things‚Ä¶i have to be told martin slow down hun‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.you are loved‚Ä¶..even if we arent around‚Ä¶..you are loved. martin‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..i love you today.:) i really do‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.please dont give up yourself‚Ä¶.dont let the voices tell you that you arent worthy enough or that you are just whatever‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶screw that! fight baby fight‚Ä¶.allow god to stay in your heart and you will never be alone‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..you willl never hurt‚Ä¶this pain is out of faith to let me get back to the word‚Ä¶.to the comfort of my fathers love‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.you have whoever in your arms dad‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..and the day you show her to me‚Ä¶.my heart she shal have that beats thru you‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.:) love me

I have to block out thoughts of you so i dont lose my head. They crawl in like a cockroach leaving babies in my bed. Dropping little reels of tape to remind me that i‚Äôm alone, playing movies in my head that make a porno feel like home. Theres a burning in my pride, a nervous bleeding in my brain, an ounce of peace is all i want from you, will you never call again? And will you never say that you love me, just to put it in my face? And will you never try to reach me, it is i that wanted space.. 
Hate me today Hate me tomorrow Hate me so you can finally see whats good for you.. 
I‚Äôm sober now for 3 whole months, thats one accomplishment that you helped me with. The one thing that always tore us apart is the one thing i wont touch again. In a sick way i want to thank you for holding my head up late at night, while i was busy waging wars on myself, you were trying to stop the fight. You never doubted my warped opinions on things like suicidal hate. You made me compliment myself when it was way too hard to take. So i‚Äôll drive so f*cking far away that i‚Äôll never cross your mind, and do whatever it takes in your heart to leave me behind. 
Hate me today, hate me tomorrow. Hate me for all the things i didnt do for you. Hate me in ways, yeah ways hard to swallow. Hate me so you can finally see whats good for you. 
And with a sad heart i say bye to you and wave. Kicking shadows on the street for every mistake that i have made. And like a baby boy, i never was a man, ‚Äôtil i saw your blue eyes cry, and i held your face in my hand. And then i fell down yelling make it go away, just make her smile come back and shine just like it used to be. And then she whispered, ""How could you do this to me?"" 
Hate me today, hate me tomorrow. Hate me for all the things i didnt do for you. Hate me in ways, yeah ways hard to swallow. Hate me so you can finally see whats good for you‚Ä¶ 
Dear diary,
I am sitting here not in pity,not in whining mode,but in the emotions that are burning deep within my soul.I have thought about all the actions that i have made and all the ways I have treated people and expected them to just take me back with no reservations.I made this life that has become my greatest regret.¬†I have been on this journey for 34 years of my life and have since seen some great things,have¬†met some great people. I just wonder why I never seem to fit in for very long.I always tend to go back to the origional thoughts..outcast,piece of¬†crap, and unworthy no matter how much self-talk I give myself, no matter how many meetings I make, I still have a emptiness in my soul that wont go away. If you have read this journal of my life up to this point you have seen that I am a craver of love,not the fashionable love that it has been watered down to be but pure,love. I am early on in my therapy and cant take alot. I cant take that it takes time to heal, I cant take that it always seems as though I am going forward but in others eyes the look of untrust,the image that burns deep within my soul. Hate is a huge word,but you know if honesty is what we work its okay to say¬†it. HATE me, today,hate me tommorow, and go about your lives as though I never existed. I am killing this person whom I am sick of, sick of all the pain in my head,all the doubts that cross my every moment,¬†I feel so insane right now, and so full of sorrow and pain, I dont know how people do it without a drink, or drug, but I tell you its the hardest thing I have ever gone thru. I understand peoples logic but have you ever traveled in the shoes of someone who every breath was trying to fit in and be accepted? I know I am not the only one, I go to rooms of people that suffer the same as I. Go to aa, go to na, go to alanon, just leave me alone‚Ä¶we love you but‚Ä¶.we still cant trust you or may¬†never be able to because after all you are a alcoholic, an addict,¬†and when a addicts mouth is moving‚Ä¶he has to be lieing. I hear all the negative parts of this process‚Ä¶so? like I have said before¬†society tells us things that we battle with daily, the insecurities,the hurt,the pain, the feeling of shrinkage in our soul. I believe in god and I pray daily so its not like ""oh my god"" he is not praying or giving this to god. No, this is my own thoughts and beliefs that I am speaking.¬†After all, isnt that what a addict does? runs off at the mouth of his own insanity? How many times have I written the honest truth and you never understood it? how many times have I told you im feeling like im dying on the inside and you never understood it? but its always about the freaking drink, the drugs with society‚Ä¶my life is unmanageable because I dont know how to live without feeling like I need love to conquer all. I am not drinking today and feel worse then when I had a drink in me. I feel worse about myself, I hate all the decisions I made as I was tearing thru the world, but you know what? I get treated alot of times like I am to fragile to handle the truth by my sponsor and some of other people I know. In my mind I make things the way they appear not as they seem, I think oh my ex might want to get back because I am changing‚Ä¶but in reality it was she hates your guts for the way you treated her and has found another online to pursue. I am the one though that the microscope continues to follow, well I am sick of being under a radar, I will not drink, I will not have random sex, or spend money on things that have harmed me but I cant tell you that I will be able to make it thru everyday with a freaking smile on my face‚Ä¶when you hurt do you smile and act as if you are okay? this isnt a pain just from relationships, this is a pain that runs deep from the earliest memories, does society really know what addiction is? or has the age old adage held thru‚Ä¶character defect‚Ä¶.lack of will‚Ä¶do you think we want to live like this? have you ever tried not to do something even if you knew it wasnt good for you? well, if you answer yes and went back to it‚Ä¶then you are a addict. How hard is it to quit your favorite food? your fav candy? your fav icecream, your fav restaurant, its not easy if it causes you comfort. Well think of the euphoria you feel after you get that‚Ä¶aww life is just a little better to take. Its not just about the demon alcohol,drugs, its about all that we do in everyday life,but you know do these people get labeled? do they suddenly get thrust in rooms and the only people that they can be around are others just like them because others dont trust the icecream addict,over eater; NO we tolerate them‚Ä¶but all of a sudden the worst of the worst US the addicts get put in rooms,locked up or banished from normalacy because We have a problem. And dont say you dont do it society, because its true. You see us as a problem to send off somewhere to get us well, or so that you dont have to deal with us. Let someone else deal with this mess‚Ä¶cause it could cause a blemish in our world if this continues. I crave love‚Ä¶but never really knew how to handle it and keep it very long. I dont crave money,drugs,alcohol. these are how i solve the emotions that run deep and i dont want to feel. this adds to the already
made problem. KILL me today. Please because I cant stand the image you have in your head of me. I am no saint, I have done wrong, I have hurt, taken and pilaged. Kill me please. I dont see that same person you see today but when i stare long enough it starts to take me there. that is what this song says‚Ä¶if you cant take the good with the bad then hate me ‚Ä¶..just leave me behind. I was told last night how much are we supposed to take from ""you "" guys. Not a ounce if you have healthy boundaries, you allow us to hurt you and then you build that wall so that even if we progress and try to heal what we have done you stay behind it so we dont ""hurt"" you again. One thing I have learned is I dont have that power to make you happy, I dont have that duty to cure your ills,but I can be supportive and caring towards you and thats it. You are responsible for YOu. Now it is clear to me why one of my ex‚Äôs left me, she said I am giving more into this then you are‚Ä¶I have to go. Well, I understand today. I feel like I am happy about the new person that is being created, but other then a few I am the only one cheering me on. I am sorry that you were in the middle of this‚Ä¶you have a new ""son"" now and im sure that he will be easier to love easier to take then I was or have been. I still love you and always will,I cant stand that I am still harming . Please do me a favor though‚Ä¶.kill me today. I am sick and tired of this‚Ä¶the pain in my brain goes deep the hurt in my heart is overflowing‚Ä¶i have never done this without chemicals‚Ä¶.can you not understand the pain that is? the moment to moment trying just to breath, trying to just be in the word‚Ä¶trying to do the next right thing‚Ä¶when all in your life has harmed left or hurt you? so what are you supposed to do out of pattern‚Ä¶Hurt back. even if you dont need to ‚Ä¶I have and obiously still do. I want a son and I wanted to name him Jameson Kole‚Ä¶.so that is not a fake name that is attached to me‚Ä¶I want a son with that name. I could give a damn about anything in the internet world‚Ä¶it all is fake in one way or the other..I would rather meet real people and develop a foundation not in words but actions. Whether people acknowledge it or not‚Ä¶it gives people a barrier to hide behind. to be righteous, to be judgemental to act as if they wish they could be‚Ä¶and in real life they cant match up to the image that is portrayed on here. illusion is the devil that is what i have been told‚Ä¶so this net thing that so many love‚Ä¶.its illusion no matter how you sugar coat it. I am running out of things to say and I just ask please kill me today. I cant or wont live up to that image you have of me. If you want to get to know me today‚Ä¶feel free but dont bring the past withyou. I am learning that in therapy and the meetings maybe instead of thinking others are the only ones that need help‚Ä¶.maybe suggestion isnt always a bad thing. One healthy and one unhealthy people eventually make two unhealthy people. Well, I know that I fight moment by moment to stay that way‚Ä¶good bye journal‚Ä¶.Martin

You‚Äôre in a better place, I‚Äôve heard a thousand times And at least a thousand times I‚Äôve rejoiced for you But the reason why I‚Äôm broken the reason why I cry Is how long must I wait to be with you

Help me Lord because I don‚Äôt understand your ways The reason why I wonder if I‚Äôll ever know But even if You showed me the hurt would be the same

I was reading these words because I am trying to hard to stay in the light of salvation.I have had some triggers today that are trying to pick away at my serenity.I will overcome because of my salvation,and my father. I was thinking earlier as I heard this song, that is the mystery that life has to offer.The reason we are so miserble alot of times , and out of place is the simple fact this isnt home. This isnt where we are to be comfortable and attached. We are to be longing a home that we have never seen but know exists. I crave my fathers arms, to love me and to show me that all the time on this earth was not in vain, but I learned to respect heaven and all the glory that it has to offer. I have been on a trip of some sort lost,confused,angry and blaming,but to look at that is to say, do you not have any faith martin? do ya not believe that there is someone that is sheltering you from all pain,evil. I watch that video on my page daily to remind me that no matter how bad I think ""i"" have it , someone that was perfect no flaws went thru so much more so that I could have a second chance at salvation. Thank you jesus for your ultimate sacrafice.I just had to come and share that with no one but myself, I get clarity once I read what I am thinking‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶god bless the lost today, may you sit and say the simple prayer ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.jesus I am a sinner, I need your salvation, I believe you are the son of god, please rescue me from my damnation‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..love ya..martin

Well, she was precious like a flowerShe grew wild, wild but innocentA perfect prayer in a desperate hourShe was everything beautiful and different
Stupid boy, you can‚Äôt fence that inStupid boy, it‚Äôs like holding back the windShe let her heart and soul right in your handsAnd you stole her every dream and you crushed her plansShe never even knew she had a choice and that‚Äôs what happensWhen the only voice she hears is telling her she can‚ÄôtStupid boy, stupid boyOh
So what made you think you could take a lifeAnd just push it push it aroundI guess you build yourself up so highYou had to take her and break her down
She let her heart and soul right in your handsAnd you stole her every dream and you crushed her plansShe never even knew she had a choice and that‚Äôs what happensWhen the only voice she hears is telling her she can‚ÄôtYou stupid boy
Oh, you always had to be right but now you‚Äôve lostThe only thing that ever made you feel aliveYeah, yeah
Well, she let her heart and soul right in your handsAnd you stole her every dream and you crushed her plansYes, ya didShe never even knew she had a choice and that‚Äôs what happensWhen the only voice she hears is telling her she can‚ÄôtYou stupid boy, oh, I‚Äôm the same oldSame old stupid boy
It took awhile for her to figure out she could runBut when she did, she was long goneLong gone, long goneAh, she‚Äôs gone

I had a long talk with someone dear to me last night and all that she told me was the Truth. I heard this song today and it just re-illiterates what was said. I must be honest with the things I have done to get it out to find closure and not allow to repeat the same mistakes. I have said it in so many ways but always danced around the truth. I was so terrible to a innocent person that didnt deserve all that I put her thru. Like the song says, she gave me her heart and her soul and still i always told her "" you cant"" and I get on the pity pot and say boohoo for me‚Ä¶well, you know its not all about me today. I have hurt people and want to make amends so that I can move on and continue this journey that god has placed for me. I thought this song hit the spot that my heart has been trying to tell me is going on. I need to keep going forward and its not about what I dont have anymore but what god has placed in front of me. I am humbled today. THank you mom, for the courage to speak honest and direct to me, I need it:) BB I recognize alot more today then I ever knew while we were one ‚Ä¶Thank you for loving me when you didnt have to. You are so precious please dont give up on yourself and your counseling. Truely a blessing to the world. Love martin.

Today i read out of day by day book that was given to me awhile back as a gift and I didnt even open it up very much back then. I have started to re-read things that I have neglected or just skimmed over to see where it ""fit "" me. Just have really started to slow down and absorb the knowledge god has been screaming at me from across the room. Today is a good day actually the sun is shining thru my office and i watch the rays hit off the office that is full of gods love. I have not read any of this diary in a long time and as suggested from my therapist not to. I am taking direction from her and others where before I didnt. I see her today at three so I am looking forward to that appointment I have so much to talk over with her. I am trying to just live in the moment and be thankful for all the gratitude and blessings that have been bestowed upon my life. I will be a better person , just for the moment in gods time. I am completing goals I set for myself and am happy about the progress I have made. Like I hear all the time progression not perfection. I understand that today. I was driving to work today and just was amazed at all the unhappy faces I passed along the way. Being one of those faces for so long its easy to spot. I just said thank you jesus for not giving up on me. I still have my moments dont let me deceive you but no where NEAR the existance I once walked the earth in. I love myself and know I am worth love from others as well. Happy üôÇ Thank you lord may you keep me near and hold your other children as close. Your son‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Martin

Daily Battles of the Mind
by Joyce Meyer 
Did you know that we are in a war? Everywhere we look we see the casualties. Every day we see people falling from disease, divorce, and tragedy. Looking around at all this suffering, we may think that the battles are being lost in hospitals and divorce courts‚Äîbut, in reality, we are losing the earlier, more important conflicts on the battlefield of our minds. 
Our minds are being bombarded daily with a constant stream of little nagging thoughts, suspicions, doubts, fears, wonderings, and theories. While any one of these can cause defeat and devastation, many of us are plagued by more than one. Our lives have become filled with daily mental battles against a variety of aggressors. 
Because we fail to identify the battlefield, we also fail to correctly identify our foe. We tend to believe that men are our problem, or women, the system, money, or religion. In order to defend ourselves, we build up strongholds in our minds. Strongholds are areas of thinking based not on truth but lies. These strongholds, instead of protecting us, actually imprison us and hold us hostage. Because of the presence of these strongholds, we continue to believe lies and make important decisions based on our deception. 
Let me give you an example of how strongholds of wrong thinking can destroy a marriage. Mary and her husband, John, are not enjoying a happy marriage. There is strife between them all the time. They are angry, bitter, and resentful. Now their two children are starting to show signs of being affected by all the dissension in the home. One of the kids is even developing stomach problems brought on by all of the conflict. 
Mary‚Äôs problem is that she doesn‚Äôt know how to let John be the head of their family. She is bossy‚Äîshe wants to make all the decisions, handle the finances, and discipline the children. She wants to work so she will have her ""own"" money. She is independent, loud, and demanding. Mary knows that her attitude is wrong, and she wants to change. She‚Äôs been in counseling, and she is constantly asking for prayer that God would help her with her anger, rebellion, unforgiveness, resentment, and bitterness. But she hasn‚Äôt seen any improvement. Why? 
Over the years, Mary has built up strongholds in her mind. Mary can‚Äôt control her actions because she can‚Äôt control her thoughts. She can‚Äôt control her thoughts because of the strongholds in her mind‚Äîstrongholds that were built very early in her life. 
As a child, Mary had an extremely domineering father. For years she suffered helplessly as her father mistreated her and her mother. He was disrespectful in all his ways except toward Mary‚Äôs brother who could do no wrong. It seemed as if he was favored just because he was a boy. By the time she was sixteen, the strongholds in Mary‚Äôs mind were firmly established. The stronghold of lies went like this: ""Men really think they‚Äôre something. They are all alike, and you can‚Äôt trust any of them. They will hurt you and take advantage of you."" As a result, Mary‚Äôs mind was made up: ""When I get away from home, nobody is ever going to push me around again!"" 
Before Mary can ever have victory in her life and peace in her marriage, she will have to tear down the strongholds that are ruling her thinking. Do you see yourself in Mary‚Äôs life? Many of us have given in to these deceptions at one time or another. How can these strongholds be torn down? We must be willing to receive the light of TRUTH in our minds. Our search for truth begins in God‚Äôs Word, which says that the truth will set us free (see John 8:32). This means we can be free from bondage, sin, and the strongholds in our minds. But just searching for truth won‚Äôt set us free, we must be courageous enough to BELIEVE the truth. 
Even though truth is revealed, it‚Äôs sometimes hard to accept. It is a painful process to face our deceptions and deal with them. It‚Äôs so easy to allow our past and how we were raised to negatively affect us for the rest of our lives. Our past may explain why we‚Äôre suffering, but we must not use it as an excuse to stay in bondage. You may have some major strongholds in your life that need to be torn down. Let me encourage you by saying, ""God is on your side."" There is a war going on, and your mind is the battlefield. But the good news is that God is fighting on your side!¬†

I have been visiting this site and read this Again‚Ä¶.and I have to constantly believe that god has me in his arms and that I am NOT alone. I will be loved by me today. I will say good things about me today. I will allow gods will to be done. I wont stand in his way. I will allow change to occur. I will bring down some of those ""strongholds"" that I relate to . I am not a victim. I am a survivor. I can change, I can be whole I am loved.

203,https://www.opendiary.com/m/rebornsoldier/no-therapy-due-to-holiday-4537823/,2006-12-27,no therapy due to holiday‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.,"
There was no group today because of the holiday season. I really needed one today also. So, I will use my old friend opendiary to get me thru it. I was thinking about things that I spoke on in my a.m. group for my job. I was talking about how one role that you play in a dysfunctional family is the lost child. I was that lost child as well as having to ""protect"" the family secrets so therefore also was the hero. I grew up thinking that everything that happend in that house was normal to a sense. I knew that other families werent like mine but also felt alliance to the homefront. How sick is that? well, in a little boys mind its not sick and you do what you feel best is for your family. I have hated my father and mother for a lot of years, and thus needing affirmation from everything known to man under the sun. I seek out comfort in all areas, and even lil things such as words can get me thru the rough spots. I still am sick even though I have gotten a lot healthier how I dont act out like I once did. I think about the consequences that are attached to my dysfunction. I spoke about how one time as a child going to get milk from the store and on the way home it fell off my bike and went all over the ground. I was terrified and panicky. I tried everything to keep from having to go home and face the music. Ultamately, I returned home to face the harshness that awaited over spilt milk. All that abuse, and all those names and tyraids‚Ä¶and people tell me today‚Ä¶.your grown get over it, let it go. The power of words is so deep that takes years to overcome much less the physical stuff. I hate who I have become due to the family i grew up in . I hate alot about humanity to allow such things to happen to the innocent, in turn once again myself. I¬† have violated, and hurt‚Ä¶you say forgive and it shal be no more. Shame/ guilt the fabrics of a addicts mindset. Anything can trigger t his also, its not like being sad or depressed cause it could be anything‚Ä¶.like today reading about it and identifying ‚Ä¶""hey that is me"". Like everything else, there is never a clear cut way to work thru it.,, just positive words to yourself, dealing with it, talking about it. Okay, then what? cause it still stays‚Ä¶and lingers and stinks. I needed a group today badly‚Ä¶..I feel depleated from the world. hell, i dont blame people that run from me, and who no longer associate with me, i would too if i were healthy, never knowing what is real with me and what is the role. At times I wonder if the rest of the world is this intuned with their every feeling emotion, like a raw person with no skin, feeling every breath of wind, and always bumping into something that causes deep gashes. I wish I could puke up this crap and never have to deal with it ever again‚Ä¶‚Ä¶I dont wish this on anyone‚Ä¶Insane today, clear tommorow. You know at times I pray that the clearness stays more then the insanity. It sucks, it hurts, it penetrates the deepest pours of the soul, tortures the good angel while the angel fights for air. I succomb to the insanity and I just want to cry but no tears fall‚Ä¶ever. I at times wonder lord? why is my will so strong‚Ä¶and why doesnt it allow you to take my life and will, why must I struggle with this so harshly?The punches I have taken in time keep rippin thru my flesh when i feel like this. I hear those chants‚Ä¶and then i weep‚Ä¶.make it stop make it stop‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶agony in the hell of the mind‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.please pray for me‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

Abuse and the Miracle of Recovery
by Joyce Meyer 
During my childhood, I was abused sexually, emotionally, verbally, and physically. 
Many of you reading this article have also been abused, or you deal with someone in your life who comes from an abusive, dysfunctional background. 
What is abuse? It means to misuse, to use improperly, to use up, or to injure by maltreatment. Let me give you a brief definition of the four types of abuse. 
Sexual abuse: considered to be the most degrading and offensive. It consists of molestation, rape, incest, exhibitionism, voyeurism, obscene phone calls, etc. 
Emotional abuse: withholding of love, attention, loving touches, or words of acceptance. Love is only given based on acceptable performance, etc. 
Abandonment: would fall under the category of emotional abuse and can occur when one or both parents leave the child physically or mentally. Adults can also experience the devastating effects of abandonment if important people in their lives leave suddenly or violently. 
Verbal abuse: People must hear loving words of acceptance to develop properly. Verbal abuse can be overt or covert. Overt: aggressive, angry words which tell you that you are flawed or unacceptable Covert: loving words withheld 
Physical abuse: beatings, unfair discipline, locked in closets or dark rooms, food withheld, etc. 
The effects of abuse can be devastating and long lasting. Many people never recover from abuse. 
Although I functioned as what appeared to be ""normal"" in society, I had multiple inward problems and complicated personality disorders. I will name a few of the things going on in me at that time that prevented me from righteousness, peace, and joy that Romans 14:17 declares is the kingdom. God the Father sent Jesus so we could have and enjoy ""the kingdom."" 
I was bitter about my past and had a chip on my shoulder, which caused me to have the attitude that everyone owed me preferential treatment. I was full of self-pity, especially if things did not go my way. I was controlling, manipulative, fearful, insecure, and harsh. I was just plain hard to get along with and often downright obnoxious. I was judgmental, suspicious, and very negative. 
I experienced a lot of guilt and condemnation. I had a shame-based nature; therefore, everything I attempted was poisoned. Since I did not like who I was, I spent many years trying to be like someone else‚ÄîI am sure you are getting the picture that I was quite a mess. 
¬†
¬†
THis next part is where I am gonna be I know it‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..
Now, what I am getting ready to say is important. I WAS BORN AGAIN AND ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN CHURCH LIFE. We attended church regularly and did church work. Our lives revolved around the church, but I was not getting victory over my problems. In fact, the really sad part was that I did not even understand that I had a problem. I thought everyone else had a problem; and if they would change, I would be happy. 
In 1976 1 received the Baptism of the Holy Spirit. Acts 1:8 speaks of receiving the power to be witnesses. Notice it does not say to do witnessing, but to be witnesses. The Bible says we are to be living epistles read of all men, light in a dark world, and the salt of the earth. Doing is a different thing than being. I had my outside polished up, but my inner life was a wreck. Quite often the inner turmoil exploded, and then everybody could see I was not quite what I appeared to be. 
The outpouring of the Holy Spirit in my life gave me a real love for God‚Äôs Word and an ability to understand the Word like never before. Second Corinthians 3:18 (paraphrased) says that as we look into the Word of God, it is like looking into a mirror; and we are transformed into His image from glory to glory. 
I have been changing ever since. I have changed, and changed, and changed; and I am still changing. Most of those problems are completely gone and the rest only flare up occasionally. I even look differently‚ÄîI look younger, happier, and more peaceful. 
Second Corinthians 5:17 (paraphrased) says if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things have passed away; behold, all things are made new. But that really does not mean everything from the past just vanishes. The Amplified Bible brings it out this way, ""Behold, the fresh and new has come!"" In other words, without Jesus there is no hope of newness of life; the past always affects the future without the power of God to overcome it. But even with Jesus, it is not automatic. When the fresh and new comes, there is opportunity; but we must give the Word of God an exalted place in our lives. We must face the truth as revealed to us in His Word, and then the truth will set us free if it is acted upon. 
I want to encourage you! Keep pressing on. You will keep changing if you stay in the Word. Philippians 1:6 (paraphrased) says He that has begun a good work in you is well able to bring it to completion. Hebrews 12:2 (paraphrased) says look to Jesus who is the author and the finisher of our faith. 
Now I am enjoying kingdom living: ""Righteousness, peace, and joy."" And no matter what your past has been or how many problems you have, God will do a miracle for you. He will change you into the image of Jesus Christ and give you a new life worth living.¬†

I was sitting here thinking that the struggle in me is the struggle of letting go‚Ä¶.my therapist and I talked on this awhile back ‚Ä¶.even on my ride to work I heard this cd that took me back to a time, and BB suddenly was in my heart. I can forgive myself for alot of things, its just that I dont know what to do with the memories. I started getting naustalgic just like a high‚Ä¶.only thinking of the good times‚Ä¶it was ""wave on wave"" and that was OUR song. I told myself just because it didnt go the way that we planned‚Ä¶.those memories will remain. NOt always a bad thing‚Ä¶I just get stuck in it‚Ä¶.and think ""what if"" ‚Ä¶.my addict mind.

Hello heavenly father:
I am at work thinking on the sermon I heard joyce meyers talk about earlier on this video I watched. She spoke on contempt and envy. It hit hard because like all others I have been guilty of this. It is such a huge stonewall on progression when ever you allow yourself to not be happy with what you have. In the world I have been guilty of this very thing, and always seeking ""better"" I know that search was from within‚Ä¶but allowed all on the outside to be the curse that fed the lonliness that beats within. I feel great today, and doing something that I havent done in awhile, saturated in it. These words above, not just words but actions that it takes to show obedience to our creator. Like in alot of areas in my life I have lacked dicipline and obedience for that ‚Ä¶that was good or to lead me on a brighter path of salvation. The last verses not knowing the price my lord paid for me‚Ä¶man, and to just walk away and say oh well, thanks but I got this lord. Selfish and spoiled ‚Ä¶from me, I for so long have been my own higher power. Thinking that no matter what ""I "" wanted that nothing could stop me from getting it. The more I gained the more the hunger grew and the pride the waste of the flesh trickled down my face in envy and regret. Please father help me learn to forgive and to be forgiven, not for face, but for sincerity from within. It is a new year and I am ready to ""start over"" to do things different, to learn how to apply what I have been taught. Help me today:) your son, martin.
P.S. not help, take it all‚Ä¶..thanks:)

The Power of Hope
by Joyce Meyer 
I define hope as ""the happy anticipation of good things."" Are you aggressively hoping for something good to happen to you? Do you wake up in the morning excited and expectant about life? You can do that by learning how to celebrate and enjoy this journey called life. 
Everything in life is a process in motion. Without movement, advancement, and progression, there is no life. Once a thing has ceased to progress, it is dead. In other words, as long as we live, you and I are always going to be heading somewhere, and we should be enjoying ourselves on the way. God created us to be goal-oriented visionaries. Without a vision, we become bored and hopeless. Hope deferred makes the heart sick, according to Proverbs 13:12, but when the desire is fulfilled, it is a tree of life. There‚Äôs something about hope that makes people lighthearted and happy. You‚Äôre not going to be happy if you don‚Äôt have hope. The more hope you have in God, the happier you become. Biblical hope is a close relative to faith. I don‚Äôt see how you can have faith without hope because hope is the foundation on which faith stands. Hope believes everything is going to turn out all right-hope is positive! To enjoy life, you must maintain a good, positive attitude. God is positive, and He wants positive things to happen to each of us, but that isn‚Äôt likely to happen if we‚Äôre not filled with hope and faith. 
Some people are afraid to hope because they have experienced so much hurt and disappointment that they don‚Äôt think they can face any more pain. They refuse to hope so they won‚Äôt be disappointed. Disappointment is painful! Rather than being hurt again, they simply refuse to hope that anything good will ever happen to them. This type of behavior sets up a negative lifestyle. Everything becomes negative because their thoughts are negative. Proverbs 23:7 says, For as he (a person) thinks in his heart, so is he‚Ä¶. YOUR FUTURE HAS NO ROOM FOR YOUR PAST! 
Many years ago, I was extremely negative because of the devastating abuse that had taken place in my past. The result was that I expected people to hurt me, and they did. I expected people to be dishonest, and they were. I was afraid to believe that anything good might happen. I thought I was protecting myself from being hurt by not expecting anything good to happen. When I really began to study the Word and trust God to restore me, I began to realize that all of my negativism had to go. In Matthew 8:13, Jesus says that it will be done for us as we have believed. I believed everything was negative, so naturally many negative things happened to me. 
I needed to let go of the past and move into the future with hope, faith, and trust in God. I had to get rid of the heaviness of despair, depression, and discouragement. And I did, once I dug into the truth of God‚Äôs Word! I found out that God is ‚Ä¶a shield for me, my glory, and the lifter of my head (Psalm 3:3). I began to turn my negative thoughts and words into positive ones! Now, I am not saying that you and I can get whatever we want by just thinking about it. God has a perfect plan for each of us, and we can‚Äôt control Him with our thoughts and words. But we can think and speak in agreement with His will and plan for us. We can practice being positive in every situation that arises. Even if what is taking place in your life at the moment seems negative, expect God to bring good out of it, as He has promised in His Word. You must understand that before your life can change, your attitude must change. 
Hope is a powerful spiritual force that is activated through our positive attitude. Then, we are assured and know that [God being a partner in their labor] all things work together and are [fitting into a plan] for good to and for those who love God and are called according to [His] design and purpose (Romans 8:28). What Satan means for harm, God intends for good. All things work together for good for those who love God. Satan wants to hurt you and have you spend your life distrusting everyone because somebody hurt you when you were a child, while you were in school, in your marriage, on your job-the list of who, what, where, and how you can be hurt is endless. You have to say, ""No! That is subject to change! I am a child of the living God! Something good is going to happen to me!"" 
[After all] the kingdom of God is not a matter of [getting the] food and drink [one likes], but instead it is righteousness (that state which makes a person acceptable to God) and [heart] peace and joy in the Holy Spirit (Romans 14:17). What this means is that after all the painful things that have happened in your past have come and gone, God still wants you to enjoy every single day of your life. This won‚Äôt happen, however, until you make up your mind to take hold of the abundant life that Jesus‚Äô death and resurrection purchased for you. Until then, the devil will always try to take it away. Jesus said, The thief comes only in order to steal and kill and destroy. I came that they may have and enjoy life, and have it in abundance (to the full, till it overflows) [John 10:10]. 
You are a new creation. You don‚Äôt have to allow the old things that happened to you to keep on affecting your new life in Christ. As a new creature in Christ Jesus, you can have your mind renewed according to the Word of God: And be constantly renewed in the spirit of your mind [having a fresh mental and spiritual attitude], and put on the new nature (the regenerate self) created in God‚Äôs image, [Godlike] in true righteousness and holiness (Ephesians 4:23,24). Things will change for the better when you keep your thoughts filled with hope. 
REJOICE IN HOPE 
The Bible is full of hope-filled promises for you and me. Through Him also we have [our] access (entrance, introduction) by faith into this grace (state of God‚Äôs favor) in which we [firmly and safely] stand. And let us rejoice and exult in our hope of experiencing and enjoying the glory of God (Romans 5:2). Good things begin to happen to you when you rejoice in the hope of experiencing God‚Äôs favor on a regular basis. Luke 2:52 tells us that ‚Ä¶Jesus increased in ‚Ä¶favor with God and man. You and I are introduced to the favor of God by faith. All of God‚Äôs promises are activated by faith. We shortchange ourselves when we believe in Jesus but don‚Äôt believe in His blessings. Believe that you walk in holiness and righteousness (see Ephesians 4:24), believe that you are anointed (see 2 Corinthians 1:21), and believe that you are blessed with every spiritual blessing as promised in Ephesians 1:3. Believe Romans 8:37 when it says you are more than a conqueror! 
Everything that is promised in the Bible is for us to rejoice in now. Be glad! Raise your expectancy level. Rejoice in the hope of experiencing God‚Äôs glory right now. My husband and I believe for many things, but beyond them all, we believe in Someone-that Someone is Jesus. We don‚Äôt always know what is going to happen. We just know that it will always work out fo
r our good! The more positive and hopeful we are, the more we will be in the flow of God. In Ephesians 1:17,18, the apostle Paul prayed, [For I always pray to] the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, that He may grant you a spirit of wisdom and revelation [of insight into mysteries and secrets] in the [deep and intimate] knowledge of Him, by having the eyes of your heart flooded with light, so that you can know and understand the hope to which He has called you, and how rich is His glorious inheritance in the saints (His set-apart ones). This glorious inheritance is for you and me! Second Peter 1:3 tells us, For His divine power has bestowed upon us all things that [are requisite and suited] to life and godliness, through the [full, personal] knowledge of Him Who called us by and to His own glory and excellence (virtue). 
THE HOPE OF SEEING CHANGE 
If there is anything in this world that you can be sure of it is change. Something is always changing. Why is it, then, that we find ourselves thinking, ""Nothing will ever change‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm always going to be like this‚Ä¶ my situation will never change‚Ä¶ he‚Äôll never change‚Ä¶ she‚Äôll never change‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm never going to be as good as so-and-so?"" The only thing that will never change is God. For I am the Lord, I do not change‚Ä¶ (Malachi 3:6). Everything else can change. If you have no hope of seeing change in your situation, change probably isn‚Äôt going to come. We endure so many things emotionally that we really wouldn‚Äôt have to suffer if we put our hope in God and stopped looking at all of the circumstances we can‚Äôt control. We will never enjoy life unless we decide to! In order to live as God intends for us to live, we must truly believe that it is God‚Äôs will for us to experience continual joy. Then we must decide to enter into that joy, which is essential to our physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual health. 
Proverbs 17:22 says, A happy heart is good medicine and a cheerful mind works healing, but a broken spirit dries up the bones. Hope makes joy available, just as a lack of hope produces misery. We can choose to enjoy righteousness and peace or to stay in the midst of condemnation and turmoil. There are blessings or curses available, and that is why Deuteronomy 30:19 tells us to choose life and blessings. What do you do while you wait for change? You pray, believe, and expect to receive. Maintain a positive attitude, knowing that God is working on bringing your change and that you will see it. Throughout your waiting time, the devil will scream, ""It‚Äôs not going to change, it‚Äôs going to get worse!"" Don‚Äôt listen to this and become discouraged. Instead, wake up in the morning and say out loud, ""This is the day that the Lord has made, and I will rejoice and be glad! Something good is going to happen to me today! Everything in my life that is not right is subject to change! The One Who never changes is changing my situation. And while He‚Äôs doing it, I‚Äôm going to enjoy my life!"" Put your confidence in God and stop wearing yourself out trying to make things happen. The decision to have a good attitude while your change is coming can change you! Now is the time to decide to enter into the full and abundant life that God wants you to have. 
GOD IS WORKING RIGHT NOW! 
Most of us have a hard time believing that God is working on our behalf until we see something happening with our natural eyes. This usually isn‚Äôt the way God works. He works behind the scenes much of the time. Right now He is changing hearts and drawing sinners unto Him. Right now He is working in our government. Right now God has a plan for your promotion-He may be speaking to your boss about giving you a raise. God is busy working in your life as long as you believe. Hebrews 11:1 says, Now faith is the assurance (the confirmation, the title deed) of the things [we] hope for, being the proof of things [we] do not see and the conviction of their reality [faith perceiving as real fact what is not revealed to the senses]. This scripture begins with the word now. Although the Greek word from which it is translated actually means but, and, etc., rather than at this point in time, I still believe the term can be used to describe faith and hope. Faith and hope operate right now! Without them, life isn‚Äôt enjoyable. Every time I lay aside faith and hope, I stop believing and I lose my peace and as soon as I lose my peace, my joy goes with it. Make a decision to be a now person. God has a good plan for your life right now. Trust Him today. Believing God brings you into His rest and puts an end to the torment caused by impatience and anxiety while you‚Äôre waiting. No matter how hopeless your situation seems to be or how long it has been that way, I know you can change because I did. It took time and heaping helpings of the Holy Spirit, but it was worth it. It will be worth it to you, too. Whatever happens, trust in the Lord and trust in the power of hope! My hope is in God who never changes. Nothing is impossible with Him. He is a big God, and I‚Äôm believing Him for big things. How about you?

I‚Äôm OK and I‚Äôm On My Way!
by Joyce Meyer 
How many times have you heard the expression, ""Nobody‚Äôs perfect""? We use and hear this expression almost every day. But it‚Äôs true‚ÄîI‚Äôm not perfect, you‚Äôre not perfect, nobody‚Äôs perfect. Hopefully though, we are all getting better, on our way to perfection. The important thing to remember is that even though we‚Äôre not yet perfect we‚Äôre still OK. Just because we haven‚Äôt yet arrived doesn‚Äôt mean that we‚Äôre not on our way. 
It‚Äôs true that most of us still have a long way to go. I used to get discouraged about how far I had to go, and it seemed like I was reminded of it every day, even every hour. I carried a constant sense of failure, a feeling that I just was not what I needed to be, that I was not doing good enough, that I should try harder‚Äîand yet when I did try harder, I only failed again. 
I have now adopted a new attitude: ""I‚Äôm not where I need to be, but thank God I am not where I used to be; I‚Äôm OK, and I‚Äôm on my way!"" I now know with all my heart that God is not angry with me just because I have not yet arrived. He is pleased that I am pressing on, staying on the path. If you and I will just ""keep on keeping on,"" God will be pleased with our progress. 
Keep walking the walk by taking one step at a time. This is an important thing to remember. It is true that we have to keep pressing on, but thank God we don‚Äôt have to hate and reject ourselves while we are trying to get to our destination. 
If I invited you to take a walk, you would think I was crazy if I became angry after the first few steps because we had not yet arrived at our destination. We can understand ordinary things like this, and yet we have a difficult time understanding that God expects it to take some time for us to grow spiritually. 
We don‚Äôt think there is something wrong with one-year old children because they cannot walk perfectly. They fall down frequently, but we pick them up, love them, bandage them if necessary, and keep working with them. Surely our awesome God can do even more for us than we do for our children. 
This process is always difficult. Growing and learning is never easy. But the changes make us a better person. We begin to think differently, then we begin to talk differently, and finally we begin to act differently. This is a process that develops in stages, and we must always remember that while it is taking place we can have the attitude, ""I‚Äôm OK, and I‚Äôm on my way!"" 
Enjoy yourself while you are changing. Enjoy where you are on the way to where you are going. Enjoy the journey! Don‚Äôt waste all of your ""now time"" trying to rush into the future. Remember, tomorrow will have troubles of its own (Matthew 6:34). 
Today you may be wrestling with a bad temper and thinking if you could just get freedom in that area, everything would be all right. The thing is, you may have forgotten that God will then reveal something else that needs to be dealt with, and you will be back in the same frame of mind again, thinking, ""If only I didn‚Äôt have this problem, I could be happy."" We must learn to look at these things in a new way. 
We can be free to believe that we are indeed OK and on our way‚Äînot perfected yet, but pressing on. We can be free to enjoy life, enjoy God, and enjoy ourselves.

Perception: to perceive a object in the definitive way that it makes sense to you, to use your senses as guides to get definition or clarity.
Often times we think that our perception matches reality or other peoples reality based mindset. But more often then not, we are wrong and alot of times there are words or actions that can not be taken away. I was thinking today that alot of times my progression was not viewed as progression by me because of other peoples reality based ideas thoughts, and perception. I read that progression happens in minut steps and can even come as fast as running at full stride. I have kept myself down because I always get reminded of all the ""things"" that could be viewed as unchristian or shady. It ends up where you are a robot scared to live and live it abundantly. I read the other day that our lives are like sand going thru our fingers and like we are chasing the wind. With that being stated I would hate to live another second worrying about what I cannot and wont be able to change and do the best with what I have and today it is the lord. I say today because I dont know what tommorow may bring and yesterday is gone. It used to anger me so much when I felt like a failure because I would always be reminded.""your a addict, your blada blada‚Ä¶.those are the negative persay not to say all that came my way was negative but the negative in my mind sticks out the most especially when its from people that I so desperately want to be like or gain their approval. I today think this, if they dont approve, then they dont. Who wins or loses‚Ä¶no one, because we are individuals that have different perspectives and directives. I miss alot of things in life, but you know I am tired of wasting day by day reminissing on ""the days gone by"". Its gone, and I will do the best I can with what I have at the moment. It may not be the best in others eyes but I am okay with the way I feel about it because I am proud I have gotten off my butt to do something. That in itself is progression with me, I have procrastinated and put off things in the event ""this or that "" happend. Life is to short and to unstable to build on anything but what the lord gives you. That foundation I found for myself has led me to this‚Ä¶.I like that person in the mirror, I may not go to meetings, I may not always pray, and I may not always do the next right thing, but for me I am making it without failing to terribly and with the lord in my corner. He takes me as I am and if you cant, thats your own issues. I am not singling anyone out but if the messege hits home with you then deal with your own issues, leave me out of any of it. I can not be that powerful to change your mood, your mindset, or anything else. Hell, I try to like myself daily how could I ever match up to your expectations? never. I am okay with that though, like joyce wrote on the previous entry, I am Ok if just for today:). I dont have to get on here to prove anything either but it is nice for me to read when the days are not so bright to give me hope, look martin its not always gonna be like this‚Ä¶you have good days too:) I can tell you one thing, my good days out number the bad ones for sure. I may not have alot still in my 35 years, but I do have dignity and identity of self which is more valuble then trying to live in someone elses perception and world. I cant fit into alot of peoples worlds due to alot that I have seen and done, but thats okay too. They love me or dont, I can love myself and have god fill in the rest:) god has blessed me with great people in different times in my life, and to those I havent and will not ever forget, but as you have moved on, obviously it is time to that the season must end. I will always love you and as I perceive it ""hurt"" more then I do anything else. So, be knowing this. I never mean another word to hurt or harm again. I am Ok and will be okay because I am not gonna give up on myself if only for today, in times we judge progression by new experiences or new behaviors‚Ä¶, it happens subtle, hell, being clean and sober and taking a bath is progression, getting out of bed, going to work and not being fired, not yelling or screaming to get your way‚Ä¶that is what the program teaches, progression rather then perfection. When you really are in a honest program and only take your own inventories, other peoples progression is just that, no expectations. Alot of times, we give back all at once but never really build something stable to keep growing, just repeat the same ""get back"" lose"" it"" behavior, in reality if you live with a addict and you replace all they lose in their addiction , if they do relapse you have just given them more stuff to pawn and destroy.¬† I hit my bottom and still wanted help, and pleaded and I was given it. Now I dont ask if I dont have it, I do without or just live with what I have. Holidays, birthdays, all those other days that are gift ridden, my sanity and serenity mean more then any amount of $$ or gift I could ever receive. Lord thank you for never leaving me in the mud of the world, and giving me strength to continue even though at times, it appears futile and long time getting there. I am almost at a year in therapy and I dont regret a day of it. Progression is the backbone of recovery. Dont give up before the miracle happens‚Ä¶.well, the sad thing is many do, and they just band aid it, and keep the wound as sick as before. I dont know if you have ever been there, but its not easy to overcome ‚Ä¶..just one second at a time‚Ä¶.well, later diary I will return hope this was positive üôÇ actually I know it was‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. I love you lord and thank you for creating me in your image‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.Your son. Martin

Love Means Sacrifice, Not Selfishness
by Joyce Meyer 

</fon
t>
No matter how long you may live, you‚Äôll never stop learning. Every minute of every day brings us new opportunities to learn something we‚Äôve never known before. As long as we‚Äôre open to receive, God will continue to teach us every day. 
I‚Äôm still learning, and I know I always will be. What God teaches me every day about love continues to change my life. I have come to the place in my life where I can honestly say, ""Lord, eliminate everything in my life that is holding me back. Please, Lord, take away anything that is keeping me from walking in love and finding true fulfillment in my life."" In other words, ""Lord, reduce me to love (bring me to a state or condition of walking in love completely)!"" 
One of the most important facets I‚Äôve learned about love is unselfishness, which is characterized in the Bible as the willingness to sacrifice one‚Äôs own wishes for those of others. I‚Äôve learned that true love will always adapt and adjust to the needs and desires of other people. 
It‚Äôs impossible for people who have truly been reduced to love to be selfish. God has taught them how to be totally adaptable and adjustable to others. Selfish people, on the other hand, have hard hearts. It‚Äôs very difficult for selfish people to learn anything‚Äîespecially if it involves self-sacrifice. They expect everyone else to adjust to them and their needs. They simply don‚Äôt know how to adjust to others without becoming angry or upset. 
Learning to adapt and adjust myself to the needs and desires of others was very difficult for me. To be honest, I just wanted my way, and I got upset when I didn‚Äôt get it. I was selfish! I wanted what I wanted, when I wanted it! I couldn‚Äôt stand having to wait on someone else, or bending my own wishes to accommodate someone else‚Äôs timetable. 
But God began to soften my heart, and gradually, I learned to see the needs of others. Then God gave me compassion‚Äîthe heartfelt desire to meet the needs of others first, before my own. 
Slowly, I became committed to walking in love. I learned to adapt my own needs and desires in order to help meet the needs of others. I learned how to show love in different ways to different people. Did you know that not all people need the same thing from us? One of our children, for example, may need more of our personal time than the others. One of our friends may need more encouragement on a regular basis than another. 
For example, my aunt needs me, my parents need me, my brother needs me, my husband needs me, each of my four children needs me, my five grandchildren need me, my employees need me, my friends need me‚Äîand they all need me in different ways. 
Do I ever feel too needed? Of course! All of us feel overwhelmed from time to time. But I remind myself that God gives me grace for whatever He places in my life, and I‚Äôm fortunate to be loved and needed by so many. 
Do I ever get weary of always trying to be available to meet the needs of others? Yes! But I remind myself of all the years I lived in selfishness and how unhappy I was. Now I‚Äôm just making up for lost time! When I consider this, it doesn‚Äôt take long for me to adjust my attitude. After all, just telling people ""I love you"" is not enough. We need to go beyond the words and actually do something to help meet their needs. 
My husband, Dave, loves to play golf, so I try to make sure our schedule gives him opportunities to play. But there was a time when it angered me for him to play golf. I was miserable because I had not learned to adjust to his needs or desires. I wanted him to make all the adjustments. 
I never acknowledged the many ways in which Dave adjusted to my needs. I never saw what he did‚Äîonly what he didn‚Äôt do‚Ä¶and it was ruining our relationship. I‚Äôm glad now that I have learned to adapt and adjust. It was a little hard on me for a while, but it saved our marriage. 
Once you‚Äôve been reduced to love, you‚Äôll have no trouble establishing and maintaining good, healthy relationships with others. Your primary goal in life will be to put the wishes of others before your own. You will learn that true love is all about sacrifice. Selfishness will be a thing of the past.¬†¬†

Is Your Rubber Band Breaking?
by Joyce Meyer 
Today in America (and in much of the world) we live in a fast-paced society that seems to be placing more and more demands on us with each passing year. People are hurrying everywhere‚Äîand they‚Äôre often rude and short-tempered. Many people are experiencing financial stress, marital stress, and the stress of raising children. There is often mental and physical stress on the job caused by overwork. Many times this type of lifestyle causes health problems‚Äîusually adding even more stress. 
The word ""stress"" was originally an engineering term used to refer to the amount of force that a beam or other physical support could bear without collapsing under the strain. Today, the dictionary definition of stress includes ""mental, emotional, or physical tension; strain, distress."" This is a condition most of us are all too familiar with. Almost everyone today is under some kind of stress‚Äîit is a normal part of modern everyday life. It‚Äôs hard to get through a day without experiencing stress in one way or another. 
Our bodies were created by God to withstand a certain amount of these daily pressures, but when we push ourselves beyond our limitations, we begin to experience problems. Are you pushing yourself too hard? Many people today live in a perpetual state of overload‚Äìalways on the verge of collapse. They just keep stretching themselves to the limit like a rubber band‚Ä¶until one day they SNAP. 
A rubber band has an amazing ability to be stretched to its maximum length and then return to its precise original form. But how many times can it do that without weakening or breaking? 
Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre working around the house and break a rubber band while trying to stretch it around something. You can‚Äôt find another rubber band so you try to fix the broken one by tying the ends together. Sometimes in our daily lives, we stretch ourselves beyond our capacity, and we snap like the rubber band. We think we‚Äôve fixed the problem by simply tying the ends back together. But soon we fall into the same behavior that caused us to break down in the first place. 
At home, when a rubber band you have tied breaks again, it usually breaks in a different spot. So you tie the ends together in another knot. In our daily lives, when we keep stretching, breaking, and ""tying the ends back together,"" we begin to feel as though we are tied up in knots inside and out! 
The solution seems simple‚Äîjust get rid of those things that cause stress in our life. That may work for a while, but it is not the final solution. The fact is we can‚Äôt totally eliminate all the stress from our lives. Our only answer is to adjust our perspective and change the way we respond to the inevitable stresses we find in our every day life. Over time and repeated exposure to stress, our lives begin to resemble that worn-out rubber band. Exhaustion‚Äîboth physical and emotional‚Äîbegins to take its toll. When stress depletes our bodies, our immune systems become weak and sickness (even depression) can set in. 
Ignoring God‚Äôs laws and His ordained limits for our life will ultimately cause burnout. You simply can‚Äôt continue to overwork your mind, your emotions, and your body without eventually paying the price. Who sets the pace in your life? Do you let the pressures and stresses of everyday life drive you toward burnout? Are you stressed out from trying to keep up with everyone else? Are you living under the stress of competition and comparison? Are you a perfectionist with unrealistic goals? 
I believe we can live stress-free even though we live in a stress filled world, but it requires making some decisions‚Äîpossibly some radical decisions. If your life has become a rubber band all tied up in knots, it‚Äôs obvious that a change needs to take place. Begin to adjust your perspective to match God‚Äôs. Seek His peace and His pace for your life. Respect your body. Treat good health as a valuable gift. Don‚Äôt waste the energy God has given you on stress. Save it for living and enjoying life!¬†¬†

You are a causality of your beliefs and fears. Whatever you believe, you become. Whatever you fear, you manifest. You need to know and practice being true to yourself in order to reach your full potential. A human being is a spirit being. A human mind is a spirit place where supreme wisdom and truth await your every beckon call. Consciousness is the reality of your universe. You chose your reality from within fundamental truth or misconceptions. Your external being or personality is constructed by your inner life and spiritual standards. Disease and suffering are manifestations of your inner ill being.
In contrast, you possess the ability to invoke healing or elimination of all pain and suffering by your inner well-being. If this is not true then your spirit being is no more than a prisoner within a mass of flesh filled with errors and contradictions totally driven by reactions to physical stimulation. The power that fuels the human spirit being is fundamental truth and wisdom, which is the foundation of human existence. The source of fundamental truth and wisdom are within the mental world you create with your spirit light. This light can penetrate and unravel any entanglement of disease or illness in any mental or physical state. All humans possess the power to heal and transcend any physical or mental limitation as they manifest. The key is to focus on each limitation one by one, in a focused sequential manner. On this level there is a growing guidance that transcends the limitations of human thought, will power, image building, suggestion and even death by letting you look from a position beyond a mass of flesh into the truth which is the cure. To gain this insight is to base your entire purpose of life upon it by always regarding your spirit being as the center of your existence. The key is to let the universe pass through you without trying to control or direct it.
Humans are dual beings who live in two places at any given moment. One part faces the reality of society and all of its pressures and the other spirit part shares space with a living universal intelligence. Most humans find the society part of themselves being used as a mere tool in the hands of others as they allow those who possess a stronger mind move them from one place to another. All that can change if you can realize that you can tap into a higher wisdom that will keep you in a happy and fruitful state anytime you choose by merely understanding the influences that surround your existence. Within you is the knowledge and wisdom that can separate truth from error. Once you have reached this realization, it is not just a matter of knowing but also a matter of living this realization. Your health and happiness will come in proportion to what truth you realize and how you apply it to your daily life. In re-establishing yourself into a whole person of truth, you need to understand your actual present situation or state of mind. You need to make yourself aware of the fears and mistaken feelings that hold you down or make you suffer. This realization or awareness will help you find a simple explanation that will turn your thoughts and feelings in the direction of setting yourself free. Your intellectual confusion and understanding how this confusion was produced in the first place is needed in order to embrace the wisdom that already dwells within you.
As a spirit being first and physical being second, you are influenced by thoughts that surround your conscious and subconscious mind. If you look at yourself as a spirit being sharing an existence within corporeal form, you will never get sick or confused. As soon as you forget your spirit self and begin to false reason, you soon fall prey to the spells and pressures of others. This spirit state is subtle, lucid and wonderfully impressionable or responsive to understanding yourself beyond any fear or sickness. Your happiness or misery is truly controlled by yourself. In other words whatever you believe you create. Humans are no more than a compilation or collection of beliefs. This inventory of existence is the one thing that can be changed. As you walk through life you sometimes lose sight of the fact that your happiness or suffering has been dealt by your own hand through the decisions you have made and the beliefs you profess. Your beliefs cannot alter absolute truth but they can alter your happiness or sickness. Pain and sickness is the cancer of your beliefs while happiness and well-being are the fruits of your spirit being. You are in control of your state of well-being.
Think of this if you are questioning the thought that you are not in control of your own state of well-being. If all life on earth did not exist then there would not be any sickness, otherwise sickness must have had an existence before life was created. If this is the case then something must have created sickness for a purpose. If you believe sickness is your adversary and was created to destroy you, then what created it?¬† Where does sickness come from? It comes from your mind. False reasoning creates sickness and false reasoning is the only dynamic force occurring within you that can make you sick. Every opinion comes from somewhere. If a human believes in something that is founded on just an opinion, then their idea is in the opinion, making the feelings associated within the opinion attach to their idea. This confines the idea within the opinion. The idea is of itself nothing but an opinion condensed into something presumed to be based on fact and every word that went into making the idea. So to make an idea, you reason about something that has no proof, only opinion. If another human succeeds in establishing their opinion without absolute truth or real facts, they limit you with their opinion and stress or uneasiness will follow you consciously or subconsciously.¬† Apply this logic to anything regarding life, love or health and you will understand how to address any problem.
As you begin to understand who you truly are, you start to understand life. Your happiness comes from knowing that no part of your true essence can be seen by the human eye. All that is seen by human eyes is only your existence reduced to corporeal form. You often speak of your identity as though there were only one identity attributed to you. You have as many identities as you have thoughts and the ones you sense at any given time are attached to the last ones that were controlling you. Your essence is a truth that existed before you took physical form.
Conclusion<span style=‚ÄùFONT-SIZE: 14px‚Äù>
If it walks and talks, recognize it. If it is wise and able to unlock the secrets of your heart, do not deny it. If it is good and full of love, do not refuse to acknowledge it.

I am hollaring lord!‚Ä¶.
I usually write in here when things are good or bad or indecisive. I dont question so much because I understand that questining just adds to doubt and confusion. I heard this song today and thought about the lyrics that I just posted. You know alot of my life I have just not cried out to anyone because I have no tears to shed, they all fall inward, and so crying out to help never lead me much of anywhere. I took it all alone and in stride. I have been stubborn, I have been prideful and I have been lost. I know that my actions or behaviors at times are less then appropriate. i do as I was taught and in time I have overcame alot of them, but still some linger. I just know that without faith, I have nothing, I have lived life so dark and isolated that I cried out jesus,,takes this away then the sun would come, and I would not know how to live in it because of all the hurt, pain that I was accumstomed to. I understand that today I have a choice to go back in the dark, or stay in the light and be at peace. I dont write in here to do anything but unload my brain from all the thoughts that go thru it. If only for today, I am OK. I dont need to worry bout anything but five minutes at a time‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶its all i can manage. I just keep going amidst all the doubters, the people that dont believe or just want me to fail, I dont care, I am still here, and a survivor of my doings, as well as the doings that others have done to me. THe love I have always seeked I now see it when i look at the lord. I can only go at my pace no one elses. I am happy at this point where i am at. God hears my cries, even if the tears cannot come. He heals me from inside out, regardless of how others perceive my progression or regression. I am OK‚Ä¶if just for today:) love you lord‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.

            Over & Beyond
By: Joan Ball
 
 How do you love when you don‚Äôt want to?
I‚Äôve been thinking a lot about love lately. Not the ""romantic, just received a dozen roses"" sort of love. Not the ""first look at a new baby"" sort of love. Not even the ""cooperate with my Christian sisters and brothers"" sort of love. Instead, I‚Äôve been thinking about the ""I‚Äôve been betrayed by a friend or falsely accused of something shameful"" sort of love. The kind of love that Jesus exemplified and that I‚Äôm still learning to get my mind (and my actions) around.
Here‚Äôs my challenge. As much as I try to practice unconditional love, I love best when I can feel it. And yet, I know the true test of my commitment to loving my neighbors comes when I don‚Äôt feel love‚Äîwhen I‚Äôm forced to deal with someone who has hurt me or someone I love, when demonstrating love means loving my enemy.
Jesus tells us to love our enemies and pray for those who persecute us. Reading through that scripture recently, another verse‚ÄîMatthew 6:47‚Äîcame to my attention: ""If you greet only your brothers, what more are you doing than others?"" The question plagued me for days. What more are you doing than others?
Then, it hit me.
Through faith in Jesus and the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, I have the capacity and the responsibility to choose to love all people in all circumstances every day‚Äîwhether I feel it or not. We all do.
But the willingness to love with the selfless abandon described in Scripture still seems unattainable when I‚Äôm confronted with circumstances that stretch my boundaries‚Äîchallenging what I think is right or comfortable or fair. I‚Äôm saddened to admit the frequency with which I put my best thinking‚Äîand my best interest‚Äîahead of Jesus‚Äô call on my life to love others, even though I know what He wants from me.
Paul wrestles candidly with this in Romans:
""For I know that nothing good dwells in me, that is, in my flesh; for the willing is present in me, but the doing of the good is not. For the good that I want, I do not do, but I practice the very evil that I do not want. But if I am doing the very thing I do not want, I am no longer the one doing it, but sin which dwells in me"" (Romans 7:18-20).
""Wretched man that I am! Who will set me free from the body of this death? Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, on the one hand I myself with my mind am serving the law of God, but on the other, with my flesh the law of sin"" (Romans 7:24-25).
So, what does it take to love God, love our neighbors, and love our enemies? We can start by taking Paul‚Äôs lead‚Äîgoing beyond the command and calling out to the One who commands us. In doing so, we need to:
‚Ä¢ Commit ourselves to following the example of Jesus and ask Him to increase our capacity to love‚Äîwhether we feel it or not.
‚Ä¢ Recognize that Christian love should extend beyond our sense of what is right or comfortable or fair and be willing to do things differently.
‚Ä¢ Engage Jesus, and let Him do in us what He promised to do.
The next time we‚Äôre asked, ""What are you doing more than others?"" perhaps we‚Äôll have an answer beyond, ""Absolutely nothing.""

Face the Truth!
by Joyce Meyer 
Today, people everywhere are struggling through life with damaged emotions. They‚Äôve endured a lot of negative things in their life, which cause untold damage that needs to be dealt with. But all too often, these hurts are simply swept under the rug in an attempt to make them go away. 
Through my own life‚Äôs experience and from my many years of helping others through this process, I‚Äôve discovered that although God wants to help those who really want emotional healing, there are some very important steps that the individuals must take for themselves. If you want to receive emotional healing, one of the first steps you must take is to face the truth. You can‚Äôt be set free while you live in denial. You can‚Äôt pretend that certain negative things didn‚Äôt happen to you. 
From my own experience, as well as my years of ministry to others, I have come to realize that we are experts at building walls and stuffing things into dark corners, pretending they never happened. 
I spent the first eighteen years of my life in an abusive environment. But as soon as I got away from that situation, I acted as though nothing was wrong. I never told anyone what had gone on in my private life. 
Why don‚Äôt we want to bring things like that out into the open? We are afraid of what people will think. We are afraid of being rejected, of being misunderstood, of losing the love of those we care about who might have a different opinion of us if they really knew all about us. 
The next step toward emotional healing is confessing your faults. I think there is a place for eventually sharing with someone else the things that have occurred in our lives. There is something about verbalizing it to another person that does wonders for us. But use wisdom. Choose someone you know you can trust. Be sure that by sharing your story with someone else, you don‚Äôt simply put your burden on that individual‚Äôs shoulders. Also, don‚Äôt go on a digging expedition, trying to dig up old injuries that have been buried and forgotten. 
When I finally worked up the courage to share with someone what had happened to me early in my life, I actually began shaking violently in fear. It was an emotional reaction to the things I had kept buried within me for so long. Now when I talk about my past, it is as though I am talking about somebody else‚Äôs problems. Because I have been healed and restored, my past doesn‚Äôt bother me anymore. 
Finally, you must assume some personal responsibility. Some people are trapped in denial, afraid of what might happen if others find out the truth about them. But as long as they deny the past, they are never going to be free from it. 
Nobody can be set free from a problem until they are willing to admit they have a problem. An alcoholic or a drug addict or anyone who has lost control of their life is doomed to suffer until they are able to say, ""I‚Äôve got a problem, and I need help with it."" 
Even though our problems may have been brought upon us because of something that was done to us against our will, we have no excuse for allowing the problem to persist or to grow and even take control over our entire life. Our past experiences may have made us the way we are, but we don‚Äôt have to stay that way. We can take the initiative and start taking positive steps to change things‚Äîand we can ask for God‚Äôs help. Whatever your problem may be‚Äîface it, consider confessing it to a trusted friend, and then admit it to yourself. 
Face the truth‚Äîit can be the beginning of a happier life!

Inspiration and PurposeDiscovery Zone By Dr. Wayne W. Dyer
 
 
 
When you are inspired by a great purpose, everything will begin to work for you. Inspiration comes from moving back in-spirit and connecting to the seven faces of intention. When you feel inspired, what appeared to be risky becomes a path you feel compelled to follow. The risks are gone because you are following your bliss, which is the truth within you. This is really love working in harmony with your intention. Essentially, if you do not feel love, you do not feel the truth, and your truth is all wrapped up in your connection to Spirit. This is why inspiration is such an important part of the fulfillment of your intention to live a life on purpose.
When I left the work that no longer inspired me, every single detail that I had worried about was almost magically taken care of for me. I had spent several months working for a large corporation where I was offered a salary three times higher than I had been paid as a teacher, but I was not in spirit. That prodding inner knowing said, ‚ÄúDo what you are here to do,‚Äù and teaching counseling became my manifested daily purpose.
And public speaking, was not a risk; it was something I had to do because I knew that I could not feel happy with myself if I did not follow my heart. The universe handled the details, because I was feeling love for what I was doing, and consequently, I was living my truth. By teaching love, that very same love guided me to my purpose, and the financial remuneration flowed to me with that same energy of love. I couldn‚Äôt see how it work out, but I followed an inner knowing and never regretted it.
You may think it is too risky to give up a salary, a pension, job security, or familiar surroundings because of a dim night-light in your mind that draws you to see why it is turned on. I suggest that there are no risks at all if you pay attention to that light, which is your knowing. Combine your strong knowing with the faith that Spirit will provide, and you acknowledge the power of intention at work. Your trust in this inner knowing is all you need. I call it faith, not faith in an external being to provide you with purpose, but faith in the call you are hearing from the center of your being. You are a divine, infinite creation making the choice to be on purpose and to be connected to the power of intention. It all revolves around your being harmoniously connected to your Source. Faith eliminates the risk when you choose to trust that inner knowing about your purpose and become a channel for the power of intention.

I just wanted to get on here for a bit and write some stuff down before i go to bed. I dont know what it is about wanting to do good and praising and praying and beliveing that when that happens, all that you are gaining the devil appears out of no where and threatens your serenity and peace. I have a friend right now that we have become close and is going thru rough times. I usually am the fixer and codependent martyr. I just listened to joyce meyers today about being a example by giving not by just doing nothing. Well, with this person i just give advice when asked, and try to just plant the seed if ya will. Well, tonight I got some news that could in the past been just enough to ruin and devistate my self esteem, self worth, and so on.¬† Because anytime I helped someone in the past was for alterior or other motives than just the fact of giving. I started to get upset and actually started screaming out loud about lil and everything at once. I felt that at this point I have had enough with humanity and to try to help those that dont want it, is to exhausting., but of course the not wanting it part is all about perception.¬† I deal with things as a child does, i throw a tantrum and then i sulk, and get bitter and angry. I didnt do that this time, I just listened and actually wanted to listen to all that was stated instead of letting fear and anxiety get in my way. I screamed at god, ranting and raving‚Ä¶.about all that i feel and the pain of my heart. I dont know if that is sacreligious or not, but i did it. I live a very simple life today and just dont know what tommorow brings most of the time, but seriously all i really have is faith. I get mad at god, i throw my tantrums, but you know honestly he is all i have to lean on that doesnt leave me. I have had numerous people in my life that just up and vanish into thin air, while all along stating all the things that are not gonna happen. Well, today i was tested with my faith and growth in the fact that in order to keep something from going away you must be honest and speak from the heart.¬† i know that as humans we cannot change another person place or thing, but if we are honest and dont push our way on these things‚Ä¶its alot more logical that they may want to stay. Desperation and frustration are things I still need to work on. I am a seeker of love, a seeker of the feeling that it brings, and when i cant love me its hard to lean on the faith of a unconditional love. I know that in time, I will get there, hell, look how much growth a year has made. I am not drunk, I am not permiscous, I am just hopeing to build on this foundation strength and knowledge for the remainder of my days on this earth. My friend appears to be doing better, alcohol is such a deadly and powerful demon. ONce that is broken then all other things can be made possible. in honesty, love, faith , and hope, then how could you ever go wrong? To lose something isnt always about it going away and never comeing back‚Ä¶alot of times we lose because we dont fight for what we feel our hearts are screaming at us to hold on to. Well, for whatever that is worth, I just hope one day to find a second part of my heart that I will fight for, I will die for, and hold til I leave this earth. I already am starting good by having god on my side.

Alone Doesn‚Äôt Have to Mean Lonely
by Joyce Meyer 
¬†
A major problem facing many people today is loneliness. It seems to have become even more of an issue recently. As I travel the world, I see an increasing number of people requesting help and guidance for handling the loneliness in their lives. 
In the Bible, God tells us we are not alone. He wants to deliver, comfort, and heal us. But when people encounter painful losses in their lives, sadly, many never get over them. Sometimes when sudden tragedy occurs, the hurt seems unbearable. Without help, a sense of loneliness can actually settle on a person or family like a cloud‚Äîand it doesn‚Äôt seem to go away. 
There are many causes of loneliness, but many people don‚Äôt realize that they don‚Äôt need to live with it. They can confront it and deal with it. Loneliness often manifests as an inner ache, a vacuum, or a craving for affection. Its side effects include feelings of emptiness, uselessness, or purposelessness. 
Are you alone (independent, solitary, on your own), or are you lonely (desolate, deserted, dejected due to a lack of companionship)? There is a very real difference. It is important to realize that just because you are alone, it doesn‚Äôt mean that you must be lonely or lonesome. While it may not always be possible to avoid being alone, there are always answers to loneliness. Many times loneliness results from a trauma or crisis resulting from the death of a loved one, a divorce, or separation. When something happens to make us realize that things are never going to be the way they once were, it often creates crisis or trauma in our lives, which can lead to a sense of loneliness and despair. 
Like a wound healing, the pain may be felt for a long time, but complete recovery requires daily improvement. When a physical wound refuses to heal, it is an indication that there is an infection that must be dealt with. I believe the same is true of emotional wounds. The emotional part of us should heal just like the physical part of us. God gave us emotions just as He gave us physical bodies. He has provided for our emotional restoration just as He has provided for our physical healing in Him. While it is true that you may always miss the person or the thing lost, that does not mean that you must suffer permanent loneliness. 
I believe there are two vital steps anyone wishing to overcome loneliness must take: 


Know that God is with you all the time. In the Bible, God reminds us that He is always with us‚Ä¶that He‚Äôll never forsake us. Loneliness often leads us into asking ourselves all sorts of questions that can‚Äôt be answered, such as: ""What if I am alone for the rest of my life?"" ""What if this pain I am feeling never goes away?"" ""What if a problem arises that I don‚Äôt know how to handle on my own?"" ""What if‚Ä¶what if‚Ä¶what if‚Ä¶?"" The questions could go on and on, endlessly. Chances are, you‚Äôll never be able to answer the ""what if‚Äôs"" in life. But as long as you know that the Lord is with you, you can be assured that He has all the answers you need.

""Press aggressively"" into a new life. Not everything in your life is over; just one part of it has ended. One season has passed, and another can now begin if you are willing to take action. Don‚Äôt just passively sit and wait for something to happen or someone to come along. Go make new friends. Find someone else who is lonely and be a friend to that individual. You will reap what you sow, and God will return that friendship many times over.
    

¬†
Let the loneliness you feel turn into compassion for other lonely people and then decide to do something about it!¬†

¬†Then He was praying in a certain place; and when He stopped, one of His disciples said to Him, Lord, teach us to pray‚Ä¶.‚ÄîLuke 11:1¬†
¬†¬†¬†¬†If we are going to spend time in prayer, we want to be certain that our time is well spent, that our prayers are effective, and that we are praying prayers God can answer. We also want to enjoy our prayer time.¬†
¬†¬†¬†¬†A successful prayer life is not developed overnight nor can it be copied from someone else. God has a personal plan for each of us. We cannot always do what someone else is doing and expect it to work for us. Our prayer life is progressive. It progresses as we progress, so be patient!¬†
¬†¬†¬†¬†Often our prayers are too vague, meaning they are not clearly expressed. When you pray, be clear with the Lord. Pray boldly, expectantly, specifically. Your heavenly Father loves you, so don‚Äôt be afraid to be bold in prayer. The writer of Hebrews says that we are to come fearlessly, confidently, and boldly to the throne of grace. (Hebrews 4:16.)¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†If you need help with your prayer life, be honest with God. Tell Him your needs. He will help you if you ask Him to do so. Begin to say, ""Lord, teach me to pray.""¬†
Do This:¬†
¬†¬†¬†¬†Your prayer life should be enjoyable, powerful, and effective. If it‚Äôs not, ask the Lord to teach you how to pray.

THank you lord for all the glory you possess in my life, please let me do your will today. allow me to be a leader not a attacker of the cross.

Perfect Love Casts Out Fear
by Joyce Meyer 
There is no fear, in love [dread does not exist], but full-grown (complete, Perfect) love turns fear out of doors and expels every trace of terror! For fear brings with it the thought of punishment, and [so] he who is afraid has not reached the full maturity of love [is not yet grown into Love‚Äôs complete perfection]. ‚Äî1 John 4:18 
In years past, when I read this scripture, I misunderstood its meaning. I thought it was saying that if I could reach the place where I walked in perfect love towards other people, I would no longer experience fear in my own life. I diligently tried to love others, but it seemed like I always fail. I could not even love them imperfectly, let alone perfectly! 
I had a lot of fear in my life‚Äîfear that manifested in insecurity and mental torment of every kind. A person, who is fearful, worries. He is anxious about many things. The past, the future, finances, what people think, etc., these are his constant companions, which literally bring torment. The King James version of I John 4:18 certainly describes fear accurately when it says that, ""fear hath torment."" 
There are many evil spirits that Satan uses to make people miserable, but I personally believe that fear is the master spirit. Fear seems to be the root of most of the problems that steal our peace. For example, if we find ourselves uncomfortable in a group of people, it is usually because we fear what they think of us. If we are trying to control a situation and it is causing us to get into strife, it is often because we are afraid that we will be taken advantage of, if we don‚Äôt control everything. 
THE CONTROL ISSUE 
Trying to control people, circumstances, and even God is a hard task. As a matter of fact, it is impossible. Out of fear, I spent many years trying to control everything and everyone. I was fearful of being hurt or taken advantage of, as I had been in the past. I had not yet learned about ""perfect love that casts out fear."" I was busy being in charge of everything‚Äîbeing the great choir director of my life. The Holy Spirit wants to guide, direct, and control us. If we allow Him, He will direct us into great blessings for our lives. We are to operate in self-control and give the Holy Spirit control of our lives, but we should never try to control other people. Satan uses manipulation and control to get his way, but these are not the methods that God‚Äôs children should use to get what they desire. 
We are to trust God, pray about what we want, and believe that He will do the best for us at the right time. This is difficult to learn because all too often our experience with people teaches us not to trust. We must learn that people and God are not alike. All people are imperfect‚Äîand even those who try not to hurt others, occasionally do. How can imperfect people love us with perfect love? If they could, we would have no fear. Our fears concerning people‚Äîbeing hurt and disappointed by them, would be ended. 
Because the emotional pain of rejection, judgment, betrayal, criticism, etc. is very real and devastating, we naturally avoid it once we have experienced it. It seems that people fall into one of two categories, they either withdraw in fear and live lonely lives where they avoid close relationships, or they do what I once did. They want to have relationships, but they can never really develop proper ones because of all their fears. 
They end up controlling, manipulating, and being angry a lot. In general, their lives are frustrating, because much of the time, they truly don‚Äôt know what is wrong. They are reacting out of old wounds rather than acting on the truth of God‚Äôs Word. 
THE CURE FOR THE INSECURE 
Insecurity is said to be an epidemic in today‚Äôs society. There are so many insecure people trying to have relationships with other insecure people. We find a very high percentage of this kind of relationship, which the world calls dysfunctional. This simply means they are not functioning properly. 
Most people are raised in dysfunctional homes. They go out into society and continue the dysfunction, and each generation adds to the last one‚Äôs problems until society becomes increasingly more dysfunctional. There is, however, an answer. His name is Jesus Christ. 
When Jesus said in John 14:6, ‚Ä¶I am the Way‚Ä¶, He not only meant that He was the Way to the Father and the Way to heaven, but I believe He also meant that He was the Way out of every wrong and messed-up situation. 
If invited, Jesus can get into the middle of dysfunctional lives and make them functional again. He restores, renews, redeems, reconciles, and refreshes. Jesus is ""re"" everything. The prefix ""re"" means ""to go back again, or to return to the starting place"". Our heavenly Father, through Jesus Christ, intends to get us back to the place, where Satan messed things up, and to give us a new beginning. 
If we repent, He removes the reproach of the past, gives us a full recompense for our past hurts. Yes, Jesus is the only Way. 
Why should Jesus help us in this manner? He does it because He is love‚Äîbecause He loves us. He is God‚Äôs love gift to us. Jesus is the manifestation of Perfect Love. Only Perfect Love can cast out fear. One thing, we need to concentrate on and seek God for, is a revelation about the love He has extended towards us. 
Very few people have a deep and abiding revelation concerning the love of God. I believe God wants me to tell you that He loves you very much. That may sound simple, but it is the most powerful thing you can believe. When we know (without doubt) the perfect, complete love that God has for us, it will cause fear to lose its grip on our lives. 
LEARNING TO ABIDE IN HIS LOVE 
The word, abide means ""to dwell in or live"". It does not refer to ""visiting"". It refers to staying or remaining. I don‚Äôt visit my house; I live in it. We should learn to live in the love of God. I John 4:16 in the Amplified translation brings out the point that we should become conscious and aware of the love God has for us. The knowledge of His love should not be some biblical fact to which we mentally assent, but it should be a daily living reality in our lives. This scripture says we should observe it and experience it. 
And we know (understand, recognize, are conscious of, by observation and by experience) and believe (adhere to and put faith in and rely on) the love God cherishes for us. God is love, and he who dwells and continues in God, God dwells and continues in him. (I John 4:16) 
I was so desperate for a revelation concerning the love of God, that several years ago I began to keep a journal of the things He did in my life that I believed to be a display of His love. No matter how small they were, I recorded them. This process helped me to become more conscious of His love. I
needed to dwell in God‚Äôs love because I needed a lot of healing. I was insecure and fearful, and I have found out that the love of God is the cure for the insecure. 
When people gave me things, I recorded it. When I was shown favor in situations, I recorded it. When God answered prayers and did things for me that I had requested, I recorded it. Many of the things I recorded seemed rather childish, but they were helping me become like the little child Jesus said we should be‚Äîa child who is trusting, humble, lowly, and loving. 
I believe God is showing His love for us daily in many different ways, but because we have not trained ourselves to be ""conscious of His love,"" we miss what He is doing. His love is there, but it is not a reality to us. Therefore, it does not benefit us, as it should. 
Paul‚Äôs prayer for the church, as recorded in the book of Ephesians, indicates how very important it is that we have a deep revelation concerning how much God loves us. Paul could have prayed for anything. He could have prayed for them to have power, to do miracles, to exercise authority over the devil. But Paul prayed for the church to be rooted deeply in God‚Äôs love. 
Paul knew that was the starting point‚Äîthe place from which every point starts‚Äîthe place from which everything else grows. Power, miracles, victory, authority are all based on our being secure in the fact that God loves us. 
May Christ through your faith [actually] dwell (settle down, abide, make His permanent home) in your hearts! May you be rooted deep in love and founded securely on love, that you may have the power and be strong to apprehend and grasp with all the saints [God‚Äôs devoted people, the experience of that love] what is the breadth and length and height and depth [of it]; [that you may really come] to know [practically, through experience for yourselves] the love of Christ, which far surpasses mere knowledge [without experience]; that you may be filled [through all your being] unto all the fullness of God [may have the richest measure of the divine Presence, and become a body wholly filled and flooded with God Himself]! ‚ÄîEphesians 3:17-19 
These scriptures make it clear that we need to experience His love‚Äînot just have head knowledge, but a deep revelation, and that the roots of our being should be ""securely"" planted in His love. 
THE FEAR OF LACK 
There are endless varieties of fear, but one of the tormenting fears that many people suffer from is the fear of lack. They fear that their needs will not be met‚Äîthat God will not come through in time. 
Hebrews 13:5-6 gives great comfort to those in this situation. Let your character or moral disposition be free from love of money [including greed, avarice, lust, and craving for earthly possessions] and be satisfied with your present [circumstances and with what you have]; for He [God] Himself has said, I will not in any way fail you nor give up nor leave you without support. [I will] not, [I will] not, [I will] not in any degree leave you helpless nor forsake nor let [you] down (relax My hold on you [Assuredly not!] 
So we take comfort and are encouraged and confidently and boldly say, The Lord is my Helper; I will not be seized with alarm [I will not fear or dread or be terrified]. What can man do to me? You may be in a situation right now that you have never been in before. You may be facing new responsibility that you don‚Äôt know how to handle. You may have needs that are beyond your resources, and the spirit of fear is attacking you and telling you that you are not going to make it. You may feel all alone in your situation, like nobody cares, but God cares about you! 
When God says in these scriptures to be satisfied with your present circumstances, He does not mean that you cannot desire change. But we should be content in Jesus, knowing that He has heard our prayers and believing that He will never fail us. We must learn how to enjoy where we are on the way to where we are going. 
God is a God of progress. He is never standing still. Even when it seems to us that absolutely nothing is happening in our lives, God is working behind the scene on things that He will manifest at exactly the right time. God is Life and life must flow, otherwise it is no longer life. Dead things stagnate and no longer move, but life is always moving, stirring, making progress. 
Beloved, God has a good plan for you, and He will manifest it right on time. Fear not, God is with you and He will never leave you nor forsake you. He will not leave you without support! If you need financial support, He will provide. If it is physical support you need, He will sustain you while you are waiting for your full manifestation of healing. If you need emotional support, He will comfort you with the kind of comfort that only the Holy Spirit can give. He will nourish you and bring you back to a place of strength in every area of your life. God is for you. He is not against you. Satan is against you, but God is for you. The greater One lives in you! 
LET NOTHING SEPARATE YOU FROM GOD‚ÄôS LOVE 
Romans 8:35-39 speaks to us about difficult times and how important it is not to allow them to separate us from God‚Äôs love. I have discovered over the years that His love sustains me in times of great trial and stress. During hard times, Satan works overtime trying to convince us that God does not love us‚Äîthat if He did, either we would not be in this situation, or He would have delivered us by now. 
I affirm out loud from my own mouth the truth that God does love me during these attacks of fear. I encourage you to say several times a day with authority, ""God loves me!"" Don‚Äôt allow the devil to steal this truth from you. 
Ephesians 6 speaks of wearing spiritual armor during demonic attacks. One piece of that armor is the belt of truth. The Amplified Bible states that we are to tighten the belt of truth during attack. That means the truths we have learned from God‚Äôs Word must be held onto tightly during trials. 
Let me close with these scriptures from Romans 8:35-39 and I pray that they will comfort you right now; Who shall ever separate us from Christ‚Äôs love? Shall suffering and affliction and tribulation? Or calamity and distress? Or persecution or hunger or destitution or peril or sword? Even as it is written, For Thy sake we are put to death all the day long; we are regarded and counted as sheep for the slaughter. Yet amid all these things we are more than conquerors and gain a surpassing victory through Him Who loved us. 
For I am persuaded beyond doubt (am sure) that neither death nor life, nor angels nor principalities, nor things impending and threatening nor things to come, nor powers, nor height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation will be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. ‚Äî Romans 8:38-39
As long as you refuse to let anything separate you from God‚Äôs love, you will have the victory.¬†

Overcoming Grief and Loneliness
by Joyce Meyer 
I am told that the number one problem facing people today is grief and loneliness. People encounter major losses in their lives; and sadly, many never get over them. When tragedy occurs and the hurt seems unbearable, Satan sees it as an opportunity to attempt to bring a family or an individual into permanent bondage. 
The death of a loved one, divorce, or the severing of a close relationship can bring grief; and most people go through a grieving process. The key to victory is to understand the difference between a normal, balanced ""grieving process"" and a spirit of grief that will try to attach itself to the hurting person. One helps the grieving person get better with the passing of time; the other causes him to get worse and sink deeper and deeper into the pit of despair. 
I believe that one of the reasons why people, especially Christians, get into bondage during these trying times is due to a lack of understanding about the ""grieving process."" The term simply describes a succession of events that may occur in a person‚Äôs life when something or someone that means a lot to them is suddenly no longer there. Obviously, all people do not experience the same things in the same degrees; but we do have emotions that can be wounded and bruised and must be healed. Healing is a process‚Äîunless God gives a miracle, which He does at times‚Äîbut more frequently, He walks His children through things step by step. 
Shock and denial are two of the first things a person may encounter when tragedy occurs. Actually, God uses these to protect us from devastation. To illustrate, consider an automobile‚Äôs shock absorbers. They are designed to cushion the vehicle from unexpected bumps in the road. Without them, it would fall apart from the violence of the blows it encounters during its travels. 
People are often the same way. We are traveling on the road of life, and most of us are not expecting bumps and potholes. Therefore, we are not ready for them when they suddenly show up. Our Holy Ghost-installed ""shock absorbers"" cushion the blow until we can readjust and adapt our thinking to accommodate the sudden change in the ride. Shock and denial are good if they are temporary; however, they become a major problem if people permanently refuse to face reality and to learn how to deal with them. 
The next thing people may (and often do) feel is anger‚Äîat themselves. They begin to think of things they wish they would or would not have done that might have made the situation better or prevented it. Satan wants us to live in regrets. Who is alive that would not say, ""I wish I hadn‚Äôt done that!"" or ""I wish I had done this""? Satan seeks to place blame; and it is intended to throw a person into a lifetime of guilt, condemnation, and self-hatred. 
The apostle Paul stated in Philippians 3:13, ‚Ä¶one thing I do [it is my one aspiration]: forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead. I like the phrase in the Amplified translation, ""straining."" This tells me that whenever I may have to ""press on"", there will be opposition from the enemy. 
Endings always bring new beginnings. Satan strives to keep us out of the new place that God has prepared. He wants to trap us in the past and causes us to live in permanent misery. Self-anger and self-blame will accomplish the devil‚Äôs purpose. 
People may also experience anger at the person who left them‚Äîeven if they died. My aunt told me that after my uncle died, she would sometimes beat his pillow at night and yell, ""Why did you leave me?"" Obviously, her intellect knew that he did not purposely leave her, but her emotions were speaking. We must realize that emotions have a voice; and when they are wounded, they may react like a wounded animal. Wounded animals can be quite dangerous, and so can wounded emotions be, if they are followed. 
The grieving person needs to be taught about this grieving process and some of the things he may experience. He must also be taught to place little or no value on his feelings‚Äîand not to follow them. For a person who has experienced a major loss, it is not the time to be making serious decisions nor the time to deal with other issues that may be anxiety producing or emotionally upsetting. 
Anger at God is quite common. People frequently ask, ""If God is good, all powerful, and full of love for us, why didn‚Äôt He stop the thing that caused the pain?"" Satan seeks to build a wall between God and the hurting person. He seizes the opportunity to say, ""God is not good, and He cannot be trusted."" However, we know that it is a lie. Satan is a liar and the father of lies. The truth is not in him according to the Word of God. 
Verses 12 and 13 of James 1 states, Blessed (happy, to be envied) is the man who is patient under trial and stands up under temptation, for when he has stood the test and been approved, he will receive [the victor‚Äôs] crown of life which God has promised to those who love Him. Let no one say when he is tempted, I am tempted from God; for God is incapable of being tempted by [what is] evil and He Himself tempts no one. And verse 17 says, Every good gift and every perfect (free, large, full) gift is from above; it comes down from the Father of all [that gives] light, in [the shining of] Whom there can be no variation [rising or setting] or shadow cast by His turning [as in an eclipse]. In other words, God is good; and He cannot be anything else. Furthermore, He is not one way one time and another way another time. He does not change. He is good, and that is the way He is. But what about the original question? Since God is good and all-powerful, why didn‚Äôt He stop this thing before it brought all the hurt and pain? 
To be very honest, these are questions for which we do not have completely sufficient answers. 
I Corinthians 13:12 says, ‚Ä¶Now I know in part (imperfectly)‚Ä¶ Trust always requires unanswered questions! 
We want answers to everything, but we must come to the place where we are satisfied to know the One who knows and place our trust in Him. Being mad at God is foolish because He is the only One who can bring the needed help and comfort to the grieving or bereaved person. 
Finally, people also get angry at the devil. This is normal and even good if the anger is properly expressed. The only way to repay the devil for hurt and devastation in our personal lives is to aggressively and vehemently do the works of Jesus. I receive much comfort and joy from Romans 12:21, ‚Ä¶overcome (master) evil with good. 
People experiencing tragedy often go through stages of emotions expressed as sobbing and hysteria. These may come and go when least expected. Even people who are normally quite unemotional
may experience a great deal of emotion during times of loss. 
In general, people are afraid of emotions; and an uncontrolled display of these emotions is even more fearful. I encourage you to ""fear not"" because it will pass. Good understanding and a lot of help from the Holy Spirit will bring you through this kind of situation. 
Confusion, disorientation, and fear are common. Depression and waves of overwhelming feelings are experienced by many, as well as, physical symptoms caused by the emotional stress, with which the wounded person is dealing. I believe the key word in these situations is balance. 
The Bible talks of how King David was feeling depressed, but he resisted it. He did not sink into it, nor get into the pit of despair. He described how he felt, but he made a decision not to live by his feelings (read Psalm 42:5-11 and Psalm 143). People have often confided to me their discouragement from being made to feel (by others) that they had insufficient faith when they go through experiences like this. 
I believe it often takes more faith to go through something victoriously than to be delivered from it. There are some that experience complete deliverance from grief after a great loss, but that does not happen to all people. There are others, and I might even say most of us, who go through very emotionally difficult times when tragic loss occurs. Those who are walking in faith come out of it, and they come out of it better than when they went in. 
In closing, let me say, ""Do not lose your hope!"" If you are hurting right now due to a loss in your life, I want to say to you that a new beginning is in front of you. You may go through some things that you will never understand, but you can trust God to work them out for your good. What Satan intends for your harm, God can turn around for your good!

I decided to write today because this weekend I had a loss in my family. One of my aunts that was in a nursing home after losing her husband passed away. The call came out of nowhere and I have been dealing with it slowly, and not lashing out or giving myself a reason to play the martyr. I would have done this in the past, and I am handling this in a adult rational way. I called my cousins and asked if there was anything I could do. I was told that since she didnt have much family and did not have any children this person has the power of attorney and they are awaiting her claiming power of attorney for the body. I have been thinking alot on this situation and I dont want to put anyone in that situation to have to make a decision as to what to do with me when god calls me home.I have been leaning on my faith and understanding that she is in a better place. Her husband passed away about two years ago as sudden it seems. I just want to be there for my family in whatever way that might be. A positive word, lending a hand however. I have prayed for my aunts soul and hope that was in the light. I just thought I would get on here and update on whats going on. I also have thought on people in my life that are sick, and those that arent around, I will be heading to west texas, she is going to be buried in odessa, and that area has some issues unclosed for me, so may be a opportunity for closure. This trip isnt about me though, so might have to wait‚Ä¶I just ask for prayer not only for my family ‚Ä¶but for me as well to lean on my lord for guidance, strength, and obediance during these times. In death we reflect on things that we take for granted daily I see. I have not had someone close to me pass since my grandma and it just kinda throws ya for a loop. Well, god has her and she is in a better place‚Ä¶.:) thank you jesus‚Ä¶.amen

I found this rap song on this cd I was listening to tonight. I never forget daily why im here anymore. I just read a story from my moms diary and thought wow‚Ä¶that is amazin the things that god does for us. All I have to do is look back at the things that he has brought me thru, the floods, the fire, the insecurities, and all that I still know is ahead. I no longer look for negativity to take me down or those that I care for. I know that some family members of mine are struggling with faith and love. I know that even in death we are continued to be shown love and grace. For so long this fire that beats in me I thought was a curse, but it has been a blessing no doubt. I feel god talk to me, to fill my heart with joy, with peace and with serentiy even in the times of struggle and darkness. I remember I used to get so scared that god would leave me when I couldnt feel him, I pray harder on those days!‚Ä¶he is there‚Ä¶always has been and my best friend is loyal and loves me unconditionally. I am so grateful that he chose my heart to save, that so many people saw a light in me that at times in my life I didnt think exhisted. With their faith came my own resurrection from the ashes as joycemeyers states. Beauty from ashes‚Ä¶..My lord has restored me to sanity, to be able to give him my will and my life, to believe in the unseen, to always know that it is a gift to be here ‚Ä¶.not the end stop ‚Ä¶just a boarding place‚Ä¶lord, you restore me‚Ä¶.you love me so much‚Ä¶.you gave your son‚Ä¶.you come in the world in the smile of a child, the innocence of a flower that blows in the wind, in the eyes of someone that is shut off from the light, it is our job to plant the seed and move on‚Ä¶and let god to water it , nurture it‚Ä¶.and sit back and watch it grow‚Ä¶not in amazement but in knowing it would happen in his time not ours‚Ä¶I cant wait to stare in the eyes of my children to show them the love that has been bestowed on me, to teach them the most important person in their lives is the lord‚Ä¶..to gain a relationship with ""my best friend"". Thank you jesus and watch over those that dont know I still have them in my heart and thoughts, keep their hearts strong in the moments of weak moments‚Ä¶i too stand her because the lord gave his only son for my rebirth‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.a price i can never repay but im willing to give him my soul for eternity‚Ä¶.love you ‚Ä¶your son‚Ä¶martin

Who am I, that the Lord of all the earth Would care to know my name Would care to feel my hurt Who am I, that the Bright and Morning Star Would choose to light the way For my ever wandering heart 
Not because of who I am But because of what You‚Äôve done Not because of what I‚Äôve done But because of who You‚Äôre 
I am a flower quickly fading Here today and gone tomorrow A wave tossed in the ocean A vapor in the wind Still You hear me when I‚Äôm calling Lord, You catch me when I‚Äôm falling And You‚Äôve told me who I am I am Yours, I am Yours 
Who Am I, that the eyes that see my sin Would look on me with love and watch me rise again Who Am I, that the voice that calmed the sea Would call out through the rain And calm the storm in me 
I am Yours Whom shall I fear Whom shall I fear ‚ÄòCause I am Yours I am Yours 
¬†
¬†
I picked these words because I still at times ask who am i lord? who am i to deserve your love and glory. I understand that all in my life has led me to where I am. I get the opportunity daily to guide and plant seeds. Like it talks about the flower quickly fading, if you have ever watched a flower wilt, it dies gracefully‚Ä¶.then its gone. I have been thinking about the ""good things‚Äô in my life that I have just been so careless with, and tried to control and have a burdening factor on. I have a understanding that in love we must detach to those that ""arent ready"" or at the level we may be at. In pushing it so fast we tend to over burden the person and they shut down and go back into their shell. I had this happen in my early experiences with christ. I have a loving adopted mother who gave me all her precious heart had and I couldnt get it fast enuff until she walked away but still held me dearly in her heart I know because I can still feel it. She is going thru some health issues, and I keep her close to my heart now to know that the lord has her and faith shal make her well. This person taught me so much, it was my own stubborness and anger and resentments that kept all the goodness she saw from coming in. I fought it, and fought it, and fought it. She saw the beautiful child of god that I am, not the dirty guilt ridden shameful person I saw. I am ridding myself of guilt and shame. I love my self today, I just want to give it back so much, because I understand that alot of times as addicts we dont see ourselves in the light others do. It takes our own journey to find ourselves our feelings, and our own path. In time we may never know what happens to these people, but no one ever crosses our path without a opportuinity to plant a seed. I must be grateful and thankful you chose me, to be the one to guide. I can not be selfish or arrogant or rude. I had to take this journey at a slow pace so why should I ever think my clients or anyone that I run into will instantly get it by the intensity I give it. I am not god. NO way am I. I am just a precious child of the creator that loves and gives today. To be a person that shows the world that it can be lived , if you just find your own recovery and faith. I have faith that in all that we struggle in, and say in the midst of anger and pain, our heart never forgets the moments that were unspoken. I am wiping myself off today because I have been in the mudd keeping others from going under while myself being taken under as well. God help those that cant help themselves without you leading the way. I have faith and hope and love that YOU will be the one that takes the pain, the confusion, and the lost feeling away and replace it with your love and glory. I am so proud to be called your son‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.daddy here I am‚Ä¶..I am YOURS>

Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of God, as we understood Him.‚ÄìStep Three of Al-Anon
Surrendering to a Power greater than ourselves is how we become empowered.
We become empowered in a new, better, more effective way than we believed possible.
Doors open. Windows open. Possibilities occur. Our energy becomes channeled, at last, in areas and ways that work for us. We become in tune with the Plan for our life and our place in the Universe.
And there is a Plan and Place for us. We shall see that. We shall know that. The Universe will open up and make a special place for us, with all that we need provided.
It will be good. Understand that it is good, now.
Learning to own our power will come, if we are open to it. We do not need to stop at powerlessness and helplessness. That is a temporary place where we re-evaluate where we have been trying to have power when we have none.
Once we surrender, it is time to become empowered.
Let the power come, naturally. It is there. It is ours.
Today, I will be open to understanding what it means to own my power. I will accept powerlessness where I have no power; I will also accept the power that is mine to receive.

Before the rain stops we hear a bird. Even under the heavy snow we see snowdrops and some new growth.‚ÄìShunryu Suzuki
The signals that new growth is underway are often very small at first. It‚Äôs sometimes discouraging when we are trying to remake our lives and all we can see for our efforts is minor growth. That is how the natural world works, and we are part of this world. When the little sprouts of growth first develop under the snow in spring we don‚Äôt even see them unless we search. Yet, they signal the beginnings of a total transformation. Time will bring vast changes, but only little signs are showing first.
Today, we may search for signs of progress in our lives. The little things we see may signal bigger transformations yet to come. To be true to them in the long run we must accept them ‚Äì even welcome them ‚Äì as they are today.
I will notice the subtle movements toward health and renewal in my life. Welcoming them will encourage them.

Laughter by definition is healthy.‚ÄìDoris Lessing
A hearty laugh can warm a cold room and make our spirits soar. But many of us are afraid to laugh, especially when we make mistakes. We think we‚Äôre supposed to be perfect, and we don‚Äôt allow ourselves to make mistakes. However, we‚Äôre not a mold punched out by a machine. We‚Äôre human beings, with all our wonderful flaws. It is those flaws that make our lives interesting and surprising. Who knows when we might accidentally bump into a chair or catch our sweater on a doorknob? We needn‚Äôt feel self-conscious, it happens to many of us.
The ability to laugh at ourselves is a gift from God. All we need to do is grab it and use it. Then we will see how healthy and powerful laughter can be.
Can I find the humor in my mistakes today? 
¬†
I was thinking today with all that I have read on and heard about addiction that god is the only way my mind goes even half calm.I have been sick the last couple days and my mind has been racing and running and making all kinds of creations. this guy said it best‚Ä¶..i have to just shut up and read and reflect‚Ä¶
 
Old problems are much more comfortable than new solutions. But always keep in mind, that life begins on the edge of your comfort zone.
Trust and listen to your intuition. If you listen to your mind, you will hear only the same old crap it‚Äôs been spewing for years. Unless you heal your past, your life, and recover from the abuse (self-inflicted and other-inflicted) your mind will not be your friend. Listen to your heart. Go with the flow.
According to A Course in Miracles, we come from either a place of fear or a place of love. From a place of love, we can do no wrong. From a place of fear, every action is a mistake. Fill your heart with love and you will surpass even your highest expectations.

Repeat Chorus 
You can pour your soul out singing a song you believe in that tomorrow they‚Äôll forget you ever sang Sing it anyway, sing it anyway 
I sing, I dream, I love, anyway,_________________________________________________________________________________________Do It Afraid!
by Joyce Meyer 
Fear! Has it ever been a problem for you‚Ä¶holding you back from moving into areas that could enrich your own life and the lives of others? There is a solution. 
One of the many benefits available to Christians is freedom from fear. When we avoid making changes or confronting issues in our lives because of fear or dread, we need to remember that God has promised to go before us and bring us through victoriously as we obey Him. 
When we are facing a job interview, for example, instead of being afraid that we will make a bad impression and fail to get the position, we need to ask God to prepare the heart and mind of the interviewer and help us to present ourselves in the very best light. When God ""prepares the way,"" we can trust that whatever happens will turn out for our good according to His perfect plan for us. 
The Bible tells of a man named Abram who trusted God in spite of his own personal fear. Now‚Ä¶ the Lord said to Abram, Go for yourself [for your own advantage] away from your country, from your relatives and your father‚Äôs house, to the land that I will show you (Genesis 12:1). 
How would you feel if God told you to leave your home, your family, and everything that is familiar and comfortable and head out to an unknown destination? Full of fear? That is precisely the challenge Abram faced‚Äîand it frightened him. But God‚Äôs words to him were ""Fear not."" It is the same message He gave to Joshua when He called him to lead the children of Israel to take the land He had promised to give them as their inheritance (see Joshua 1:6-9). And to all who set out to follow God‚Äôs plan today, He says, ""Fear not."" 
Elisabeth Elliot, whose husband was killed along with four other missionaries in Ecuador, tells that her life was completely controlled by fear. Every time she started to step out to minister, fear stopped her. Then a friend told her something that set her free. Her friend said, ""Why don‚Äôt you do it afraid?"" Elisabeth listened and took that advice. Together with Rachel Saint, the sister of one of the murdered missionaries, they went on to evangelize the Indian tribes of Ecuador, including the very people who had killed their loved ones. 
Many times we think we should wait to do something until we are no longer afraid. But if we did that, we would probably accomplish very little for God, for others, or even for ourselves. Both Abram and Joshua had to step out in faith and obedience to God and do what He had commanded them to do‚Äîeven though they were afraid. 
I believe the words fear not simply mean ""don‚Äôt run."" So the solution to fear is simple‚Äîrather than bowing our knee and giving in to it, we must stand firm against it, knowing that God has gone before us and prepared the way. 
That is precisely what God wants us to do. Even if our mouth is dry and our knees are shaking, we need to keep asking God to strengthen us. We need to determine that our lives are not going to be ruled by fear but by the Word of God. 
As we saw before in Genesis, God gave Abram a tall order. He said, ""Pack up and leave everyone you know and everything you are comfortable with and go to a place I will show you."" If Abram had bowed his knee to fear, he never would have fulfilled his destiny to become all God created him to be‚Äîthe father of many nations. 
In the same way, if Joshua had not overcome his fear and been obedient to God‚Äôs command to lead His people into the Promised Land, they never would have enjoyed all that God had prepared for them. 
Giving in to fear alters God‚Äôs best plan for your life. So use the power of God‚Äôs Word to do what He wants you to do‚Ä¶even if you have to do it afraid! The rewards are great.¬†¬†

WOw‚Ä¶.great stuff there. The first is martina mcbrides new song ‚Ä¶I just listen to those words in the event that I dont have it in me to do it anyway. Sometimes in recovery we procrstinate and wait and wait for something to get better or change, while on the inside we continue to deminish hope and faith. We hang on to people, places,things for all the wrong reasons because in our minds we think we know more then our creator. We get angry and we get torn we think that at times we just should walk away and give up‚Ä¶but its because we havent listened to him or the signs he has given us. We stare the answer in the face and often are given the opportunities to change our lives and balk or just ""one more time"" this will be different. That is the insanity that is discussed in the unmanageable part of step one. Powerless over our own will and thoughts to do the next right thing out of fear and regret and anger of being in a place that isnt a comfort zone. I have been there and at times it is damn near impossible to get out of self and allow god to lead and guide even if you know every great reason too‚Ä¶.pride kills‚Ä¶has killed me for years. I play the pity card when i step out of comfort and try something new and it ends badly or not in my favor, well it was poor pitiful me, when the lesson is often overlooked. I know in my heart that nothing happens in gods world by mistake. NOTHING. The signs we are given the words we are handed, we overlook because how could it possibly be this easy? and if it is‚Ä¶do i deserve it? we often times hold on to stubborness because we are scared and arent totally being honest with ourselves and will continue to harm ourselves and others around us til the day comes‚Ä¶.when its do or die‚Ä¶and the will to live must be more then the will to die completely. I have been there and victim has been a role i milked and milked‚Ä¶til you know what the cow died. ‚Ä¶the pasture burnt up‚Ä¶.my lips fell off‚Ä¶..and i was ""made"" to do it only relying on god and what I had learned. Living life on lifes terms. Oh a lesson that can not be taught, but only experienced. I know life is difficult, but selfishness and self centeredness kill everything in our path, and we dont even real
ize it til we are on our own death bed, asking god why? why? was this the life you chose for me‚Ä¶..but wait a minute‚Ä¶we choose‚Ä¶..he claimed our life to be abundantly‚Ä¶well in my pain and self pity i thought partying was living life abundantly. I didnt care who i tore up or went thru to get what I wanted. I lied stole, cheaated, and would have done anything to keep from facing consequences. well, we all face them, and when we must get to that point in life.,it is better to just go thru it with support of a higher power, and a support group that doesnt judge but supports. I made all freaking types of excuses to not be sober, to not be sane. Well, thats why at times it hurts deep all that i pushed away. I will never forget that. , but dont choose to dwell on it either.

Taking Care of Ourselves
We cannot simultaneously set a boundary and take care of another person‚Äôs feelings. It‚Äôs impossible; the two acts contradict.
What a tremendous asset to have compassion for others! How difficult that same quality can make it to set boundaries!
It‚Äôs good to care about other people and their feelings; it‚Äôs essential to care about ourselves too. Sometimes, to take good care of ourselves, we need to make a choice.
Some of us live with a deeply ingrained message from our family, or from church, about never hurting other people‚Äôs feelings. We can replace that message with a new one; one that says it‚Äôs not okay to hurt ourselves. Sometimes, when we take care of ourselves, others will react with hurt feelings.
That‚Äôs okay. We will learn, grow, and benefit by the experience; they will too. The most powerful and positive impact we can have on other people is accomplished by taking responsibility for ourselves, and allows others to be responsible for themselves.
Caring works. Caretaking doesnt. We can learn to walk the line between the two.
Today, I will set the limits I need to set. I will let go of my need to take care of other peoples feelings and instead take care of my own. I will give myself permission to take care of myself, knowing its the best thing I can do for others and myself.

We all wear masks, and the time comes when we cannot remove them without removing some of our own shin.‚ÄìAndre Berthiaume
The masks men wear are as varied as those who wear them, but their purpose is quite simple. We wear masks to hide our real faces from those around us and even from ourselves. There are seductive masks, innocent masks, white knight masks, tough guy masks, black sheep masks, lone wolf masks, and many more. Sometimes we want to take on another identity so others won‚Äôt see our insecurities. Or we think taking the form of someone else will give us power over others, or they will like us better, or we can escape ourselves.
The cost of wearing a mask is not getting a chance to develop our real personalities. What masks are we attached to? Are we willing to give them up in the interest of our spiritual growth?
May I have the courage to drop my phony masks in order to grow stronger in self-knowledge.

Codependency 
For well over four years we have advertised at this site for someone willing to help write an article on codependency. We got around a dozen responses, but that was it: just an initial response and then nothing.
Symptoms of Codependency include overextending oneself and difficulty in following a project through. So, it soon became apparent that while we were going to get responses, we weren‚Äôt really going to find anyone to help write this. We would have to do it alone.
So, here goes:
Codependency is a terrible term. It has endless connotations that have nothing to do with the disorder. Codependency itself is such a broad dysfunction that it is extremely hard to define in concise terms. However, one therapist and friend summed up the condition thus: ""I only wanted to be loved."" Another simple definition that works is, ""Codependency is a dysfunctional relationship with the self.""
Codependency is habitual behaviors that are ultimately self-destructive. Almost everyone (at times) has symptoms of codependency. No one escapes.
Codependent behaviors can be stopped. Therapists, books, support groups, and constant and careful self-monitoring will help. In the end, healing from codependency is ultimately up to the individual.
The following are a list of symptoms. Few have them all, some have a few, and many symptoms are contradictory, but that is the irony of Codependency. For more symptoms you can click here and visit another site on the web.

Symptoms

Care taking: the codependent individual feels responsible for other people. S/He feels anxious and even guilty when another has a problem. S/He feels compelled to help that person solve their problem. S/He anticipates the other‚Äôs needs and feels angry when his help is not effective or rebuffed. At the same time, the codependent feels slighted that others won‚Äôt help her/him out when s/he needs help. However, this same individual who is constantly doing way too much for others, and not getting ""any"" help from anyone, will usually answer when asked what is wrong or what do you need, responds, ""Oh, nothing."" The codependent minimizes his/her own worth. The codependent is his/her own worst enemy.
The codependent is over committed, harried, pressured, feels safe when giving, but insecure when someone gives to him/her, goes out of her/his way to help others, and believes deep inside that other people are responsible for the way they are and will blame others for the ""spot"" they are in. Others make them feel the way they feel, they are victimized, angry, unappreciated, and used. Others are driving them crazy.
Low Self Worth: codependents tend to come from troubled, dysfunctional families, and will deny this to the very end. They blame themselves for their family‚Äôs shortcomings. They blame themselves for everything. They pick on themselves constantly: not intelligent enough, not pretty enough, not smart enough, not athletic enough, not good enough. But if another criticizes them, boy do they get defensive and angry, not to mention self-righteous. Don‚Äôt try to give a codependent a compliment; they reject all compliments and praise, even though they get depressed from lack of compliments and praise. They feel ""different"" from the rest of the world. They reject themselves, but fear rejection. Everything is taken personally, they love being the victim (though will deny it with their last breath). They have been victims of sexual, physical, or emotional abuse, abandonment, neglect, and/or alcoholism. They feel like victims, carry lots of guilt and shame, and think their lives are not worth living. They should have done this, should have done that. They ""should"" themselves to death. Codependents say, ""Why me?"" on the outside, and know ""why me"" on the inside. While trying to prove to others that they are good enough, to themselves they are worthless and empty.
Repression: most codependents repress their own needs, their own desires. They are afraid to let themselves be who they are and often appear rigid and controlled. They repress all thoughts of self worth out of their awareness and they are full of guilt. Codependents cannot have fun.
Obsessive Compulsive Disorder: codependents worry. They worry about the slightest and silliest things: they worry that people are talking about them; they worry that people are not talking about them; they lose sleep over little things; they check up on others; they try to catch people in the act; they never find any answers, they focus on other‚Äôs problems; they spend money compulsively; eat or drink compulsively; and wonder why they have no energy and why they never get anything done.
Controlling Behaviors: codependents try to control events and people through helplessness, guilt, coercion, threats, advice-giving, manipulation, or domination. They are afraid to let people be who they are or let events happen naturally. They‚Äôve lived in so many situations in which they had no control (abuse, alcoholism, etc) that they now try to control everything and get frustrated and angry when they cannot. They end up feeling controlled by events. They feel controlled by others. They resist change as if change were a contagion.
Denial: codependents ignore problems or pretend they do not exist. They pretend things are not as bad as they are; they tell themselves it will get better; they stay busy to avoid thinking about things; they get confused, sick, depressed and visit doctors for a prescription. Many are workaholics. They lie to themselves and others. They believe their lies. And most of all, codependents will leave a healthy situation (by lying to themselves that it was an unhealthy situation) and get back into an unhealthy situation; though for the most part, most codependents either never leave an unhealthy situation/relationship, or they go from one unhealthy situation/relationship to another.
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size
=‚Äù3‚Ä≥>Dependency: codependents do not feel happy or content with themselves. They look to others to supply them their happiness or their needs. They are threatened by the loss of anything or any person that provides them with their happiness. They do NOT love themselves. They did not feel loved by their parents. They equate love with pain and believe others are never, ever there for them. They need people more than they want them; their lives revolve around someone else‚Äôs life; they tolerate abuse; feel trapped; leave one bad relationship and jump into another bad relationship. They wonder if they will ever find true love. And if they do find true love, they will leave that and find a loveless relationship because deep inside (often beneath consciousness) they feel unworthy of love.
Poor Communication Skills: codependents blame, threaten, coerce, beg, bribe, and advise others. They don‚Äôt mean what they say and don‚Äôt say what they mean. They don‚Äôt take themselves seriously and expect others to do the same. They avoid getting to the point, asking indirectly for attention by sighing, crying, or moping around. They say everything is their fault. They say nothing is their fault. They can‚Äôt get to the point, and if pressed, they‚Äôre not sure what the point really is. They believe their opinions do not matter and have difficulties asserting their rights or expressing honest emotions, openly and appropriately. They apologize for bothering people.
Poor Boundaries: codependents say they won‚Äôt tolerate something from anyone, and then engage themselves in exactly that. Then they gradually increase their tolerance levels till they can tolerate most anything others do to them. They allow others to hurt them, over and over and over again. They stay in bad relationships for all the wrong reasons: to fix the other; for the kids (like kids need to grow up in a loveless relationship); because things will get better; and worst of all: because they feel they deserve to live in hell. They complain and blame but far too many never get away from their abuser. Then they finally get angry and become totally intolerant and the cycle begins all over again. (For a list of unhealthy boundaries from Recovery.org, click here.)
Lack of Trust: codependents do not trust themselves, their feelings, their decisions, other people, or even God. And then, right out of the blue, they‚Äôll trust someone who is totally untrustworthy.
Sexual Problems: codependents go through cycles in the bedroom. They are caretakers there too. They have sex when they don‚Äôt want to or withdraw sex to punish their partner. They try to have sex when they are hurt or angry, and refuse to enjoy it. They withdraw emotionally from their partner, feel revulsion toward their partner, and don‚Äôt want to talk about it. They reduce sex to a technical act, wonder why they don‚Äôt enjoy it; lose interest; make up reasons to abstain, wish their partner would die, go away, or guess what is wrong with them; they have strong sexual fantasies about others and consider having affairs.
General: codependents can be extremely responsible or irresponsible, they become martyrs, sacrificing their own happiness. They find it difficult to be happy, feel close to others, or have fun and be spontaneous. They are passive aggressive, feeling passive, hurt, helpless yet violent and angry. They laugh when they want to cry. They are ashamed of their families, of their relationships. They cover up, lie, and protect their family from their problems. They don‚Äôt seek help because they don‚Äôt feel the problem is all that bad. And then they wonder why the problems never go away.

From Bad to Worse

Progressively, if the codependent does not get help, the symptoms above just get worse. The codependent becomes lethargic and depressed and eventually withdraw and isolate themselves. Their daily routine falls by the wayside. They abuse or neglect the people who depend on them, mostly, their children. They feel utterly hopeless and initiate plans to escape. They contemplate suicide. They become violent, or seriously mentally or physically ill. They develop an eating (drinking or drug) disorder.

Summary

Not all codependents have all of the above symptoms. If you have just 20% of the above symptoms, you can consider yourself a codependent. If you have 5 to 10% of the above symptoms, you are normal. Normal people are, at times, codependent. Even normal people can use a bit of therapy, a bit of healing.
We are all, in many ways, self-destructive. None of us came from the Cleaver Family, Father does not know best, and our mothers were never as perfect as Donna Reed.
The worst thing about being codependent is that the codependent wastes her/his life. The next worst thing about being codependent is we pass it on to our children, and in them, our symptoms are hugely magnified.

Origins
The one question is how did we get this way?
Prolonged exposure to oppression is the key here. As Earnie Larson states in his books and lectures (I‚Äôm paraphrasing here): ""What we live with we learn; what we learn we practice; what we practice becomes habit; our habits have consequences.""
All of these behaviors are ""learned."" They can be unlearned.
Everything boils down to this: we have little self worth; our happiness is found outside of ourselves.
However, Earnie Larson has one more wonderful phrase that really sums up the codependent‚Äôs situation or dilemma: ""If nothing changes, nothing changes.""
We, the codependent, must DO something to initiate healing. It won‚Äôt come from outside. It just doesn‚Äôt happen. If nothing changes, nothing changes.

Healing Codependency

Most
people do not heal their codependency on their own. Let us face it, with all these symptoms flaring up, especially the denial, who could possibly see a way out?
Most codependents are slapped upside the head by a friend: ""Hey, you need help!""
We do need help. We need the experience of others who have broken the cycles. We need a good therapist to help us see the light. We need friends who are open and honest with us. We need to sit and read a bit about ourselves, our problems, and the way out. Most of all, we need to know that we can be healed. This is NOT a permanent situation. But each person has to recognize the problem, admit to it, and then find the tools to help end it.
The first and most important thing for a codependent to learn is that Happiness is inside of us, not something outside. A good relationship is good, not because of the person we love, but because of the person we are. One person does not a relationship make.
Healing codependency is often referred to as ""shifting our relationship with ourselves."" Codependents must learn to accept their powerlessness over people and events. Recovery for a codependent is like recovery from alcohol or drug addiction and the same 12-step model is oftentimes employed: Let Go. Let God.
The codependent must sometimes ""fire"" the people in their lives. If they are not willing to work through their issues, then we have to ""fire"" them and move on ourselves. But we must keep in mind that this is about us, not them. Recovery means learning to take responsibility for our own actions, issues, feelings, behaviors, and our lives.
Recovery is not easy. Letting go of the need to control people, places, events is not easy. It is highly recommended to find a Codependent Anonymous (CoDA) group and attend regularly. Meetings, therapy, talking to fellow codependents, and reading and just plain being aware of our feelings and thoughts will ultimately set us free from our self-defeating patterns; from our fear and shame. Letting go of caretaking and all the energy expended in that fulltime effort frees up our energies to more constructive things. Below are links to more information, a place to locate a CoDA meeting, and further reading.
But finally know this: Your author has been through his own bouts with codependency. Hardly any of us are untouched by this. Healing is not only possible, it is wonderfully exhilarating. Once we step out of our destructive patterns, anything is possible. In a letter to a friend once, I wrote the following that I want to share with you.

Old problems are much more comfortable than new solutions. But always keep in mind, that life begins on the edge of your comfort zone.
Trust and listen to your intuition. If you listen to your mind, you will hear only the same old crap it‚Äôs been spewing for years. Unless you heal your past, your life, and recover from the abuse (self-inflicted and other-inflicted) your mind will not be your friend. Listen to your heart. Go with the flow.
According to 
¬†
A Course in Miracles, we come from either a place of fear or a place of love. From a place of love, we can do no wrong. From a place of fear, every action is a mistake. Fill your heart with love and you will surpass even your highest expectations.

Each man with a new idea is a crank until the idea succeeds.‚ÄìMark Twain
What does it mean to be different? How does it feel? Is it okay to act or look or be different from everyone else at times? Sometimes, maybe even most of the time, it feels safer to blend into the crowd. We don‚Äôt want to stick out like a sore thumb. But sometimes it‚Äôs when we are different that we discover new things no one has ever thought of or done before.
We don‚Äôt want to spend our whole lives doing only what others do. And there are times when we must take a stand if what others are doing is wrong. Perhaps it‚Äôs good practice to try to do some little thing differently once in a while, to stand out from the crowd, just to get used to it. We might even like it. After all, if no one ever dares to be different, how would our world ever change for the better?
What little thing can I do to stand out from the crowd today? 
Trusting Ourselves
Trust can be one of the most confusing concepts in recovery. Who do we trust? For what?
The most important trust issue we face is learning to trust ourselves. The most detrimental thing that‚Äôs happened to us is that we came to believe we couldn‚Äôt trust ourselves.
There will be some who tell us we cannot trust ourselves; we are off base and out of whack. There are those who would benefit by our mistrusting ourselves.
Fear and doubt are our enemies. Panic is our enemy. Confusion is our opposition.
Self-trust is a healing gift we can give ourselves. How do we acquire it? We learn it. What do we do about our mistakes, about those times we thought we could trust ourselves but were wrong? We accept them, and trust ourselves anyway.
We know what is best for us. We know what is right for us. If we are wrong, if we need to change our mind, we will be guided into that ‚Äì but only by trusting where we are today. 
We can look to others for support and reinforcement, but trust in ourselves is essential.
Do not trust fear. Do not trust panic. We can trust ourselves, stand in our own truth, and stand in our own light. We have it now. Already. We have all the light we need for today. And tomorrow‚Äôs light shall be given to us then.
Trust ourselves, and we will know whom to trust. Trust ourselves, and we will know what to do. When we feel we absolutely cannot trust ourselves, trust that God will guide us into truth.
God, help me let go of fear, doubt, and confusion ‚Äì the enemies of self-trust. Help me go forward in peace and confidence. Help me grow in trust for you, and myself one day at a time, one experience at a time. 
This above all, to refuse to be a victim. Unless I can do that I can do nothing.‚ÄìMargaret Atwood
Men have often become victims by seeing themselves as saviors. We forgot that we have needs too. We thought if we gave enough, our needs would eventually be met. In the process we became great controllers, not for the sake of power, but to make everything okay. We turn ourselves inside out to make our mates happy or to please our children or friends. But being a savior is a disrespectful role to play. When people became angry with us for it, we absorbed their anger and felt misunderstood.
No relationship is healthy for either person if one is a victim. We must do our loved ones the favor of letting them see our strength ‚Äì let them bump up against it ‚Äì even when that means we say a loud and strong no! After we have said no, our yes is much more believable.
Today, I will take responsibility/or my own life and try not to be a savior for others. I won‚Äôt undermine my relationships by being a victim.

Removing the Victim
Don‚Äôt others see how much I‚Äôm hurting? Can‚Äôt they see I need help? Don‚Äôt they care?
The issue is not whether others see or care. The issue is whether we see and care about ourselves. Often, when we are pointing a finger at others, waiting for them to have compassion for us, its because we have not fully accepted our pain. We have not yet reached that point of caring about ourselves. We are hoping for awareness in another that we have not yet had.
It is our job to have compassion for ourselves. When we do, we have taken the first step toward removing ourselves as victims. We are on the way to self-responsibility, self-care, and change.
Today, I will not wait for others to see and care; I will take responsibility for being aware of my pain and problems, and caring about myself.

It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye.‚ÄìAntoine de Saint Exupery
It has been said that intuition is a talent of women, but in this program we, as men, are learning to listen to our own inner feelings. This is a strength, which has nothing to do with gender. Many times we have a quiet inner knowing of something, but in the past we developed insensitivity to these messages. Our growing self-respect includes the ability to stand up for what simply feels right. We don‚Äôt have to prove anything to ourselves. If we dismiss our own private feelings, all we have left to go on is someone else‚Äôs idea of reality.
This realm of inner feeling is the realm of wisdom. It is the creative part, the mysterious part, the spiritual part. It is the foundation of honesty with ourselves. In these quiet moments, we are more able to perceive what we know in our hearts. As we grow, we respect and trust it more.
Help me respect my private messages from within.

Good Morning father:
I am here at work doing the morning things that I do before my day starts, reading praying, and listening to be led. I have had a great week and not much has gone on. I feel gods presence in me. I am leaning on him for all, and it is becoming easier to do so. I fought it and at times still may be a lil stubborn but for the most part, I let go and let god. I have been doing alot of work on codependency and know that alot of what was killing me as well, was my need to not be able to love myself, and try to fill that void thru outside things, people, places, things. I have read alot of it lately and am starting to understand that I was and at times still very sick. This is at times more harmful then the addiction I suffer from as well. Knowledge is power and for a long time thought that if i ignored it it would go away with :new"" things in my life., but the miserble person I was ‚Ä¶I would use it and be bored and move on to something new. I never really had a connection to alot in my life, but a family saw in me the person I am becoming thru christ. They showered me with all the love they had, and then let the water drops of hope , love and faith soak in. I am cleaner in christ today, and at times i stumble and fall, but for the most part, i know where to go when my soul is happy or weak‚Ä¶.seek out salvation from above. Like the mirror thing above., i used to see such uglyness, in it, would hate to see my eyes down, my soul weak, and hurting, but you know we choose alot of times to keep the cycle going because it becomes a permanent fixture of our programming. I had to stop pretending, stop playing the game that I was losing at. I have stated in other entries that I have stole, have lied, have manipulated, and other things out of feeling so dirty that it was engulfing me and taking me to the flames. The devil has a knack for taking things and making them more appealing. I refuse today to listen to those voices, and pray and listen to the voice of truth. I used to ask my mom(susan) how do you hear god? i dont hear him. And she said when you are ready he will talk to you. I hear him now and i listen to what he says in my heart and mind will be. I have faith that even in my own self will with god leading it i can not go wrong. I have been back and forth for so many years, i refuse to be there today one sec at a time. Yesterday i felt my mind start to wander and go crazy‚Ä¶i layed my head on the bible and prayed‚Ä¶..and it went calm‚Ä¶my mind my soul and my being‚Ä¶Thank you so much father‚Ä¶.for my salvation and light‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶love you your son martin

I didnt really feel the way this song says‚Ä¶but I have before. I am sitting here deciding to jot down some feelings that I have had as of late. I have stayed away from this site because I dont know I just give up so easily on things when I view them as being a ""good"" thing. Well, I discussed this with barbara and she set me straight telling me that I need to get my stubborn butt to writing again even if i feel that I dont need it. Yesterday was easter and I wanted to go visit my mom, but made every excuse not to go. I didnt go with my brother back to west texas either just stayed isolated and free from issues as i thought in my head. Today I dont want to be around people that have issues either but unfortunately its MY Job. I have not been wanting to feel anything lately and I just dont know why that is. I just graduated my year mark with this job and got a raise also. I am still running it alone and the owner is impressed with my abilities. I still love to counsel, but like I talked about with my therapist its not any of this that is my downfall. My downfall is idle time and lonliness, because in my head I start rehashing crap from here to there and all over that usually doesnt make sense after it is written. That is one reason I am writing today to rid some of these insane thoughts. I wonder if ever I will find individuals that understand my insanity. I am still ashamed of it, still embarassed that I have racing thoughts, insane thoughts and actions. I no longer down play my situations or afflictions. I am crazy!. Oh well if that isnt progression I dont know what is. I once spoke on being sane and NO problems at all. I dont care anymore that I am not quote unquote normal‚Ä¶.alot of my stuff is re-enactment from the behaviors that were programmed as norml for me‚Ä¶oh well, just doing what the therapist suggested‚Ä¶if this is ramble and doesnt make sense‚Ä¶.hey imagine this in your head‚Ä¶going what the hell‚Ä¶.lol‚Ä¶oh well god bless‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.latar

I love this song;) heard it on my way to work one day and thought wow~! I know the last entry was kinda down and out. I just watched a video from my mom and put alot in perspective. The weight that I carry alot of times is put there by my own F.E.A.R. damn that! sick and tired of that self harm‚Ä¶I am codependent on the world for my wants needs and happiness, while I wither inside because I cant seem to satisfy this hunger that at times I feel is like a flame out of control that just engulfs all that is me. I just react and never take time to shut my mouth and listen to direction. I also think I am my own worst director of things. I know where I need to go, where to head for salvation and light, but in my own stubborness I rebel and dabble in the world just a lil more lord‚Ä¶just a lil more‚Ä¶hmmm what arrogant thinking is that or a spit in the face of the one that gave me life and can take it away as well. I am not a god‚Ä¶I am merely a man who struggles with the inadequate way to live life on its terms and not be a part of ‚Ä¶.but a part of a family that is just out there for me. People just like me but i refuse to be a part of why? because amidst it all when things are being directed in a good way I forget I have issues, and problems. 911 god is what i have and have had for sooooo long. If I die tonight‚Ä¶I pray that I go to heaven. I feel sooo dirty sometimes like the only way I can trully rid that nastiness is go to a monestary or something I go back into temptation and lust and all that so easily and before long I am so ingulfed I am almost dead again. I play with my life¬† like I have all the time in the world, and I dont. I am 35 alone no family no kids, no wife, all that i own fits in a closet and a car. thats it‚Ä¶..who am i kidding that I am a adult. I try to go forward while trying everything in the world to stay a kid. To throw tantrums, to rebel against all that is good. same ol pattern how long martin‚Ä¶.how long‚Ä¶.are you gonna do this? how long? ‚Ä¶that is really the question‚Ä¶‚Ä¶when is enuff enuff? to be so lost that all that salvation you know is lust greed, temptation and finding ways to destroy others.

Trusting God
A married couple, friends of mine, decided to make some changes in their living situation. They had always lived in the city, and now they decided they wanted to live in the country, on a lake.
They found a small lake home. It wasn‚Äôt the house of their dreams, but when they sold their city home, they would have money to remodel it. They had saved some money, so they moved into their lake home before selling their city home.
One year passed, and the city home didn‚Äôt sell. My friends went through many changes during this time. They had times of patience and impatience. Some days they trusted God; other days they couldn‚Äôt figure out why God was making them wait so long, why God wouldn‚Äôt let them move forward with their plan. The doors just wouldn‚Äôt swing wide open.
One day, a neighbor came to visit my friends. His home on the lake was my friends‚Äô dream home ‚Äî everything they wanted, plus more. The first time my friends saw this house, they admired it, wishing they could have a home just like it, but then they forgot about the idea. They didn‚Äôt believe it could ever be possible.
The reason the neighbor came to visit my friends was that he and his wife had decided to move. He offered my friends the first option on purchasing his home.
My friends accepted his offer, and signed a purchase agreement. Within two months, they sold their city home and their small but adequate lake home. A short time later, they moved into the home of their dreams.
Sometimes, we experience times of frustration in our life. We believe we‚Äôre on track, trusting God and ourselves, yet things don‚Äôt work out. We have false starts and stops. The door refuses to swing wide open. We may wonder if God has abandoned us, or doesn‚Äôt care. We may not understand where we‚Äôre going, or what our direction is.
Then one day we see: the reason we didn‚Äôt get what we wanted was because God had something much better planned for us.
Today, I will practice patience. I will ask, and trust, my Higher Power to send me His best.

One of these days you‚Äôre gonna love me You‚Äôll sit down by yourself and think About the time you turned from me And what good friends we might‚Äôve been ]And then you‚Äôre gonna sigh a little Maybe even cry a little but One of these days you‚Äôre gonna love me 
Now everybody stands up The congregation sings It‚Äôs a song of sweet forgiveness And as the chorus rings The wind blows clear my memory The pages start to turn Then suddenly I‚Äôm singin‚Äô The moment that I learn 
One of these days I‚Äôm gonna love me And feel the joy of sweet release One of these days, I‚Äôll rise above me And at last I‚Äôll find some peace Then I‚Äôm gonna smile a little Maybe even laugh a little but One of these days I‚Äôm gonna love me 
I chose this song today because I was reading out of this book on serenity‚Ä¶I think about the last part of this song where he talks bout loveing himself. I know alot of times I have treated people the way I saw myself, ugly, fat, not good nuff, or just plain with isolative thoughts. I just have been going in my mind as it is at peace and serenity the ability to be clear and honest with no deception or lieing but just in clarity. This journey I call my life hasnt really been that long im only thirty five but emotionally so much younger‚Ä¶This moment in time i feel so confident and have the will to do the right thing instead of putting myself in harmful situations. I am allowing those with issues and problems to deal with them on their own i suggest but not take them as my own, it keeps my mind clear and happy. This song is sooo true‚Ä¶..as alot of his are‚Ä¶‚Ä¶love comes from within and we teach people how to treat us‚Ä¶.if we feel bad or not good we teach them to want to take care of us, or if we feel over confident we tear down anyone that is there for humbleness in our life. Thank you jesus I love me at this moment, gives myself a hug:) laughter is constant in my head right now‚Ä¶not mania but its letting me know that life isnt without laughter, is just a lil gloomy as i was seeing it:) but I am happy‚Ä¶.thank you‚Ä¶may your days be blessed‚Ä¶.love you‚Ä¶..:)*

Competition Between Martyrs
""Yes, I know your spouse is an alcoholic, but my son is an alcoholic, and that‚Äôs different. That‚Äôs worse!""
My pain is greater than yours!
What an easy trap that can be for us. We are out to show others how victimized we have been, how much we hurt, how unfair life is, and what tremendous martyrs we are. And we won‚Äôt be happy until we do!
We don‚Äôt need to prove our pain and suffering to anyone. We know we have been in pain. We know we have suffered. Most of us have been legitimately victimized. Many of us have had difficult, painful lessons to learn.
The goal in recovery is not to show others how much we hurt or have hurt. The goal is to stop our pain, and to share that solution with others.
If someone begins trying to prove to us how much he or she hurts, we can say simply, ""It sounds like you‚Äôve been hurt."" Maybe all that person is looking for is validation of his or her pain.
If we find ourselves trying to prove to someone how much we‚Äôve been hurt or if we try to top someone else‚Äôs pain, we may want to stop and figure out what‚Äôs going on. Do we need to recognize how much we‚Äôve hurt or are hurting?
There is no particular award or reward for suffering, as many of us tricked ourselves into believing in the height of our codependency. The reward is learning to stop the pain and move into joy, peace, and fulfillment.
That is the gift of recovery, and it is equally available to each of us, even if our pain was greater, or less, than someone else‚Äôs.
God, help me be grateful for all my lessons, even the ones that caused me the most pain and suffering. Help me learn what I need to learn, so I can stop the pain in my life. Help me focus on the goal of recovery, rather than the pain that motivated me into it.

I have alot of friends right now that are dealing with loss and have severe pain going on in their lives, I am not one to really give advice that I necessarily dont believe in so here goes.: I know that god heals me, and therefore is able to take away all the pain we are currently experinceing he is not to little for that. I know that we lose people, places, and things in our lives and the only way we can cope alot of time is to medicate the way we feel. I want you to understand something‚Ä¶once the haze comes there is no way you can handle anything rational. I hope that you guys that are experienceing pain and suffereing understand that this to shal pass and the love that you cant let go of you dont have to if it is foundated in you‚Ä¶god is love‚Ä¶.and at times when we hurt and have severe pain its hard to understand that‚Ä¶.i would suggest that you do what you dont think will work, hell what will it hurt? how bout a prayer? a comforting person that really understands and doesnt want to ""fix"" you. I am here for all you guys I hope you know that‚Ä¶.I wont try to counsel you‚Ä¶but just¬† be a friend to direct your thoughts to salvation and strength. I love you guys for hangin in there‚Ä¶I know its not always easy to do the next right thing, but we do that enuff we will see brighter days! I am here if you want to talk or just vent‚Ä¶.holla atcha boi‚Ä¶‚Ä¶if not may god bless you and Ill keep you in my prayers‚Ä¶.have a blessed day full of sunshine and blessings‚Ä¶..dont let the devil get you or your thoughts‚Ä¶he wants you to stay miserble‚Ä¶.go to where the water of salvation can rinse those tears and fill them with love‚Ä¶‚Ä¶lata*

My struggle
Must be some mistake‚ÄòCause I‚Äôm not worth the price you paid. With every passing hour I convince myself that you saw something in me
But I can hear them still, As the whispers laced with hatred fill the room. Guess I‚Äôm wasting my timeHow could you love a man like me? 
Lord I need your strength ‚ÄòCause I am weak and falling to my knees. Who is on my side? ‚ÄòCause I can‚Äôt tell my friends from enemies. Filling up with pain. Bitterness controls the air I breathe. What am I fighting for? Do you have a plan for me?

Matthew 25
I call myself a man of God While laughing at my brother I crossed the heart of a hungry man Instead of giving him some bread And what I say And what I do Are not the same anymore And who I slay, who I betray Lord have mercy on my soul And you were hungry And you were thirsty You were lonely you were cold And you were hurting, you were dying I just left you all alone 
I watched a mother who had her children They all three crying out for help But know one heard them And I just passed them and I screamed ""Lady get a job!"" She took her own life Under the bridge that day While her children sat and cried I could have told her about my loving father Instead I spit in Jesus face, when I heard her voice What you do unto the least of them You do unto me And when you see one of my hurting children I want you to snee Cause I was hungry And I was thirsty I was lonely I was cold And that was me hurting, that was me dying And you just left me all alone I call myself a man of God While laughing at my brother

 Missing Pages by Seventh Day Slumber

            On the outside all we see is clay 
            That hides the perfect life 
            But no one really knows the pain inside 
            I understand how much it hurts 
            To be the one who‚Äôs never seen 
            The missing pages in a magazine 
            No one knows you anymore 
            You‚Äôre lost inside the walls you‚Äôve built 
            No one knows you anymore 
            A prison deep within your soul 
            There is One who sees it all 
            He‚Äôll give you life you‚Äôve never dreamed 
            He can see the pain underneath your skin 
            It‚Äôs hard to see you fading 
            Nothing that I do can bring you back 
            I pray to God that you don‚Äôt fade away 
            Your addiction is a symptom of a lost and dying soul 
            Without Jesus there‚Äôs no hope at all 
            There‚Äôs so much more this is not the end 
            It‚Äôs all in your hands don‚Äôt throw it away 
            A beautiful life with so much to give 
            The image of God underneath your skin 
            The beauty of God underneath your skin (3x)
I was listening to this song on my way home and right now as i sit writing down some thoughts and feelings. I just had a group not long ago and i need a place to unwind and put my thoughts. I sit and wonder if people in the world really understand the pain of someone that doesnt know god goes thru. I was in a room full of ""me‚Äôs"" tonight the me I mean is the fence straddler. When things are going great its all about me..but let the wind start to change direction then ill go down in a blaze before I ask god for his help‚Ä¶.selfishness and faith alot of times play a role in good or bad decisions that happen in my life. I really am not as insane as these blogs suggest, these are just the way it comes out of my mind on the cursor riddend path I have chosen/ GOod news! I found out today im gonna be a uncle again to a neice! I cant wait‚Ä¶.another baby in the family. I will have children one day im sure if I just follow gods plan for me. There is a part of this song that suggests that when we hit that part of time that we fall on hard times we hide out and isolate ourselves from everyone but we can never run from our father. Underneath the skin‚Ä¶he sees and feels our pain‚Ä¶we run we run we try to self will it‚Ä¶we try to fight and fight til we collapse from exhaustion/ I was telling my clients to night that acceptance is the key‚Ä¶the key to salvation and the key to surrendering the things that we cannot change in our lives that keep us entombed to misery and pain. I have thought long and hard about misery because of all the years I spent in self sabataging my good fortune. I would get a great gf or great job and sabatage the hell outta it, due to the insecurities that bubbled to the top of my head to cause me to walk away or cause them pain before they hurt me. I have cried out to jesus many of nights to remove this burden that I have carried for so many years‚Ä¶and you KNOW what? slowly but surely it is going away‚Ä¶my eyes are no longer hazey from the pain that either I or life created. I know I hid alot of years from people out of shame/guilt. I was raised pretty much in a small town, where everyone knew your business even if they acted like they didnt. I crawled underneath my skin alot of times because I thought everytime someone saw me they saw my father the criminal‚Ä¶and the son of a criminal‚Ä¶I guess like I said in my other entry about always wanting to save those that are lost, and searching‚Ä¶.so that I allow myself not to give up on me‚Ä¶because i do alot. I hear so many repeated re-enactments in my head when i get rejected, when im tired, when im lonely‚Ä¶.all the negative part of the world that used to be my own.¬† I am learning what it is to be a brother, a uncle, and a caring party of society where most of my life I was lost up in the grip of addiction and the storm that raged in my head. Today I am happy:) full of hope, and full of the lords presence. I am not crazy‚Ä¶.I just can talk about things that others think openly and not care about criticism ‚Ä¶.had a liftime of it for me to ever care what your thoughts of negativity mean‚Ä¶..:) wow, all that in my swift stroke of the keyboard‚Ä¶..may the lords love be holding you tightly as you try to squirm out‚Ä¶:P god bless you guys‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.time for bed*

Here With You

Well I‚Äôve been beat and I‚Äôve been laughed at
And I‚Äôve been drugged through strings of pain
And I‚Äôve had people turn their back on me
I have been called every name
And I‚Äôve felt lonliness and hunger
And I felt helpless and betrayed
And all the hurtful things you‚Äôve done to me
You know my love has never changed
You drove the nails through my hand
I never gave up on you
You placed the thorns on my head
But I‚Äôm right here with you
I‚Äôm here with you
Well I took the sting of torture
So you wouldn‚Äôt feel the pain
Well I was nailed upon a cross for you
And child I‚Äôd do it all again
You drove the nails through my hand
I never gave up on you
You placed the thorns on my head
But I‚Äôm right here with you
I‚Äôm here with you
You drove the nails through my hand
I never gave up on you
You placed the thorns on my head
But I‚Äôm right here with you
I‚Äôm here with you

good morning lord! I just thought I would get on here and write the feelings that are currently running thru my¬† head. I woke up with a happy earnest feeling inside. I was supposed to go to a cook out thingy with the roomies, but decided against it. I feel alot of times that I go with them out of lonliness or boredom. I really dont enjoy all the things we do together, they are older and i feel like the third wheel or buffer. I woke this morning happy that you lord gave me another day to breathe to be in your grace and love. I am trying to find my way back into your arms, I have wandered alot of times due to being more interested in people, places, and things in the world instead of having my eyes on the most important thing‚Ä¶YOU. I guess alot of times I get disfocused when i get caught up in the poor me crap that goes on in my head as well, I feel to deeply alot of times, and am misunderstood alot of times as well. For some reason I think the world isnt as caring as it once was or maybe pain is so deep in peoples eyes that it just sucks all the goodness from the ones that are happy. I know you are the only one that can ease any type of harm or pain. I know when I get my eyes off you I look for comfort in the arms of someone that loves me, and when that doesnt happen I get more depressed and down, start to unravel like a ball of unbridled rope. I love you lord, soooo much, I just at times wonder why it is that being a christian is just a statment today. You ask anyone and their response is.."" yah im a christian"" ‚Ä¶.without a second thought, but their actions state otherwise. I myself have been guilty of running your name thru the mud, and even turning my back on you when i get self righteous and prideful. I hope today that my day is full of giving to those that need the love so that I can in return empty my cup so that more blessings can occur‚Ä¶‚Ä¶may your children run to you for support and happiness, and grace‚Ä¶..holy father‚Ä¶.your son:) martin

LINKIN PARK LYRICS

""What I‚Äôve Done""

In this farewell,
There‚Äôs no blood,
There‚Äôs no alibi.
‚ÄòCause I‚Äôve drawn regret,
From the truth,
Of a thousand lies.

So let mercy come,
And wash away‚Ä¶

What I‚Äôve Done.
I‚Äôll face myself,
To cross out what I‚Äôve become.
Erase myself,
And let go of what I‚Äôve done.

Put to rest,
What you thought of me.
While I clean this slate,
With the hands,
Of uncertainty.

So let mercy come,
And wash away‚Ä¶

What I‚Äôve Done.
I‚Äôll face myself,
To cross out what I‚Äôve become.
Erase myself,
And let go of what I‚Äôve done.

For What I‚Äôve Done

I‚Äôll start again,
And whatever pain may come.
Today this ends,
I‚Äôm forgiving what I‚Äôve done.

I‚Äôll face myself,
To cross out what I‚Äôve become.
Erase myself,
And let go of what I‚Äôve done.
What I‚Äôve done.


Forgiving What I‚Äôve Done.

A mother is not a person to lean on, but a person to make leaning unnecessary.‚ÄìDorothy Canfield Fisher
A strong, healthy tree is one which is free to grow straight and tall. A weak tree often must lean against another for support. It is not that different with people. We are not healthy and strong when we must always lean on another to support us.
This doesn‚Äôt mean it isn‚Äôt healthy to accept help. But the best help we can get or give is that which enables us to do things without it. Sometimes we think we lose a relationship when others don‚Äôt need our help, or when we don‚Äôt need theirs all the time. The reverse is true. Only when we are each strong enough to stand on our own can we really share the kind of help, which allows both, helped and helper to be independent.
Have I been giving the right kind of help?

You are reading from the book The Language of Letting Go 
Overspending and Underspending
I used to beat my husband to death with my credit card. It made me feel like I had some control, some way to get even with him.‚ÄìAnonymous
I spent ten years buying everything for myself at garage sales. I didn‚Äôt even buy myself a new pair of shoes. The entire time I was depriving myself, my husband was gambling, speculating on risky business deals, and doing whatever he wanted with money. I learned that when I made a decision that I deserved to have the things I wanted, and made a decision to buy something I wanted, there was enough money to do it. It wasn‚Äôt about being frugal; it was about depriving myself, and being a martyr.‚ÄìAnonymous
Compulsive buying or overspending may give us a temporary feeling of power or satisfaction, but like other out of control behaviors, it has predictable negative consequences.
Under spending can leave us feeling victimized too.
There is a difference between responsible spending and martyred deprivation. There is a difference between treating ourselves well financially and overspending. We can learn to discern that difference. We can develop responsible spending habits that reflect high self-esteem and love for ourselves.
Today, I will strive for balance in my spending habits. If I am overspending, I will stop and deal with what‚Äôs going on inside me. If I am under spending or depriving myself, I will ask myself if that‚Äôs necessary and what I want.

A.A. Thought for the Day
Disillusionment and spiritual confusion mark our age. Many of us have cast aside old ideas without acquiring new ones. Many men and women are creeping through life on their hands and knees, merely because they refuse to rely on any power but themselves. Many of them feel that they are being brave and independent, but actually they are only courting disaster. Anxiety and the inferiority complex have become the greatest of all modern plagues. In A.A. we have the answer to these ills. Have I ceased to rely on myself only?

I am so glad heavenly father that amidst all the pain of the world that came to you, that you never gave up on the thought that humanity was worth dieing for. I was listening to this song this morning when i woke up and was thinking about all the times that I have felt this way also, and knowing that my god made it with all the tribulations of the world and he died for me and mine, i too can go on. I am speechless really when i hear this song. I am gaining a understanding of the undying love you have for me father.There are things that happen in the world without any kind of understanding by us, but with your love at the foot of my thoughts I know all will be okay. I understand that phrase of people turning on you, I have been guilty of that more then once, and still you didnt give up on me. I love you for that. I have dragged your name thru the mud, and have place false hope in the ways of the world, and still you never left my side. You waited patiently while I was playing the game called my life. I understand pain and hurt today, and even though I have ran thru the world like a aimless player, I cant go back and change the paths I have burned up but I know deep in my heart, that you can and will repair those that were harmed due to my carelessness. I love you so much heavenly father. Your all I need in this world of temptation and confusion. You are unyielding and unchanging. Love at its fullest. I start off today with you in my thoughts and heart. Thank you for allowing me one more day‚Ä¶.Your son. Martin:)

Bring Any Request to God
Bring any request you have to God.
No request is too large; none too small or insignificant.
How often we limit God by not bringing to God everything we want and need.
Do we need help getting our balance? Getting through the day?
Do we need help in a particular relationship? With a particular character defect? Attaining a character asset?
Do we need help making progress on a particular task that is challenging us? Do we need help with a feeling? Do we want to change a self-defeating belief that has been challenging us? Do we need information, an insight? Support? A friend?
Is there something in God‚Äôs Universe that would really bring us joy?
We can ask for it. We can ask God for whatever we want. Put the request in God‚Äôs hands, trusting it has been heard then let it go. Leave the decision to God.
Asking for what we want and need is taking care of ourselves. Trust that the Higher Power to whom we have turned over our life and will really does care about us and about what we want and need.
Today, I will ask my Higher Power for what I want and need. I will not demand-I will ask. Then I will let go.

Codependency is a progressive disease brought about by child abuse, which takes the form of anything ""less than nurturing."" Codependency is epidemic (maybe all of us are codependent) and defines a vast array of psychological and physical symptoms. The caring manifested by codependents is an unconscious effort to keep repressed pain at bay, and the codependent actually contributes to the addictive behavior of their loved ones by enabling. Enabling keeps the loved one addicted so the codependent can go on caring to gain a sense of self worth. Recovery from codependency requires drastic attitude and lifestyle change (Detachment) and a lifelong commitment to the 12-step regime. 
The Idea That ""Less than Nurturing"" Experiences are Necessarily Traumatic
We expect relief‚Äìquick relief. We are fortunate to live in a time when quick relief for many of the discomforts of life is available, often at a very low price. We not only have remedies for such nuisances as a headache, we can choose between ibuprofen, acetaminophen or aspirin, depending on your preferred means of pain relief. We live in an age in which people believe that life should be fair and comfortable. You don‚Äôt have to go back very many decades to be assured that things are pretty fair and comfortable these days relative to the lifestyles of our ancestors. I imagine if one of these codependency books was published a century ago there would be very few who would have taken it seriously. Imagine a family migrating west in the 1800s, just barely surviving. Imagine an exhausted wife and mother bouncing along in a horse led wagon, face chapped from the sweltering midday heat. She opens up Pia Mellody‚Äôs book as she breast feeds her infant while leaning on a loaded shot gun and nursing her husband‚Äôs wounded arm. Her eyes open wide. She says to herself? ""What? a disease of caring?"" ""I need to relive the ""shame"" of my childhood and hold all the ""bad"" people accountable, detach and learn to live for myself because I don‚Äôt have to take care of anyone but myself?"" You can bet Beattie‚Äôs book would be fire bait that cold dessert night. 
The codependency idea offers an easy route to relief in this age of quick cure. In fact, Melody Beattie says ""It is not only fun, it is simple (54). At last people who are angry, frustrated, bored, unhappy, clingy, irrational, or guilt ridden can have a diagnosis. What‚Äôs even more fun is we get to reexamine our childhoods, our families, Everyone‚Äôs favorite soap opera, as Wendy Kamminer writes in I‚Äôm Dysfunctional You‚Äôre Dysfunctional. Codependency mandates a poignant story. We get to ask, ""How did I become codependent? Mellody will respond, ""Carried Feelings."" She will offer an electrical circuit analogy. You, the child, because of your ill developed boundaries were literally a conduit for the intense feelings of shame which were discharged by your parents. As a child you incorporated these into a ""shame core"" which is manifested in your ""shame attacks"" today. You will pass on shame cores to your children unless you unleash the bottled up pain today. 
So what is an alternative to the idea that caring contributes to the problem or directly perpetuates it? How bout the exact opposite? ""I‚Äôm in no way responsible for the endurance of your addictive habit. You are making a decision to drink, use drugs, squander, overeat or whatever. Period. Now that we have that settled, let‚Äôs examine my behavior. Well, I do a lot to make his life comfortable. I‚Äôve been that way for as long as I‚Äôve known him. And now our lifestyle has changed and we have this awful substance abuse problem and I‚Äôm feeling spent and frustrated most of the day because he won‚Äôt change. I wonder if there are certain behaviors that, in and of themselves are okay, but which make his quitting this habit more difficult now, at this juncture of our lives."" This mind set results in an examination of many caring behaviors and the possibility that some many need modification while others may not. 
I once worked with a young man who was in his 40s and living at home with his mother. He had moved in with her secondary to a nasty divorce and a bout of depression which was proving particularly tenacious. This fellow was drinking heavily every night and the mother finally had it and mandated that he get some help. She went to an outpatient clinic and was told that she was the majority of the problem with regard to her son‚Äôs addiction, that she was enabling. She took the bait and evicted her son, and told him that she could not be responsible for his problems any more. She wouldn‚Äôt take his calls and had her locks changed. 
This would have been fine and dandy, but the woman felt miserable. She went to Al-anon meetings and left feeling depressed. She constantly worried about her son, about his well-being, his health, his depression. Ultimately she made the decision to let him come back home She was quickly back where she started. He was depressed and drinking heavily in the evening. To boot, she felt even more helpless than before, because she now felt that she was causing his problems, though she simply could not abandon her son as the counselor had suggested. When the family came to me they had been told that I had a different clinical conceptualization of addictive behavior and family involvement. Initially I met with the son and thoroughly assessed his alcohol abuse problem which was clearly triggered by his tenacious depression. After a medically supervised detoxification and thorough evaluation by a psychiatrist it was agreed to afford him a pharmacological regime as well as cognitive therapy, emphasizing the acquisition of skills to counter urges and craving, prevent and cope with relapse, modify lifestyle and manage negative mood states. Upon meeting with the mother and the son together the idea of enabling, which had been so indoctrinated by the previous counselor, was discussed. She was told that her son‚Äôs depression was not 75% per fault, as she had been told. I also encouraged her to entertain the possibility that the patent‚Äôs behavior was being driven by the need to feel better, not by her actions. I told her that her housing of her son, providing meals and so forth were manifestations of a caring mother, and in and of themselves were not pathological. She agreed that these qualities had been utilized in the rearing of her other three children and in her friendships, none of whom had addiction problems. I encouraged her to consider the present situation with her son as a special situation in might evaluate all behaviors involving her son, and make a determination whether they are making it less easy or more easy to change. She came to the conclusion that providing shelter for her son in intoxicated states and while recuperating was probably making it less easy for him to change. She felt that ""kicking him out"" while he was attempting to recover from such a long standing depression was counter to her convictions regarding family and probably wouldn‚Äôt help him either. She was able to give herself permission not to do this. The son was able to articulate that he would very much like to be independent and have his own place again, and didn‚Äôt feel he was in a posi
tion to take on independent living at that time. He also saw how a comfortable bed to drink in and nurse his withdrawal was not going to help him change. The mother was receptive to my ""recruiting"" her in the effort of helping her son stay on course with regard to his rehabilitation and agreed to make her house available to her son as long as he avoided alcohol. If she suspected he was drinking, he was to find another place to stay for the next 72 hours or until he was not intoxicated or withdrawing. 
The mother did not have to follow through with this condition, as the threat alone served to help the patient stay on course. She felt that it was okay to provide the caring she had always provided and did not feel as though this condition conflicted with her values. 
So you‚Äôve tried to ""stop caring"" and found that it makes life dreadful? Maybe you don‚Äôt have to relinquish core standards to be happier. Perhaps you‚Äôre trying to eliminate the foundation and expect the building to continue standing. Maybe it‚Äôs okay to ""care too much."" Can you ""care too much"" and be happier than you are now? That would take a lot of re-evaluation‚Ä¶of yourself, of your spouse, of your family, maybe even your past. Now that‚Äôs a challenge!

Eight Specific Reasons Why Christians Suffer
by Joyce Meyer
And if we are [His] children, then we are [His] heirs also: heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ [sharing His inheritance with Him]; only we must share His suffering if we are to share His glory (Romans 8:17). As Christians, we like the thought of sharing in Christ‚Äôs glory, but what about sharing in His suffering? Jesus took care of the death penalty once and for all so we don‚Äôt ever have to worry about that again. But the Bible teaches that we must suffer times of trial if we are to share in the glory. Is it worth it? Listen to the words of Paul in Romans 8:18: ‚Ä¶For I consider that the sufferings of this present time (this present life) are not worth being compared with the glory that is about to be revealed to us and in us and for us and conferred on us!¬†Too often we think we suffer because of our circumstances. We believe that if our circumstances would change, we‚Äôd be able to act right. But God wants us to become so mature and stable that we act right even when none of our circumstances are good. There are different levels of faith, and most of the time we want to use our faith to get rid of a problem. But sometimes God‚Äôs plan is for us to exercise a higher level of faith that will carry us through life‚Äôs challenges. This requires even greater faith than being delivered from a situation. Too often we marvel at the delivering power of God and overlook His keeping, strengthening and enabling power. Although there are many reasons why Christians suffer, I would like to address what I believe are eight of the most common reasons why there is suffering in our lives. 
1. A Lack of Word Knowledge 
Many Christians suffer because they‚Äôre too busy seeking carnal knowledge instead of the Word of God. The Lord Himself said, My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge‚Ä¶ (Hosea 4:6). Paul was an educated man, with a wealth of carnal knowledge. When he realized the importance of spiritual knowledge, he said, ‚Ä¶I resolved to know nothing (to be acquainted with nothing, to make a display of the knowledge of nothing, and to be conscious of nothing) among you except Jesus Christ (the Messiah) and Him crucified (1 Corinthians 2:2). Like Paul, we need to realize the importance of learning spiritual things, for Galatians 6:8 says, ‚Ä¶he who sows to his own flesh (lower nature, sensuality) will from the flesh reap decay and ruin and destruction, but he who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life. 2. Disobedience 
Once we know the Word of God, we have a responsibility to be obedient to it. Too many of us intend to be obedient, but put it off. Even procrastination is disobedience, and it can cause us to suffer. James 4:7 gives us good advice: Submit yourselves therefore to God‚Ä¶ (KJV). When God tells me to do something, I find it helpful to write it down. This serves as a reminder that I must be obedient if I want God‚Äôs blessings. If you are willing and obedient, you shall eat the good of the land (Isaiah 1:19). 
3. To Purify and Test Your Faith Sometimes people seem surprised that they must go through a time of trial or suffering. Perhaps they‚Äôve been faithful to learn and obey the Word, and the trials still come. Sometimes trials come simply to test and purify our faith. [You should] be exceedingly glad on this account, though now for a little while you may be distressed by trials and suffer temptations, so that [the genuineness] of your faith may be tested, [your faith] which is infinitely more precious than the perishable gold which is tested and purified by fire. [This proving of your faith is intended] to redound to [your] praise and glory and honor when Jesus Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed One) is revealed (1 Peter 1:6,7). 
4. A Need for Brokenness 
The word brokenness may strike fear in some people, but it‚Äôs really not a bad word. God doesn‚Äôt desire to break our spirits, but He wants to break that outer shell, the flesh that prevents Him from being all He wants to be in and through us. He wants to break off things like pride, rebellion, selfishness and independence. God wants us to be totally dependent on Him, and suffering seems to bring us to that point. However, having to depend on God shouldn‚Äôt cause us to feel sorry for ourselves. I once said, ‚ÄúOh, God, I‚Äôm so lonely, and I don‚Äôt have anybody but You.‚Äù And the Holy Spirit said, ""Poor Joyce, you‚Äôre just stuck with God."" I‚Äôve discovered that having only God is a good position to be in. 
5. To Build Compassion 
Compassion is born out of experiencing similar problems. The Bible says, ‚Ä¶we do not have a High Priest Who is unable to understand and sympathize and have a shared feeling with our weaknesses and infirmities and liability to the assaults of temptation, but One Who has been tempted in every respect as we are, yet without sinning (Hebrews 4:15). It comforts me to know that Jesus understands me and has compassion. Going through trials and experiencing God‚Äôs deliverance better equips us to minister to others. Our pain is never wasted; it brings about compassion that reaches out to other hurting people by saying, ""I‚Äôve been there, and God brought me through it, and He‚Äôll do the same for you."" 
6. To Encourage Others 
The apostle Paul said there were many things that God allowed him to go through simply as object lessons for other people. ‚Ä¶I want you to know and continue to rest assured, brethren, that what [has happened] to me [this imprisonment] has actually only served to advance and give a renewed impetus to the [spreading of the] good news (the Gospel)‚Ä¶. most of the brethren have derived fresh confidence in the Lord because of my chains and are much more bold to speak and publish fearlessly the Word of God‚Ä¶ (Philippians 1:12,14). Even in Paul‚Äôs imprisonment, his stability and ability to be used of God was evident. If we‚Äôre to minister to others, we too must face some adverse circumstances. But if we stand in faith and confidence, God will bring us through to victory, and we‚Äôll be a great encouragement to others in the process. 
7. Because of the Word Sometimes we suffer attacks from the enemy simply because of our involvement with the Word of God. Mark 4:17 speaks of those who hear the Word and endure it for a while, ‚Ä¶then when trouble or persecution arises on account of the Word, they immediately are offended (become displeased, indignant, resentful) and they stumble and fall away. When someone receives the Word of God, Satan delights in coming immediately to try to steal what‚Äôs been sown in their heart. He knows the Word will strengthen us and help us live a victorious Christian life, and he wants to stop it if he can. So it‚Äôs imperative to guard the Word in your heart and resist the devil from stealing it away from you. 
8. Because of Living in the World 
Many times Christians face trials and suffering simply because we live in a world full of sin. But Jesus said, ‚ÄúI have told you these things, so that in Me you may have [perfect] peace and confidence. In the world you have tribulation and trials and distress and frustration; but be of good cheer [take courage; be confident, certain, undaunted]! For I have overcome the world. [I have deprived it of power to harm you and have conquered it for you]‚Äù (John 16:33). What a promise! Understanding the reason for our suffering and having the assurance of the final glory we‚Äôll share should make it a little easier to enjoy our lives‚Ä¶even during the times of sharing in suffering.

if i told you that i loved you would you just make me cry
if i told you that i loved you would you only say goodbye
if i told you that i loved you would you walk thru the rain
with me, as often times in my life its really hard to see
the person that i want to show isnt the one that i put in front
but at times its the deepest part that gets hurt the most
if i told you that i loved you would you only make fun of me
if i told you that i loved you would you just laugh at my heart
would you tear it open amist the stitches of the past, would you
care enough for my love to stay and make it last??
if i told you that i loved you would you run amist your head and 
wonder why my heart and my exterior all seem so dead
if i told you that i loved you would that be enough for you to stay
or would you question my integrity enough to make the day turn gray
if i said those words that are hard to speak that come from beneath my soul
would you laugh at me in question and look away from my smile., or my empty 
hole. 
If i said those words‚Ä¶.would you ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶could‚Ä¶ you‚Ä¶please stay‚Ä¶‚Ä¶because without you in 
my life, my life has nothing but raindrops that run array. 
I love you i love you as my heart aches, my world may not be extravagant but I am just me
a person with feelings so deep that i am scared for all to see. 
when i say i love they run or they hide‚Ä¶..like i am not capable of feeling that without foolish pride
so next time i say these words please dont judge so quick, love for me is like a anecdote because 
i am always sick. 
i love you i love you‚Ä¶.please hold it near for my heart took all this time to make the pain disappear.
i love you.

By the title I am sitting here feeling sorry for myself‚Ä¶I didnt want to write about it but tonights group was so emotional it got to me. I went to the dr today and he is keeping me on the prozac which is awesome but you know feelings are feelings and all the medication in the world unless your dead you wont feel anymore. I am happy that I feel today but its the times like i feel right now i get scared of. Its the down feeling or just the feeling of concern for me. The group was watching gridiron gang with the rock. I love that movie because of the topic football. I keep thinking I may want to go back to school and coach. It is yet another profession that isnt lucrative as far as $$ are concerned. I am not about the money but the addict in me wants what it wants‚Ä¶and im spoilt to nice things even if i cant afford them or shouldnt have them, because i just get tired of it and move on. Blah!@ that is from the misattachment i have to me‚Ä¶is all that is. I dont like to talk about my feelings because its often times misconstrued as whining or poor me by people but you know This is what my therapist says to do‚Ä¶.do IT ANYWAYS‚Ä¶.Well the same is stated in recovery do the shit anyways who cares if i think it is best or not‚Ä¶.hell my best ways got me where i am at this point‚Ä¶I will do this:) i will write‚Ä¶.as the raindrops are on the side of this page for comfort and lifesong blares out of the speakers‚Ä¶i race for the finish line if just for tonight to finish up strong. I will not endure something my precious jesus didnt have and more! I wont act like im alll together at this moment because I am not but you know what this is only temporary and I will be okay thru these insane thoughts of insecurties. I said the word adversary in group about this movie and one of the clients blurted out its ADVERSARITY gosh say it right already‚Ä¶.i felt so small and embarassed but I didnt lash out like i would have before I just kinda got quiet and let it fester. The others were laughing and joking around about it, i said well that word has two ways to be pronounced but why should i let that bother me? I am not perfect and neither are they‚Ä¶.so I need to do as i am and write about my insecurities‚Ä¶.I hate being called out like that., to be wrong‚Ä¶or speak of something in the non correct way‚Ä¶.hell i am tired i dont even know if he is right or not but you know i dont really give a rip. I did before i started writing and that was eating at me‚Ä¶.damn they think im stupid or retarded or what not‚Ä¶.but you know jesus i pray for them as well as myself and i pray that is enough. I believe that your words and thoughts are correct not another person that struggles just like me. I have to have faith in you‚Ä¶.I have nothing else at this point. ‚Ä¶not that i am at rock bottom or as dramatic as i put things at times‚Ä¶.i am well, i am happy a lil overweight as the dr put today wants me down to 200 lbs. or 185‚Ä¶.said i am carrying a seventh grader on my back in the essence of the weight i have put on. I struggle with that too‚Ä¶.but you know‚Ä¶.WHO CARES i am gonna give it my best shot.¬† I am not poor meing right now i promise‚Ä¶or hell if you read this and think so‚Ä¶i still love you anyways‚Ä¶im not ALWAYS right either‚Ä¶..and that is what i am tryin to learn‚Ä¶.do as you speak so that you can match what you say with your words‚Ä¶.recovery isnt just for not drinking its about repairing your life so others can tolerate you in theirs and the wall is down enough so that you can love and be loved. I was telling this guy something tonight that hit me in the face. I called him a ""shit talker"" if you will pardon my french I told him that so many times we get used to moving our mouths so fast out of fear that we never get to the believeable point so that others understand we are trying‚Ä¶they are so used to game out of our mouth that‚Ä¶nothing is belived even if honestly we are trying. I am guilty of that‚Ä¶i am the best of the best at ""shit talking"" but you know when you have to feel you have to be right when everything around you has been told that you are wrong‚Ä¶its out of survival‚Ä¶hell the battle is over‚Ä¶..learn to let go martin‚Ä¶.no one is keeping score and you are not any less cause you are older‚Ä¶.be who you are‚Ä¶.live what you talk and know you are enough not only for you‚Ä¶but others too.

I woke up this morning feeling good:) sitting here listening to seventh day slumber. I love this band so much because this guy not only brings the issues of real life, but also gives you the faith to turn it all over to the lord.
this song speaks to me the most for some reason.it is the resilancy of faith in the mist of pain and suffereing. I was just thinking the pain and suffereing brought about by me is usually fear and i react to it. 

Well I‚Äôve been beat and I‚Äôve been laughed atAnd I‚Äôve been drugged through strings of painAnd I‚Äôve had people turn their back on meI have been called every nameAnd I‚Äôve felt lonliness and hungerAnd I felt helpless and betrayedAnd all the hurtful things you‚Äôve done to meYou know my love has never changedYou drove the nails through my handI never gave up on youYou placed the thorns on my headBut I‚Äôm right here with youI‚Äôm here with youWell I took the sting of tortureSo you wouldn‚Äôt feel the painWell I was nailed upon a cross for youAnd child I‚Äôd do it all againYou drove the nails through my handI never gave up on youYou placed the thorns on my headBut I‚Äôm right here with youI‚Äôm here with youYou drove the nails through my handI never gave up on youYou placed the thorns on my headBut I‚Äôm right here with youI‚Äôm here with you
I am gonna be okay:) just was a long week, and had alot of emotions going on because of the job and out of it. I read things that hurt, because I think hmmm ‚Ä¶one day i will be there‚Ä¶totally have no doubt or shame/guilt. I love you lord, and even though at times it seems like im all alone I know I have you. this song states it. amist all the judgment of my own soul and how others perceive me I will be okay because of the undying love you have for humanity and me. We drove nails in your hands and still you stood tall with no fear or regret‚Ä¶.just to love humanity and myself. At times I feel that pain maybe of not having nails in my hands but of words that cut thru my flesh and just crash my heart. I am on medication today and it seems that words hurt me more then anything‚Ä¶i retaliate out of fear, out of not wanting the pain or their words to be true. I know I am a good person but when I have the issues that I deal with and see how others appear to have it all together and never talk about their pain I feel like im just a broken piece of human life that isnt supposed to feel broken at times, is it un normal to talk about my feelings as i do? is it okay to get them out? or should i go back to stuffing them and acting as it all is okay because ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶i know that well. I am not necessarily feeling so down i cant move or want to do anything today , i am just releasing these negative feelings in words, because i need to empty my head of t his before i start the day. I am gonna go spend time with my nephew and take him to the park‚Ä¶, life is not all bad or chaotic‚Ä¶there are some real perks that I enjoy today. He gives me hope that amist all the injustices of the world, his grin and laughter make it all okay:) I would rather be me today then anyone else. I am okay with who I am‚Ä¶, I am a child of god. With no doubt! i may not sing about it, or have that annointed spot that shows I am but in my heart i believe with all of it that if i¬† were to go today I am going to heaven. 

On the outside all we see is clay That hides the perfect light But no one really knows the pain inside I understand how much it hurts To be the one who√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s never seen The missing pages in a magazine No one knows you anymore You√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re lost inside the walls you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve built No one knows you anymore A prison deep within your soul There is One who sees it all He√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll give you life you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve never dreamed He can see the pain underneath your skin It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s hard to see you fading Nothing that I do can bring you back I pray to God that you don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t fade away Your addiction is a symptom of a lost and dying soul Without Jesus there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s no hope at all There√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s so much more this is not the end It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s all in your hands don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t throw it away A beautiful life with so much to give The image of God underneath your skin The beauty of God underneath your skin (3x)
i love you jesus! thank you for loving me too father‚Ä¶..under neath my skin i know you are the salvation to anything i may do today‚Ä¶..please watch over me with your loving grace and serenity. I will be beyond words of others perception. I am loved. in your name with all i am‚Ä¶your son‚Ä¶.martin:)

Hello Journal,
I am sitting here at work just finished doing some paperwork. I am listening to music which in my case is very powerful and allows me to let out my feelings thru words and sound. I am thinking about the weekend that is coming up ahead. Saturday we have training all day. I spent last saturday with my lil nephew at the park, at mcdonalds, and at his house playing with him. He smiles so big around me and just laughs‚Ä¶he makes me feel loved:) im so grateful he is in our family. He shows such love and kindness. I see a lil of me in him, the shyness at first but then the hyperness at times its really fun to watch. I think im gonna spend the night with them on friday so that i wont have to drive that far for the training since it is in forth worth. Tim wants to get a four bedroom house, and asked if I would move in with them. I am seriously thinking bout this because I want to be closer to family. I get lonely alot of times because of the closeness of family i think.¬† This playlist im listening to has some great songs on it, so calm and deep. I guess this person really is in touch with that and not scared to show it. I am there also because I really dont care what others think as much as I used to am just trying to live it the best i can ‚Ä¶.and if its not perfect, then I am still trying to do the next right thing:) I am sober for quite awhile now‚Ä¶ninety plus days , I tried to go back to it a lil on the celexa and just negged the hell outta me, but on the prozac I really feel complete and happy. I dont feel like I need it to continue on. One of my biggest problems has always been living in the past or the future and never being confident enough to stay in the now. I am about to be 36 in sept, and you know for the first time in my life, i feel i am a adult. I have childish antics when im with those i love, but üôÇ all is well. My therapist suggests even more work on the family structure, to dig deeper in the meaning of the abuse cycle. So, i continue on‚Ä¶..wow, this song really displays alot of anger and rage‚Ä¶..she is really telling the guy off‚Ä¶.hahaha‚Ä¶.poor kiddoes‚Ä¶.they both lose‚Ä¶.even in anger and stuff, so i have learned. Another thing I have learned that once you love someone they stay in your heart even if they move on and find others that are good for them. I hold alot of people in my heart, and this is okay with me because i used to not give myself permission to feel it once they leave. ¬†oh well, i better get back to work, i just thought i would empty my head of these feelings that go round and round in the cabesa‚Ä¶:) For once in my life, being with martin isnt so bad, hes a good person ‚Ä¶.just gotta keep him in check or he gets off course and messes things up. love you peeps‚Ä¶. bye for now‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..:)

Love consists in this, that two solitudes protect and touch and greet each other.‚ÄìRainer Maria Rilke
For a relationship to be healthy and fulfilling, each of us must respect the other. ""Two solitudes"" is exactly what we are, and we will never be one, no matter how close we become. It may feel like that at times, but we always remain separate persons with our own thoughts, feelings, dreams, and interests.
When we love one another, we allow each other to be who we are, to have our own lives, for it is out of those separate lives that we bring strength and energy and life into our relationships.
We are meant to honor the differences between us. Often these differences lead to squabbles, but when we recognize that each of us is necessary to the union we have created, we create a better one, far superior to the sum of its parts.
What differences between us make our lives together better? 
Saying No
For many of us, the most difficult word to say is one of the shortest and easiest in the vocabulary: No. Go ahead, say it aloud: No.
No ‚Äì simple to pronounce, hard to say. We‚Äôre afraid people won‚Äôt like us, or we feel guilty. We may believe that a ""good"" employee, child, parent, spouse, or Christian never says no.
The problem is, if we don‚Äôt learn to say no, we stop liking ourselves and the people we always try to please. We may even punish others out of resentment.
When do we say no? When no is what we really mean.
When we learn to say no, we stop lying. People can trust us, and we can trust ourselves. All sorts of good things happen when we start saying what we mean.
If we‚Äôre scared to say no, we can buy some time. We can take a break, rehearse the word, and go back and say no. We don‚Äôt have to offer long explanations for our decisions.
When we can say no, we can say yes to the good. Our no‚Äôs and our yes‚Äôs begin to be taken seriously. We gain control of ourselves. And we learn a secret: ""No"" isn‚Äôt really that hard to say.
Today, I will say no if that is what I mean.

I am sitting here listening to this song and im just like awwwing to myself. I feel so good inside today and when I feel this way I know that its from above. I went to see these two in concert and when they started the concert , it was this song first. I was next to someone that I had been close to for a couple of years or more, and i still couldnt reach out to hold her like i wanted because of so much damage i had done to this soul. I am not writing in naustalgia or no other reason then these are the feelings in my brain at the moment:) I think about her daily because i know in my heart she is a great person and she gave me alot of love more then i deserved at that time, and now i feel that even though i go thru life without her, she is still a part of me because i learned so much from her. I remember one time i was griping about a client and the way ""I was being treated"" cause you know its always bout poor martin‚Ä¶lol. Well anyways‚Ä¶she just turns to me and says well martin‚Ä¶why dont you try this‚Ä¶it would be nicer if you said it this way. I couldnt let my pride down to say you know what babe YOUR right. Cause at that point in my life i had no humility much less patience for another telling me a easier softer way‚Ä¶time heals no only stupidity but hopefully arrogance and ignorance. I am listening to faith and tim sing on‚Ä¶I want that someday‚Ä¶you can just tell that love they have for each other is real even though in some of his songs you hear struggle and doubt‚Ä¶its her love and passion that keeps them going. I miss that. I miss having someone that believes in me when i dont‚Ä¶.but my problem wasnt that ‚Ä¶it was letting them in enough to lean on them when i wasnt strong. or just leaning to much where i would become dependent‚Ä¶.sheesh i know‚Ä¶:P its the extremist in me‚Ä¶.oh well, i feel good writing this stuff down cause im being honest‚Ä¶im not anywhere as perfect as i portray myself to be and most of the time im so insecure about life that i try to just build up a wall to keep everything out that i dont understand. I heard this song called who knew by pink‚Ä¶and i started tearing up cause you know‚Ä¶at one point‚Ä¶i wanted her more then anything ‚Ä¶its these issues that i am putting to rest daily always got in our way‚Ä¶love them with kindness‚Ä¶is something that was so foreign to me‚Ä¶but last night i was in group and i told the group you know when you have such self hatred that you ""have to be high "" to be with you‚Ä¶that is some extreme self hatred. I was there yall‚Ä¶..if it wasnt drinking was other more perverse things‚Ä¶.today though‚Ä¶i am hanging in there just like my backdrop is‚Ä¶Just do it martin‚Ä¶.no matter what‚Ä¶.no matter what‚Ä¶..live and keep going forward‚Ä¶.you see, i have lost alot of great things in my life of my own doing‚Ä¶.for so long i pushed blame‚Ä¶.i made excuses‚Ä¶hell read the journal‚Ä¶its full of them. surrender is somthing also that i told my group last night‚Ä¶its not meaning your a failure‚Ä¶it is meaning that if that is what is keeping you sick‚Ä¶.you must identfiy it and deal with it. Just do it!..i listened to micheal irvin this past weekend in his induction to the hall of fame‚Ä¶and he was talking about for better or worst‚Ä¶..and he said its easy when its for better to be loved‚Ä¶but very seldom does someone have a very loveing person in their lives that sticks it out‚Ä¶.and you know i had that..not only in a family but in this person and today i just want to tell you THANK you‚Ä¶.for nothing more then going thru the worst with me and still wanting to hang in there‚Ä¶you are a wonderful person and I really hope one day you see that all that you went thru with me, at one point it was real babe‚Ä¶it really was. i love you for that.¬† this is the ""real"" martin‚Ä¶yall the one that can feel and let people know without shame or guilt or fear of not hearing it back‚Ä¶..to keep goodness, you must empty the truth ‚Ä¶.and let it be available to be refilled‚Ä¶..well, gotta get to work‚Ä¶..i just felt i would get on here and release some feelings‚Ä¶.:) god bless all of you‚Ä¶.

Many of our fears are tissue-paper-thin, and a single courageous step would carry us clear through them.‚ÄìBrendan Francis
There was a huge slide at the park and Jason was afraid to go on it. There were so many steps to climb to reach the top. All of his friends were climbing up the steps and yelling as they came down the long rolling slide.
""Come on,"" said his friend Steve. ""It‚Äôs lots of fun!""
""Isn‚Äôt it scary?"" asked Jason.
""A little bit,"" answered Steve, ""but you get used to it."" He ran off to go again.
Jason walked to the steps of the slide, his heart pounding in his chest. Slowly he placed his foot on the first step and lifted himself up. Courageously he climbed the ladder. When he reached the high platform he felt as if he were standing on top of the world.
We can learn from Jason that by taking that first step we can experience many exciting and wonderful things. We have all done it before, on the slide, on a bicycle, in school. Why not again?
What fear can I walk through today? 
¬†
I was sitting here just read some others OD and started feeling a little saddend and upset. But then I read this and it really makes alot of sense. Fear is somthing that alof of times causes me uneasiness, and pain. I often resort to reacting the way that has been programmed in my head., for so many years. I was thinking about what i read and the perception in which I was takin it. I have had a great weekend and just mowed alot of grass, weed eated alot of grass. That in itself allows you to feel that you arent the biggest thing this planet has. Even though I get highly congested from it, I still did it amidst the fear of staying in my comfort zone. Alot of times I get on here and think, hmmm who is gonna read this, what perception are they instantly gonna take‚Ä¶but it isnt about anyone but me that has the fear going on. No one really cares anymore what i write, and what ive read lately‚Ä¶, just a codependent trait of mine. I am feeling good today and I need to get my mind re-directed on the positiveness I know is truth. I will walk thru the fear that is raging in my head, because you know what ? I cant change it‚Ä¶I no longer have any part of it, and last of all.., i know in my heart i am a good person. I went to a service last night that talked about that, how judgement and lack of forgiveness keeps you sick and bitter. How you carry issues from experience to experience and always have someone to blame, well‚Ä¶i dont write in here about how crappy i was treated anymore, how blada blada‚Ä¶.i had dreams the last couple days of events in my childhood that brought back fear‚Ä¶I had to tell myself last night as I woke up out of sound sleep‚Ä¶its only a dream martin‚Ä¶only a dream. See, sometimes you may read quotes, listen to certain perception on many things, but in the end it is up to you to make that correct decision that you can live with. I may be 35 but the experiences of life have taught me one thing‚Ä¶in the midst of fear it is better to go thru it with those that believe in you then to team up with those that want to keep you sick. I still make mistakes, and I still fall, but you know one thing I know for certain anything I have read out of the bible or heard, it never said that we are to be perfect, but to be in the attempt to be like jesus. That gets me when i read that. I love you lord thank you so much for all that you have brought before me and all that you allow me to walk thru even in fear‚Ä¶your guidance allows me to keep going in faith.¬† I refuse to let the past or the future interfere with living for today‚Ä¶..song of the day wait for you by elliot yamin‚Ä¶.cool song:) Just be‚Ä¶*

hehehe‚Ä¶.one two three calories‚Ä¶gone‚Ä¶as i type away‚Ä¶hahaha i wish! 
I was just sitting here thinking about how happy I am today with all that has gone on lately. I have no real ill intent towards myself or anyone else. I had a individual earlier and we talked about letting go and letting god. I thought about this as i was counseling them, and for the most part ‚Ä¶I have started this process. I decided while reading my codependent no more book, and numerous sessions with my therapist about letting go of the crap that has held me captive for so long‚Ä¶the insanity of my beliefs the insanity of my thoughts, and definately the people i choose to be in relationships with. I cant pick em when they are sick as i am or worst off. I am a helper by nature but one thing for certain when i get with someone that is a caretaker also i switch the role and become the victim as barbara says in the trauma bond of things. There needs to be a healthy balance where the other person doesnt violate their boundaries to want to save me, because i may be thirty five but the inner child is young and maturing.¬† I told my clients the new slogan by me‚Ä¶.and even though may not be to origional or even borrowed‚Ä¶..""just be""‚Ä¶. can be anything you want it to be at the end because it leaves out room for doubt or question. I keep staring at that lion it is too cute‚Ä¶bouncing up and down‚Ä¶.weight loss yah that too ‚Ä¶I have been working out daily and watching what i eat‚Ä¶a dirty body equals a dirty temple.¬† A dirty life equals dirty outcomes. I have been sober and dont miss that AT all. I never smoked or anything like that so cleaning up is not gonna be that hard its mostly inturnal. I am up for the challenge even though it is lifelong. WHOOO *does the shake dance* hahahaha‚Ä¶..oh well thought I would drop in here and write a little because you know ‚Ä¶.life is to short to be unhappy ‚Ä¶another thing i told this client we dont shut the door on the past‚Ä¶.but DONT choose to dwell on it EIther. It reminds us of where we have been‚Ä¶.and where we are moving on from‚Ä¶.i still have not dated anyone or even done the one night things I was so prevelant to do as you have read in here‚Ä¶all that seems silly and stupid to waste time on just anyone that makes ""me "" feel good about myself‚Ä¶.no one does it better then god. For reals‚Ä¶.humans let you down as i have let others down‚Ä¶.without that connection with the lord‚Ä¶.everything else goes away‚Ä¶.as the lion bounces‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶hehehe‚Ä¶.today is a great day!!! ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶lata peeps‚Ä¶keep on rockin and just be""‚Ä¶.if only one sec of what your life is really ment to be‚Ä¶.quit existing and seeking out answers that only god can give you‚Ä¶..:)

Hi journal it is three in the morning and I am in alot of pain‚Ä¶.good pain but still the consequences are hurting right now. We went out on the boat today and I tried the wake board which is a new adventure for me because everytime before we have went out there I have been so petrified of drowning its not even funny‚Ä¶well today I strapped it on and dove in‚Ä¶whooosh I said a quick prayer to keep myself safe and accident free. I grabbed the ski rope and the boat took off ‚Ä¶..I hung on for dear life but all that happend was I swallowed a mouth full of water‚Ä¶.hahaha‚Ä¶.so I let go and tried it again‚Ä¶..same thing so I took that thing off and let it be a moral victory for the fact that I even got in the water with it strapped to me like having your legs bound and just floating there til the boat picks ya up. I got back in the boat and aired up the tube ‚Ä¶..this thing is weird because it is fifty two inches round, and well‚Ä¶.just a toughy to hang on to‚Ä¶.that was such a blast by the time it was said and done was out there for like five hours‚Ä¶I forgot to put sunscreen on and im really dark!‚Ä¶lol. I usually dont see alot of sun during the summer if any at all‚Ä¶and this is definately the darkest I have been in a lonnnnng time. I enjoyed doing this because not only a.¬† helped me do something that i totally have no control over and b. was a heck of a good time. I got home and bought two movies the shooter and the number 23 with jim carrey they are both pretty awesome one a physchological thriller and the other was just action‚Ä¶im a junkie for both‚Ä¶.hehehe‚Ä¶well‚Ä¶.this weekend was well needed since the weeks get long with hearing stories of addiction and pain, and dealing with my own sobriety and staying on the right path that in time wears me down but im good:)¬† I am learning just to live which feels good. I was thinking of another birthday coming up and how old I will be ‚Ä¶whoa‚Ä¶lol. from 31 to 35 has been a wild four years with alot of ups and downs ‚Ä¶.but I wouldnt trade it for the world as far as knowledge. Sometimes the best teacher in life is experiencing things and living thru them. I havent shut down in a while now and feels so good. I am going to start following the local football team they play their first game in two weeks. I will see how they do, I miss going to high school games‚Ä¶and my hometown is too far to drive to watch. So, im excited about that. I dont play my ps2 hardly at all‚Ä¶.its a new season and still havent gotten the yearly updates. I guess tired of staying in doors and zoning off for hours while life is goin on outside..I spend alot of time outdoors on the weekends‚Ä¶I am gonna go get a chain so I can hang my heavy bag up tommorow and get the excersise bike out to ride‚Ä¶.I am not tired right now and just pretty content‚Ä¶I ate at a pizza place tonight that reminded me sooo much of a place I used to eat in denton with the big slice pizzas‚Ä¶..wass so good if just to splurge for a moment‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Shania twain plays in the background‚Ä¶..for some reason I dont listen to her stuff as much as i used to. Martina mcbrides valentine song has been my favorite for a long time, and it signifies the bond I have with my higher power which I call god. I am going to church again tommorow or today should I say‚Ä¶life is great!:) one day valentine will be played at my wedding reception as a big smile is on my face as I dance with my wife thinking you know everything in life points to love ‚Ä¶.one step at a time‚Ä¶., nothing is controlled as that board taught me‚Ä¶‚Ä¶even with a mouth full of nasty lake water I was smiling thinking you know‚Ä¶..its not about getting up that I should fret over but the fact I stayed at it, and didnt let the fear of the unknown keep me from trying. I think I will get up and do some laundry and clean tommorow also‚Ä¶..go to a service hit up a movie and just chill‚Ä¶‚Ä¶well‚Ä¶.life is really good right now‚Ä¶..compared to the hardships i hear my clients go thru weekly‚Ä¶i see exactly how far my meds and my continuem of sobriety and working on my stuff are keeping me going straight in life. ‚Ä¶well‚Ä¶..I am gonna get off here time to unwind as the stars of the night will becon the sandman‚Ä¶‚Ä¶hahaha that was tooo funny‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..love ya‚Ä¶.just be*

Glory glory glory‚Ä¶..I come to you journal in the spirit of the lamb. I was just sitting here waiting on the next client to come thru my door. I have just found out there is a new casting crowns cd. I cant wait to go buy it. 
For a long time this is what I have wanted in my life, and you know for the first time without interuption or feelings of not being good enough I am living it. I dont worry about how far I have come or where I am going because neither is guarenteed but the¬† moment in which I live.¬† I am thankful today for the air i breathe, the ability to move my body and not be in a coma or some other event that others are in at this second somewhere in the world. I believe today that goodness comes from within and as long as you give it away in order to keep it there is nothing wrong with that. I told my group last night that to just have a vision of faith in themselves that god can do it for them, nothing is impossible with a glimpse of faith. I am so thankful I know that in my heart without a doubt today. 
¬†hahaha‚Ä¶.man getting back into shape is not easy but its a lifechange that I am embracing with all I am. I want to live, I want to have a chance to participate in what god wants me to be. I dont really worry if my ex‚Äôs are moving on‚Ä¶why I am alone‚Ä¶blada blada crap, because I know in my heart as long as I keep going nothing will stop me either from finding who god wants me to be with. She is out there as well, and She will love me like jesus does. i am in no hurry though, because its his plan not mine. I mess things up when i take the reigns another thing recovery has taught me, when i take the wheel then i edge god out. My EGO takes over. I feel so free right now its amazing that the lord has me and is actually guiding me moment by moment. I love you martin‚Ä¶i really do! ‚Ä¶.HOpe that god has you too, because without him I know how miserble my life can get fast!‚Ä¶i may not have what i once did , but i had to lose it in order to finally understand what its like worshiping someone greater then self. well my next client is here soooo im out for now‚Ä¶later lord!~‚Ä¶JUSt be*

I hate it when your hungry and trying not to eat bad or sneak a meal in here or there‚Ä¶here it is ten thirty and i definately dont need to be eating so i just drank a protein shake the third one today. I also went by tractor supply and got a three foot chain to hang up my heavy bag out back. So, now I have a heavy bag, excersise bike and music out there‚Ä¶.the dogs walk with me in the mornings in the back field its pretty cool. I am not a morning person still after all these years but it is a great way to start the day. I need to drop this seventh grader off my back as my dr called it. once i get this weight down I am gonna keep it off ugh I hate it. Its so easy to put on but a b to get off. I found out today that my mom is getting out of prison definately in 2010. She didnt make parole again and she wrote my brother to tell him that. My lil nephew is about to be two im so excited he is a lil chatterbox its awesome to hear him talk‚Ä¶another football season is upon us and the bears are two and o in preseason not that it means much, but It makes me happy:) I think 35 has been a pretty good year. I am still working on the oral presentation for my lcdc test and its hella hard, but I know I can do it. I will get this done. I am running that office in arlington and my boss is proud of the progression I have made . It is at its highest census ever 86 clients with one and a half counselors‚Ä¶lol. So, that makes me feel good that I can run a facility if need be. ITs all falling together. I even talked to a friend of mine tonight and looking into possibly looking into buying a home where he lives its a estate outside of town and not to far from my job. My car is almost paid off and that would free up that money so that I could live in my own home:) I am really gonna look into that further. Father thank you for all the blessings you bring my way‚Ä¶.in the small baby steps I take,,,has led me to walk alil more brisker at times with confidence and faith!. I am gonna lay it down for the night. Had a awesome day ‚Ä¶..thank you jesus:) Just BE*‚Ä¶today i will just be Happy and proud of the accomplishments of sobriety and stability. ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.night peeps‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..behave yaselves*

I dont know what it is lately but I wake up at this time almost every night. It is four in the morning and I get up for a few minutes and then back to sleep. I was sooooo tired last night due to pushing my body harder then its used to and it was rebelling on me. I am listening to mercy me HOMESICK. This is definately one of my favorite songs of theirs. Back to earlier, I was feeling tired and lonely. Two of my relapse triggers. I didnt feel like drinking or anything but I was edgy and every little thing annoyed me. I came home and ate a little something then went to bed. I will be okay I know it¬† have been in this position before. Power and control two more things that have been a thorn in my side for years and years and years. ITs like these two things are the catalyst behind every bad decision I make or every decision that I take out of my saviors hands. I have neither but at times, I attempt to trick my mind to think I do. I just took my prozac and after I write this I will head back to la la land‚Ä¶.;) ""a flower quickly fading‚Ä¶.here today and gone tommorow‚Ä¶."" those words are sooooo strong ‚Ä¶because its the truth. I listen to people daily talk about how much time they lose to their addiction and I totally can relate. I tell them that one day (preferbly that day) it is time to lay it down to the cross ‚Ä¶..and learn to move on. I know those words appear easier said then to do it. I struggled for sooooo many years with that easy concept. once again POWER and CONtrol. God always wins though in the end‚Ä¶:) I am neither that in control or that powerful. I was talking with a friend of mine earlier and told them that lonliness still gets me at times, but for the most part its almost like im conditioned to be alone even though I know I am never alone, and I want the oppt to be a husband, a father, and a leader of the family unit. It may never happen for me, but you know I am trully blessed by the lord in so many ways who am i to complain? üôÇ My sanity lord is what i adhere to the glory of your existance that means so much to me. I was a LIAR AND CHEATER amongst other things in my life of destruction of self and others. NOt proud of any of it. Please continue to teach me lord how to let that down before your feet so that my mind doesnt take over ‚Ä¶.I know that I feel like a different person but your actions of hurt and pain always appear to define you forever. I wont allow that to happen because I am not either of those today. I am kind, I am trustworthy, I am a reliable person with the capability of love of self, and the ability to love others. I guess those things do hurt me though cause I know how bad those two words can harm another, to the point of hatred and disgust. Like the years spent in my addiction ‚Ä¶.at times the only thing one can do is live different and match my words to my actions‚Ä¶, I have no control or power and frankly dont want it. I am gonna be up in like four hours again to begin my day. Cardio cardio‚Ä¶.oh the air of sobriety and love today‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.cant beat it:) ‚Ä¶..thank you jesus for taking those chains of insanity and constant pain away from me. I ask that you work on another thing for me, temperance and the ability to forgive myself even more. I still harbor small traces of shame/guilt. I am better then at any time in my life that I can remember just please hold me father‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.let me walk in the path you choose for me. GLory glory be the lord of my understanding. Thank you for the ability to change me in your undying love for me‚Ä¶.I am off to sleep‚Ä¶..just be martin‚Ä¶..thats enough‚Ä¶‚Ä¶continue to let go‚Ä¶‚Ä¶your doing great‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.you are loveable‚Ä¶..you are not a piece of crap‚Ä¶‚Ä¶you are a kind beautiful person‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..:)

candy by seventh day slumber

So many nights wasted, poisoning myself Guess I just hated, the emptiness I felt To be excepted you gotta look like they do But you held your hand downand took me just as I am Your love‚Äôs like candy oh like something I‚Äôve never tasted before And you take me places I never dreamed I could go Oh I‚Äôve been laughed at and broken in two And I‚Äôve felt the wrath that words of hate can do Oh I‚Äôve been stranded and left standing in the rain But you picked my head up and carried me away from this place Your love‚Äôs like candy like something I‚Äôve never tasted before And you take me places I never dreamed I could go and where would I be without you where would I go without you

TOday oh lord my heart is calm and full of love. I pasted these lyrics due to remembering how many nights and days my life was unmanageable. I loved my alcohol more then life itself. I have to remember when i feel good exactly where i have come from. The insanity, the lonliness, the despair. I owe that to one god that removed all that from me. I have had people turn their backs on me, been called every¬† name. I know exactly why to go thru these things to get to a calmer state had to happen. I am bursting with thankfulness today. I know so many people that are still in their addiction or self destructing in one way or the other. Working out lately also reminds me the damage I do to my body when i eat unhealthy or in gluttonous ways. I have to look at everything from a perspective of in the past how did i handle this situation, and where did it take me. I have been down that road time and time again because it was like ""home"" it was comfortable and reliable. I moved from town to town to get my new start on life but I brought myself iwth me and that was a bad combination when it comes to my disease. I seek out the lowly people, the lost looks in their eyes to hang with in my past., cause misery loves company and they didnt reject my lifestyle or me. I stayed in areas of comfort while trying so desperate to leave it behind. Well, like my doctor told me about my weight‚Ä¶it cant be a diet must be a life change. NO truer words ever spoken. I finally understand what recovery is trully about. Its not about not just not drinking or drugging. Its about the actions that take you to the other life, the lying the cheating, the secrets, the fear of the unknown and living as though a victim or needing a reward for my sobriety‚Ä¶.all or nothing folks‚Ä¶..that is/was my calling card and i say that because at times i go right back to that mode of thinking‚Ä¶.its a progressing disease‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.no truer statement‚Ä¶.progressing from who god wants you to be‚Ä¶‚Ä¶who you should want to be‚Ä¶..not a saint‚Ä¶not a perfect person‚Ä¶but one that is descent and trustworthy. I am that today, amidst my character defects that i like no one else knows better i have to work on them to stay out of my former self. I dont act broken anymore, or constantly look at what im not doing or where i am not at . I live one day at a time, and what i have is what is ment to be there. Sometimes i believe that we focus on the negatives in this addiction so much that even in progression it gets trampled on by oh thats great ‚Ä¶but what about this part of you that is still sick‚Ä¶.blada blada‚Ä¶..well that part that is still sick will get where its ment to be in gods time‚Ä¶and if its to much for you to handle go with god‚Ä¶i still love you:) I have gotten to the point where living and let live‚Ä¶.means alot today‚Ä¶.cause what am i gonna do? sit in the same spot for the next forty years knowing what i have k nown the last ten? time to move on and accept things and people as they are‚Ä¶.the beauty in them as well as the flaws‚Ä¶..that only they can fix if they feel it is a problem‚Ä¶..i dropped seven pounds already‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..sixty three more to go!! well, I am gonna go shower and head to get something to eat‚Ä¶..just be.* cause its good nuff for god‚Ä¶.its definately great nuff for me‚Ä¶:) love you peeps‚Ä¶..behave yourselfs‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.

Three oh three in the am and I am sitting here writing in my diary. I had a great night. I went to buffalo wild wingz and watched the UFC fighting championship. It was cool. I also watched football on the many tv‚Äôs they have in that place. I ate to many wingz. Maybe thats why I am up at this hour. I also have my sinuses,allergies acting up so no biggie. I am getting up here in awhile and going to a morning service hopefully. I am going back to 24 hour fitness tommorow night to work out. It feels good to be shedding these pounds my body feels clean and not weighted down. I know it is probly not anything more then detoxification of the harmful toxins we carry round due to not eating healthy and drinking sodas and crap., but it feels good. I spoke to my brother tonight , him and my lil nephew are going to the zoo today , i think he likes to spend sundays just him and toby which i think is awesome. That little boy is gonna be two, wow‚Ä¶.they grow up fast. He is a angel‚Ä¶.I thank god he brought toby into our lives‚Ä¶.i just smile when I think of him and the innocence of his laughter, and the gentleness of his hugs. He rocks! I know I will have a son or daughter one day and I will be a great father as well. I can finally give something to someone that I give myself. Love, understanding and trust. I know for a fact that life is changing for me and I am not fighting it. I dont feel immature and childish anymore, I love to laugh and have fun, but definately can be a leader that I was created to be. Thank you jesus!. writing in this helps me unload the thoughts that are good bad indifferent that just generate in my mind, and allows there to be nothing to keep me from sleeping or having a day without the ""thought commitee"" gathering in my mind. We used to say Peribolo in high school during the workouts and before games at times‚Ä¶it means Whatever it takes‚Ä¶.well‚Ä¶.I am doing whatever it takes to be the man the lord wants me to be, and not dabbling in the other lifestyle that has kept me sick all this time. I hit bumps in the road ‚Ä¶.but thats when i lean on some people that are strong when i can not, and thats when i pray like theres no tommorow. LIfe is great:) damn it feels good! when i wrote that this song came into my head‚Ä¶live like you were dying by tim mcgraw‚Ä¶.that is so true‚Ä¶live like youve never lost, live as though your best friend is the cornerstone for your life‚Ä¶..god you do that:) no fear, just action‚Ä¶.knowing that i am gonna be alright. One more day clean and sober‚Ä¶‚Ä¶dont need a chip or a person telling me good job, because in my heart‚Ä¶.god allows me to feel it. I dont count the days because I understand I am powerless over that crap‚Ä¶why focus so much on something you know you cant beat‚Ä¶hell ive tried to do everything to get around that stuff, and failed ‚Ä¶so today i just live. live like you were dying‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..my first half of my life may have been not as scripted but i am a adult and im gonna make sure this next half is gonna be the best my god can make it, I will love like i am dying‚Ä¶.like i were dying‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..cause one day yup‚Ä¶..heaven awaits.!¬†¬† well, i am getting back to bed‚Ä¶..to early to be this hyper‚Ä¶lol. night diary‚Ä¶‚Ä¶much love‚Ä¶.just be*

Seventh Day Slumber ¬ª I Know

Wonder what can be so bad That it makes you want to die I wonder what could be so tragic Makes you want to take your life You have your Savior on the cross While you sit on the throne Put yourself up on that cross Put your Savior on the throne And I know it‚Äôs hard to take what‚Äôs happening And I know life is tough sometimes And I know it seems like there‚Äôs no hope for you And I know your life is worth more than you can see It‚Äôs hard to see beyond your pain When you feel so dead inside It‚Äôs hard to see what you‚Äôve been given It‚Äôs hard to find the hope in life And I know it‚Äôs hard to take what‚Äôs happening And I know life is tough sometimes And I know it seems like there‚Äôs no hope for you And I know your life is worth more than you can see And I say look at Jesus‚Äô hands Those scars are there for you You know He understands What you‚Äôre going through

Good morning journal,
I am sore sore from working out at 24 hour fitness lately. I went last night and just got in the sauna and jacuzzi and did cardio and some arm work. I tried the ab machine a lil. I am getting there. I can feel the ol body tightening up. I picked these lyrics because I was talking with a client about these exact words yesterday and at group referenced it. This person was really hurting and not necessarily wanting to die because in all essence they are the walking dead. Sometimes you dont have to put the gun to your temple and pull the trigger to be dead.¬† When i get tired it reminds me of the feelings of emptiness and despair, because that is what depression is‚Ä¶getting to a point where your body starts to shut down on you. I dont have those feelings much anymore but lately since I have been working out alot and really pushing my body it doesnt know the difference and at times have to snap myself out of the mental state I am in because it thinks I am wanting to shut down again and am depressed. It is a good measuring stick., to identify my growth. I have been giving serious thought lately to go continue my education and finish up a degree program in another field. It has been pulling on my heart, and obviously cant sleep very well over it. I have prayed about the direction the lord is wanting to take me and asking for guidance. I have known for a long time that counseling was just a temporary thing for me it was preparing me for bigger things. I am going to talk with my boss when I am certain of the direction the lord wants me to take. I will stay with it and get my lisence because I have done so much to get to this point, but I definately know this is not where god wants me. It tears me up inside to hear the re-enactment of the stories of people that refuse help even when it is written on the wall. I was that person for so many years so no one understands their struggle more then i. I dont just identify with the pain and loss, but i really have somewhere to take them today instead of leaving them without hope of going anywhere but the rut they are in. One of my old supervisors who I have been trying to catch on the phone lately gave me some important words when i started this journey she said‚Ä¶.Martin when your heart isnt in it anymore its time to do something else because your not doing you or them any good. My heart is in it but i feel drawn to other areas of helping. I have learned so many lessons while counseling, the ups and downs of success and failure, the rebounding of tragedies, the process of recovery, and the most important thing‚Ä¶.WHO i am. HOw to keep martin in check and to stay accountable to god ‚Ä¶i quit drinking. That was huge, I am on medication, living life in forward instead of always living in the past. I have this on my heart, and right now really in need of some prayer and some good ears to hear what and where the lord is directing me. Its times like this that I miss terribly the luxary of family guidance and direction. Its like being a little kid‚Ä¶..wanting to jump but just not sure where‚Ä¶.or when‚Ä¶lol. I can at least laugh about it. It will come I just need patience and to be non impulsive. well that is really all that is going on in my life‚Ä¶being a gymrat, and attempting to lose weight‚Ä¶.lost seven pounds already‚Ä¶.wooohooo‚Ä¶not for vanity but for my health‚Ä¶oh well, woke up with this on my mind, so decided to write it all down. to thy own self be true‚Ä¶.be kind to yourself, let others be directed by the lord‚Ä¶.and learn to shut up and listen martin‚Ä¶lol‚Ä¶.live and let live‚Ä¶‚Ä¶all so true slogans for success. I am off to bed‚Ä¶.good night love ones‚Ä¶..god bless the broken ones that have yet to find that road of sanity‚Ä¶‚Ä¶keep fighting for you‚Ä¶..the lord doesnt descriminate‚Ä¶.just be* love ‚Ä¶.love‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..

dear journal‚Ä¶.
it is six in the morning and i woke up from a dream that was so real i felt that i had been given a chance to redeem all the fd up mistakes i have ever made. I was in this house(was my old house as a child growing up) and i was in it with two refrigerators and hardly any furniture. It was desolute to say the least. I was in there with this guy that used to be my roomate and he was moving out, or actually had been living there uninvited. I was just numb and not even in my body really. Then all of a sudden he takes off running and he gets caught by a dog or something and then I see my old family, brittney, susan, and larry. Britney grabbed a piece of two by four and started heading towards him and it was weird in this dream because I was like watchin this in third person‚Ä¶.i was cheering her on but i couldnt move fast enough to get to her to help her. Adam was down on the ground and he was begging her not to hit him with the board but I was cheering her on to..she hit him in the neck and then kicked him. I was right there and i started hitting him tooo‚Ä¶.i was bloodied for some reason, and we leaned in to kiss, and it was sooo sweet tasting, hmmm we grabbed each other and it was like we never missed a step, we walked back into the house and for some reason susan came and sat down next to me and started talking to me about forgiving myself and letting this moment show that britt and i had another chance. I felt like i would die for that chance. All day today I had h er on my mind, at the gym, the football game i went to, i was sitting there thinking of the last high school game i went to I was such a asshole to her and susan that I should have kicked my own ass. I am not writing this out of pity or naustalgia, but I have tried to fill and find someone as awesome as britt is. I know she has moved on with some guy and is in love with him, which I am happy for her. I just knkow that I had to write this down because I write everything else that happens to me. I am being honest with all that i do today. I do miss her, not for any other reason then she was a part of my life that i never gave a chance to see how good we could have had it. I was a mess. well, she came over and sat next to me and i just held her close‚Ä¶.and wasnt gonna let her go as i was crying and i couldnt stop‚Ä¶tears of shame,tears of sorrow for her‚Ä¶.i have written alot of things about her and i in here that may seem like a atttempt to just get her back because i am lonely or what not, but you know britt, this is not that at all. i read your last msg to me that stated you couldnt be around a person like me because it reminded you of how bad you hated yourself around me‚Ä¶well i turned all the hate i had in myself and ended up wanting you to see what i saw in the mirror daily. It is football season again, and i was never a longhorn fan‚Ä¶.never. I got that from this family and you know i stay a fan not because i want to but because it is yet one more thning that was brought into my life that is good. I am sitting here crying, not in pity, but just feel so like my life is being played out in my dreams the way my heart really wanted it to be but i had to much idiocracy keepign me back from loveing her. Adam, my stupid job, the moves, living at tracis‚Ä¶.hanging out with ray, having female friends on and off the computer, just putting my priorities everywhere but where i knew they should have been. ON brittany. I was thinking tonight at the football game how awesome it would have been watching our son playing one day. there were all these little boys in football jerseys and lil girls in cheerleading outfits, i know how she loves children, ‚Ä¶.i know i will never find another like her she is definately one of a kind. I used to focus on all the flaws i¬† saw in me and projected them to her, i treated her like she wasnt good enough to be with me and i was so much better‚Ä¶but you know what‚Ä¶she was a angel. I am using past tense not because she isnt now but it has been awhile since i have seen her and what i read she has moved on and dont want to cause any problems in that. I notice the one thing in that dream that i never thought would happen or did happen while we were together‚Ä¶.SHE FOUGHT for ME. Looking back all that poor girl did was fight‚Ä¶.thats why she would cry, would be angry‚Ä¶.I didnt give the dream a chance to finish because I have lived it ‚Ä¶amidst all that i thought i didnt want at the time, i just hated myself so much and wanted a double life of addiction and perverse thinking., that all the love i was given was being blocked by a darker presense. I wasnt ready i didnt want to be ready but i know one thing for certain brittany‚Ä¶.you touched my soul ‚Ä¶we did have our moments. If giving back all the money, all the gifts all the things that you got me ‚Ä¶.would have you here i wish i would have never gotten any of that because i lost the one thing that is worth more then any of that‚Ä¶.i lost you. Its years later i know, but my heart is different and my soul is able to feel good‚Ä¶.oh well‚Ä¶.i just hope that you are happy with this new guy‚Ä¶he definately will be kinder with your heart and soul then i was. I wish you the best . Thank you for all that you and your family did for me, no mistakes‚Ä¶.i will always love you in my heart because i know what that is for real now. thank you for you.¬† I dont live life in the tv screen‚Ä¶.anymore. even though your not around me, i see you everywhere i go ‚Ä¶i love you baby and always will. i didnt walk away‚Ä¶you did when i was at my sickess‚Ä¶for your salvation and sanity‚Ä¶.once again you taught me something your strength to leave pushed me into wanting to be a better person. ugh‚Ä¶i need to stop ‚Ä¶.ill see you in my dreams‚Ä¶.and in heaven one day‚Ä¶thank you for all the love you gave me i just want you to know that it wasnt in vain ‚Ä¶.i wish now we had a family ‚Ä¶.cause i know you would be the best mom‚Ä¶..love you always for loving me when i was the most unlovable. ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶see you in my dream to see how the story goes different.

Happy labor day to all you peeps!
¬†
I just was sitting here listening to this song play on and I realized just how down I had allowed life to get me. I hear so much negative things from people that I end up soaking it in. I am a person that loves to help out people, but after guiding them over and over to the direction‚Ä¶and they continue to go on their own beaten path., comes a day when I finally let them go with god. I just think that everyone deserves a chance to prosper in this life of chaos and despair. THank god for football and the season being at hand this is the time of year that i remember how to live life‚Ä¶to be strong, because I played that sport for so many years taught me how to get thru any problem and always knew I had back up. Some of the biggest things that bring me issues is the fact that people either are a)over eager and bug ya to death(im guilty of this at times) or b.) they are so wishy washy they never commit to shit or just back out without the courtesy of letting you know. I am not singleing out one particular instance so if you have feelings behind anything i say look at it. I know people arent perfect but this has nothing to do with perfection or lack of. This has to do with a selfcentered self imposing gradification at the expense of others feelings, and even their kindness. Trust issues we all have, but where did they come from? from being burnt over and over by a neglectful continuem of programmed immorality passed on from generation to generation. This society we live in today is such a far cry from what I knew it once‚Ä¶.its a dog eat dog world and unfortuantly its your soul that gets engolfed in the meat grinder of life. There is addiction, there are suicides, there are marraiges that are just that‚Ä¶.no love, no trust, only the guilt of the vow that keeps you together, there are vampires that suck the life out of the weak, the ones that take advantage of kindness just to further their own intentions. Sadly I hope that it changes because I see a generation I counsel as cold, callous, and non feeling about anything. There is a deadness in their eyes that even the kindest intentions get ripped to shreds‚Ä¶.where has it gone/ how did it get this bad/ we are about to engulf another anniversary of 9/11‚Ä¶..just another rememberance of fallen individuals for one day we remember while we are so caught up in scandals.., talkin bout the state of the union, but no one takes the initiative to step out on faith and demonstrate their beliefs. ONe nation under god‚Ä¶but to alot they have no clue what that means., but this day in age everyone is a ""christian"". Deception from the enemy. The times are grim, the smiles of the devil take the innocense of the saved. Temptation is everywhere., and we are losing the battle. You have to ask yourself if i died today‚Ä¶.where would i go? we ban together on every issue in the name of tragedy for the medias sake, give out ribbons, give out tshirts, make tribute videos, but really do we understand what its for? is it the memory of the fallen or is it about our own self gratification and guilt. ? In the land of the walking dead something must change‚Ä¶..because words arent enough anymore. jesus died on the cross for this? how we slap him in the face ‚Ä¶.you stand for nothing‚Ä¶you will fall for anything ‚Ä¶and even though i was general in all i talked about in here not only am i general about it i to am guilty of it, it is time for me to clean my own house so that i may be a inspiration to a younger generation‚Ä¶.will you join me?

Another birthday has come and gone and you know what? I am sober and still awake at one in the morning. I was thinking what was going on six years ago at this time. I had just went to johnathons in denton with traci and amanda, we were there just hanging out drinking, and after that went back to the apartment on dallas drive and passed out. I was asleep when my brother called me at about noon one oclock telling me ""we are at war"". I was like hazily thinking what the hell‚Ä¶.? i was hungover and groggy and thinking damn am i still in a dream, well amanda came home and i couldnt quit watching the images on the tv‚Ä¶.we went to sams club that night and traffic was soooo bad‚Ä¶.we both were like in a haze‚Ä¶.wow‚Ä¶.fast forward ‚Ä¶.here we are on the anniversary yet another year and we are still fighting people that are trying to do us harm. ‚Ä¶sad.
I just got back from watchin superbad at the theatre‚Ä¶it was funny but kinda juvenile‚Ä¶lol. oh well, i needed a good laugh. I spent sunday with my family and played with toby and his playdough‚Ä¶awesome stuff i tell ya;) he is soooo loveable i am glad he is my nephew‚Ä¶.so easy to love him. I am getting sleepy just thought i would empty my head before i went to bed‚Ä¶.thank you lord for another year‚Ä¶..god bless.

I am at work right now and going to have a staffing here in about two hours or so. I am feeling good, just tired and sleepy. I woke up at seven thirty and hit the treadmill for like thirty minutes and worked up a great sweat and felt great now i just want to lay down for a nap‚Ä¶hehehe‚Ä¶.my body is like oh okay you worked hard now its time to relax‚Ä¶due to the client schedule and long day i am unable to do that. oh well, this to shall pass.

            the humbled shal be set free
            Let me start off by saying I am a sinner. Not in the announcement that I am proud but for years that shame/guilt has kept me inprisoned by the devils grasp. I was on here and decided to lay down but my heart was heavy and decided to write about it. I have some friends that are at their ends of this world, and it appears that every road they take leads to another dead end. I have been there it started when i was born came into this world fighting not given a chance to live because my heart was ill..my lungs werent developed the list goes on and on. I had so many trials and tribulations that lead me into a family of dysfunction that created the path where i would never return but it sure lead me to you oh heavenly father. I had been lost for so many years searching, seeking, having doors closed in my face often times by my own doing, my own inability to ask for help, the prideful things "" i would not do"" to get me back on track. I have had a lot of people in my life that god placed in front of me that guided and guided with their love, i didnt see it then but it isnt until i see my life in others that i understand why i went thru those things, not to brag or speak of them in a entitled way but to share it with others that they to can rise above by being weak and allowing god to do for them what they cannot. I was told give it to god‚Ä¶.give it to god‚Ä¶and i didnt believe had no faith that is all it took, and it took obedience on my part to start the ball rolling, to keep it going in the right direction with the help of those that had more faith then i at my weakest moments. I dove into the bottle more then once in my journey often times swearing i would never come out, i have hidden out for years, in the darkness of my own insanity wishing for one person to come save me of my own demise‚Ä¶.they came they were burned up by the insanity of the flames that seemed to cultivate around me in all i touched. only one reached me and planted the seed that has eventually grown into a rooted oak of faith. GOd is my savior is my light is my glory. They talk about finding god if you have tried all else i didnt ever believe i needed him. but for so long, i tried it and failed and failed and failed‚Ä¶i blamed my life my past my upbringing, my parents, my circumstances‚Ä¶.but i was unwilling to change, unwilling to be humbled to the point of rebirth. my friends i am speaking of are spinning in a web of uncertainty the web of "" i am not giving up "" but you know what‚Ä¶this world doesnt change for us, we must change where we become not of the world but of a higher existance, a higher calling. it takes time, it takes getting to that point where you are truelly sick and tired of being sick and tired, i know all these sayings i hated them, because they sounded like a bunch of shit and there was no way they or anything else would save me in my situation ‚Ä¶but I WAS wrong‚Ä¶..and looking back on it have been wrong in alot of ways‚Ä¶.time to wake up and be humbled to the possibility of change and the possibility that you have a lfie that is not your own, everytime i tried to kill my soul i was saying god you made a mistake i will take you out by killing myself in the bottle, the dysfunctional relationships i got into the self gratification i seeked, i thought i knew best‚Ä¶.lord i ask that you watch over these people that come into my path not for saving but for guidance that leads to you, because you are the only one that can help them. I am not that strong and my words are just testimony of your undying salvation for my soul. I have been down i have been out‚Ä¶.i have walked with shame‚Ä¶i have walked with defeat and i allowed my soul to die, til you came and said martin i can make it all go away..the pain, the chaos the uncertainty‚Ä¶until then you will walk around dead until you meet the earth again. i gave up on this world along time ago but in god i have eternity even as i walk it. hang on to strong people when you are not strong, go to church when you dont want to go, take the small things and build on them the simplest forms is faith, hope and love‚Ä¶.the greatest of these three is love‚Ä¶.give and give and sit back and be still the blessings are on their way‚Ä¶sometimes slowly but not ever in our time but in our fathers‚Ä¶.hang on!! there is no one person place or thing on this earth worth living your existance for, because they cant get you into heaven, they cant be your world when one day you will need salvation tokeep you out of eternal damnation. heed the warnings on the wall, only one can that one is god‚Ä¶.please give him a chance to change your walk, your thoughts, because without him we have nothing only temporary finances, like sand thru our fingers our money goes and so does our lives‚Ä¶..one day you wake up and your moments are just a glimpse of sand in the hourglass of your life‚Ä¶..and then you are faced with a decision which road will you take‚Ä¶.will you listen to the words that hold your soul in their hands‚Ä¶.thank you heavenly father‚Ä¶.please continue to pull at the hearts of uncertainty‚Ä¶the hearts of pain and despair and bring them to their knees til they find what you spent years showing me‚Ä¶..YOU. without you i would not be anything, i would not have my sanity or serenity. please find him yall‚Ä¶..build that foundation on a cornerstone of strength instead of building your home on quicksand and of the world. god bless you‚Ä¶.this to shal pass‚Ä¶..help is on the way‚Ä¶hang in there wait on him‚Ä¶..call out to jesus‚Ä¶..in the darkest moments of insanity he clears it all he holds you when you are broken and weak‚Ä¶.we are here for one second in time‚Ä¶.please humble yourself and grab gods hand of grace and certainty‚Ä¶..love you all ‚Ä¶.hang in there‚Ä¶.:) night.

I am home on a saturday night.with a mind full of thoughts. I come to this place now instead of the world because it doesnt judge or condemn my thoughts or behaviors. I have had a tough day today had a ""drinking dream"" and woke up wanting a drink so bad i could taste it. I didnt complete the scenerio though I went and started calling people to talk to them about my feelings. I have been edgy and angry today for some reason. I just feel that life is really just a lil strange today. I read so much into the world, I hear so much spoken, I take almost everything as face value and alot of times personalize it. I am not that mighty but as every addict knows ""the world"" does revolve around us. I have not been in a state like this in quite awhile but I have been real active both mentally and physically so my body is just tired im sure. I am not a young man anymore. I am listening to the lord in the music on my player. I know he is with me, all he needs is me to speak to him. I have friends in my life that are struggling, that are worried, that have issues with finances, and all kinds of things that I at this moment dont have for once. I remember what it was like trying to get the money for this or that, how to pay the cell bill, get tags, etc etc‚Ä¶.I am so thankful I give all these to my lord almighty. I must be proactive in the sequence also because when i take the wheel and want it all, i just make a mess of it. I saw a show called intervention last night about this guy that is a heroin addict ‚Ä¶and how his family had hurt badly cause of it‚Ä¶.i watched this and really have forgotten how bad it can ""really"" be. I have never done any other hard drug other then alcohol and marijuana, but still the lifestyle was something I was huge in. I never lived on the streets, I never had to steal for it, but you know, on the inside we all share a common bond in our lives‚Ä¶..the pain i felt in my dream that transferred to reality today. I feel deep today, and at times most of my life it has felt like a hinderance to me, but i tried to keep myself numb because of it. I felt so bad for this guy‚Ä¶.his family ‚Ä¶.the addiction had that grip on him so much‚Ä¶..his life revolved around it. I am so glad I didnt go drink‚Ä¶.wouldnt have solved a damn thing. I am sober now for two months. I slipped one day and felt like shit after that. I am proud to say two months. It may not seem long but it is to someone that had it every weekend or on crisis situations. Mark isnt drinking either we are keeping each other accountable. My heart is heavy today, i k now without these days i could never appreciate the sunny ones:) i am not sad, i am¬† not depressed, i am just longing‚Ä¶.i havent been kissed, or hugged in a longgg time now, and you know as silly as it sounds for a guy to talk like this‚Ä¶.i miss it. not because of who i am‚Ä¶.but because of what youve done‚Ä¶not because of what ive done‚Ä¶..i am yours lord‚Ä¶.right now my mind is wanting control and ""fun"" but i know deep in the depths of my soul that fun has killed me for years. I am a better person with out it. I will makie it if only one second at a time‚Ä¶.i am someone special, i am a child of god. I am not a f‚Äôup anymore. I still struggle with these thoughts because of the total isolation i have brought my life to be. i dont trust people because i dont want to party partake in high risk behavior or just be around those that dont know the lord. It is hard to find the true people from the ones that claim to be a christian. i know the difference.., but sometimes im already deep in the friendship and overlook crap to be accepted. listen to me‚Ä¶.im 36 and thinkin i sound like a fifteen year old kid‚Ä¶.insanity.¬† progression rather then perfection. i keep telling myself that over and over and over‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.let me feel you lord let me fell you in all that i am‚Ä¶.all that i wish to become let me feel you in all that is attempted to be taken away ‚Ä¶..i wont stray from your love, your forgiveness‚Ä¶.i love you to much and you love me as well‚Ä¶.nothing matters in my world without you‚Ä¶..daddy here i am‚Ä¶‚Ä¶here i am‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.clean the brow of your son as i sit here with the tears rolling down my face as i weep for the world that there are so many hurting people, so many lost, as i attempt to continue to stay in your light as well‚Ä¶this is no joke, no game‚Ä¶‚Ä¶all that i know about it, all that i see it takes‚Ä¶..for once my eyes are opened and i want to repay the kingdom for the love and affection you have given me. father here i am‚Ä¶.send me‚Ä¶..send me‚Ä¶..for they may laugh they may stare, they may ridicule, but your love keeps me strong‚Ä¶.i love you so much for your daily love and grace. my soul gets so tired just praising i feel it so deep!‚Ä¶.please help those that still hurt‚Ä¶..that still doubt, that still suffer from the grasp of addiction and shame‚Ä¶.let them continue calling out to you‚Ä¶..heavently father please cleanse my soul tonight‚Ä¶‚Ä¶in your precious sons name i pray‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶amen:)

You can‚Äôt quit until you try You can‚Äôt live until you die You can‚Äôt learn to tell the truth Until you learn to lie

I know some things that you don‚Äôt I‚Äôve done things that you won‚Äôt There‚Äôs nothing like a trail of blood to find your way back home 
I was waiting for my hearse What came next was so much worse It took a funeral to make me feel alive

I am sitting here listening to this song‚Ä¶it was written on the heroin diaries by nikki sixx. I saw a interview with him the other night on vh1 and he has been in recovery after oding on heroin and done things that anyone in a life of addiction has surely done. I fight the battle daily not to drink but like he stated ""being honest"" for some reason i am a person that fears conflict, fears the appearance of not having it all together, but in trying to hide all this i just mess it up worst with the lies. I clean myself up and then just to dirty myself up again. I am still sober but doesnt mean that there are not some areas in my life that need sobriety. I try‚Ä¶thats all i can say‚Ä¶wow i am in a zone that i cant explain‚Ä¶i deeper consciousness to the understanding of my life and the life of others that have traveled down the same road..be back in a bit to write more‚Ä¶clients here.

Permission
I apologize
That your memory serves you more than I can now
You‚Äôll have to make sense of my life somehow
Yeah, somehow
Well, I close my eyes
Remove each piece of armor one by one
Inhale this moment deep into my lungs
Make amends for all I‚Äôve done
All of my devils are free at last
And all my secrets revealed
And your permission is all I
Need to heal
Well how long have I
Been sitting here, I must have drifted off
I cannot finish any of my thoughts
Forgive me for my wayward shot
All of my devils are free at last
And all my secrets revealed
And your permission is all I
Need to heal
I wake up in the morning, and it comes back to you
I breathe in I breathe out, it comes back to you
I stare up at the ceiling, and it comes back to you
I step out my front door, and it comes back to you
The end of my driveway, it comes back to you
Brakelights on the highway, it comes back to you
I could die in Los Angeles.
It would come back to you.
All of my devils, they are free at last, oh
And all my secrets are revealed, yeah
And your permission is all that I,
I need to feel
All of my devils, they are free at last, oh
And all my secrets are revealed, yes they are
And your permission is all that I need.

Hey journal:)
how goes it? all is well at this moment as i type into the abiss of the cursored screen of demand. I have had some feelings and thoughts the last couple days about the world of addiction that I have for some delusional or just lack of understanding of it totally. I know that one thing for certain it takes and takes and takes.. No matter how many days go by without a drink i know i am just one situation or one corner away from one. I dont want it and for once am situationing my life to help me sustain that promise to me. I have denied myself, my love ones and others in my life the glory of seeing the true me. I have been down roads with no names, seen and used people with no faces, in the end the same result came me on the ground wishing something or someone would make it all go away and praying to a god i didnt know would take it away. I yearned for the existance of serenity and calmness but as soon as it came, boom i would make it in to a managable situation that i had power and control over, thus harming and making the good surely turn into a mess of dysfunction that was called my life. I have been following the heroin diaries and even have the soundtrack. I have forgotten for some reason that I have felt that intense lost and insecure feeling in my life. I have somehow created a life with no pain no worries, and no one in it that i can manage. That is no life, that is being protective of a prison environment that i have created for my soul. God is my guard and i am doing life with no parole. I am no pity parting it, but being honest with my perception as i see it. It may be destorted it may be romantisized, but in the end ‚Ä¶.we still had everything to gain but i lived like i was dying.¬† Not wanting to be aware of the triggers, the scenerios the high risk situations that have all been a cultivation of insanity based theory. I talk about my life in this not because I am proud of this‚Ä¶it takes all i have to be honest in this thing, to write my true insecure feelings, my real feelings, thoughts bout situations. I dont write to save anyone, or touch anyones heart, i write to cleanse my mind of the insanity that blazes within the grey mater of the flameful torch. I have tried so many times not to lose, not to push away, not to get to close, because in the end it was goodness i have feared the most, because for so many years‚Ä¶.shit was my aroma that i thought a rose smelt like. I didnt know clean, i didnt know calm, or that there was serenity in the meshes of the carpet of life we call our soul. I felt that i had done to much to go on‚Ä¶seen to much to want to continue replaying in my mind day in day out. I hated the shadow that i had become in my own reflection. I wonder if you have seen that world? if you know what it is like to wake up in the land of the addicted, the land of confusion and the land of denial and wanting to rebel against everything that is right for you, to be wanting to fight even when there is no war to win but to destroy all that goodness stands for. even though drinking has been a off and on occurance in my life, women were my drug of choice and i had good quality bad quality and in between. I have been clean from any for awhile and its like a constant shake to get in something that is anything. I crave it i crave the total existance of it. I want to get to a point where i can view a woman as the image of beauty and respect they deserve not as a object to devour and use up and get high off of, and then descard. I havent wrote in this for a bit like this because of the shame of being honest in this, the judgement, the see i told you he is still sick‚Ä¶blah bs. Dont have to hide it from anyone ‚Ä¶.anyone that knows me i sure either loves me still or hates me with every breath they breathe. IT has alwasy been that way. I can apologize a million times over but you know waht im trying to forgive martin from all that i have done to not only others., but to myself. I have my good days, i have my bad days, but i am sober, and i am still trying amist not having very much in my circle of imprisonment that i caused my self. wehn you are so full of pain and tired of hurting others and even dont care about yourself, you choose to find a way to hide away other then killin yourself. I chose imprisonment‚Ä¶.and isolation. I am in my own prison. I dont see it as terminal, i will see light of day and the days etch closer each moment i continue to learn about life and coping with it appropriately. I have no one really that believes in me that still talks to me, so i have all the time to self talk myself thru some tough times, and there has been many‚Ä¶, but i still want a hug, a kiss, a kind word, ‚Ä¶..guess sometimes what you want isnt always what you get cause i had it, and i didnt know how to keep it. i rebelled against it. I will make it i am certain, i will honesty is a b* but sometimes there is no other way‚Ä¶.later journal‚Ä¶..talk again soon my friend. god bless.

I have been waking up off and on all night long no particuliar reason other then being restless, my thoughts in my mind were going a million miles a second in my dream. It is always the same sequence in there the thoughts of overcoming and continueing to rescue myself from the intensity of the obstacles that appear larger then life. In this dream I was in a farm of animals that I was smaller then any of and the obstacles were huge. It stunk it was a place of desolate carcass and just nasty. I was going thru this maze type environment trying to reach ""the road"" which was to freedom and escape. I was with some high school buddies and they were falling off behind me. I met a group of people that were just no good, and i still was trying to reach out to defuse the potential harm that they wanted to inflict on us. I know this sounds strange but its a dream so deal with me. I woke up and had martina mcbrides song valentine in my heart. She sings a melody of peace and security in her voice. I was thinking in my mind as i slept it was like a interview i was giving someone. I would hear a question asked and then I would proceed to answer it. 
what do you feel about love today martin?¬† I feel love is something that is given when you realize the power to forgive the events in your past and present to understnad that perfection is not necessary just a connection from the heart. (that has always been me, though even though that sounds insightful and what not‚Ä¶how the hell do i get there and what does it mean to me? ) 
why is pain and suffereing a recurrant theme for you in your life martin? maybe the road god has laid for me‚Ä¶who knows.
are you ever happy? yes i have been happy when ever i dont have to give so much to others and i feel a balance is there, of give and take. roadtrips make me happy, visiting new places makes me smile, and being with those in my life that make me feel safe and secure make me happy. 
do you believe in god and that without him your life is unmanageable? i believe in god with all that i am‚Ä¶i guess it just makes me sad though that i see him working in me, and for the most part without harm or derest and in other peoples lives i sit and watch them go spiraling down the tube day in day out, and i feel so powerless to do anythnig about it. I know i am not god but what type of person in their heart can watch people hurt, want to die, want to continue medicating and be okay just sayin oh well ‚Ä¶..go with god im sorry i am not built that way. but i must endure the pain in order not to enable them or kill them further. how do you save someone from themselves when its the demons from within they battle with only one can do that. yah god exists i see it, i feel it. sometimes i just dont know how not to cleanse my guilt and shame from watchin people die and hurt in front of me, without losing myself in it.
will love and family, ever happen for you? I am sure it will‚Ä¶.i hold out for it anyways. I am not a victim or a broken piece that is not worth that anymore, but i guess the problem would be does anyone see enough in me to take a chance on. 
what scares you the most martin? that i wlll always feel ""outside"" of society, that people will never trully understand the beatings of my heart and soul, and not think negative of my words or actions.
¬†
i had these questions asked of me in my dream so i had to write them down with the answers i remember giving. right now i dont care about how im perceived. I am wide open exposed to the world a person that just wants to be accepted thats it. i guess i find it frustrating because i can see the potential and pain in my clients and even in people in society and i dont judge them and always look for the good part in them , but i feel like alot of times i dont get that from others and not that i could change them, but it still makes me think‚Ä¶.do you look sad? unapproachable? do you really care? i could drive myself crazy with all this but i had to get it out‚Ä¶.i do love you martin. sometimes that has to be enough. enough to continue on in a world where people hurt others, where people lie to others, where people deceive others, and where truth is hard to come by. still keep searching, cause god didnt make us not perfect its our self will that directs us out of his intention. please lord‚Ä¶.i am weak, i am viewing myself as unloveable, and tired tired‚Ä¶.i dont hear from anyone that i still hold dear in my heart, because ""recovery"" states its not good not to‚Ä¶oh well‚Ä¶.just let them know i still love them‚Ä¶.i think about them daily‚Ä¶people tell me martin your not alone‚Ä¶.but you know on this earth i am‚Ä¶.i really am. but oh well i made this bed i must lay in it. bye

I want to be in a position to assist not necessarily be in control of such huge responsibility of someones life. I may do it later on in life when i am further down the pipe with my own progression right now I am just to angry at the field in general, for two years i struggled, i fought for and lost due to my giving more to this then my life, and i have resentments from that. Wow i just stepped away from the computer and came back and was like whoa was i in a trance‚Ä¶i know the lord has me for what he needs me for.¬† listening to this playlist just takes me back to sometimes in my mind‚Ä¶i am no more the saddend person i once was the lost soul i was the untrusting one‚Ä¶i am a child of god with earthly struggles and free will issues. I was driving home from my brothers last night after the game thinking you know‚Ä¶how far my life has changed but still the simple things always remain. I love the concept of family values watching toby get ready for bed, him running after me while i picked him up and knowing the little girl is on the way in about two or three weeks‚Ä¶:) that is truelly a blessing for these children to be coming into a world where they are loved. My brother has come along way even though he isnt perfect by no means he provides for them and loves kimbre with all h e is i know that. Toby is always smiling for the most part. I love to see that smile‚Ä¶.i can understnad it today:) cause i to feel happy like that for no reason other then just being‚Ä¶i hope i get the oppt for a child someday maybe two three or five. hehehe damn sinus meds got me going‚Ä¶lol seriously i do want a child ‚Ä¶ but one lesson that i always hear in my head‚Ä¶must love the mama to show the child that he/she is loved. 
I miss things that i have had that somehow i didnt know how to keep ‚Ä¶.at 36 i guess i really understand the importance of realism more then fantasy ‚Ä¶damn took me long nuff. I am not perfect and at times say things or do things out of impulse lonliness or desparity to show others that I could be ""the one"" for them or what not, but i dont need to prove it to anyone but me i need to be more aware of that. I have girls on my myspace page that i leave comments for thinking if they see how good a person i am they would date me or what not but in reality i dont need that drama‚Ä¶cause my heart is closed off ‚Ä¶.i do that on impulse on lonly nights stupid crap‚Ä¶.that isnt me and im worth more then that. I want substance not quanity. I can search and search but only god knows where or who she is‚Ä¶.well‚Ä¶.time for staffing must direct and gude and actually work‚Ä¶.have a great day journal‚Ä¶..help me love myself as i am sick today‚Ä¶..muah* martin.

Alone Doesn‚Äôt Have to Mean Lonely
by Joyce Meyer 
¬†
A major problem facing many people today is loneliness. As I travel the world, I see an increasing number of people requesting help and guidance on handling loneliness in their lives. 
In the Bible God tells us we are not alone. He wants to deliver, comfort and heal us. But when people encounter painful losses in their lives, sadly, many never get over them. Sometimes when sudden tragedy occurs, the hurt seems unbearable. Without help, a sense of loneliness can actually settle on a person or family like a cloud, and it doesn‚Äôt seem to go away. 
There are many causes of loneliness, but many people don‚Äôt realize that they don‚Äôt have to live with it. They can confront it and deal with it. Loneliness often manifests as an inner ache, a vacuum, or a craving for affection. Its side effects include feelings of emptiness, uselessness or purposelessness. 
Are you alone (independent, solitary, on your own)? Or, are you lonely (desolate, deserted, dejected due to a lack of companionship)? There is a very real difference. It‚Äôs important to realize that just because you are alone, it doesn‚Äôt mean you must be lonely or lonesome. While it may not always be possible to avoid being alone, there are always answers to loneliness. Many times loneliness results from a trauma or crisis due to the death of a loved one, a divorce, or separation. When something happens that makes us realize that things are never going to be the way they once were, it often creates crisis or trauma in our lives, which can lead to a sense of loneliness and despair. 
Like a healing wound, the pain may be felt for a long time, but complete recovery requires daily improvement. When a physical wound refuses to heal, it indicates there‚Äôs an infection that must be dealt with. I believe the same is true of emotional wounds: the emotional part of us should heal just like the physical part of us. God gave us emotions just as He gave us physical bodies. He has provided for our emotional restoration in Him just as He has provided for it physically. While it is true that you may always miss the person or the thing that was lost, it doesn‚Äôt mean that you must suffer permanent loneliness. 
I believe there are two things anyone wishing to overcome loneliness must do:¬†
1. Know that God is with you all the time. In the Bible God reminds us that He is always with us and He‚Äôll never forsake us (see Hebrews 13:5). Loneliness often leads us to ask ourselves all sorts of questions that can‚Äôt be answered, such as: What if I am alone for the rest of my life? What if this pain I am feeling never goes away? What if a problem arises that I don‚Äôt know how to handle on my own? What if‚Ä¶what if‚Ä¶what if‚Ä¶? The questions could go on and on endlessly. Chances are, you‚Äôll never be able to answer the ""what ifs"" in life. But as long as you know that the Lord is with you, you can be assured that He has all the answers you need. 
2. Press aggressively into a new life. Not everything in your life is over; just one part of it has ended. One season has passed and another can now begin‚Äîif you are willing to take action. Don‚Äôt just passively sit and wait for something to happen or someone to come along. Go make new friends. Find someone else who is lonely and be a friend to that person. You will reap what you sow, and God will return that friendship many times over. 
Let the loneliness you feel turn into compassion for other lonely people, and then decide to do something about it!¬†¬†

I have been sick the last week and I am starting to feel better from it. I had a upper respitory infection and sinusitis. I am just waiting for my group to start and decided to write a little bit. I noticed that it was a little cooler outside today and fall is finally upon us. The above reading was the website that i read occasionally and joyce has alot of good information to pass on. I was watching her show the other day on the tv and it is amazing how some of the things she was saying can just make so much sense once you allow it to be a part of your being. It is early to be here especially on a friday‚Ä¶im trying to get motivated for the morning session. One thing that being sick teaches you is that when you have trouble breathing or what not, it can always be worst on the other side. Often times it is, I have had alot of clients relapse recently and its like they just give up on the program or lack of having faith in there could be something different. I can see why they would but you know like I have been told you make your own choices and choose to make the mistakes, sometimes when ever you come back around life still holds you in the non pleasant light. Oh well, I am okay with that and I tell my clients that just because you are clean and sober it doesnt mean that what you did to people will disappear or there wont be consequences. I think that is the hardest lesson to learn is that even though you have started on a new path sometimes you destroyed so much the worst fear is often realized. Well, gotta get to group‚Ä¶..have a great friday‚Ä¶:) god bless.

good morning diary:)
woke up feeling much better then yesterday praise the lord. I came home yesterday afternoon after a long day i was sweating perfusely and was still weak. I dont feel as weak this morning. That is a great thing. I just woke up from a dream that was a page out of my life. the life that at times is so weird that only god knows why it happens the way it does. It is a calm saturday morning as rascal flatts sings on. The song is what hurts the most‚Ä¶love that song the words are so deep and his voice cuts thru all and is so convicting.¬† I was watching joyce meyers yesterday before group talking about faith and how its easy to have faith but what gets us into trouble is when we start to think about it and try to make it what we want it to mean. I have held onto others faith along this road of insanity that has been my life, and in tune resentments were formed anger raged and relationships severed. Like i tell my clients in this life of addiction the one thing that is certain is that you and i have been thieves we steal,manipulate, and lie to get a edge on the next and learn to not face consequences due to being one step ahead of the ""game"" that is insanity and it is a load of crap‚Ä¶she also said that those of us that have been abused spend the rest of our lives acting like people owe us‚Ä¶this was so profound because that is so true subconciously we feel we are owed love, respect, dignity, etc‚Ä¶.but you know no one does. we owe ourselves to rise above our situations and get a life that we can manage and a life that has god first and everything else after that. sorry just went to take my prozac‚Ä¶forgot to take it last nite. my thought is just jumping off my mind on this page cause like always i have lots to say and it ever seldom makes sense to anyone but myself. 
Joyce talked about forgiveness‚Ä¶forgiveness of self‚Ä¶we tend to forgive others first of their stuff but we carry that forgiveness/resentment in our heart so we re-live the event over and over as our fear mounts. She said it is okay to forgive ourselves and still doesnt mean we have to be okay with the person place or thing that has harmed us. I have played the victim for alot of years and thought well woe is me, as long as i seek out and search for a different life then my struggle will equal one. once again‚Ä¶bull* . The life i have always wanted and seen has always been right before me in front of my face and it has for years been so deluted and hazed over i never saw it. I have been told just live your life let the old crap down , but i was to busy preparing for a life i neve rknew existed within me at the moment. I am saddend that when people look at it it brings the worst out of them, that is something i have tried to avoid happening to anyone that i cared about. once again trying so hard to control things lead me to just destroy all that i didnt understand. I understand that it is okay for others to feel and project their opinions or pain towards me that is okay we all hurt in different ways. 
I think alot of times it is viewed that i am a needy person, but for the most part that is inaccurate my addiction is a using one. martin doesnt need or want to need, while my addiction tells me that i need excess to be happy. I dont want to reach out and have people know my business or for them to even get a notion that i am weak and dont have it all together, my addiction is the one that causes me lookin for things of substance to devour, such as niceness, gentleness, and genuine things that for years I was unable to give myself. I dont reach out so when i do that is progression on my part , but since my addiction has ravaged and destroyed so much i can understand the perception of me just trying to get in again and use people placces or things. I dont want things usually and i have had in excess the life over, it is one thing that has always alluded me that money can not buy. It is safety in the arms of another and love that i can understand and not as joyce says ""tear apart"" . that is where faith comes in when someone loves you, faith that god has that love in your interest and it will not harm you. that has been my area that when i feel safety or other things threatened i start picking away at it and picking away at it, letting my addiction dictate my thinking where i go to porn girls and other unmentionables for comfort. 
I am writing this not in shame or in the need to justify my behavior but my dreams or so vivid i need a place to rid the garbage of the mind so that i can have a chance at living a normal life. i have done dreadful things when it comes to being a part of my life to others none which i am proud or making excuse for, i just type in here not to relive or inflict pain but to rid these thoughts so that i can somehow allow gods thoughts and direction to guide me instead of my own. i struggle with that, i struggle with¬† good orderly direction but I am trying attempting to actually walk it even if i dont understand it. its not mine to control or even to understand. two songs i am listening to by rascal flatts ""mywish"" and ""what hurts the most"" ‚Ä¶..
i guess my wish for humanity since i have affected so many is that gods will and grace be with them when they hurt at a rememberance or at the perception that ""the monster"" is back attempting to harm again. I dont want any of that and like i have stated above need it. i have created a prison from this person that you know all so well. Have for years the attempt is to not close the bars and never come out for fear that i can never be like you or anyone else that i have seen does know love and understanding and care. a prison of my own making ‚Ä¶.i am attempting to keep the bars down to keep the positive thoughts continueing to come in. I know that my life is baby steps and just in the last couple years i have gone backwards but when i look in the mirror i see a sober person that can continue to stay free from the bars of insanity‚Ä¶.when i get scared and when i get confused i lock myself up but often times it is to late, the harm has already been done. There is nothing you say or do that can harm me more then my own memories. I am glad that you are away from this insanity hell i read it and think good god ‚Ä¶.you are crazy dood! oh well, i call it what i ti is today just holding on for that sunshine in my day to build on and most days it is gods grace because martin has done so much that not many want anything to do with him. 
¬†
This is not pity or woe is me because when i go there it just adds ammo to my addiction. i write like i say out of emptying the brain so that that ray of sunlight can be let in. in my dream i was moving seperating things that were bought, things that were gifts and there was such pain in that dream because the one thing that i didnt want to leave was the one thing "" i hurt the most""¬† i never wanted money clothes material things‚Ä¶‚Ä¶its to get beyond my prison and not harm anyone or love enuff for it to never leave. i know that doestn make sense, but everything else in the life of a addict is attainable‚Ä¶its the love of self and the love of another that is our own hell.¬† thats why we drink, we drug, we have sex randomly, or view porn, whatnot. to just add to the self hatred one mor eblock at a time hopeing for it all to end‚Ä¶.someday‚Ä¶.somehow. 
&nb
sp;
well im getting sleepy again so i guess i can go back to bed without having any more nightmares or dreams that i cry my eyes out in them but waking up is the worst thing because at least in my dreams it happens naturally the way it is supposed to.. i love you guys and hope that your lives are full of nothing but happiness. I am holding on to that image daily that i can be able to love myself when the world tells me im unworthy of it or im a piece of shit‚Ä¶.somethings prozac doesnt work on‚Ä¶..but martin can with the help of the lord. my bible doesent ever let me down. god bless and have a great weekend world‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.

hey diary! whats up just sitting round waitin for my laundry to finish up and rounding off the night of a weekend of football watching. My team lost again this week and start off with a 1-3 start. Shameful. Oh well cant win them all, but i sure hope it turns around for them. It is truely life for them one moment on top of the world and having everything they desire in a football career and then losing the big game and having a hangover the next season only mustering one win. SHameful. My lil neice should be coming any day now I am so excited! I am heading to a baby store to get a infant car seat or somewhere cause they cant bring her home til she has one. I talked to my brother and we decided that if I was to get anything this would be more feasible a gift since they dont have one. I felt her kick the other day when i was there it was so cool to actually feel that ‚Ä¶.freaked me out at first but then you could like feel the lil feet and everything awesomeness. I am still coughing a little bit but no where weak as i was or burning up, so I think i am just working out the last of it out my system. I have paperwork this week so not gonna be a lot of work thank god. I really am looking into getting back in the gym a week and a half out of it and takes alot out of you‚Ä¶almost like starting over. I am feeling real positive at the moment even for no other reason then just being in the moment. I mowed a acre and a half of land this evening to so felt cool riding on the lawnmower gives you a chance to reflect on all that is good in your life and the ability to give thanks. I know i wrote a long entry the other day but had been storing that up for a long time now‚Ä¶oh well..why should i apologize that is what i started writing in this thing years ago for to rid the insanity out of my mind‚Ä¶.nothing else. 
¬†
I was just thinking about recovery in the sense you slip and ""hold your breath"" while the rest of the world is breathing‚Ä¶.until you almost die , then you exhale only to keep from passing out‚Ä¶well once you start learning not to hold your breath so long each time and enjoy each breath that is when you realize its not how many breaths you have but the things in your life that just you cherish as if they were never gonna go away. I hold out faith that the best is yet to come in my life even though at 36 alot of it has gone by but you know i cherish each day or try at least‚Ä¶hell tommorow i may be writing oh crap my life sucks blada blada‚Ä¶.hahaha‚Ä¶i hope not but as i go the texas wind does as well‚Ä¶.but just for this moment all the stars are aligned up and i feel ""sane"" and happy. 
¬†
In my dreams I can be anyone that I want without the fear of hurting anyone especially myself.
In my dreams I can run and be free without the fear of falling and never getting up again.
in my dreams I can be happy and sad while tears of joy roll down my face, and no one hates me for what ive done
in my dreams i can fly and listen as the voices tell me its okay to be smiling as i streak across the sky.
in my drams i am whole with no goodbyes.
in my dreams the weak walk with aggressive strides‚Ä¶in my dreams the sad laugh with no pain, in my dreams
no one knows how to feel a ounce of pain, in my dreams there is nothing but cookies and cream‚Ä¶.happy joyful laughter from a childs mouth where innocense is never taken away. 
in my dreams i will be there someday it is my heaven where i go back to being childlike and my innocense is once again pure and unblemished.
i used to hate to sleep because i dreamed nothing but nightmares and shame based behavior that i lived out in ral life the tricks that i used that were my calling call of smirks and lies, i was there to take in the excess of all that was in my grasp to keep the fire going in my souless heart of liquid toxic fire. Oh such a life I would not thrust on my own worst enemy‚Ä¶.the addicion of the flesh and the flow of the blood thirsty creation that is the master of all lies. 
¬†
well‚Ä¶..bedime for me heading to a place where the lord keeps me safe even if my nights are full of questions cause my mind always asks‚Ä¶.and asks‚Ä¶‚Ä¶lol‚Ä¶.just feel martin‚Ä¶let it happen‚Ä¶.dont be afraid‚Ä¶‚Ä¶dont have to control it all for it to make sense and for all to be just the way it was ment to be‚Ä¶.keep your heart and mind on the lord and everything else will work itself out in given time‚Ä¶. dont leave before the miracle happens‚Ä¶..god bless night*

hey diary‚Ä¶
It is midnight and i was laying in bed ruminating in my head all that has gone on today and trying to find peace with it before i went to bed. I know that alot are hurting tonight and i just want you to know you are in my prayers and in my thoughts. I keep hearing that song hurt by johnny cash going over and over in my head. I spoke tonight to my group about the instinct that drives us back to our addiction it isnt lack of or to much of‚Ä¶its the inner core that depends on the chemical to make everything equal. It has nothing to do with sober time or the goal towards at one point in your life you must give your all to god ‚Ä¶we are told there is no cure for this and we must live with it day by day but you know imagine in your heart a glimpse of hope and love‚Ä¶.then you get comfortable and forget you have a disease that is just waiting to get you when you feel all is manageable and you can be ""normal"" like everyone else. I told my group about my struggles in sobriety the fears, the losses and the thievery it has taken from all that loved me. 
I identified my addiction as a pimp for my soul and i am its hoe. It is waiting to trick me out and make me do things that are unspeakable to people i love to hold my head in shame when i know i live amongst the lost and the dead but still it tells me everything will be okay, one more time my dear friend. such lies echo a life of no existance and no life of any kind of decency. I lost for years to my addiction and it brought more and more shame each time i went to the chemical that tore apart my life as well as those that loved me, time and again i would ask when is enough enough. I know that it is different for all of us, but me being the extremist I was i wanted to beat it and never lose again. I got to the point that i understand today as i sit here sober and clear headed. IT isnt about strength it isnt about surrender its about what length you are willing to remain clean and sober no MATTER what. See each of us lose in this disease but sometimes we dont lose enough. Because how can you lose anymore then your own soul? a mom, a dad , a brother, a family or existance of‚Ä¶.it all is interchangeabel with the bottle for the moment. Because just like they tell us we are powerless over it, so it is more powerful then anything but god himself., and without that faith we continue to try and try again‚Ä¶.hoping to win the family, to win the life we always say we want in our drunken conversations wanting to believe it in the end‚Ä¶, but the powerfulness of the one that never lets us down‚Ä¶.its like a filler of the soul that no ones love can come close to, its a deterant to truth, to serenity to a life of existance among the liveing. To hide out in a stupor while we can ""fit"" in anywhere. We choose our friends not to fit with them but to have onething above them whether it be looks, money, families, or even a car‚Ä¶..something to manipulate them with and get what we want from. It is a filthy game but its one that our addiction teaches us well. ITs a monet in our heads while to the rest of the world it is just a pile of crap. Please understand that we love you with all that it will share us with you. IT is our one our only friend, it never lies to us we think, it doesnt say good job or why dont you change..its all equal in this playing field of insanity. I have loved it with all the cursing as i puked it from my inner coil, as my whining won me one more cent for this wishing well. I lost i have loved in a stupor of indecency i called home. To you i am trashy a whore who knows no truth but in the bottles of security I own all that you hold dear, it is me that it wants and you cant rid me of it. You try you cry you get angry and you defend only to push me further and further because I am already dead to the world , my head swirls in circles as you count the days i will come back again. I wonder just how far i will go this time without the chips in my pocket will i make it work? I dont take this as a game or take this as a test i take it as my life whom no one guides leaves me drunk at the end of the day. 
¬†
¬†
That above was a story of what my life used to be like. A abiss of insanity that tore from home to home. I wasnt proud of it but my shame/guilt kept me there. I will not let that happen to me ever again if god is my witness‚Ä¶ thats why i write in you diary to keep the thoughts from mounting up the hidden lies, the hidden mess that is my lustful heart of desire. I crave love as i have craved a drink and being drunk kept me in its hands for years because now i am loved not by anything of the earth hell if anything i have created hatred from anything or anyone that has uttered my name. I am just a existance of life that hopes to help all that i have torn down in my twisting and turning tornado that eventually settles ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.god has me‚Ä¶.the drink is just around the corner and my addiction gets stronger day to day‚Ä¶‚Ä¶i will never be cured no matter how many days i call "" my sobriety date"" but¬† you know at least i am in acceptance that i cant be around it, be with who i used to be with, and even entertain that thought ""i am normal"" because you know what? I am not never will and that is okay, because my addiction brings me to god every second i am weak, tonight i sinnned and i couldnt sleep until i wrote in here where before i would have went to sleep and hid that in my heart and in my head, to mount pressure for tommorows trials and tribulations. I am just martin today‚Ä¶‚Ä¶and that is good enough for me the face i see in the mirror ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶am i better then that person i described above? hell NO we are one in the same‚Ä¶..so you love me as you do or hate it as you will but in the end‚Ä¶.god created this out of a purpose i may never understand so as you will‚Ä¶‚Ä¶tell him your angry at his mistake i see me as unique with the ability to have a higher calling then just¬† a person who no one has the oppt to even know‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.alone doesnt mean lonely to me anymore‚Ä¶cause you know i have had that empire of dirt‚Ä¶‚Ä¶and in the end‚Ä¶.the whiskey came and made it all hurt‚Ä¶..so without it today as simple as it may be‚Ä¶.i can at least smile without the shame beneath my teeth. 
¬†
May god be with you in the times of your pain and hurt‚Ä¶.
may god guide your thoughts and know its okay to be upset and guess what?
relapse isnt part of recovery‚Ä¶‚Ä¶relapse is putting down your program and saying this shit doesnt work‚Ä¶i want to choose to stay using‚Ä¶..
so call it what it is‚Ä¶..a addicts way of staying in the dark amist the light that shines day in and day out in this persons life. 
someone told me martin you cant save the world ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶and you know what‚Ä¶.your not that good at it anyways."" 
may god hold you in his arms and your family as well‚Ä¶.i still love you even if you dont acknowledge i exist anymore‚Ä¶..will keep you all in my prayers‚Ä¶god bless‚Ä¶..
¬†
¬†
we hurt those that we love the most‚Ä¶..part of this freaking addiction where everything is backwards in our brains‚Ä¶.
good night‚Ä¶..

wow! push up casting crowns‚Ä¶once again this group has done it. The messege is loud and clear. I am listening to their new cd the alter and the door. This song is so true we never ever crumble in a day. It is a slow fade that started a long time ago. I went to see my lil nephew and my bros family last night got that infant carrier and took it over there. I also got toby a longhorns coat! man i am on a high that is unbelievable. I cant wait my lil neice is coming in about two weeks or so. Toby is already noticing the change and is acting out a lil bit due to his sissy coming.gotta get back to work‚Ä¶.be back in a few..:)
¬†
Okay im back‚Ä¶just doing paperwork has made me dizzy..lol. I have a conviction on my heart right now and i just told someone about prayer‚Ä¶.i have prayed alot of times‚Ä¶i mean alot! but one thing i forgot to do is step my butt out the way and leave them with the lord. To many times we ask and ask and ask‚Ä¶the questions‚Ä¶..but we never sit in solace and have the patience to allow him to work and take over. I have been guilty of this for a long time but I am jamming to this cd and it is just exploding my soul on fire to write and to testify. Learning to let go Jesus is goin to save the world but maybe the best thing we can do is GET out the way!! wow so powerful‚Ä¶.and another thing is that jesus is the only way to god‚Ä¶but we are not the only way to jesus‚Ä¶do you get what that means brothern? A spirit that will lead us to salvation in this time we need him the most‚Ä¶.there are so many lost souls, so many hurt and in pain., there are so many lost lost‚Ä¶..i have been there yall‚Ä¶..and at times if i dont step out the way and allow jesus to work‚Ä¶.i mess it up for the world‚Ä¶make promises, direct traffic in MY way not gods will‚Ä¶alot of times people dont need my perception of the gospel or the translation of recovery‚Ä¶.just need to plant the seed and lead to jesus‚Ä¶..and LET him work‚Ä¶he doesnt need me:) but still loves me anyways‚Ä¶.with all i am. 
I am a counselor‚Ä¶by no mistake‚Ä¶i am here by no mistake‚Ä¶..but this is a position that is not of glory or of huge rewards but you know what? Jesus gives me all i need! ‚Ä¶i just pray that i do no harm and his will. God bless you all‚Ä¶and if you dont know about my god? ask me‚Ä¶if you are scared to let go‚Ä¶ask and it shall happen. The work of calvary is done ‚Ä¶..meaning that we cant add to or take away from‚Ä¶it is the way its ment to be ‚Ä¶when we walk away from the lord we take it into our own hands and say I DONT NEED YOU. I need my drugs, my friends, my people that get me and my misery‚Ä¶..how foolish are we? even in rebellion we admit we are rebelling from a god of our understanding‚Ä¶.foolishness. I love you jesus with all i am‚Ä¶.and thank you so much for allowing such a person like myself to hold onto and love when i spend alot of time tearing myself down ‚Ä¶..thank you for not giving up on me like alot have.

Death and Sunflowers
On 9/11/01, my daughter and her family were here in San Diego for the wedding of an old friend. They had their gift nicely wrapped with a frothy bow, my daughter‚Äôs red silk shawl was freshly pressed, and her husband‚Äôs tux hung ready in the closet. But when those planes slammed into those towers, wedding guests on route from England and other places were turned back in midair.
With everyone mired in shock and grief, the wedding was called off. It was a time to gather for solace, so the bride and groom drove down from Pasadena, and two more thwarted guests came in from Redlands. We sat solemnly in my family room and watched the relentless TV reports.
We wept at the horrific scenes, played and replayed, and we found ourselves moved by the overwhelming displays of international sympathy. That day, people walked the length of London‚Äôs Oxford Street to the US embassy to sign the condolence book, and a man slowly rode his bike up the street, waving a huge American flag while people cheered him on.
At the Embassy, the statue of FDR was festooned with flowers and personal tributes. One note read, ""Today, we are all Americans."" Propped against the base of the statue was a photograph someone had taken of himself at the top of the World Trade Center and scattered around it were scribbled references to the British/American alliance in WWII. In the wake of a vicious act of hatred, the world loved America.
The day‚Äôs emotional dichotomy reminded me of a story I‚Äôd once read about an anti-American demonstration in the Middle East. Amid sign waving and shouting, one protester stopped long enough to chat with a journalist, and when he realized that the reporter was American, his eyes lit up. He so wanted to visit. He dreamed of taking his children to Disneyland!
Then, with the conversation over and no apparent sense of irony, he resumed chanting anti-American slogans. America seemed to exist for him as two opposing concepts-on the one hand, a big bad scapegoat for all the ills of the world, and on the other, a shining promise of the good life.
This double-edged sentiment, this human capacity to contain contradictory passions, was similar to the feeling in my family room on 9/11. While we tried to comprehend the scale of that day‚Äôs atrocities, the young couple sat close to each other on the sofa, and the bride murmured softly into the groom‚Äôs ear. He took her hand and said, ""We still want to get married.""
I looked at them, young and earnest and forward-looking, proof that life and death coexist, and that we must, we must, honor that balance and carry on.
While the murderers huddled in caves, we would go on living in the sun as a form of vengeance. Blind-sided by terrible loss, it might have been inappropriate to throw a splashy bash in a chic hotel, but it seemed entirely right and fitting to affirm the resilience of the human spirit, and so we had a wedding.
The bride held the sunflowers I‚Äôd had in a vase on the kitchen table, and my daughter selected a passage from Kahlil Gibran on friendship. There were eight of us, plus my one year old grandson. We stood around the stone Buddha under a palm tree in the garden while the couple recited their vows, and the backdrop of tragedy gave the moment weight and urgency. Even the baby, wide-eyed and sucking his thumb, seemed subdued by our bittersweet mood. Death brings life into sharp relief.
Afterward, back in the house, we all glanced at the TV but no one turned it on again, not yet. Instead, I served celebratory champagne and comforting chocolate cake. I always keep cake and champagne on hand because you just never know when you might need one or the other. 
‚Äî Copyright ¬© 2007 Elle NewmarkWe always have a choice about how to handle even life‚Äôs worst moments. These are the choices that make all the difference
I was just reading this story and it stuck out to me so much because I had a individual session this morning from a person who has just lost someone dear to them. I was sitting there thinking of how I would feel trying to be empathetic to this person as she cried, and let her feelings go about this tragedy she was going thru. I was thinking man‚Ä¶to lose someone and they are still alive is no where near losing someone when they no longer walk the earth. I spoke to her about the only advice that I knew could solace her. I told her that this is the time that she needs to read the bible more then ever.I also told her that even though there is NOOO way i know how she is feeling inside that the level of grief she will definately go thru. I know she has a high relationship with god and that was the only direction that i kept referring her to. I know that in the bible there are the answers that she needs to read and here. She was not instantly accepting of that but the more she thought about it she appeared to understand a little more. I have had situations lately here at work that have really tugged at my heartstrings because you know its hard not to hurt when someone is hurting but you must be a objective person and guide them to the best way to keep them from relapse thinking or even worst. In the end its up to them which direction they want to take. I feel for my clients cause alot of times they mess up more and more then they succeed and alot of society does not understand why continuously it occurs. I am on month number two clean and sober 60 days!! aug 5th is my last dou. It has not been to difficult but at times it does cross my mind, but then i go back to everything that i have seen it destroy or harm, and basically im sick of it all. I am sick of the people it harms, the life it takes from me, and all the misery it emits my way and others. I am proud of myself and even though this is not the longest I have been clean, it is the most rewarding cause usually I would be counting down the days til another catastorphe would happen. Give myself numerous reasons to use. I am feeling better no longer have the cold that had me down and out ‚Ä¶tonight is gonna be my first night back at the gym. I am looking forward to it. I was on my way to work this morning thinking‚Ä¶you know this is living, this is life on lifes terms‚Ä¶no real worries or even if they arise going where i know i need to. JUSt live is what i hear all the time in my head‚Ä¶dont think about it. I just thought I would get on for a few to empty some thoughts so that I dont dwell on the things in my head and get stressed out because i want to change things for those that have no clue‚Ä¶i know that it is up to them to change and if you just put it out there they will grab on to it when they are ready. No mistakes‚Ä¶., even in death there is glory!! god bless you all. martin;)

Now that it‚Äôs all said and done, I can‚Äôt believe you were the one To build me up and tear me down, Like an old abandoned house. What you said when you left Just left me cold and out of breath. I fell too far, was in way too deep. Guess I let you get the best of me. Well, I never saw it coming. And I should‚Äôve started running A long, long time ago. And I never thought I‚Äôd doubt you, I‚Äôm better off without you More than you, more than you know. I‚Äôm slowly getting closure. I guess it‚Äôs really over. I‚Äôm finally getting better. And now I‚Äôm picking up the pieces. From spending all of these years Putting my heart back together. ‚ÄòCause the day I thought I‚Äôd never get through, I got over you. 
You took a hammer to these walls, Dragged the memories down the hall, Packed your bags and walked away. There was nothing I could say. And when you slammed the front door shut, A lot of others opened up, So did my eyes so I could see That you never were the best for me. 
Well, I never saw it coming. And I should‚Äôve started running A long, long time ago. And I never thought I‚Äôd doubt you, 
I‚Äôm better off without you More than you, more than you know. I‚Äôm slowly getting closure. I guess it‚Äôs really over. I‚Äôm finally getting better. And now I‚Äôm picking up the pieces. From spending all of these years Putting my heart back together.¬† ‚ÄòCause the day I thought I‚Äôd never get through, I got over you.

Four am and im wide awake‚Ä¶.hmmm so much in my dreams so much in my head so i thought i would get on here and spill it so that i can finally get some rest. This song was playing when i woke up and it is so true that times you spend holding on to something or someone that time and space get wider and wider then in the end it is just a illusion or memory of what you thought it was not really reality. I am picking up the pieces and I will never let anything or anyone make me feel like I have for so many years. I am to a point in my life where I dont try to live up to your expectations but to the reality that is me. I love myself amidst the terror of my past , the terrible things that have happend that have just torn people places and things to shreds. I wont blame it on my addiction because you know what‚Ä¶that was only a part of it. I am taking off this mask‚Ä¶cause you know its not worth one more day I have been brutally honest in this diary and for it i have been judged ridiculed alienated and made fun of. Honesty is something that alot of times doesnt come easy for me due to the shame guilt that i feel after the fact of making a poor decision. I am getting better though. I found this poem on a website and wanted to share it with you guys‚Ä¶so true.
THE MASK I WEAR
Don‚Äôt be fooled by me.Don‚Äôt be fooled by the face I wearfor I wear a mask. I wear a thousand masks-masks that I‚Äôm afraid to take offand none of them are me.Pretending is an art that‚Äôs second nature with meBut don‚Äôt be fooled, for God‚Äôs sake, don‚Äôt be fooled.I give you the impression that I‚Äôm secureThat all is sunny and unruffled with mewithin as well as without,that confidence is my nameand coolness my game,that the water‚Äôs calmand I‚Äôm in command,and that I need no one.But don‚Äôt believe me. Please!
My surface may be smooth but my surface is my mask,My ever-varying and ever-concealing mask.Beneath lies no smugness, no complacence.Beneath dwells the real me in confusion, in fear, in aloneness.But I hide this.I don‚Äôt want anybody to know it.I panic at the thought of my weaknessesand fear exposing them.That‚Äôs why I frantically create my masks to hide behind.They‚Äôre nonchalant, sophisticated facades to help me pretend,To shield me from the glance that knows.But such a glance is precisely my salvation,my only salvation,and I know it.
That is, if it‚Äôs followed by acceptance,and if it‚Äôs followed by love.It‚Äôs the only thing that can liberate me from myselffrom my own self-built prison walls.
I dislike hiding, honestlyI dislike the superficial game I‚Äôm playing, the superficial phony game.I‚Äôd really like to be genuine and me.But I need your help, your hand to holdEven though my masks would tell you otherwiseThat glance from you is the only thing that assures meof what I can‚Äôt assure myself,that I‚Äôm really worth something.
But I don‚Äôt tell you this.I don‚Äôt dare.I‚Äôm afraid to.I‚Äôm afraid you‚Äôll think less of me, that you‚Äôll laughand your laugh would kill me.I‚Äôm afraid that deep-down I‚Äôm nothing, that I‚Äôm just no goodand you will see this and reject me.
So I play my game, my desperate, pretending gameWith a facade of assurance withoutAnd a trembling child within.So begins the parade of masks,The glittering but empty parade of masks,and my life becomes a front.I idly chatter to you in suave tones of surface talk.I tell you everything that‚Äôs nothingand nothing of what‚Äôs everything, of what‚Äôs crying within me.So when I‚Äôm going through my routinedo not be fooled by what I‚Äôm sayingPlease listen carefully and try to hearwhat I‚Äôm not sayingHear what I‚Äôd like to saybut what I can not say.
It will not be easy for you,long felt inadequacies make my defenses strong.The nearer you approach methe blinder I may strike back.Despite what books say of men, I am irrational;I fight against the very thing that I cry out for.you wonder who I amyou shouldn‚Äôtfor I am everymanand everywomanwho wears a mask.Don‚Äôt be fooled by me.At least not by the face I wear.
good stuff right there. HOnesty and direct and to the point‚Ä¶dont understand it? well ‚Ä¶.it is basically asking others to see what they think you are underneath it all is it real or is it just a programmed ""face"" that doesnt allow others to see anything is wrong or whatnot. For a lot of years I wore a mask of a victim the mask of the martyr, and
the illusion that my life was so crappy it would never get better. I am dealing with some things lately that in the past would have taken me to drink to go to the strip clubs to just medicate in anyway possible. Hell who needs it today‚Ä¶.the time it takes to medicate just takes my focus off things‚Ä¶and in the end i end up hiding out for a longgggg time. I wont do that to mysellf today. I wont. There is nothing in the world worth drinking or doing some of the unmentionables for. I got a friend request on my myspace page from someone I used to confide alot in, bear my soul to if you will..well over the years i learned that the trust i had for this person was betrayed because secretly he thought i was a piece of shit for my actions but could never tell me to my face instead he went behind my back and basically took all that i told him or did out of context and just betrayed my trust. I am not bitter anymore at this person but you know i dont trust easily so i am trying to get to a point where i can let him back in cause i miss him, miss our football talks our crazy political talks‚Ä¶.i know that i can only work on my side of it, until then i wont add him. I have nothing to hide just certain people have made it clear how they think of me and how they wish to have nothing to do with me anymore which is fine, i am trying to make their wishes to be honored. I miss you bud:) how bout those jags‚Ä¶.i hope you dont take it personal if i dont add you right away‚Ä¶.maybe you can msg me or get to know me again? who the hell knows‚Ä¶.pain is a bitch once it opens up a hole ‚Ä¶.healing takes time and it comes from the inside out. I love you man‚Ä¶.dont know anything really that has happend to you in years‚Ä¶.but i am just respecting the perception i got from you and my ex on one of her comments to you when i started my page‚Ä¶.i have always known who i was‚Ä¶and my age‚Ä¶.just not many people ever could accept that. oh well that is my resentment done and to the point‚Ä¶.walking away from it‚Ä¶ i really do wish we can be friends again‚Ä¶.if not hope you get everything out of life you ever wanted and more‚Ä¶your a great person üôÇ 
I am not bitter anymore and the things that come at me i realize really‚Ä¶.is it that important martin? really? cant change others but you can be accountable to keep going forward and attempt not to hurt others rebuild the bridges of the people that want to meet you halfway if not give them to god. I am no saint but you know what‚Ä¶.i get on this page and bear the hardest thoughts that for years have killed me‚Ä¶and all those thoughts and actions‚Ä¶have been my enemy for a long time‚Ä¶.i almost died the other day had a blow out again and this time the car started going side to side and almost flipped. But you know what? I am not scared to die anymore because I know there is a better place then the earth and this isnt the end. I dont have to preach it i dont have to have it proved to me, I just know in my heart it exists. the battles are ending that i have waged for years out of fear‚Ä¶out of denial‚Ä¶out of confusion and out of insanity‚Ä¶.laying it down daily as i walk away one step at a time from the memories of the past and people that have been there along the way i miss them like crazy at times‚Ä¶.but you know what? everythign happens for a reason‚Ä¶..i dont have to be understood i dont have to be vindicated i just have to be me and be okay with that. I am so thankful for my life today just got another job offer, new neice on the way., a relationship with my brother and his wife. Life is to short to be angry all the time, to short to not speak the truth, to take accountability for your life. People ask me everyday this question‚Ä¶..why dont druggies or alcholics just quit‚Ä¶..dont they see what they are doing to others around them‚Ä¶.ever been there when everything around you isnt real to you? ever been there so down and shameful that the only solace is the bottle or the drug? if you havent ever had THAT feeling of emptiness and embarassment you could never understand it. NEver. one thing that is certain‚Ä¶.everyday that your mind is clear gives you one more day to repair that bridge to you and the lord and let him repair everything else. You dont have to love me anymore you can be repulsed by all that is me‚Ä¶.but when you have something ill to say‚Ä¶yoru saying god made a mistake in my creation‚Ä¶.and spitting in his face for i am a child of god..good bad indifferent‚Ä¶.wow lots coming out this early in the morning. oh well thats why i cant sleep imagine these thoughts being projected onto dream land. oh well‚Ä¶..i have said alot‚Ä¶.but you know the thing with honesty we all crave‚Ä¶sometimes you cant handle the reality of what is really going thru someones head. oh well‚Ä¶..lata peeps* keep ya head up‚Ä¶..god has us all‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.

I woke up a second ago and I guess I have alot on my mind. First of all my lil neice is a angel sooo precious. I went to see her the other night after work and took her and kimbre some things. I held her in my arms felt so awesome to have a lil innocent child in your arms. They are so innocent and sweet. I love the way a baby smells. She was just sleeping and every now and then would twitch her nose and make these funny faces. She is so perfect goodness. It really gives you perspective in all that you take for granted in the world. I am so happy for both of them. Toby has a lil sister and he was so good with her. I am gonna go over there today or tommorow and take pics. Awesome lil girl. It really gives you perspective on the innocense of children holding one as a new born. I was so happy felt like it was my own. I will not let anything or anyone hurt this child either. Shopping for this child as well as toby gave me happiness since I have none of my own, it is so cool that my brother has a family and is working towards more stability and peace.

The week was really rough due to us losing another counselor. I am the lone ranger again. I finally completed all my paperwork and case study I just have to send in my money and then im ready to test. I am really tired of missing the deadlines and stuff. I had a job oppt the other day and it is in another location with benefits and all the bells and whistles. I dont know about it though. It has never been about all that with me and this career that I have chose it is about seeing someone know there is hope to get thru their addiction. there is nothing more awesome then watching theirs eyes light up and finally understand there is a different path they can take away from the misery and pain that they carry with them on a daily basis. I am gonna try to do something fun today I need a break from thinking and analyzing. I am really gonna be better to uncle martin‚Ä¶.he is a good guy.

I have had blowouts on my car the last two thursdays and even had to replace a bar thingy that was messed up in the front but god is good to me these days had the things i needed and made it thru okay. One thing that i do today that i didnt do before is stop and examine things instead of reacting and making descisions in a frantic instinctive way. Dang i think im getting old..lol. Oh well, im enjoying the ride. I am allowing myself to finally get a hold on my emotions my triggers, my insecurities, and my own demons that i fight on a daily basis. Nothing god cant handle for me. I got a sirius radio for my car last weekend..and its really awesome i was kinda upset last night about the blowout but i stopped called people vented and then on the ride home, changed it to just peaceful music to calm myself down. You know the longer i remain sober the easier it is to dispise it. I feel for those that still havent given up to recovery or the¬† powerlessness of their disease. It takes what it takes and definately took alot of years for me to get it right. 
¬†
goals : to continue working on my foundation for christ
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† to allow myself to be kind to myself, to continue to give back, continue to be a leader not a harmer for the word as well as my profession. I will be a role model not a distraction for people trying to get into recovery for their lives. I am going back to sleep just thought i would empty some random thoughts down so i can sleep some more. God bless all and may you guys find some peace within‚Ä¶.because unless it comes from within the peace we search in the outside world is only temporary. lOve you all‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.night night.

good morning diary.,
I have these two songs in my head as i woke up in the middle of the night. I just read a page that was describing why do we need it when our time is over here. So true, no matter how many toys we gather no matter how great we may think we are or the opposite one day our father will give us all that we need or desire. It is changing weather around here and it reminds me of another season for alot of people slowing fading away. I always noted the seasons in my addiction cause it would be one more day towards quitting. whatever that quitting may be. It is a sad thing to see so many losing the battle that is waged from within. I had a dream last night and i was like riding around this city on a bus. , at some of the stops there were carnival type set ups and this one stuck out like no other ‚Ä¶inside of it was total darkness and total evil. I was looking at it from the corridor and somehow as we all do in life, without knowing it we are drawn closer and closer until we are knee deep into the grip of the abyss of the devil. I noticed that everytime i tried to leave that there would be this spider web of demons trying to keep me there, not necessarily harming me, but putting up like a forcefield of evil laughter and smirks to try to get me to stay. I called out to jesus in my dream i remember and all of a sudden i was on a bus heading in the sunlight away from that place. i ended up at a movie theatre with people i knew from past, present and even unknown people playing video games, and just waiting for the movies to begin. I remember goin to the little twenty five cent machines and got a ring out of it., i was walking towards this person to give it to them and i woke up. ‚Ä¶.intense and so lifelike. I spent all day sunday at my brothers and held my neice all day. She just slept and slept., such a quiet baby. I took some pics but for some reason they arent coming thru the email addy. as soon as i get em i will post them up. I think i am going back to bed just had to get up for a few so thought i would wind down my head a lil‚Ä¶‚Ä¶god bless the lost and the strugggling.the ones that just know the answer but just wont submit to the truth. I dont say this in judgment or even in shame of others, because we all have been at that point. Like they say in recovery‚Ä¶takes what it takes and sometimes in the process takes your life, before you understand you were powerless. Lord hold us near for at times we know not what we do, and we seek and seek ‚Ä¶..while being bounded by the earthly things‚Ä¶..may you hold us close in all that you will for us to be‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶:P

Forget what we‚Äôre told Before we get too old Show me a garden that‚Äôs bursting into life 
Let‚Äôs waste time Chasing cars Around our heads 
I need your grace To remind me To find my own 
If I lay here If I just lay here Would you lie with me and just forget the world? 
Forget what we‚Äôre told Before we get too old Show me a garden that‚Äôs bursting into life 
All that I am All that I ever was Is here in your perfect eyes, they‚Äôre all I can see 
I don‚Äôt know where Confused about how as well Just know that these things will never change for us at all 
If I lay here If I just lay here Would you lie with me and just forget the world?

I love this song;) i know its not quite a new one but i was just sitting here in my office with my lamp on trying to defrag a lil and bring myself back to calm. I am soooo tired today it has been a long week and I am looking forward to the weekend. I am going to a haunted house and just sleeping hopefully. I am the only counselor again at my location and for the most part im happy with it just not used to all the hours at once. I got a job oppt from mhmr in ft worth , but still dont know which way i am gonna turn. I turned my test stuff in so finally i am gonna take the plunge and take the test. I will be a lcdc before its all said and done. This song just wraps its words around me and comforts my inner child and lets it say its gonna be okay martin‚Ä¶no fear on the outside you are just tired so rest baby boi.¬† I am happy today just really need a soft blankie and bed to cuddle in. I saw jailie this past weekend she is adorable‚Ä¶.held her all day. she is so quiet and sleeps alot but i put my finger in her hand and she squeezed it tightly. awww‚Ä¶.so cute. thats what life is all about the tender touch of a child and the love from the things that are simple and innocent. Last night i was so frazzled that when i got home i sat in there for a minute and all of a sudden i felt a scratching on the door. It was my dog spanky. he was raising up lookin in to the car‚Ä¶and whimpering. I opend the door and hugged him and just made the trials of the day a lil easier to take. its okay to be weak i know today as long as you allow love in to replace the vulnarbility. I am really enjoying my life even though at times feels a hundred miles an hour. I have had to deal with blow outs, new plugs, new wires, new struts‚Ä¶you name it but you know what‚Ä¶god has me in all of this‚Ä¶.at the time i was freaking out and my face is broke out due to it., i still dont deal with instant change that well‚Ä¶lol. i freak out for the moment then once i go thru it afterwards i soak it in that everything will be okay. I am working on that. I am a lil more awake at the moment that i calmed down the atmosphere in here. To much light causes wear on the old eyeballs‚Ä¶.lol. well just thought i would stop in and write‚Ä¶you guys have a great day and thanks for the¬† kind notes:) god bless you guys.

smiles:) man these lyrics are strong and sooo true. There has been many nights many days that I wanted to just give up and questioned and questioned what is it lord? what is it that you want me to see cause either i am to stubborn to see it or just dont want to and rather be barely hanging on. I understand that struggle of the addict the struggle of the pain filled heart that at times seems never to empty. I know that at times we play the victim for days, weeks, months, years‚Ä¶but everyday that we hold on to the garbage the devil tells us is truth is one more day we live in agony. I was talking to my group tonight about the family how even though we may get clean and sober we have wanted the family to ""hold on"" until we get it right., well something happens they get tired of holding on. Tired of staying up late wondering if you were coming home, watchin the phone hoping that you call and say your on your way, and praying to god you wont be high or drunk and that you just come home and pass out. Having to live their lives in the prison that addiction builds around you. Even though WE get clean what damage have we inflicted on these poor souls that all they wanted to do was LOVe us thru our tough times. WHy do you use? why cant you stop? arent i enough? isnt your family enough? I have heard these questions for alot of years and each day I have clean and sober I understand the pain of the heart and soul that my addiction inflicted on those that loved me without condition. I dont get on here and preach anything that i havent been thru or my perception but even my perception is at times warped. Because think of it., we see life one way while in reality its really totally different thru the eyes of the sober and the hurting. I have stated I am sorry til my face is blue, to just go and do something else to mess it up to ruin that fragile trust that my love ones were holding on to. I have had a tough week‚Ä¶as I wrote in my previous entry but you know only once did i think of using, but my mind goes somewhere else today it goes to what happens once that goes inside me‚Ä¶.even though the love ones are no longer there, and in reality who would care or get hurt if i did‚Ä¶.I WOULD ‚Ä¶.and for years I never cared about myself enough to stay clean. I read about acceptance tonight, and you know that lil stumbling block can keep addicts crippled for years and years‚Ä¶not being able to accept that they are powerless over their addiction and still wanting to try it one more time, go thru detox, thru treatment one MORE time. Why wouldnt our love ones not want to let go and let god have us? how many times must we hear the very simple messege? god is all that in the end you need or that spiritial foundation of love for self. Cause if you dont find something stronger then your drug of choice to fill that void once you stop, its just a matter of time til something happens and you go back to it. been there done that. i gave myself every reason to slip again and start drinking‚Ä¶..didnt have to be things were going bad‚Ä¶.hell i had the best two years anyone could ever want..had a gf that loved me, a family that was there for me, and every problem i created they fixed. so what did i hav eto control? well my addiction made me feel like I WAS in control and had some sort of power over something‚Ä¶.sick sick sick‚Ä¶but hell thats what it is when you are in your addiction sickness at its finest.You dont care that love is walking out the door, that you have hurt someone with harsh words or statments, but you know what? when your sober you see beyond the haze that the bottle has kept you behind for so long. I notice that the longer i stay clean and sober that i cant remember stuff, and i play it off as stress ,which very well could be but at times i know i have done some damage all the drinking i have done in my life time. all the speed pills supplements when i worked out had ephedrine in them, the anger the isolation they wanted to keep me¬† hidden cause what if someone found out? what if they knew? well hell hiding out only told them what was going on‚Ä¶.we addicts as bright as we think we are‚Ä¶..are so predictable. I followed a pattern and looking back on it, was so easy to spot. I told my group you know when the addict comes home ""clean"" the family needs help ..ala alanon, coanon..just because the addict is clean the family is still sick. lord only you have the power to help those that refuse to give up the fight to you. You are bigger then any addiction of the soul ‚Ä¶you are bigger then the lies, the excuses, the false promises. You are bigger, if they just let their pride and let honesty actually happen. Truthfully 90 days is a accomplishment that I am slowly one day at a time going towards but I am still a infant in recovery, I wont be able to say nothing til i have years and years‚Ä¶of working and changing my defects of character. I cant live in the sickness but actually can not deny it either. that statement it takes what it takes‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.and you know for me it took my biggest fear coming true‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ending up alone souless, empty and scared. face down in my own self pity of what i called my life. sometimes the ones that love you the most are the ones that it takes you actually losing to straighten up. I love them still with all my heart and hold on to all they tried so hard to teach me. I just had that problem never enough‚Ä¶.could never reach that level that was never even there for me to reach‚Ä¶.i was enough just as i was as i am.:) i see now that even in times of uncertainty and trial‚Ä¶.i am loved by god and by myself even at times its hard as hell to say a kind word to myself, or to believe it. I got off the rollarcoaster of dysfunction‚Ä¶.we must finally get to the point of honesty‚Ä¶.honestly what are we doing ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶how much treatment does it take to just let god in? i have guys that sit in front of me and ask for the magic answer and you know in the end‚Ä¶.it all goes back to that spiritial connection that you need. Not just talking the talk‚Ä¶.but walking the walk even when its hard staying sober when its hard, when your life feels like its crumbling around you and you cant go one more step, hold on‚Ä¶.even though you think you cant. the pink cloud is awesome when you come back into recovery but you expect it to be that way all the time, and it goes away and alot of times your so busy getting high on that newness that you fall face down befo
re you know it cause as addicts we use everything up fast. then here we go again‚Ä¶.oh please one more chance, i will change‚Ä¶.seriously‚Ä¶..will you? or you just so used to being on that treadmill of lies that it is fight or flight response‚Ä¶hold on god is on his way but do we hear him? do we actually listen¬† to direction or do we do what we need to to fulfill someone elses perception of what being ""sober is"". I have done it all folks‚Ä¶..lies manipulated and was a thief of the thing that money couldnt buy. LOVE. til i was bankrupt and alone. unless you learn how to love yourself and have that connection nothign will ever change. NOTHING Changes nothing changes. i woke up with all this on my mind wow. there is a god martin‚Ä¶.and you need to quit playing the role you can never fill ‚Ä¶.he is within you you arent him. love yourself be kind to that inner spiriti‚Ä¶..its hard yall‚Ä¶but you gotta hold on‚Ä¶when times are tough‚Ä¶you gotta hang in there even when you dont want tooo‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.we can take meds, we can hide behind counseling, we can hide anywhere we want‚Ä¶but in the end‚Ä¶god never leaves so you continue with the shame and guilt cause you have a conscious when you first get sober‚Ä¶that in time the devil wants you back so badly he does anything he needs to ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.to get you back‚Ä¶‚Ä¶hold on‚Ä¶.hold‚Ä¶..on‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..quit with the lies, quit with the i wills‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.quit with the what ifs‚Ä¶‚Ä¶faith is knowing that it will happen even if you have no control of it and even if you cant see it. humility and humbleness‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.hold on‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..hold on‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.is all that i can keep hearing‚Ä¶..no mistakes‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.the storm doesnt last forever‚Ä¶..hold on‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..i love you guys for the kind notes and the encouragement. I hope that if you have a addict in your family know that you cant change them, only in time and with god and acceptance and honesty can this happen amongst waning TO CHANGE>we do it when faced with loss‚Ä¶‚Ä¶but we slide back in when we get stuff we were scared of losing back‚Ä¶‚Ä¶hold to yours and get help so that you dont get hurt by us one more day. one day thru god and all his glory ‚Ä¶if its ment to be ‚Ä¶..we will come back to you‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.love you guys good night:)

Hey diary!~
Sitting here on my lunch break listening to kenny chesney‚Ä¶always been a favorite of mine. I am not much into country music as i once was but i feel the need today. I am thinkin about life and how quickely it goes away‚Ä¶.this song is so true dont blink cause you know ‚Ä¶it happens so fast then your older and ready to depart.¬† 
Sunny days seem to hurt the most Wear the pain like a heavy coat I feel you everywhere I go See your smile, I see your face I hear you laughing in the rain Still can‚Äôt believe your gone It ain‚Äôt fair you died to young Like a story that had just begun But death tore the pages all away God knows how I miss you All the hell that I‚Äôve been through Just knowing, no one could take your place Sometimes I wonder, who you‚Äôd be today 
Would you see the world Would you chase your dreams Settle down with a family I wonder what would you name your babies Someday‚Äôs the sky‚Äôs so blue I feel like I can talk to you And I know it might sound crazy 
Sunny days seem to hurt the most I wear the pain like a heavy coat The only thing that gives me hope Is I know, I‚Äôll see you again someday 
Someday, someday
sometimes i wonder who youd be today‚Ä¶..that lyric that says he wears the pain like a heavy coat‚Ä¶wow such lyricism in that. I know what that feels like. This wednesday is halloween another year another holiday season., in seven days i have ninety days! clean and sober.¬† This song reminds me a lil of so many in my lives that have either passed on or moved on. I wonder how they are doing, if they have everything in their lives that is making them happy:) I hope so. For the journey we all go down alot of times doesnt really fill us all the time with happiness but you know its from those moments we understand why the journey is so necessary. I need to cry but havent in years‚Ä¶the tears just wont flow even though i feel them drippin in my soul.¬† I hope to live to a old age and have all that this life says is ""normal"" dont blink‚Ä¶one day your in elementary school, cant wait to grow up and get out the things that your seeing and having happening to you, dont blink‚Ä¶.life is going so fast need to slow it down‚Ä¶.dont blink‚Ä¶..how can you sleep when all you see is nightmares that travel into the realm of insanity filled reality.¬† I heard the other day that sometimes life goes as you wish but sometimes those that arent around maybe you will see them again someday. My grandma died in ninety four, my uncle in eighty eight.¬† I havent seen my mom in almost two years now. I dont understand why so many times we harbor feelings from things that have came and went., why we waste so many precious moments continueing the pain someone created or did to us. I have thought many times before I have forgiven her, but once you forgive then its just a empty spot where anger and all that used to live. I know that if anything happend to her i would be saddend but for so long even today its like i am alive but still feels like life is just soooo confusing. Spend the day clean and sober and go to bed so tired that no time to think on anything or anyone, just wonder who id be today.., other then the person im trying to be. I want to actually be all that god wants me to, but at times i dont see it, i dont understand it, and sometimes i dont feel it. I guess on wednesday gives me a chance to finally shed the mask of togetherness if only for one day‚Ä¶.and be who i am today‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..oh well ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..back to the grind‚Ä¶..love ya all‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..

No I ain‚Äôt had nothing to drink I knew thats probably what you‚Äôd think If I dropped by this time of night Remember way back when I promised you I‚Äôd drop in At one of those meetings down at the Y 
Well, they started talkin bout steps you take Mistakes you make The hearts you break And the price you pay I almost walked away 
You could hear a pin drop 
When this old man Stood up and said I‚Äôm gonna‚Äô say it again Like I do every week For those who don‚Äôt know me 
It‚Äôs the simple things in life Like the kids at home and a loving wife That you miss the most, when you lose control And everything you love starts to disappear The devil takes your hand and says no fear Have another shot, just one more beer Yah, I‚Äôve been there, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm here 
This ole boy stood up in the aisle Said he‚Äôd been living a life of denial And he cried as he talked about wasted years I couldn‚Äôt believe what I heard It was my life word for word And all of the sudden it was clear 
It‚Äôs the simple things in life Like the kids at home and a loving wife That you miss the most, when you lose control And everything you love starts to disappear The devil takes your hand and says no fear Have another shot, just one more beer Yah, I‚Äôve been there, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm here 
I know for us it may be too late But it would mean the world to me If you were there when I stand to say It‚Äôs the simple things in life Like the kids at home and a loving wife That you miss the most, when you lose control And everything you love starts to disappear The devil takes your hand and says no fear Have another shot, just one more beer Yah, I‚Äôve been there, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm here Oh, I‚Äôve been there, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm here
four in the morning and im wide awake. I love this song , have for alot of years. It states it all and I write about drinking/drugging/ or the lack of alot i guess cause inside addicts are restless,irratable and discontent and that in itself is our addiction. But im not gonna spend alot of time on that right now the last couple entries have touched on that. I want to talk about a family that I wish i had, a loving wife and kids. In this song talks about going to a meeting at the Y is why he is there, but I am ""here"" due to being there. Losing control and everything you love starts to disappear, even if in the end you wake up wondering how did i get here? the steps you take the mistakes you make the price you pay‚Ä¶hmmm interesting. I know today that acceptance is the key to my salvation. without it, there is nothing and loss of self is what ends up happending. I cant lie about the state I am in. I am sitting here listening to this song and no matter how many days, weeks, months, years go by‚Ä¶.she is gone. im mad at this stupid ass disease that plaques the generations of humanity. I used to laugh and joke like nothing was wrong with it. Something happens when you sober up‚Ä¶.everything you love is no longer there and all that is left is the memories and the unfinished what could have been. I have to get these thoughts out even in reality i would never show you these things. I would act as if nothing is wrong and i have it all together while i crumble inside wanting just one more time to be with you. I used to laugh and make fun of people with problems in aa or any other type of meeting thinkin how the hell can that keep you sober? talkin it out in front of strangers the things that your going thru? living the life of denial‚Ä¶.viewing self as better then‚Ä¶.not a junkie, not a dope fiend while all the time fitting and busting out those clothes. I dont really go into everyday conciously thinking i miss this person or that, my ego is to strong for that, but underneath it all there is that missing that what could have been‚Ä¶.my adopted mom used to talk about ""hating this disease"" and i never understood her anger and hurt. The longer i stay sober the more i trully understand‚Ä¶how can people take this as a joke? hell i ask the same questions that i myself did‚Ä¶insane huh? i took it as a joke, as a game, not me im to cool to be labeled a addict, alcoholic. I if not was sicker then most., and still am on alot of accounts but i chose to not dwell on those things otherwise i would never come out the bottle. Prozac or not. Its funny to me that this time of night is when you truelly reflect on everything in yoru life that has either gone good or just failed miserbly. YOU know what hurts the most? ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.being so close and having so much to say and watchin you walk away‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..god i suck!¬† I guess i deserve this prison of walking alone and not wanting to touch anyone or anything for fear of infecting it with my sickness. all these songs talk about love and yada yada‚Ä¶..what hurts the most is missing the person that was there and you never saw‚Ä¶.now that is painful. taking someone or something for granted and thinking i will get well enuff to be the man that i am ment to be. ‚Ä¶then this f‚Äôing drinkin problem always told me always‚Ä¶‚Ä¶drink one more time it will be the last time, no one will know‚Ä¶.blah whatever.you watch everything and everyone¬† you love go down the tube of lifes failures. im really not this meloncholoy right now‚Ä¶.but damn if i dont keep it honest on here i will drink again‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.because i will start to think hey im NOT THAT BAD‚Ä¶..I am the COUNSELOR after all‚Ä¶fuck all that ‚Ä¶..tired of that deception and lies‚Ä¶.i tell my clients the truth and i dont sway from it because you know what‚Ä¶.why lie? why lie. what hurts the most‚Ä¶..hmmm that song plays on‚Ä¶..and on‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..and on‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..and on‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..and on‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.and on‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶and on‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..and you know what? no matter how much in my mind i want it to end different ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶everytime the song ends‚Ä¶‚Ä¶i sleep alone‚Ä¶‚Ä¶i go to the movies alone‚Ä¶‚Ä¶i eat alone‚Ä¶‚Ä¶i hope your happy truelly‚Ä¶caue you know what? you deserve that and i hope you see not so much my addiction that is being wrote about but actually see martin underneath it all‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..please lord dont give up on me‚Ä¶and help me not to give up on myself‚Ä¶‚Ä¶these thoughts seem so damn insane‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.i just want your love‚Ä¶‚Ä¶want your forgiveness‚Ä¶‚Ä¶for all that i have done‚Ä¶.i want to live again‚Ä¶without drinking in my life, without the addiction of the flesh in my soul‚Ä¶‚Ä¶maybe one day all my friends and family that keep themselves away from me for their own safety are guarded with your love and allow them to love me again in their hearts. til then‚Ä¶keep em all safe from tragedy and pain‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶goodnight lord‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.this is my prayer to you‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

Well I‚Äôm sitting here all alone wondering how you are. And the thoughts of you spin round my head, like wheels on a car. And I wish you were beside me dreaming up at the stars. Well the times we had together, well they just blew me away. And I think about your soft green eyes, every single day. How my plans for us just seemed to fall, fade into gray. 
I guess I didn‚Äôt see it coming. How could I have been so blind? And as I cry myself to sleep. I wonder do I ever cross your mind. So won‚Äôt you smile for me my Texas angel? It‚Äôll be all right. You just lay your head beside me, dream of me tonight. And I promise I‚Äôll watch over you till the morning light. 
Well I‚Äôm heading back to the west coast, looking for my soul. Trying to mend the pieces, of shattered years before. And the ocean takes my pain away, as it comes rolling into shore. So if you see me walking down the street. Baby don‚Äôt turn away. I just want to see your smiling face, looking my way. And I never want to see you go, see you go away. 
Won‚Äôt you smile for me my Texas angel? It‚Äôll be all right. You just lay your head beside me, baby just hold me tight. And I promise I‚Äôll watch over you till the morning light. __________________________________________________________________________________________
Its four fifty four and im sitting here listening to this song on repeat funny how some songs give you comfort when the memory is no longer around. This song ohhh‚Ä¶this song. I just got back from sports authority and i got me a new longhorn hoodie its getting cold and i couldnt find my other one. I am thinkin bout going down to victory plaza outside of american airlines center and watching the texas vs texas tech game this weekend on the jumbotron. I am kinda in a haze today and just feel out of sorts. I always look for comfort when that happens in my head‚Ä¶there really isnt anything im ruminating that i can think of but still feel like i want what this song makes me feel like. Happy love, secure, and safe. I feel that way because of who is brought up in my memory as it plays.¬† Funny how time flys and sometimes the memories just burn etched deep in your soul. this part of the song ‚Ä¶I guess I didn‚Äôt see it coming. How could I have been so blind? And as I cry myself to sleep. I wonder do I ever cross your mind¬†¬† ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶I just finished a long week of doing monthly reports which i started last week. I get mentally exhausted from those things cause they have to be so detailed and every minut detail is critiqued. how far is the east from the west? i need to quit the pity party but really i am not pitying anything other then i guess i feel unsafe lonley‚Ä¶.thats what would be it. I have had a rough month due to haveing so many repairs on my vehicle, people yelling at me here because they think im after them, the stressors of my addiction and just hearing second hand about my mothers health, no matter how i try to block things out that i should detach from i feel so deep, feel so strongly ‚Ä¶.*exhales*‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.five oclock and the ticking on the clock keeps ticking‚Ä¶..group in a hour‚Ä¶..the ride home‚Ä¶.getting rest‚Ä¶‚Ä¶feeling vulnarble‚Ä¶‚Ä¶wanting to just kinda slip into invisible mode and let my defense mechanism come out and run group. i need to cry just wish they would come‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.tears %%%%%%%%%%% please fall‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..im out for now‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.lata

What This World Needs lyrics
What this world needs is not another one hit wonder with an axe to grindAnother two bit politician peddling liesAnother three ring circus societyWhat this world needs is not another sign waving super saint that‚Äôs better than youAnother ear pleasing candy man afraid of the truth Another prophet in an Armani suit
What this world needs is a Savior who will rescueA Spirit who will leadA Father who will love them in their time of needA Savior who will rescueA Spirit who will leadA Father who will loveThat‚Äôs what this world needs
What this world needs is for us to care more about the inside than the outsideHave we become so blind that we can‚Äôt seeGod‚Äôs gotta change her heart before He changes her shirtWhat this world needs is for us to stop hiding behind our relevanceBlending in so well that people can‚Äôt see the differenceAnd it‚Äôs the difference that sets the world free
Jesus is our Savior, that‚Äôs what this world needsFather‚Äôs arms around you, that‚Äôs what this world needsThat‚Äôs what this world needs

What you got if you aint got love?The kind that you just wanna give awayIt‚Äôs okay to open upGo ahead and let the light shine throughI know it‚Äôs hard on a rainy dayYou wanna shut the world outAnd just be left aloneDon‚Äôt run out on your faith
Sometimes that mountain you‚Äôve been climbingIs just a grain of sandWhat you‚Äôve been out there searching for forever,Is in your handsWhen you figure out love is all that matters, after allIt sure makes everything elseSeem so small
It‚Äôs so easy to get lost insideA problem that seems so big, at the timeIt‚Äôs like a river that‚Äôs so wideIt swallows you wholeWhile you‚Äôre sittin round thinking about what you can‚Äôt changeAnd worryin‚Äô about all the wrong thingsTime‚Äôs flying by, moving so fastYou better make it count, cause you can‚Äôt get it back
Sometimes that mountain you‚Äôve been climbingIs just a grain of sandWhat you‚Äôve been out there searchin for foreverIs in your handsOh, When you figure out love is all that matters after allIt sure makes everything elseSeem so small
Sometimes that mountain you‚Äôve been climbingIs just a grain of sandWhat you‚Äôve been out there searchin for foreverIs in your handsOh, When you figure out love is all that matters after allIt sure makes everything elseOh it sure makes everything elseSeem so small

WOw‚Ä¶.I was listening to this song on the way home, and thought that is soooo true. I drove to work today and I had a certain peace in my soul and a certain person on my mind. All the way to work and when it slows down I just think about this person. I wonder about family, about children, about our life would have been with all these things and I know that there are no mistakes, but still wonder what if? I even thought bout leaveing a msg to ask to talk to this person‚Ä¶.but why mess with their happiness and the progress they have done in their lives. So, i drove on ‚Ä¶.thinking about the song‚Ä¶yup so many times in my life i was searching everywhere while it was right there in my hand making mountains out of grains of sand. Tonight at group we talked about boundaries, and you know i have heard this and its different when you teach something you trully get a understanding of it. I just had some reeses cups yummy‚Ä¶.lol. 
I never thought life would be as good as it is today, sure it isnt all roses but you know what? I am sober my mind doesnt wander i dont have issues with porn like i used to i dont go to places where my character would be questioned, I am responsible with my finances, and I actually have the ability to take care of myself for once in my life. I am not bragging by no means cause it took a long time for me to ""grow up"". I was reading something the other day about losing in order to grow, well that is so true, if you never have to see the truth for what it is, and actually get honest with yourself then there is no way in hell that you can grow. I have learned to laugh tonight at group i said something and just burst out in laughter, i got so tickled that i couldnt stop i had to go to the bathroom and splash water on my face to bring it back‚Ä¶lol‚Ä¶.something i could never do really before is admit that i have a lighter side, the funny side, the witty side, and the side that its okay not to know everything and still look foolish, who cares life is to short to worry bout that mountain when its only fear that makes it a mountain. This weekend i am going to get me some funnel cake at this place i am craving it. Havent ate it in YEars‚Ä¶the last time was a windy day with me and b. we were gettin more powder on us then in our mouths i think but that was a time i couldnt just laugh at the moment was to worried bout what people thought if i got full of powder‚Ä¶such foolishness‚Ä¶..be kind be happy, and have joy, those things have always been foreign to me. I am trying though. I dont want to waste another day or another year to this bs of ‚Ä¶.once i get there‚Ä¶‚Ä¶i am here:) for better or worse‚Ä¶..i am me. I dont want to wake up one day and wonder where it went., what did i do with it, i heard a old timer say ""life isnt a dress rehersal, you only get it once"" or like in the big book talks about the world being a stage, we are our own worst critics, we are merely players because you know we wanted perfection as you do, but you know what? WE aint running nothing, we are merly players in this stage show called life. I think wow‚Ä¶how profound to think ‚Ä¶.so small but yet so fragile thinking we are so strong and even bigger then life itself. 
I am 36 and finally am glad that I am at this age, cause it took alot to get here. I was looking at this diary and i started it in 2003. Wow‚Ä¶thoughts and ideas never go out of style, you just learn that maybe sometimes you pick your battles and its okay to be wrong. That was part of having damaged boundaries, thinkin i knew it all, letting the unhealthy in, and keeping the healthy people out. I dont know what is guarenteed in my life but i do know this, live it, love it, and laugh at it, cause is it really that important to be angry at it, hoard it, and want to be anyone but you? hell, i was playing around today with the cam at work and i was taking some pics that were clean and things i was unashamed of. I used that cam for bad in the past and kept it dirty just like i felt i was all that time. Never crossed my mind once. I dont go into chat rooms anymore, dont ask people to ""see"" me on cam all i use it for is to take some pics of myself so that my friends can see me as i age‚Ä¶lol. I also look at it to measure who i am trying to stay a part of. Me. Martin isnt so bad after all. I have my days there is no such thing as perfection but you know‚Ä¶for the most part‚Ä¶i try to be a part of my life today instead of apart from. I also was driving to work thinking about that song‚Ä¶who youd be today‚Ä¶‚Ä¶so many secrets and things keep you from loving those that you cant let go of‚Ä¶once trust is broken‚Ä¶all that remains is the memories of the part that never leaves you ‚Ä¶their smile, their kiss, their touch, and their kindness not to hurt a soul, but just the tenderness of a childlike innocense, just priceless. 
its three thirty in the morning and i have tons to say obviously‚Ä¶lol. This line in this song goes pain surrounds me like a heavy coat‚Ä¶wow gettin to old to wear that coat‚Ä¶..i feel you everywhere i go‚Ä¶sometimes i wonder ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶then i smile and think ‚Ä¶..only god knows. Just know no one can take your place‚Ä¶‚Ä¶sometimes i wonder who youd be today‚Ä¶.you know i get caught up in life and the speed of it, its so great when im teaching group or a individual session and you can really know its god that is directing it‚Ä¶such a great feeling‚Ä¶.it took me losing my soul, losing my love ones, and always having a outlet to keep me sick, like they say some suffer from grave and emotional illness that may never get it. , i always thought damn that is me, but i was making god small. i w
asnt ready and really wasnt done, just a game of teeter tooder, putting my love ones thru hell watcing me deteriorate and die.we must give up and let god take the fight in us, take it all, and kill our old selves so to speak its what it takes to finally understand the pain of losing all that you hold dear, as you sit there in your tears as your life is going down the drain in a pile of vomit of last nights binge. I have empathy for addicts cause i am one and i work with them, but alot tell me it took jail or prison to get the dry time they needed away from everyone and everything they loved to sit and reflect on all that was dear, the drug is cunning, baffling and powerful.Life is full of temptation and full of ways to kill your soul when you feel at your lowest, but you know sometimes like it says the mountain you are climbing is a speck of dust in gods eyes‚Ä¶all the treatment in the world, all the literature, all the doctors in the world, all the medicine in the world, nothing works,,,,until you make that descision to be honest, and accept you can never ever never ever touch it again‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.and then start to take the steps they outline‚Ä¶.anything else is just self will run riot‚Ä¶..and the chaos that is a junkies life. all the treatment all the stuff you learn hell i am a counselor and i dopefiened my addiction trying to think i wasnt that bad‚Ä¶.i had a job had a gf had a car‚Ä¶..yada yada time to cut it off ‚Ä¶.took alot‚Ä¶..and i only hav eninety days‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..was a battle but im here finally!! i know that its a goal, but everyday is a goal to remain in gods light and glory especially when my will gets beaten down and i want a way out, anyway will do, SOMETIMES WE MUST FEEL THE PAIN>>>>>>TO REMEMBER I NEVER WANT THIS SHIT LIFE EVER AGAIN‚Ä¶it sounds harsh but you know‚Ä¶.takes what it takes they are right. ill get off my soapbox what the hell do i know? im just a addict that is working this the best i can for me, aint got time to work on others when i am just one step away from ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.have a great day !! love you guys‚Ä¶.thanks for your prayers and kind words‚Ä¶.:)

hey diary:) 
It is ten oclock on a saturday night and i just purchased some wireless headphones and jammin to this old school song. I have had some weird dreams lately from the past and from the present and everything in between. One thing I could never say very long is that I was faithful in my life. Faithful with my god, faithful with my extended family, faithful with my girlfriends, faithful to me or my sobriety. I write about these things cause its like getting it out to let myself grow even more. I was watching a show tonight on the worlds most evil and so many memories were triggered from my dysfunctional family that were being portrayed on the screen. My mom and dad were evil in the ways they thought the way they treated themselves and us. I was remembering how I used to video tape women for him at pools, and areas feeling such shame but at the time tossing that shame aside and started to feel accepted by this man. I knew what i was doing wasnt right but i felt it was the closest i could get to a female without the rejection factor taking over. I was thirteen when this started, being exposed to the chaos the sexuality crisis i dealt with learning a disrespect for women I already had it with humanity. I was watching this show tonight thinking you know‚Ä¶.its a miracle I didnt turn out to be a serial killer or worst. Its a miracle that no more had to see the demon that raged inside of me that those that had to endure that sickness. I remember the beatings the fear of the unseen pervertiveness of my fathers twisted world. I learned to be a monster, to be a person with no soul or feelings and take it out on the one gender that expresses love and kindness, on the female. I hated my mom deep down for all that she didnt do, all that she allowed to happen to me, all the sexual abuse that happend to me the torture the sadistic voyerism i was exposed to the graphic pornography that layed around constant shame from hearing it, or seeing it. The constant accusations of me stealing it or looking at it and losing it which was never true, i took the blame alot of the time to keep others from hurting and taking all the pain. I wanted it to go away quickly i learned to lie, to manipulate situations so they would be quickly defused. I didnt want to be confrontational. I wanted it to end as quickly as it could and prayed to god i would not end up looking in the bad light in the end.¬† I remember the looks he would give when he went into that perverse state of mind, licking his lips, his eyes wideing up‚Ä¶.the total smell of lust in the air, the total focus on self indulgance at the expense of others. Damn‚Ä¶sounds like i did become like my old man‚Ä¶.these are gone slowly but at times i get so intranced its like a drug, like getting a fix, cause after all , all that i know about it is that it is all connected into the limbic system the pleasure center of the brain. I learned not to feel pain, not to feel happiness not to feel remorse or to feel anykind of self care other then to become the robot to make sure the tools he had were always in place, to make sure that everything was as perfect as could be around him, heating up his food, if it was cold a kick a slap a mean yell or word. I remember alot of sleepwalking alot of bed wetting, alot of fear alot of fear, while all the time asking myself where are you god? why wont you take this man away? 
¬†
I am writing about this because on friday i had a individual session with a person or actually two that were sitting in front of me telling me the identical things i went thru in my life, and i didnt react but i did feel it felt the pain the suffering these two people felt at the hands of another. TO become as though life is perfect around them having no way to wind down, no true connection to life other then working and trying to ""make it"" . Being so strict in their lives not to give themselves any room for failure or for shame. If there is shame or guilt be sure to ""clean it up"" as fast as possible to not face consequences. I have had dreams where my uncle was in them, where there were fighting, where there were sexual exploitation, where i was in compromising positiions and made to do stuff to people. I listen to the stories of others and the core component of drug addiction is abuse of some sort either emotional, physical , sexual or just plain mental disorders. I learned from my therapy that i was sexually abused as a child and i used to deny this with a passion stating no ""fing "" way. But it was normal to see these things how did i know that was sexual abuse at this point in my life. My dad got locked up and my mom and i was happy was happy the madness was over but it started a life of memories of repressed insanity in the mind. I took my first drink at eighteen and woke up at thirty one a lost and insecure little boy trying to be a man in a world that i didnt understand. I didnt know anything but drunken sex, drunken stories and lifestyle, drunken anger, drunken lies, drunken manipulation, drunken abuse, and drunken life. I was chasing after martin and i didnt have a clue who the hell i was or where i was going with my life. I was wanting to be respected while i had none for self, i wanted to be taken serious while i was never serious, i wanted salvation but layed with the devils children in the streets of the lost. I wandered around the world a sickness with no cure or no way of knowing i was even sick if that makes sense? I thought the world was just a piece of crap that i was left to fend for myself and not knowing who the hell i was when i wasnt in my fantasy world of alcoholism and sexual addiction. I was a person on a mission to destroy myself so that humanity didnt have to be hurt or harmed from my sick twisted existance. I was drowning myself in liquor sex and lies, and games to keep everyone including myself to not want to be around me, but while on the inside screaming out please dont leave. I was inprisioned by my lies, by my perception of what life was about. I met some great people along the way and even could be ""normal"" but once the pressure of failing at a simple event of living came along‚Ä¶hell i got nervous irritable and discontent and i started jonesing for a drink cause what if what if‚Ä¶they find out‚Ä¶‚Ä¶find out about all that i try to hide on a daily basis.?what if they know? wh
at if they judge me? what if they dont understand i dont even know why the hell i act like i do? what if they lock me away and never let me out cause im insane‚Ä¶..or worst off a alcholic. 
I found god many times i would find god when i was alone in my bed while my bruises were healing, when i would be getting beat so severly that i couldnt walk, couldnt cry and couldnt scream, i found god in these moments cause i was taken away so that i learned not to feel anything. I learned not to ask for or to even expect other then a harsh word, a harsh look, or just that i was someone no one wanted.There were people in my life that did want me did treat me good i dont want to sound like there wasnt, but i wouldnt let them in, because to me everyone was the enemy, hell i lived with the enemy in my own family. On the outside would look like the picture perfect family to the rest of the world, oh but thats my step son, marty‚Ä¶.he cant hear good, his eyes are crossed at times, his teeth are crooked, he smells, ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..dont worry bout him he wont hurt you got to keep him in his place and he wont move. He will stop breathing if you get on to him enough. I know today that marty isnt me anymore but somewhere deep down in the scars‚Ä¶.i know he was here once. He has left some clues some insecurities, and definatly some visions for me to see. I dont know how this kid made it? i dont know how he survived ? how he has the heart to go on even when it appears dismal and all that‚Ä¶.he made it by killing himself and just existing. So, I ask‚Ä¶to all the physchologists the therapists the people of faith, when all that you touch or have tough you eventually hurts the skin ‚Ä¶..how to raise up and be born so that it doesnt seep into the scars of yesterday? Cause that is where i am at and have been for years and years and years‚Ä¶people can tell you your worthy of love and stuff and at times you believe it, but underneath everything that is you, for some insane reason there is always that part of you that hurts, that aches, that smells, that cant hear well, that has funny eyes. I grew up to be someone i can respect and at times admire. but i know its not martin that speaks in the groups, it isnt me that does the counseling it is god, because when i let down the insecurities he flurishes‚Ä¶..i get tired i start beating myself up ‚Ä¶i get lonely‚Ä¶which is all the time‚Ä¶i start‚Ä¶‚Ä¶i pick up where that son of a bitch left off‚Ä¶.
all that blood that spilt was my hopes my love my desires, my faith, my personality, my innocense, my self worth.
all the years i drank i filled myself up with all that spilt out of me everytime i got beat, now i walk around sober and i still hide not because i am ashamed cause i talk about it i write about it, but because i still dont feel worthy ‚Ä¶.i know jesus went thru alot and he was perfect didnt do nothing wrong, but its like all the beatings i took all the pain i suffered i have spent most of my life making up situations to justify the abuse. its like when people make fun of me or make fun of what i say or do or that i am this or that i am that‚Ä¶.they think it hurts‚Ä¶but how can you hurt me when i have heard that my whole life? your just making it even clearer to me that i am a f-up, a misfit, a lost soul. this is honesty that im typing, the type many dont want to read or even comprehend, but these are the feelings that if kept inside of me will fester and continue to grow‚Ä¶..
i am not mad at god like i once was i even talk to him with faith and love, but there is still alot i have to learn along this journey i call my life. I dont know what my being is for, and when others get that light in their eyes that i want ‚Ä¶..i understand‚Ä¶.i tell my clients about my life, with no shame, no guilt, just honesty‚Ä¶..i just know one day i will stop hurting and all these insecurities will end, i have felt it‚Ä¶..that gives me hope. people ask‚Ä¶what do addicts think or feel‚Ä¶.well i have shared a little in this what goes on in my head‚Ä¶..i could write and write and write‚Ä¶.but i get scared cause i dont want to be judged or ridiculed for anything i believe or say in the name of ignorance and shitty parents. I feel empty inside now that im on the prozac‚Ä¶not depressed not happy‚Ä¶.just here. hell its better then the anxiety the lack of sleeping and crap‚Ä¶..small price i guess for some kind of sanity‚Ä¶you know i dont think i will ever be totally okay, but pray to god i find another that understands that and is able to live with me to build a family that i wish i would have had. I have taught myself good and wrong, but teaching it and knowing when to u se it seems to be my misfirings. I am not making excuses in here‚Ä¶.just trying to keep it as honest as i can‚Ä¶.well i am empty for the moment‚Ä¶ill be back soon‚Ä¶.love you guys and thanks for the notes and encouragement‚Ä¶..we all have issues‚Ä¶.some deeper then others but they all cut the same‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.

And with a sad heart I say bye to you and waveKicking shadows on the street for every mistake that I had madeAnd like a baby boy I never was a manUntil I saw your blue eyes cry and I held your face in my handAnd then I fell down yelling ‚ÄúMake it go away!‚ÄùJust make a smile come back and shine just like it used to beAnd then she whispered ‚ÄúHow can you do this to me?‚Äù

I just read this and heard the song on another page of someone very dear to me. Today i am reflecting on martin and all the precious gifts I have around me either from my past , present or even preparing for the future. I was this person of confusion and plain lost, and fearful of everything i was being exposd for my shortcomings for my insecurities and for all the failure i felt i had in me. I am listening to the voice of truth by casting crowns‚Ä¶see, alot of times i hear it but dont understand it and it pumps me up for a bit, but then i get caught up in the ways of the world, the all or nothing of my addictive personality. I know i cant be perfect with serving the lord so i give up way to easily because of the fear and all the restless feelings of insecurity. I have listend to the voice of truth, and i have been around god knowing people and each moment i spent with them i felt my dirtiness fade away but i didnt learn how to keep it off myself cause i always wanted others to ""save me"". 
I have been neglecting martin lately just exhisting in the moment and the confusion of others. I miss many people in my life, and wonder if they will ever trust me to speak to me again, to know that i care about them. I have failed at alot in my life, but the one thing i achieved was the conviction for truth lately., the longer that i stay sober the more time and energy that gives me hope that i can and will do this thing called living;. I keep hearing britts name in my head day to day and i wonder exactly what that means. The last msg or note i read told me clearly how she thinks of me and i just wonder what it is i am supposed to do or what not.¬† It is hard as hell to get on here and bare my soul and not be afraid that i will say something that offends or hurts, but i must do it to stay clean, and on the right track that god has prepared for me. I heard a story of two farmers that were asking god for rain‚Ä¶..they prayed and prayed one of them started preparing his fields for rain and the other did nothing. That is a example of having faith and living life as though its going to happen. Positive thoughts‚Ä¶positive actions‚Ä¶..i have been that farmer that has waited for signs all my life in order to move, i am getting better but still i procrastinate on things. reflect reflect reflect. all i am is your son lord, all i am is your precious gift to the world. 
I need to start saying good things about myself more the negative, but then i worry damn will people think i am being on a pity party or just boasting., i cant change them, i need to be true to the lord and do as he wishes. You know yall i make my lord small‚Ä¶so many times, i think lord this is to big for you let me have it‚Ä¶..step back a minute..use me to do it. then it takes forever for the problem to be solved cause i am scared and fearful‚Ä¶..silly huh. I will be back to write more‚Ä¶.i just need to sit back and soak in the word for a bit‚Ä¶.and shut up and be obediant‚Ä¶ i talk to much:P be back later yall‚Ä¶.god bless you guys and love you ‚Ä¶thanks for your notes and guidance‚Ä¶.may god be with you as well‚Ä¶

Every Man Lyrics by Casting Crowns
I‚Äôm the man with all I‚Äôve wantedAll the toys and playing gamesI am the one who pours your coffeeCorner booth each Saturday
I am your daughter‚Äôs favorite teacherI‚Äôm the leader of the bandI sit behind you in the bleachersI am every man
I‚Äôm the coach of every winning teamAnd still a loser in my mindI am the soldier in the airportFacing giants one more time
I am the woman shamed and hauntedBy the cry of unborn lifeI am every broken man Nervous child, lonely wife
Is there hope for every man?A solid place where we can standIn this dry and weary landIs there hope for every man?
Is there love that never diesIs there peace in troubled timesSomeone help me understandIs there hope for every man?
It seems there‚Äôs just so many roads to travelIt‚Äôs hard to tell where they will leadMy life is scarred, my dreams unravelledNow I am scared to take the lead
If I could find someone to followWho knows my pain and feels the wayThe uncertainty of my tomorrowThe guilt and pain of yesterday
Is there hope for every man?A solid place where we can standIn this dry and weary landIs there hope for every man?
Is there love that never diesIs there peace in troubled timesSomeone help me understandIs there hope for every man?
There is hope for every manA solid place where we can standIn this dry and weary landThere is hope for every man
There is love that never diesThere is peace in troubled timesWill we help them understandJesus is hope for every man
There is hope for every manA solid place where we can standIn this dry and weary landThere is hope for every man
There is love that never diesThere is peace in troubled timesWill we help them understandJesus is hope for every man 
I just finished watching the movie again facing the giants‚Ä¶unreal unreal testimony for the power of faith even if the smallest seed can be bloomed into a firm oak of understanding and glory for our god, and his son jesus christ.
Today has been a great day! I took the time to recharge and refill my love for god, I have been depleted for months and days, hanging on with the smallest threads, it feels great to have a whole day to worship and to understand that i can be quiet and let god speak to me, i dont have to know it all i dont have to be the best i can just be me, just be martin and that is enough for me and the world, i am here as a love for the world so that i may glorify the lords name and not be a hinderance to his glory but a harvester of love and peace, and hope. I work for a foundation called HOPE and the holidays are coming and are full of unfilled dreams, and unmet financial strains for people with less then some of us, please if you know anyone that needs help please direct them to the shelters, the food banks, the united way or some places where they can be assisted. This is the heaviest time of the year for peoples hearts, minds and souls. I understand this cause usually I am down around this time but this year I choose to do something different to try something new, not to prove a point but to actually learn the true meaning of thanks and glory for being able to be here to praise my lord one more day!‚Ä¶.I am feeling so great‚Ä¶so peaceful and clean‚Ä¶.full of promise and full of glory for my father! obediance is something i learned today‚Ä¶it means that there must be obediance even when no one is watching or checking up on you, there must be conviction amidst all the trials and tribulations of self doubt and self worry‚Ä¶there must be accountability for all i do, even the things i am not proud of or the thoughts that sometimes accumalate in my mind:)
That movie is just awesome and being a harvester for the glory of another and not me makes me feel great inside especially when that other person is my savior and guidance, my god. I have had some tough times lately because I have still been getting lonely and feel ""empty"" and thats why i know i need to feed my soul, which i have not been doing, i pray but its only half of all i can give, i have much more to give much more to go towards. I make a commitment tonight that i will give my best in all that i do and not to overdo it as long as its for the glory of my creator. I have not ever done that, have done it for money, have done it for status, have done it for acculades, and for self indulgant pride. One think i notice about me is that i make my god small, and attempt to not have help in times of need, no mistakes, i hear the words in my mind‚Ä¶.i hear the feelings that come from my heart‚Ä¶.in these times everything is goin so fast we want this want that‚Ä¶.cant be happy with out this or that‚Ä¶‚Ä¶while our soul remains empty and our conscious aches with the calls from our father‚Ä¶.saying hi‚Ä¶i love you i just want to speak to you martin‚Ä¶..you hear everyone else‚Ä¶.why wont you take time to listen or talk to me? are you ashamed? is it fear? why son do you forsake me ? god gave me the gift to lead to be loud‚Ä¶..and to penetrate the deepest denial thru his glory and his leadership, i waste that gift, i waste alot that has been bestowed to me by my heavenly father, instead i worry bout stupid stuff the world tells me is important, ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶please forgive me lord‚Ä¶..please forgive me. 
¬†
I am gonna go read some out of my bible and then call it a night i am to wired to call it a night exactly at this moment, but i am so thankful that god cares enough about me not to keep me in the grasp of the devil, ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶if your having problems with accepting any kind of faith or if he exists or not,‚Ä¶.try him his son‚Ä¶..give him a chance‚Ä¶to change your life, what does it hurt‚Ä¶your already hurting why not try something new? ask the lord into your heart if you havent, give your everything in the name of jesus to bring you to the salvation your soul aches for‚Ä¶.ask yourself where is my life going? what if i died tonight? where would i go? ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶god bless you all that struggle with shame/guilt, and much more, please dont give up the answer you seek is deep within your heart ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶let god in‚Ä¶.he opens the doors that cant be opened and doesnt close the ones that want to close‚Ä¶alll in his glory we are here‚Ä¶.god bless good night* love you all.

Daily Battles of the Mind
by Joyce Meyer
Did you know that we are in a war every day? We see the casualties everywhere‚Äîpeople falling from disease, divorce and tragedy. Looking around at all the suffering, we may think the battles in hospitals and divorce courts are being lost. But in reality, we‚Äôre losing the advanced and more important conflict‚Äîthe battle in our minds. 
Each day our minds are bombarded with a constant stream of nagging thoughts, suspicions, doubts and fears. While any one of these can cause defeat and devastation, we are often plagued by more than one‚Ä¶filling our daily lives with mental combat against an array of aggressors. 
Since we fail to identify the battlefield, we also fail to correctly identify our foe. We tend to believe people, money, religion or ‚Äúthe system‚Äù are our problems. In an attempt to defend ourselves, we build strongholds in our mind. Strongholds are areas of thinking not based on truth but lies. Instead of protecting us, they actually imprison us. Unless we renew our mind, we risk continuing to believe those lies and making important decisions based on deception. 
Let me give you an example of how strongholds of wrong thinking can destroy a marriage. Mary and her husband, John, are not enjoying a happy marriage. There is strife between them all the time. They are angry, bitter and resentful. Now their two children are starting to show signs of being affected by all the dissension at home. One of the kids is even developing stomach problems brought on by stress from the conflict. 
Mary‚Äôs problem is that she doesn‚Äôt know how to let John be the head of their family. She is bossy‚Äîshe wants to make all the decisions, handle the finances, and discipline the children. She wants to work so she will have her ""own"" money. She‚Äôs independent, loud and demanding. Mary knows her attitude is wrong and wants to change. She‚Äôs been in counseling and is constantly asking people to pray for God to help her. But she hasn‚Äôt seen any improvement. Why? Mary has trouble controlling her actions because she has trouble controlling her thoughts. She has a hard time knowing what thoughts to control because of the strongholds in her mind‚Äîstrongholds that were built very early in her life. 
As a child, Mary had an extremely domineering father. For years she suffered helplessly as her father mistreated her and her mother. He was disrespectful in all his ways except toward Mary‚Äôs brother who could do no wrong. It seemed as if he was favored just because he was a boy. By the time she was sixteen, the strongholds in Mary‚Äôs mind were firmly established. The stronghold of lies went like this: ""Men really think they‚Äôre something. They are all alike, and you can‚Äôt trust any of them. They will hurt you and take advantage of you."" As a result, Mary‚Äôs mind was made up: ""When I get away from home, nobody is ever going to push me around again!"" 
Before Mary can ever have victory in her life and peace in her marriage, she will have to tear down the strongholds that are ruling her thinking. Do you see yourself in Mary‚Äôs life? Many of us have given in to deception at one time or another. How can these strongholds be torn down? We must be willing to receive the light of Truth in our minds. Our search for Truth begins in God‚Äôs Word, which says that the Truth will set us free (see John 8:32). This means we can be free from bondage, sin and strongholds in our minds. But just searching for Truth won‚Äôt set us free. We must be courageous enough to also believe the Truth. 
Even when the Truth illuminates what‚Äôs inside of us, it‚Äôs sometimes hard to accept. It‚Äôs a painful process to face our deceptions and deal with them. It‚Äôs so easy to allow our past and how we were raised to negatively affect us for the rest of our lives. Our past may explain why we‚Äôre suffering, but we must not use it as an excuse to stay in bondage. You may have some major strongholds in your life that need to be torn down. Let me encourage you by saying, ‚ÄúGod is on your side.‚Äù There is a war going on, and your mind is the battlefield. But the good news is that God is fighting on your side!

Oh I had alot to sayWas thinking on my time awayI missed you and things weren‚Äôt the same‚ÄòCause everything inside it never comes out rightAnd when I see you cry it makes me wanna die.
I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm bad, I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre blueI‚Äôm sorry about all the things I said to youAnd I know I can‚Äôt take it backI love how you kiss, I love all your soundsAnd baby the way you make my world go ‚ÄôroundAnd I just wanted to say I‚Äôm sorry. 
This time I think I‚Äôm to blameIt‚Äôs harder to get through the daysWe get older and blame turns to shame‚ÄòCause everything inside it never comes out rightAnd when I see you cry it makes me wanna die.
I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm bad, I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre blueI‚Äôm sorry about all the things I said to youAnd I know I can‚Äôt take it backI love how you kiss, I love all your soundsAnd baby the way you make my world go ‚ÄôroundAnd I just wanted to say I‚Äôm sorry. 
Every single day I think about how we came all this wayThe sleepless nights and the tears you criedIt‚Äôs never too late to make it rightOh yeah sorry
I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm bad, I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre blueI‚Äôm sorry about all the things I said to youAnd I know I can‚Äôt take it backI love how you kiss, I love all your soundsAnd baby the way you make my world go ‚ÄôroundAnd I just wanted to say I‚Äôm sorry. I‚Äôm sorry baby.I‚Äôm sorry baby, Yeah.I‚Äôm sorry.
yah‚Ä¶‚Ä¶all that and much more‚Ä¶.i have this song on my page and it just says it all when as the days go by and blame turns to shame. Pride keeps hearts from connecting cause the past, and all the things that keep you from coming together again. I just finished group and wanted to write in here cause its something that cant wait til i get home. I am just overwhelmed with emotion right now and i am all kinds of things at once‚Ä¶im sad im blue im happy and im lonely and i am just overjoyed. None above the other. This song touches me deep down cause a love i had and thought time got rid of or even the harsh words or actions of another later on killed it, i still just hold on to it, sorry is not enough when the one you care about you harm‚Ä¶its not like a intentional thing that happens because most of the time its the complete opposite in my head. I dont want to harm and end up harming, i dont want to lose someone or something, and i lose them‚Ä¶i never fight for what i want i just wait till its gone then miss it like crazy, because that is when the feelings are able to be genuine. Sorry isnt enough when you cut to the deepest of someones love, you know the truth of the matter is i will never find someone as great as what i lost. NEver. No one is perfect but the good qualities out numbered the bad‚Ä¶, this honesty stuff is hard as shit, when feelings are involved, cause its getting deep down and gut wrenching with the real way you feel about people ‚Ä¶
I know you got over me along time ago, and the mention of my name brings disgust to your insides. I succeeded in what i set out not to do. I made you hate me. This is how little i felt about myself. This is the smallest increment of discust i had for myself‚Ä¶i succeeded. To protect you from me. 
exhales* this is tuff‚Ä¶‚Ä¶the bleeding of the soul is a hard process but must be done to get on with living and healing‚Ä¶.

its two in the morning and i saw a glimpse of you in my dreams‚Ä¶i reached out to touch you and it was like a forcefield was around you cause of all the times that i touched you i left scars that took years to heal. I finally got close enough to touch you and you cried and i wiped them off your cheek and said yes baby i know i feel it too. I dont know why it took so long for it to happen but now that your here i wont let you go, and i sure as hell wont make the same mistakes that allowed me to loose you to begin with. You stared in my eyes and asked why did it take me so long to get thru all the stuff that kept me sick? i said ‚Ä¶it was a time that god was preparing this to happen. I got here as fast as i could, and as healthy as i could. I know that if it was up to me, i would have jumped from start to finish‚Ä¶but isnt that how i lost you to begin with? So many nights i wonder in my sleep if it is you that i see, the gentle touch of your skin to the smell of passion on your breath, but then i reach out to touch you and you would be gone‚Ä¶i always wondered if it would ever be again, to much guilt to much shame that in time i thought you would never be again. You hold me as you have never lost me and that i never hurt you and that the child inside me has finally healed, no more dirtiness to get your skin sick, no more sins that chip away at your faith as well, just a solid person that loves you and wont let you fall again and hurt yourself or pull away. I feel the hands of god as all of our insecurities melt down our sides and we allow the past to be just that‚Ä¶..gone forever to be thought of no more but a new ness that is you and i. You place your hands on my face and look deep in my eyes and see nothing but the future for us, its full of children and lots of trust. You cant pull away because the picture is so intense that it creates a smile from ear to ear and you say‚Ä¶baby i knew you would make it back someday, i have missed you more then a thousand days‚Ä¶even the ticks of the clock are so short, this seemed like eternity for us to start this again‚Ä¶living baby is a part of life that allows the old to be no more, to allow growth and happiness to reign free. I have spent lots of sleepless nights waiting for the day i would hold you again‚Ä¶kiss you again and never see anything but the love that the lord set us up with to begin with. That thing that used to bring us apart is no longer around, i dont want it and dont need others to fill the space in my heart that was made just for you. It has taken time for me to become whole‚Ä¶.you ask me in the gentlest of voices, are you sure its me that you want? are you sure that all this time we have anything to gain from touching again""? i look you deep and as sincere as i can say it, baby for so long i didnt know it was anyone that would be good nuff for me especially myself then i keep goin back into my heart and seeking deep and far, and every beat it takes there you are. Not a faintness but it is stronger then the scars and in the end, you prevail amidst it all.

The Scars of Life‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
Some years ago, on a hot summer day in south Florida, a little boydecided to go for a swim in the old swimming hole behiind his house. Ina hurry to dive into the cool water, he ran out the back door, leavingbehind shoes, socks and shirt as he went. He flew into the water, notrealizing that as he swam toward the middle of the lake, an alligatorwas swimming toward the shore.
His father working in the yard saw the two as they got closer and closer together. In utter fear, he ran toward the water, yelling to his son asloudly as he could.
Hearing his voice, the little boy became alarmed and made a U-turn toswim to his father. It was too late. Just as he reached his father, thealligator reached him. From the dock, the father grabbed his little boyby the arms just as the alligator snatched his legs. That began anincredible tug-of-war between the two. The alligator was much strongerthan the father, but the father was much too passionate to let go. Afarmer happened to drive by, heard his screams, raced from his truck,took aim and shot the alligator.
Remarkably, after weeks and weeks in the hospital, the little boysurvived. His legs were extremely scarred by the vicious attack of theanimal. And on his arms were deep scratches where his father‚Äôsfingernails dug into his flesh in his effort to hang on to the son heloved. The newspaper reporter who interviewed the boy after the trauma,asked if he would show him his scars. The boy lifted his pant legs. Andthen,with obvious pride, he said to the reporter, ""But look at my arms.I have great scars on my arms, too. I have them because my Dad wouldn‚Äôtlet go.""
You and I can identify with that little boy. We have scars, too. No,¬†not from an alligator, but the scars of a painful past. Some of those¬†scars are unsightly and have caused us deep regret. But, some wounds,¬†my friend, are because God has refused to let go. In the midst of¬†your struggle, He‚Äôs been there holding on to you. 
God loves you. You are a child of God. He wants to protect you and¬†provide for you in every way. But sometimes we foolishly wade into¬†dangerous situations, not knowing what lies ahead. The swimming hole of life is filled with peril, and we forget that the enemy is waiting¬†to attack.
That‚Äôs when the tug-of-war begins, and if you have the¬†scars of His love on 
your arms be very, very grateful. He did not and¬†will not ever let you go.
¬†
Please pass this on to those you love. God has blessed you, so that¬†you can be a blessing to others. You just never know where a person¬†is in his/her life and what they are going through.
Never judge another persons scars, because you don‚Äôt know how they got them. Right now, someone needs to know that God loves them, and¬†you love them, too ~~~~~ enough to not let them go

Somewhere In The Middle lyrics
Somewhere between the hot and the coldSomewhere between the new and the oldSomewhere between who I am and who I used to beSomewhere in the middle, You‚Äôll find me
Somewhere between the wrong and the rightSomewhere between the darkness and the lightSomewhere between who I was and who You‚Äôre making meSomewhere in the middle, You‚Äôll find me
Just how close can I get, Lord, to my surrender without losing all control
Fearless warriors in a picket fence, reckless abandon wrapped in common senseDeep water faith in the shallow end and we are caught in the middleWith eyes wide open to the differences, the God we want and the God who isBut will we trade our dreams for His or are we caught in the middleAre we caught in the middle
Somewhere between my heart and my handsSomewhere between my faith and my plansSomewhere between the safety of the boat and the crashing waves
Somewhere between a whisper and a roarSomewhere between the altar and the doorSomewhere between contented peace and always wanting moreSomewhere in the middle You‚Äôll find me
Just how close can I get, Lord, to my surrender without losing all control
Lord, I feel You in this place and I know You‚Äôre by my sideLoving me even on these nights when I‚Äôm caught in the middle
hey blog i am thinking alot tonight about the middle of the road that is before me.I have a great opportunity before me that has been waiting for me since I started this journey as a counselor. I dont take the time to give thanks and to be humble and actually give my glory to the highest of the high..god almighty my lord. I am sitting here wanting to cry because of all the stress of the day and just not knowing how to take things in moderation. I have always been that way if I wanted something i went at it full blast then worried bout keeping it later on‚Ä¶i know it doesnt happen that way for the foundation of the strong. I am learning and if i have come across a lil strong to some of you , please forgive me, I just dont want to let some good things or as i view them sit and get stale . I am so analytical it cracks me up. I have so many things to be thankful of for this day, even though so much went a little off the smooth path that is control. I am learning slowly that sometimes in order to achieve we must let go of the reigns so that if it happens it grows on its own‚Ä¶.i had a client today that just gave me the creepiest feeling and i never get that with any of them but he was so cold and felt so lost, i kept telling myself this will pass love him like jesus martin. Be grateful to him dont judge him, he is a person that could be saved today if only you dont treat him as so many have in his life, keep the exterior out of the picture dig deep. He was a accomplice to a murder, rape, burning of a female‚Ä¶.all this happend and all he got was twelve years‚Ä¶..amidst all that gruesome stuff is a soul, that wasnt always lost, wasnt always full of anger and pain. The only thing that seperates the lost is significant pain and suffering with no real coping skills to deal with the pain, shame/guilt of life. I had group with this individual tonight and you know what? i looked past what i had read and concentrated more on the soul, then the person that commited a crime or sin. He is gods child as well, as i type away on this keyboard like im orchrastrating a symphony‚Ä¶‚Ä¶i feel the spirit of the lord taking the blemishes of my day and cleansing my soul, cleansing my thoughts, and allowing me to actually love myself at this moment. I dont know sometimes why it comes as it does, but i know one thing for certain it helps‚Ä¶‚Ä¶for all of you that gave me prayers today‚Ä¶god bless you ! i love you guys‚Ä¶..:)

Pray For Me lyrics
[Verse 1] She lights a candle, but she doesn‚Äôt know why. She wants to save me, but i‚Äôm barely alive. My soul is thirsty. I just wanna get high. Make her go away. 
[Pre-Chorus] Now i‚Äôm hitting the wall and she begs me to quit, And she drags me to church but i‚Äôm scared to commit, And i‚Äôm loosing my mind ‚Äôcause she hides all my shit. She wont go away. 
[Chorus] And all I ask of her is Pray for me, ‚ÄòCause I don‚Äôt want to Pray for me, If you love me. Cross your heart and hope that I wont die before the best day of my life. Just pray for me tonight. 
[Verse 2] I dragged myself out of the bed that she made, And I escape her in a black motercade She‚Äôs pushing bibles and a clear bill of health. I can‚Äôt make her go away. 
[Pre-Chorus] Now i‚Äôm hitting the wall and she begs me to quit, And she drags me to church but i‚Äôm scared to commit, And i‚Äôm loosing my mind ‚Äôcause she hides all my shit. She wont go away. 
[Chorus] And all I ask of her is Pray for me, ‚ÄòCause I don‚Äôt want to Pray for me, If you love me. Cross your heart and hope that I don‚Äôt die before the best day of my life. Just pray for me tonight.

¬†
the insanity of the uncertain is looming around every corner as i am contimplating a career move, all the agony of my mind goes in and out my brain, as the questions whirl around my head as so many feelings go in and out as i inhale and exhale praying for the sanity of my soul, the restlessness to stop, the irritable undesiveness to stop.
¬†
¬†
So here we are at the end, And at the same time we‚Äôre at the beginning Of this misadventure. Why I had to go down a dead end street At 200 miles an hour Screaming for vengeance and embracing death, That‚Äôs still something I‚Äôm trying to figure out. You know a part of me thinks this is some big master plan To expose the raw nerve endings of dysfunction so I can heal. But you know addicts, we think everything‚Äôs about us, don‚Äôt we? 
Man, it got so convoluted, polluted, and distorted I ran with the only information I was given I turned it into my armor, my defense mechanism And my weapon of self destruction Yeah, I had a fucked up childhood. And I was a troubled teen. Those are facts. How I got there? That‚Äôs a story told by many voices. It‚Äôs not my job to blame anybody anymore, I just need to accept the path I was given. 
This is, without a doubt, My life‚Ä¶ after death. 
¬†
I am not in the cross hairs of a victim but at the edge of a cliff that if i jump i will dive into salvation to this life to never return. You must die and kill the old to be born again brand new, i am not talking about suicide i am talking about leaving the old behind and never fuckin lookin back, the only thing that will come with me will be the freakin memories of who i am and what i am about. I am so sick and tired of this road i continuously crash into and whipe out from the fear of going around the next corner. I let fear rule my every move my every breath, until i choke til i have nothing left, i am miserble, i am lost, but i know this is old news to those that have known me the best, just another cry for help another meaningless follow thru.., well i tell you this, as time is not no longer a ally for me then i will make this leap and finally be born again, all the booze all the antidepressants, all the freakin world revolving faster and faster and faster til our brains just want to implode with the sound of the ticking stopping long enough to take a breath of freedom. So, many times we wonder how did it get to this? why is it a constant continuem of question of doubt, of shame, of guilt of ignorance and of dark filled unlove. Fauk where does it all come from why is it just a enigma in my head that in continuem of trickles of emotion leave a moment where nothing exists and no one is warm and no one is hurt by me or mine, i am in a world where i dont understand it, and for the most part never felt like i belonged in it. I am like a rogue that destroys all he touches if not instantly but in time the camoflauge of a camelion that hides to be safe from the destruction‚Ä¶.all in¬† his path.Pain death loss emo addict lost soul without a plan, why cant i commit to the one thing that will set me free? why must i lie to keep this insanity up? why does it burn to the core of my very existance that screams out in shame, why why ‚Ä¶.ugh i see others that have it all together as my world unravels one thread at a time, for those that can make it thru the day without the pain, i comend you on a good job done, because in my mind it never stops, it never calms itself, it never releases happiness unless im so freaking medicated i laugh like a foreign stated mind that doesnt identify where to start it and when to cut it off, i swear the longer i stay in this mindfuck the sicker it makes me, i just want out but i have so many things that i need to be responsible for and i cant just walk away from‚Ä¶oh well welcome inside my mindfuck‚Ä¶‚Ä¶where all the screaming and pain is just a walk in the park as those around me live a life i dont understand and pain is all i can identify with, therapy inside my head as i sneeze and the oozingt stops for a moment in time, why god am i here? what is my purpose? what is this life all about cause i really dont fuckin know‚Ä¶‚Ä¶i have no clue‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..help me i am just fallin like these flakes‚Ä¶‚Ä¶gotta go work‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.or try to.

diary diary diary‚Ä¶.the diary of a madman ozzy once sang about. As i live longer i appear to understand that insanity. I was upset with myself cause all damn day i thought the meeting i was going to was at eight where in reality it was at six and here it was six thirty, pissed me off. I am listening to linkin park right now, and was reading battlefield of the mind earlier, trying to understand this continuem of questions that arise in my mind. I have felt for a lot of years that the only person i really wanted to know was me., but it appears the more people that know that person for some ungodly reason they dont like him. Either a, he is to clingy and needy or b. just to cold and untouchable. I know that i am not a unique individual by any means, but still i think what the hell‚Ä¶.i can hear that moments of time that fall as the snowflakes fall in this background. all i know is that my mind is in constant battle and turmoil of what ifs‚Ä¶.why nots‚Ä¶.and stupid victim crap. I was watching this show on discovery channel talkin bout the most evil people in history and they all had a running trait, some sort of dysfunction happend to them all, and they turned out to inflict pain and torture on all those that crossed their paths. 
¬†
I was just thinkin of the extent that i go for a person who i just meet to get to like me‚Ä¶.so intense that i make sure they wont want to leave., then in the process smothering the life out of that person or thing. Then its either that or its the total opposite, i keep you away til i trust that you wont harm me, and by that time its to late, you are bored with me and have just about opted out of the relationship. I wonder why the hell relationships are like my focal point, sheesh i feel crazy wanting something that i am totally unable to do. Insanity it is.
¬†got a one-way ticket on a hell-bound trainWith nothing to lose and nothing to gainNobody ever taught me how to liveI‚Äôm feeling like I‚Äôm lost- like I‚Äôll never be foundI‚Äôm twisted and I‚Äôm turned aroundNobody ever taught me how to loveI‚Äôm hurting everybody I‚Äôm hurting myselfI‚Äôm desperate

(verse2)If you were to tell me that I‚Äôd die todayThis is what I‚Äôd have to sayI never really had the time to liveAnd if you were to give me just another chanceAnother life, another danceAll I really want to do is loveI‚Äôm hurting everybodyI‚Äôm hurting myselfI‚Äôm desperate
But what do you doWhen it all comes down on you?Do you run and hideOr face the truth?So what do you doWhen it all comes down on you?Do you run and hideOr face the truth?So what do you do? 
When all is said and done you could be the oneWith open arms and open eyesYou‚Äôre jumping off the edge and hoping you can flyAccept your fate for what it isInto the great unknownYEAH!
So what do you do? When it all comes down on you Do you run and hide? Or face the truth So what do you do? When it all comes down on you Do you run and hide Or face the truth So what do you do? When it all turned around on you Do you run and hide Or face the truth?

            Be Happy 
            ../noindex‚Äì>
            January 16
The Lord is my Strength and Song; and He has become my Salvation. The voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tents and private dwellings of the [uncompromisingly] righteous: the right hand of the Lord does valiantly and achieves strength! ‚ÄîPsalm 118:14‚Äì15 
Happiness is the result of a radical, outrageous relationship with God. If we want to walk in victory, we have to put some time into our relationship with the Lord. There is much to discover about His plans for us. 
Our contentment won‚Äôt last if we are not obeying God by seeking Him with our whole heart. God wants us to really talk to Him and pay attention to His answers. Spend enough time with Him this morning to walk in victory all day.¬† 

learn to love your life, and live it for you‚Ä¶those that have harmed you let them go to god, it is the way it is ment to be to live in regret and doubt is to live in confusion and pain‚Ä¶only god can get you thru the darkness, people of human form can only tempt the progression of the lord, to seek the sunshine you must be willin to accept the positive people in your lives‚Ä¶run from even the appearance of evil cause as you are with the evil in bondage so does your life command you to hell‚Ä¶a life without love and acceptance of self is a life of unhealthy wants and the way we get in the way of progression‚Ä¶we must spend time on the goodness in us and others that are worthy of that thru god not thru humanly appearance. Thru our own love we let others love us‚Ä¶we allow people to hold to confort and to help us when we are weak‚Ä¶in the end god sent us to be a testimony to those that have no faith or are being led by self will. When the wicked get tired enough to change then god is waitin thru his son jesus christ‚Ä¶.which direction are you headed? are you lettin him guide you? or are you doing it the same way that it has always been to only be inevitably waitin for it to fail‚Ä¶the same results time and time again‚Ä¶if nothing changes NOThing changes‚Ä¶.in god we have hope in god we have love‚Ä¶.in god there is sunshine‚Ä¶in the doubts, and worries , and shame and guilt are of the devil‚Ä¶be still‚Ä¶and listen to the way you are being guided‚Ä¶thus release your love upon the lord‚Ä¶.may your days be full of love, and full of life., those that you see the spirit of god in ‚Ä¶.flock together‚Ä¶in those that dont know him‚Ä¶.you must let them be until they to are bonded with the holy spirit‚Ä¶god bless you guys‚Ä¶have a blessed day‚Ä¶had this on my heart‚Ä¶.mostly to remind me of my own defects not trying to save anyone else‚Ä¶.love yall‚Ä¶.god bless*

Somewhere between the hot and the coldSomewhere between the new and the oldSomewhere between who I am and who I used to beSomewhere in the middle, You‚Äôll find me
Somewhere between the wrong and the rightSomewhere between the darkness and the lightSomewhere between who I was and who You‚Äôre making meSomewhere in the middle, You‚Äôll find me
Just how close can I get, Lord, to my surrender without losing all control
Fearless warriors in a picket fence, reckless abandon wrapped in common senseDeep water faith in the shallow end and we are caught in the middleWith eyes wide open to the differences, the God we want and the God who isBut will we trade our dreams for His or are we caught in the middleAre we caught in the middle
Somewhere between my heart and my handsSomewhere between my faith and my plansSomewhere between the safety of the boat and the crashing waves
Somewhere between a whisper and a roarSomewhere between the altar and the doorSomewhere between contented peace and always wanting moreSomewhere in the middle You‚Äôll find me
Just how close can I get, Lord, to my surrender without losing all control
Lord, I feel You in this place and I know You‚Äôre by my sideLoving me even on these nights when I‚Äôm caught in the middle
Balance is what this song is telling me and that somewhere between the alter and the door was where I didnt understand but it all makes sense at this moment cause for years i :""wanted"" a god who i didnt understand a relationship with him that didnt make sense i just knew i prayed‚Ä¶..i heard something today that hit me hard‚Ä¶.did i pray to god ? or did i pray just to hear myself speak? for alot of years‚Ä¶was out of desperation out of last ditch effort‚Ä¶today i told myself martin‚Ä¶in victory and in defeat you WILL PRAISE the lord almighty. I am sitting at my desk happy happy for no other reason then having this song on repeat and allowing the sunshine of my gods love flow down on me. I have been listening to joyce meyers all day! i burned three cds from limewire. com and they are sermons of her testimonies and convicted stories of faith‚Ä¶i finished a book called adult children of alcoholics‚Ä¶was written about me‚Ä¶totally. I dont have alot of time cause i have a client here in a bit ‚Ä¶but i just wanted to drop some lines of happiness and sunshine‚Ä¶god is so great and for alot of years of confusion and ""seeking"" that middle‚Ä¶.i was lost and afraid‚Ä¶afraid of leaving the old world behind‚Ä¶i am goin to get baptized as soon as i find a church home‚Ä¶i am starting my journey this weekend without fail! i promised this to the lord and i will be obediant. I want to be one with my father who journeyed‚Ä¶for my salvation. I dont want to spend forty years walking in circles where it only is eleven miles‚Ä¶..i will continue because i understand a little more today‚Ä¶its such a rush!!!!!! one more update i have been working out twice a day ‚Ä¶..takin the day off tonight cause im wearing a lil out but back at it tommorow‚Ä¶.i am growing up‚Ä¶.darn FINALLY!!! i am tired of childish ways‚Ä¶i am no longer a child‚Ä¶.and dear lord all because of your glory i am free if just for the moment‚Ä¶.which i know wont be unless i become prideful and take it back‚Ä¶..* I plan on not‚Ä¶..thanks for all your prayers and love‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..god bless * gotta get back to work‚Ä¶.

317,https://www.opendiary.com/m/rebornsoldier/today-4501-4537938/,2008-01-22,today‚Ä¶,"
I am writing in this forum cause in the other site i right my honest feelings and stuff i get judged so harshly that it angers me and why should i get angry over others perceptions. I am at work right now and not sad or down but have alot of idle time and i dont want to fill up my mind with trash. I have been speaking to myself lately about being honest with things that i have never wanted to deal with or run from. One of those issues was one time when my grandmother passed away I was off in a stupor because I couldnt handle the emotions like always just wanting a way out. I have noticed that when it comes to my emotions or pain i have been really selfish in this area where no one else in the world¬† matters. I have been told more then once about this but like they say when you arent ready to hear the truth you turn off your ears and open your mouth. I have been so bad at this, well, back to the story well probly about a month later my gf who was with me the whole time thru my grandmothers death had hers pass away, well during this time a friend of mine from my past had came back into the picture. Another character defect, always wanting the unattainable. I am ashamed to type this but i know its part of healing. I was so cold to my gf when she told me her grandmother died because i wanted to go to church with this other girl and her parents. I totally was cold and all that. She forgave me because like alot of my life i have been able to smoothe things over with a slick tung. I am gettin sick feeling typing this but i need it out. I have been looking at the pattern of my life that is a constant, and i have come up with these things. I am a liar, i manipulate, i use sex as power, and i play the victim. Those amongst other things have kept me from truelly giveing myself to god. I hold on to those coping skills in the ""backup"" role. I also have false pretense, meaning that when i am down and out i turn the ""god‚Äô card over, i try to fill the emptiness and lonliness with all that is ""holy"" while becomeing prideful then i crash and burn. I understand these things and at times i tell myself ""your not really doing this or that"" but in reality it is what it is‚Ä¶deception and total disregard for what living for the lord really is intended for. I live with shame/guilt on a daily basis i come to find out. I cant sleep lately because my own demons have been seen in another in my life. I have had anxiety beyond belief, and have been treated by this person the same way i treated my last real gf. So, you can imagine thinking ALL that is going on when i dont get a phone call, or a return text or its short and left with interputation issues. I always think the worst because for alot of years i have done the worst and still do,¬† so is it fair to judge and play the victim because someone is doing to me what i did to someone who trully loved me. I think i should feel every bit of the frustration, the pain, the not knowing and all the other negative attributes that go along with this. Another thing is using big words or fancy sentences to get my point across, what a sham, just another way to cover up my true feelings and insecurities. I know that i have gotten on here and swore to change and blah blah blah‚Ä¶like the addict i am, why believe a word i say, but you know in my chest after speaking TO god not at him last night in the middle of the night and admitting I am broken and a sinner of upmost proportions. I feel a calmness right now and im trying to not touch it. I want to be honest and not just tell the truth anymore. I have been a adulturer, a cheater, and a piece of crap all while ‚Äòsaying god this god that""‚Ä¶.all the time thinking others needed to ""change"" where refusing to change myself. I thought well i will read or do this and that, and it will mean something . I have been no better then the addict that continues to relapse after goin in and out of rehabs. I have made a decision to leave my profession behind and really quit running from my life and hurting others in the process. I am a deceitful ugliest individual i can imagine all the years of deceit. I thought that if i helped someone out that in turn i would feel better, but it just mounts up and up when it doesnt happen that way. I just pray that god truelly helps those that i have harmed in anyway what so ever. I never took this job serious and always thought, the words of another , the directions i have seen others take, i can pass myself off as the same where in reality i was no better then those that are still using. One thing for certain i cant care about a soul, not even god until i finally come clean with my stuff. I harbor so much trash in my heart and head that times i wonder how i dont explode from all the things ""I "" try to do. I could use all the catchy little phrases like progression rather then perfection but i know that just gives me a excuse to try as little as possible and then play the victim. I dont treat others with dignity and respect because you know what i have none for myself. this plateau that i am on right now feels so serene and safe i am gonna keep writing til i cant write anymore. I am owning all that i say. I have hurt the world with my falsness, and insecurities that i blamed others for. I want to get right with jesus i really do. i have became everything i swore i would never become. every damn thing. This person i am watchin self destruct means alot to me, but i cant save them. I have been that person and for what its worth i still am even though i dont drink i still harm martin any and every chance i get. i finally cried the other night, not as much as i should have but at least tears came out so i know there is still ducts that work. I often am the runner from my life because of the fear of consequences good or bad. I have always thought i was a big hearted person, but as soon as i see that person amerse i make a reason for you to hate me or dislike being around me, sabatage all the good that god is trying to give me and i cant receive it. i wont get into the preaching because i dont feel worthy enuff at this moment to use his name when i have used it so much in vain as it is. i was so mad at god the other day and the devil at the same damn time, wondering what the hell is the battle over, why is it so hard for me to be obedient, and to finally surrender for good, because i have expectations, expectations that once i feel good‚Ä¶‚Ä¶what if i never feel bad again‚Ä¶then what/ that is my best friend has got me soooooo many things in life‚Ä¶RIGHT! whatever, that person has destroyed all that i thought i wanted out of life, and even almost killed me many nights.i have spent 31 years becoming the person i am the one that is confused all the time, the one that harms himself when others arent paying attention to him, one that can not say no to ""fun"" and the one that thinks everyone is after my well being.¬† I made a promise to my therapist that i would take care of my inner child, and i let myself down like i always do, when no one is payin attention time for martin to hurt himself. Or if you are payin to much attention i run to hide to do the devious things i do so that ""i dont hurt you"" by being exposed to them. all bs and insanity i tell ya but for some reason‚Ä¶i just dont trust god enough to know how to let him have my life totally! i feel him right now as i type but doesnt mean at nine oclock tonight i wont be lonely and looking to make it go away‚Ä¶.insanity especially when i know that its just a quick fix to the eventual problem will still be there‚Ä¶..and bigger! I dont know what to do anymore, i am tired of playin the victim, tired of dragging those that i do know love me down the pipe of my destruction, i am lookin for a way to deal with this mess called my life and find a way to break free of the insanity and start to finally be happy‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.well that is all for now‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.

somewhere in the middle‚Ä¶ Current mood:  blessed Category: Life 
I just had a individual session and alot of things that were said just popped out at me and its incredible the word of god at work. I was telling this person that we at times look for that ""magical"" moment when all is where it should be for us to live. I have lived that way for years, always needing a measureing stick to begin to actually enjoy my life. I had to let all that go, because i am exactly where i am ment to be at this MOMENt. Good bad indifferent, and the things I am not proud of i can give to god. I have taken alot of life and just lived it with reckless abandonment, lived it as if i had time to make up for the years i destroyed. I have rebuilt myself after heartbreak, after chaos after disasters, and all that did was keep me searching searching for the moment where i realized that gods love is all i needed. I have tried it all, the selfishness, the coldness the isolative things. I noticed today that i am in a self preservation mode right now cause im not in control of somethings in my life. I always thought that with love it could make things appear faster, but love of self is required for things to actually stay around. So, many me included have struggled with this, because times in my life that were not so kind, but I am a new creation of god, how can i continue want to tear down all he has given me. I have come so far in my life and I am a great person, I may not be positive all the time‚Ä¶.but really who is? lol. I do the best i can with what i got. I am tired of pulling myself down to others levels when ever all they want to do is keep me miserble and lost. I was told by my lord that my life once i gave it to him would be of abundance and of peace. I believe that and at times i just spit in his face when i get stubborn and want it MY way. I am sittin here in reflection of the words he puts in front of me not only for my issues but the issues of others that come to me for guidance and to stop living a life of selfdestructive abandonment. I love my job and i am trully blessed to be sitting here after years of Trying to find ME. I found myself along time ago when i accepted god as my savior. He has never left me but i leave him all the darn time, i cant add to his greatness, but i sure do try to take away from it. I have some people in my life that trully care about me and some that are scared to, but all in all i love openly and will continue, plant seeds baby!‚Ä¶.forgivenss is something that must occur in order for progression to occur rebuild the temple that us as humans destroy. I told my clients how much did i love myself when i had to be drunk to be with me‚Ä¶.thats alot of self hatred right there‚Ä¶..well gotta get back to work‚Ä¶lata have a blessed day yall:)

Daddy please forgive me for the sinner that I have been and the love that you continue to give me regardless of how low i feel at times. I feel so powerless at times when i want something so badly it just eats me up that i cant change the outcome just by my will. I know in the end its giving up and letting go that will get me thru.¬† I know that whenever i attempt to lay it down before the cross my mind and the world starts attacking me. I dont have much going on today other then downloading this christian band seventh day slumber. He is a recovering addict and his words talk to me so deeply. I understand his struggles and pain. I have never had to do something so hard as let go‚Ä¶.it tears me up because in my mind letting go means saying goodbye forever cause anything i have always let go of it never came back. I know that sounds sad, but its the truth. I am just trying to keep it one second at a time in front of my face and keep saturated in the word of worship, i feel that when i take one glance away even for a second a door swings open and my mind is off and running. I am mad for never being taught at a young age the power of forgiveness and love the right kind. I wake up at times with a anger that is so powerful i cant shake it. I guess the only way to get rid of the anger is to accept it and LET IT GO. Damn one more thing, I know it sounds dumb for me to ask this but how do you just let it go‚Ä¶‚Ä¶and let it gone. let it gone‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.is this letting it go by writing about it? I went and got me some running shoes cause i forgot mine from home and i am needing the gym more then ever tonight i cant go another day without it. I am going to keep you in my heart lord, you sent your son to die for me ‚Ä¶..how dare i disrespect that.

I had to come back and repost cause i have found this song‚Ä¶.it holds a tie to me more then any of you will realize. There were times in my life that I wanted to slow the ball down and kept messing up at the same time, I felt that at times ""those that loved me"" wouldnt wait so i just gave up on me and kept drinking. I let the world be my total existance while hopeing what i wanted would wait for me, and at the same time sabataging it all. I know that deep in my heart i saw what i wanted just had no clue how to make it come true. I have had lots of angels leading me and at times had to walk away so that i would do the work. I am so thankful this song makes me cry‚Ä¶another thing that i never could do in my addiciton and pain. I have called many nights with whiskey on my breath thinkin they wont know‚Ä¶.this is the one they want and im him. I was in a illusion that kept me thinkin my reality was actually one in the same. Put that bottle down and walk away‚Ä¶..those lyrics are strong because all i ever wanted was that and guess what i Have done that!!! i am no longer that hurtful, in pain, nervous, anxious, individual that kept me going back to the bottle. what will be will be god has me in all that i do today even though i still have free will i choose to let him guide me.

song of the day for sure‚Ä¶.i like this group and have for awhile now‚Ä¶.but this song speaks to me so deep. 
¬†
we claim to have come so far but yet‚Ä¶we just repeat the same old mistakes, and the next generation sufferes‚Ä¶you always want to judge the growth you make by trying new things but in the end we are just programmed with what we know and how we act. I think that sometimes we repeat things out of fear and just out of iimpulse. Its like something needs a answer or deadline‚Ä¶the world is burning to the ground..no doubt. Life is weird at times when it is good only stays for a couple days at a time then it is like a new life beginning again in like four days from then. I guess its the stress of all that i hear all the issues that i am responsible for directing people to. I sometimes dont want that power. I used to crave it like a drug to be in control of all now i just want to go to a place where there is no more power no more control just peace‚Ä¶‚Ä¶like today dont want to be here want to be at home just chillin no real responsibility‚Ä¶no real direction just to live it as it comes‚Ä¶.a dream i know‚Ä¶a fantasy‚Ä¶.i guess after living life directed in one way for so long it is just on the extreme‚Ä¶.i just need a break a break a break‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.im so numb today really not because anything is going on but because i just dont want to hear all this stuff that is directed my way i feel like i am in a boat that the more i pump water out of the quicker it feels up. See i am just programmed almost started typing "" client appears‚Ä¶.."" ugh need some days away from here and¬† a million dolla to finance it‚Ä¶lol. oh well i gotta get back to work‚Ä¶just thought i would drop in and say hello the the blinkin lights‚Ä¶..

I am sitting here thinking about how life is today. I got a call early this morning by mark and he was already in his mood of how bad life is, blah blah blah,. I hung up on him cause you know i have issues of my own that i fight with and dont need to hear that negativity. I dont understand how some people can wake up so early and be so discontent. I can but i cant cause even in my worst days i still was able to find something in the world to change my mindset from the negativity. I had a eleven oclock appointment not show so im waiting on my pizza to get here. I have taken my blood pressure daily and i am happy to report it is almost normal. DOwn alot from what it was. I am going back to the gym tonight to get back into the swing of things. I am just seeing that life is short and to short for all of the unimportant things to get in the way.¬† It is so pretty outside right now i wish i didnt have to be here and could be out and about ‚Ä¶oh well soon nuff‚Ä¶:) my pizza just got here so im gonna go eat‚Ä¶maybe ill c ome update lata‚Ä¶.god bless*

I like this song alot, speaks so much truth‚Ä¶.especially those that are doubting the reasons of gods love like i have been in my past. I cant just assume that gods love goes away like the day ends, that is a problem in so many lives today. They stop the love from god as they go to sleep., then start over the next acting as if the new day needs a recommitment. I am just speaking for myself but he is there and loves me even as i sleep. I have hid out and ran from that love so many nights so many days‚Ä¶.walkin in the rain that this video portrays..I know that i am forgiven from all that i am and have done, all i know is that there are lots on this planet that need to understand, god isnt about proving ourselves to him for love, its about accepting the love he already gives. there is a huge difference there. huge difference‚Ä¶‚Ä¶in that‚Ä¶.allowing and accepting‚Ä¶when i hear this song makes me think of gods unbending love, because as we fail, as we relapse, as we ""are ungodlike"" he¬† is still there saying‚Ä¶let me love youuuuu‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..and then we act as if we arent good nuff to be loved‚Ä¶.sad aint it?‚Ä¶oh well enjoy the good that god has bestoyed upon us‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶why waste another day or second in pain of misery and doubt? let go let god‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.leave people where they are and if t hey arent where you are‚Ä¶..its okay‚Ä¶..to be healthier, love them from a distance‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.love me god with all you are‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶thank you!!!!

sitting here thinkin of all that i have seen and heard today. I went to the ""spa"" or chiropractors office‚Ä¶which i think is really doing me some good. I am feeling like the pain that was in my lower back is subsiding. I like this song alot cause so many times i wanted to give up and say ""its over"" well if i had then where would i be today? sometimes its not what we are going thru today but what we are allowing god to take from us that determines the direction we are to go. I remember britt telling me alot of times that martin u use alot of ""i"" and me in all that you state meaning that there was no room for god to grow or take over the issues I was dealing with cause i couldnt see ""the forest for the trees"" if you understand that analogy sometimes we are to caught up in us that god cant work cause we dont have our eyes on him AT all. I have been neglecting this lately and it has caused me some issues with my serenity. I love you jesus with all that i am. I sit across the way from the bible thinkin i will here in a minute‚Ä¶..or oh okay god i hear ya but need to finish this or that‚Ä¶.,
¬†yup what about now? what about love‚Ä¶the only thing that really matters and without it there is nothing because god is love‚Ä¶the creator of all. What bout now? where has it gone in the innocense of a childs smile, the love of a elder holding our fragile hands., thinking about the times when we had more to give then to take‚Ä¶.we ask ourselves‚Ä¶what about now? where is it? where did it go? what about the ones we want so badly to change that if we changed ourselves then they wouldnt be so much of a issue. I wonder what about now? why wait‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.the beauty of a flower the sunset across the sky‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..what bout now? love yourself or die?‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.

Dear lord‚Ä¶today is a day that is full of your glory full of your light just like the song says‚Ä¶indescribable, how amazing you are. When we take ourselves out of our own skins and start focusing on you, thats when things change. I have really just felt so relieved the last couple of days for the simple fact I have no one to answer to but you. I am living for you and trying to situate myself for your glory as best as humanly possible. You are amazing god‚Ä¶..all powerful,‚Ä¶‚Ä¶i love this song always have and just dont know how pretty and clear it is until you are out from that mess. I know people dont intend to be evil or harsh to others but without god its a given how people will treat each other. We choose to put up with what we do and justify reasons to stay. I amidst the urging of my god finally listened and now just leaning on faith to take me one moment at a time, cause i dont know where my road is going, and when i take the reigns i still mess it up.
¬†
¬†
i have alot of times played the victim the martyr for others shortcomings in what i expected to be. Nothing is guarenteed but our own salvation and happiness. We can hope that others we love will finally wake up from the haze and ""get it"" but often times we push and push and it takes them further from the truth, due to our own insecurities and pain. I know there will be days when this world will hurt me and i will have tribulation but you know what bring the rain lord and wash me clean from the mess that is the world. I know and hear things daily of peoples lives that are lost and hurting without a clue that god is the only salvation that can make it completely better. If they are like i was early on ""god"" or knowing him was just like working the steps‚Ä¶.okay i did it. where is the miracle? where is the light? why do i still hurt why do i still have pain? well it takes time to indulge the word and to fill the void that for years was consumed by alcohol, porn, you name it. I am not proud of this by no means but you know Today i still have slips but no where near the hole i lived in for years‚Ä¶‚Ä¶and that is due to my understanding of my god‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.he is holy he is sweet and he is kind, and if treats me like this so i can learn to as well and allow those to also. I am a work in progress‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.i love you lord‚Ä¶for my salvation for my existance and for the people in my life that trully love me‚Ä¶‚Ä¶all glory to you oh lord‚Ä¶..jesus bring the rain!!!

Codependency 
For well over four years we have advertised at this site for someone willing to help write an article on codependency. We got around a dozen responses, but that was it: just an initial response and then nothing.
Symptoms of Codependency include overextending oneself and difficulty in following a project through. So, it soon became apparent that while we were going to get responses, we weren‚Äôt really going to find anyone to help write this. We would have to do it alone.
So, here goes:
Codependency is a terrible term. It has endless connotations that have nothing to do with the disorder. Codependency itself is such a broad dysfunction that it is extremely hard to define in concise terms. However, one therapist and friend summed up the condition thus: ""I only wanted to be loved."" Another simple definition that works is, ""Codependency is a dysfunctional relationship with the self.""
Codependency is habitual behaviors that are ultimately self-destructive. Almost everyone (at times) has symptoms of codependency. No one escapes.
Codependent behaviors can be stopped. Therapists, books, support groups, and constant and careful self-monitoring will help. In the end, healing from codependency is ultimately up to the individual.
The following are a list of symptoms. Few have them all, some have a few, and many symptoms are contradictory, but that is the irony of Codependency. For more symptoms you can click here and visit another site on the web.

Symptoms

Care taking: the codependent individual feels responsible for other people. S/He feels anxious and even guilty when another has a problem. S/He feels compelled to help that person solve their problem. S/He anticipates the other‚Äôs needs and feels angry when his help is not effective or rebuffed. At the same time, the codependent feels slighted that others won‚Äôt help her/him out when s/he needs help. However, this same individual who is constantly doing way too much for others, and not getting ""any"" help from anyone, will usually answer when asked what is wrong or what do you need, responds, ""Oh, nothing."" The codependent minimizes his/her own worth. The codependent is his/her own worst enemy.
The codependent is over committed, harried, pressured, feels safe when giving, but insecure when someone gives to him/her, goes out of her/his way to help others, and believes deep inside that other people are responsible for the way they are and will blame others for the ""spot"" they are in. Others make them feel the way they feel, they are victimized, angry, unappreciated, and used. Others are driving them crazy.
Low Self Worth: codependents tend to come from troubled, dysfunctional families, and will deny this to the very end. They blame themselves for their family‚Äôs shortcomings. They blame themselves for everything. They pick on themselves constantly: not intelligent enough, not pretty enough, not smart enough, not athletic enough, not good enough. But if another criticizes them, boy do they get defensive and angry, not to mention self-righteous. Don‚Äôt try to give a codependent a compliment; they reject all compliments and praise, even though they get depressed from lack of compliments and praise. They feel ""different"" from the rest of the world. They reject themselves, but fear rejection. Everything is taken personally, they love being the victim (though will deny it with their last breath). They have been victims of sexual, physical, or emotional abuse, abandonment, neglect, and/or alcoholism. They feel like victims, carry lots of guilt and shame, and think their lives are not worth living. They should have done this, should have done that. They ""should"" themselves to death. Codependents say, ""Why me?"" on the outside, and know ""why me"" on the inside. While trying to prove to others that they are good enough, to themselves they are worthless and empty.
Repression: most codependents repress their own needs, their own desires. They are afraid to let themselves be who they are and often appear rigid and controlled. They repress all thoughts of self worth out of their awareness and they are full of guilt. Codependents cannot have fun.
Obsessive Compulsive Disorder: codependents worry. They worry about the slightest and silliest things: they worry that people are talking about them; they worry that people are not talking about them; they lose sleep over little things; they check up on others; they try to catch people in the act; they never find any answers, they focus on other‚Äôs problems; they spend money compulsively; eat or drink compulsively; and wonder why they have no energy and why they never get anything done.
Controlling Behaviors: codependents try to control events and people through helplessness, guilt, coercion, threats, advice-giving, manipulation, or domination. They are afraid to let people be who they are or let events happen naturally. They‚Äôve lived in so many situations in which they had no control (abuse, alcoholism, etc) that they now try to control everything and get frustrated and angry when they cannot. They end up feeling controlled by events. They feel controlled by others. They resist change as if change were a contagion.
Denial: codependents ignore problems or pretend the
y do not exist. They pretend things are not as bad as they are; they tell themselves it will get better; they stay busy to avoid thinking about things; they get confused, sick, depressed and visit doctors for a prescription. Many are workaholics. They lie to themselves and others. They believe their lies. And most of all, codependents will leave a healthy situation (by lying to themselves that it was an unhealthy situation) and get back into an unhealthy situation; though for the most part, most codependents either never leave an unhealthy situation/relationship, or they go from one unhealthy situation/relationship to another.
Dependency: codependents do not feel happy or content with themselves. They look to others to supply them their happiness or their needs. They are threatened by the loss of anything or any person that provides them with their happiness. They do NOT love themselves. They did not feel loved by their parents. They equate love with pain and believe others are never, ever there for them. They need people more than they want them; their lives revolve around someone else‚Äôs life; they tolerate abuse; feel trapped; leave one bad relationship and jump into another bad relationship. They wonder if they will ever find true love. And if they do find true love, they will leave that and find a loveless relationship because deep inside (often beneath consciousness) they feel unworthy of love.
Poor Communication Skills: codependents blame, threaten, coerce, beg, bribe, and advise others. They don‚Äôt mean what they say and don‚Äôt say what they mean. They don‚Äôt take themselves seriously and expect others to do the same. They avoid getting to the point, asking indirectly for attention by sighing, crying, or moping around. They say everything is their fault. They say nothing is their fault. They can‚Äôt get to the point, and if pressed, they‚Äôre not sure what the point really is. They believe their opinions do not matter and have difficulties asserting their rights or expressing honest emotions, openly and appropriately. They apologize for bothering people.
Poor Boundaries: codependents say they won‚Äôt tolerate something from anyone, and then engage themselves in exactly that. Then they gradually increase their tolerance levels till they can tolerate most anything others do to them. They allow others to hurt them, over and over and over again. They stay in bad relationships for all the wrong reasons: to fix the other; for the kids (like kids need to grow up in a loveless relationship); because things will get better; and worst of all: because they feel they deserve to live in hell. They complain and blame but far too many never get away from their abuser. Then they finally get angry and become totally intolerant and the cycle begins all over again. (For a list of unhealthy boundaries from Recovery.org, click here.)
Lack of Trust: codependents do not trust themselves, their feelings, their decisions, other people, or even God. And then, right out of the blue, they‚Äôll trust someone who is totally untrustworthy.
Sexual Problems: codependents go through cycles in the bedroom. They are caretakers there too. They have sex when they don‚Äôt want to or withdraw sex to punish their partner. They try to have sex when they are hurt or angry, and refuse to enjoy it. They withdraw emotionally from their partner, feel revulsion toward their partner, and don‚Äôt want to talk about it. They reduce sex to a technical act, wonder why they don‚Äôt enjoy it; lose interest; make up reasons to abstain, wish their partner would die, go away, or guess what is wrong with them; they have strong sexual fantasies about others and consider having affairs.
General: codependents can be extremely responsible or irresponsible, they become martyrs, sacrificing their own happiness. They find it difficult to be happy, feel close to others, or have fun and be spontaneous. They are passive aggressive, feeling passive, hurt, helpless yet violent and angry. They laugh when they want to cry. They are ashamed of their families, of their relationships. They cover up, lie, and protect their family from their problems. They don‚Äôt seek help because they don‚Äôt feel the problem is all that bad. And then they wonder why the problems never go away.

From Bad to Worse

Progressively, if the codependent does not get help, the symptoms above just get worse. The codependent becomes lethargic and depressed and eventually withdraw and isolate themselves. Their daily routine falls by the wayside. They abuse or neglect the people who depend on them, mostly, their children. They feel utterly hopeless and initiate plans to escape. They contemplate suicide. They become violent, or seriously mentally or physically ill. They develop an eating (drinking or drug) disorder.

Summary

Not all codependents have all of the above symptoms. If you have just 20% of the above symptoms, you can consider yourself a codependent. If you have 5 to 10% of the above symptoms, you are normal. Normal people are, at times, codependent. Even normal people can use a bit of therapy, a bit of healing.
We are all, in many ways, self-destructive. None of us came from the Cleaver Family, Father does not know best, and our mothers were never as perfect as Donna Reed.
The worst thing about being codependent is that the codependent wastes her/his life. The next worst thing about being codependent is we pass it on to our children, and in them, our symptoms are hugely magnified.

Origins
The one question is how did we get this way?
<font style=
‚ÄúBACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff‚Äù face=‚ÄùComic Sans MS‚Äù color=‚Äù#800080‚Ä≥ size=‚Äù3‚Ä≥>Prolonged exposure to oppression is the key here. As Earnie Larson states in his books and lectures (I‚Äôm paraphrasing here): ""What we live with we learn; what we learn we practice; what we practice becomes habit; our habits have consequences.""
All of these behaviors are ""learned."" They can be unlearned.
Everything boils down to this: we have little self worth; our happiness is found outside of ourselves.
However, Earnie Larson has one more wonderful phrase that really sums up the codependent‚Äôs situation or dilemma: ""If nothing changes, nothing changes.""
We, the codependent, must DO something to initiate healing. It won‚Äôt come from outside. It just doesn‚Äôt happen. If nothing changes, nothing changes.

Healing Codependency

Most people do not heal their codependency on their own. Let us face it, with all these symptoms flaring up, especially the denial, who could possibly see a way out?
Most codependents are slapped upside the head by a friend: ""Hey, you need help!""
We do need help. We need the experience of others who have broken the cycles. We need a good therapist to help us see the light. We need friends who are open and honest with us. We need to sit and read a bit about ourselves, our problems, and the way out. Most of all, we need to know that we can be healed. This is NOT a permanent situation. But each person has to recognize the problem, admit to it, and then find the tools to help end it.
The first and most important thing for a codependent to learn is that Happiness is inside of us, not something outside. A good relationship is good, not because of the person we love, but because of the person we are. One person does not a relationship make.
Healing codependency is often referred to as ""shifting our relationship with ourselves."" Codependents must learn to accept their powerlessness over people and events. Recovery for a codependent is like recovery from alcohol or drug addiction and the same 12-step model is oftentimes employed: Let Go. Let God.
The codependent must sometimes ""fire"" the people in their lives. If they are not willing to work through their issues, then we have to ""fire"" them and move on ourselves. But we must keep in mind that this is about us, not them. Recovery means learning to take responsibility for our own actions, issues, feelings, behaviors, and our lives.
Recovery is not easy. Letting go of the need to control people, places, events is not easy. It is highly recommended to find a Codependent Anonymous (CoDA) group and attend regularly. Meetings, therapy, talking to fellow codependents, and reading and just plain being aware of our feelings and thoughts will ultimately set us free from our self-defeating patterns; from our fear and shame. Letting go of caretaking and all the energy expended in that fulltime effort frees up our energies to more constructive things. Below are links to more information, a place to locate a CoDA meeting, and further reading.
But finally know this: Your author has been through his own bouts with codependency. Hardly any of us are untouched by this. Healing is not only possible, it is wonderfully exhilarating. Once we step out of our destructive patterns, anything is possible. In a letter to a friend once, I wrote the following that I want to share with you.

Old problems are much more comfortable than new solutions. But always keep in mind, that life begins on the edge of your comfort zone.
Trust and listen to your intuition. If you listen to your mind, you will hear only the same old crap it‚Äôs been spewing for years. Unless you heal your past, your life, and recover from the abuse (self-inflicted and other-inflicted) your mind will not be your friend. Listen to your heart. Go with the flow.

Hey diary‚Ä¶what up. I am feeling really undecided right now. I am really happy for getting my new apt and having a place to stay. I am happy about alot. I just am confused at what i read and see. I dont know if i have offended people not intentionally. If i have then im sorry. i have been sitting here praying and thinking on alot that has happend this week and its only tuesday. I know alot in my world are hurting alot are lost and alot are just plain fed up with the way things are. I dont blame you at all for feeling this way. I have been there more then i can count but the one thing i have learned is that it doesnt stay around as long as our heads tells us its goin to. I know that things happen and words and sentences get taken out of context or misread or misunderstood. I am really thankful for alot today not just because of what is going to be but where i am at this moment. I know deep in my heart that all is going the way its ment to be because it is just falling into place as it should no doubts. It doesnt come without question or without asking for direction but for the most part i must be quiet and be guided without question or worry. This guys voice is really calming and has a longing that i too have felt in my life. I dont know just much more important things to get in order first, my life has been one setback after another alot of times at my own doing. I have learned though it is not necessary to live in the problem or be upset or chaotic about things in order to feel normal. I have been taking time to talk to god this last week much MORE then i have in months. Dont read that wrong not that i havent in months just not daily as i have been. I know that with the seed being fed i can continue without setback. I am my own worst enemy alot of times because i fear success at all costs even though failure is the catalyst alot of time that drives the perfectionism. I know blah blah blah., but honestly this is a problem for me because not so much the drink anymore but just blowing thru life just existing and trying not to feel has been a tool that i have used for years. Today i am taking a look at all in front of me moment by moment.. I have clients that are hurting and in pain, and god it takes a toll to watch them in this state and know it doesnt have to be like this, that there is a better way. A easier softer way. But in time we get there when we are thru with the lies, the illusions, the enabling, the taking blame of all, and the list goes on., when your ready to change then change occurs. I hear sometimes slowly sometimes quickly but most of the time it does happen with hope. Just writing this down has allowed my head to have some room for positive to go back in it. I havent been negative in this entry just needed to get this stuff out, cause i know i am one person and most of people in my life their lives DONT revolve around me, but the addict that i am‚Ä¶..get my mind agoing. oh well, almost time for the next client just thought i would write while i had a second‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..you guys have a great day! god bless.

good morning diary. 
¬†
I have just a couple of seconds and thought i would come in and speak to you. I am about to move into my new apartment and for the first time in my life im not scared of this. I am okay with the way things are going because I keep my eyes right now on where i know i need to go. I dont have the fear or anxiety that i once had. I have had alot of time to think the last week and you know what i feel okay with my decisions not all of them but you know i dont have near the shame/guilt i was living with at my other residence. I know that i have hindered and hurt people in my life but i dont think that defines who i am. Like joyce is saying above ""got to grow up"" that is so true, because for years i lived for the earth, for everything that satisfied the flesh. I know alot dont trust me and find fault in alot i say or do, but i am aware of the things i say arent always right. I strive to make a difference. Like this sermon up above‚Ä¶""under the attack""‚Ä¶.that is so true‚Ä¶.we create chaos and turmoil even if we dont need it. I know that words hurt, words harm, and words are not taken back once they are spoke. I have read alot lately and i try to pass on the positive. The world doesnt resolve around me at all. man this is powerful! i have made promises and made deals‚Ä¶.i am sick of that. I will show myself and that everyone can see. If i live alone and that is where god wants me to be then that is where i will be. I will do as i am told, tired of trying to prove to people of my growth or my glory i call jesus i know in my heart he loves me and is working in me. 
¬†
i have allowed get it‚Ä¶.allowed words and others actions to become who i have been. Allowed it and kept taking it cause i felt like i deserved it. I I will be a victim NO MORE. I have been told that i have done the same thing over and over again everytime i change. Re-invention‚Ä¶..well that is true, and i will continue to strive for what and where god wants me to be. I am sick of sick people around me sick of those that dont like themselves to penetrate my serenity , laughter is a great thing , but most hide behind the laughter in order to protect themselves from the pain. Joyce is speakin on alot that i understand and can relate to. I have done this. I protect others from me because sometimes i feel so toxic or unloved that i dont want to harm those that love me. I will make a difference today and love myself if only one second at a time. I am a winner i am a survivor. I will be happy today no matter what or who tries to make me down. It is a sad state when you hate yourself that much that you want to tear others down‚Ä¶been there done that. It is 2008 and alot of years have gone by ‚Ä¶..its over and time to do something else. it may be good it may be bad it may not make sense to anyone but me‚Ä¶..but god loves me regardless. I have never given up and always tried to please others, i let myself get torn down. I deserve more i will demand more. NO More a victim‚Ä¶.just a survivor with gods love to heal and guide me. Speak what you want ignore me if you want i am not a bad person. I am human i make mistakes,¬† i still love and i still feel. I am not contagious and i am not perfect, but i keep trying to show others that i am worthy of their love. i may fail and sabatage ‚Ä¶.but i keep trying to make a life for me that i am proud of‚Ä¶‚Ä¶well gotta get to work‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.god loves me that is all that matters.!‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..the truth will set me free‚Ä¶..and all i am is who he wants me to be‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.god bless you guys‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..much love.

""Save You"" Take a breath I pull myself together Just another step till I reach the door You‚Äôll never know the way it tears me up inside to see you I wish that I could tell you something To take it all away Sometimes I wish I could save you And there‚Äôre so many things that I want you to know I won‚Äôt give up till it‚Äôs over If it takes you forever I want you to know When I hear your voice Its drowning in a whisper It‚Äôs Just skins and bones There‚Äôs nothing left to take No matter what I do I can‚Äôt make you feel better If only I could find the answer To help me understand Sometimes I wish I could save you And there‚Äôre so many things that I want you to know I wont give up till it‚Äôs over If it takes you forever I want you to know That if you fall, stumble down I‚Äôll pick you up off the ground If you lose faith in you I‚Äôll give you strength to pull through Tell me you won‚Äôt give up cause I‚Äôll be waiting if you fall Oh you know I‚Äôll be there for you (Ahahaha) If only I could find the answer To take it all away Sometimes i wish i could save you And there‚Äôre so many things that I want you to know I wont give up till it‚Äôs over If it takes you forever I want you to know (Oh) I wish I could save you I want you to know (Ohohh) I wish I could save you (oh)

I was just listening to this song and it exemplifies alot of moments in my life wanting to save when i couldnt even keep myself afloat. I love this band and this new album has songs on it that show how mature they have became with their lyrics and music. It is hard when we want to save someone that is hurting, lost, and just plain stubborn. I know many have tried and it wasnt until they were able to let go that the miracle happend. It is about saving us for the moment by planting the seed and not the harvestor. I am thankful people never gave up on me.I still struggle with things dont get me wrong but for the most part i have been able to not live in the past and surely not try to get to fast either. It is hard to see people hurt. , and especially if you know you were the nature of the pain. Sorry cant take away the pain that is in there deep. I know that I am not that person anymore but when trust is broken it is hard to repair and sometimes it never is no matter how hard you try. I am no where proud of where i have been, all i know is where i am going. I am happy to see that i have a new start ahead of me. I love life today where before i dreaded waking up to another day. It isnt all roses either but the difference is not dwelling in the pain of the moment because someone dear to me told me that is the devil‚Ä¶..wanting to keep you there. worry, guilt, shame, resentment, all that is from the enemy and wants to keep us inchained in misery. I am not saying dont deal with things as they arise but you know why let it rent space in your head? why let it ruin your day? dont give people the power to hurt you just like yesterdays entry on words and pain. Why allow yourself to be a victim of the past or of the pain that truelly still never goes away, but with god he heals in time. I am responsible for one person that is martin. I love others in my life and care deeply but i have learned that you meet people where they are‚Ä¶if they are healthy at the moment dont treat them as sick. If they are hurting dont ignore the pain and cover it up with false hope, its okay to feel.., just dont stay in the problem. its a work in progress:) the simplest thing we can do is love one another in times of confusion and pain, because you know in kindness the devil loses all grip. we keep the devil close to our hearts and mind when we give him ""all that we fear the most"" , work in progress, i am writing for myself mostly no where near for anyone else if it helps ya im very happy, but i am only accountable for martin. He loves himself today, and is just taking it right in front of my face‚Ä¶.:) have a blessed day!!!‚Ä¶

Hey diary,
just thought i would come and vent a minute cause at this moment im a little upset and pissed off. I am just angry at the way things you say can be used in a way that it appears your telling people how to live their lives. I in no way do that and i just suggest. One thing i know is that you leave people where they are at. If the pain gets intense enough then a change will happen or they will make a change. I am thru with family issues cause for years that is what kept me sick and harming myself due to the stress that the damn chaos causes in my heart. I feel deeply and cant stand to listen to peoples denial in the fact that it is just a lil problem. One of the reasons i am 36 and single is because i have seen first hand how dysfunctional people raising children only perpetrate the sickness is there perfection? no but you know when you identify issues in your life and make excuses for them all in the name of love its not love its denial. I lived a life of hurt,pain and sorrow for years, and it hurts to see people that i love trapped in the storm that no matter how hard you try to be there for them they just want you to drown with them. I wont do it. If i am not known by my nephew or neice due to issues that rage within that foundation then at least one day i can honestly tell them why i didnt come around. I am not judging or anything like that it just is sad the things i hear the things i see, and then to act as if it is okay and not to be spoken of is insane. I wont put myself in that situation and for their sake all i can do is pray. I was the superman for years i thought and all that did was leave me with scars and bruises that now i can see just beneath the surface and i cant go back there. I love these people to much to be in there with the sickness and care about me to much to let myself go back there. I am not perfect no where near but i do take suggestion when my old ways werent working and kept me getting the same damn results, its not people its not situations, its not finances, its not addiction, its excuses so that can fall back on these things to keep doing what you are getting away with. WAKE up. You tell me that your kids know love but how can they when dad is not around their mom in a loveing way? how can they when they feel your tears and pain and it is written all over your face? how can they not know when dad goes to hold them and feel the emptiness in his arms because he feels empty and inadequate inside? tell me its not affecting them? hmmm lived in a environment like that‚Ä¶dad always cheating on mom, yelling at us and acting like money would make all the hard nights okay, its a lie a illusion, i saw the tears in my moms eyes and i grew up too, had nothing but hatred and resentment towards that lady for leaving us in that environment. Yah kids know and feel it, just cause they put on a smile, doesnt mean that they arent learning and thinking hmmm if only i could do this or that better then maybe they would love each other. Yup, wake up cause hurt people hurt people. When its your time hurt ends but until then, anger and control and excuses keep you in caged in a life of pain‚Ä¶.for both of you. I love you guys to much to stay silent and this is the only way i get it out and dont have to hear the excuses. i have been ""t"" the oldest son., where mom thought her love for dad would be enough to keep him happy, and not in a bad mood all the time, and it was alway s when i get thru college or get this job or that and more money he made the more he dove into the addiction he claimed he didnt have or couldnt get out of. One thing i noticed missing even as a child was god in our family, and since i didnt have a father figure to admire i thought my mom was it, and then she turned on me by keeping me getting beat and crap, and still she stayed‚Ä¶..sound familiar? well gotta get back to work‚Ä¶..i love you guys and one day i hope all is well ‚Ä¶.for all involved‚Ä¶.love is not about another person its about the love god brings in the family‚Ä¶.and right now where is god? he is waiting ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

hey diary, what up? just feeling a little like this today‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..I am not sad just sitting wondering what life is all about today. I know that things are going the way they are ment to be but as my addict mind says‚Ä¶""what is really up with it martin? ""¬† I like this song for some reason‚Ä¶You know it is hard being alone, even though i know im not, but like the sermon said sunday, must get used to loveing myself in singleness before i could ever love someone. I wonder when and who that someone may be. I get sick and tired of the doubts the questions the rehashing old shit, and then here i am again. Talkin about the same stuff just in a different day.

yup something like that‚Ä¶.oh well life goes on and so does the tickin of the clock until my heart finally heals and the emptiness is totally gone‚Ä¶, one thing i dont forget is that I CAUSED ALL THIS>..and that hurts me the most‚Ä¶.but i must go on what can i do? but go on‚Ä¶..

Good morning diary,
First of all this video has strong language and violence but it was on my mind for a reason because I finally had a epiphany as to what is up with my life. I have been having dreams constantly lately about the biggest events in my life of ""what could have been"" well, I finally woke up with a voice telling me the reason was due to ME PREPARING FOR A FIGHT THAT NEVER HAPPEND. I was having a dream this morning that I was in some kind of shop and I had friends around and some of my cousins and there was turmoil of course just like always. I could visually see my dad talking to us. He sent me in to get something for him out of the truck because this was my job the fetch boy. Go get this get that, and ill tell you half the damn story but expect you to understand it all. I was so eager to please that i half listened to all of it. I was also scared of messing up. I ran and got this thing in the truck and i couldnt find it, i was tearing it up and down and nothing. Well finally he comes and gets something else but didnt hit me like he would have, and then we both go to the back of the truck and he is being sarcastic like he always was, and i said something back. I dont remember the exact words, but i know i said something to my defense. I then went from that moment to hearing a scream and crying for mercy and i was looking in a refrigerator and could hear the struggle and the agony of pain of this womans screams it was so powerful that it brought a fear in my skin that i have had a lifetime. I was a little boy at this point in the dream, I was grabbing franticly for this person who i had no clue who it was, and then when i couldnt reach her i walked around the refrigerator and followed the screams and crying and muffled gasps for air, and there around the corner was my dad on top of my mom with a bag around her head twisting it tighter and tighter and i was there panic stricken and scared to death like always and then boom i woke up. 
I had this dream and all the other football dreams for a reason this voice told me it was to show me that i have prepared for a fight of life or death all my life and in tune hold a anger and rage inside me that always swells up and isnt felt because I am scared of the unleashing of it on the ones that dont deserve it. I hurt myself worst then anyone could ever hurt me ‚Ä¶.i have fought this demon all my life and has caused me lots of pain and lots of shame and guilt. I know I was a boy and was small but then i prayed one day for god to make me bigger and that way i could protect myself and my mom and others against the pain and beatings. I got bigger and stronger and in my mind nothing could ever hurt me again. I waited and waited and swelled the anger up and all that pain to unleash on him and finally show him that he wasnt the powerful one. I never got the chance. So there is a lifetime of pain and anger and all that i have seen and its stale. I dont see how any aa/alanon meeting can rid the pain because all i get to do is talk about it and people look at me like what the hell is he doing here? a hour at a time and it never gets fully to a point where i can let it go, i put it out there but it always gets replaced by more and more pain, and anger. I look at my face in the mirror and see a person that is just turned off and i do have my moments dont get me wrong and i am happy, but you know its not like i can control this. I hear peoples stories all day long and it causes me extreme pain inside to hear how they too were a victim. i dont like that word because i never felt a victim but a target of his anger and rage and her silent denial. I have had¬† people in my life that love me but trully have no clue what it is to walk in this bondage unless trully you were there. I can describe it and i can talk to you about it but its like it just stays. I want to fight i want to crush things i want to beat something to a pulp and then the fuckin counseling bullshit comes out ‚Ä¶would that really help anything? of course it would, i rationlize in my mind. My body has even turned on itself due to the strain of building up for the fight that never happend. ITs like training and trainging and being in condition then ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶all that goes for nothing when you find out your opponent will never accept the battle you trained to rule and win.Thats why abuse people always feel a incomplete because they never get to inflict the pain on the perpetrator. ITs a unfulfilled moment in time that no amount can erase or take away. I take prozac to not feel the sadness and its like a covered up evil stench of death. 
I was also thinkin about my relationship with god. I believe in god with all i am but i cant commit to him because i dont trust him. I was a boy asking where were you god? where were you as my mom was getting beaten? where were you as i was trying to be strong to withstand the pain so that she or my brother wouldnt have to feel it not one ounce of it. I know you were there but i didnt believe in you so you couldnt do nothing. I am just writing this because i feel this was my belief then, not necessarily now.¬† where¬† were you ‚Ä¶..when my grandma died? where were you when my uncle was murdered and lost his battle with his own demons?¬† I have these questions and i know the bible has all the answers but i want them from you. I dont want to interput something that was written a lifetime ago and understand it. You spoke to me in my dream this morning and i totally appreciate that because it finally makes alot of sense. For years i have asked and asked, why does this battle never cease? I guess cause i dont know how to turn off the killer that i have become. The alter personality that has been trained for combat that was always around, and now its all i know even though i can turn it off but its under the surface, the anger the pain, the loss the confusion, just festering waiting for the moment i go home and still i stuff it down and hold it down with all i am to appear as though i have it all together while i dont i crumble and for the most part im lost. I know my life is short i just want to have one second of this burden off of me and a life that i feel a part of. I hate myself most days not because martin does but because without the self hatred there would be no where to use the defense to pain, it would just sit there ticking like a bomb til i shut down due to the pressure or it all. I hope that this goes away and that i trully am the end of it so that my lil nephew and neice can only experience happiness without the bs that was passed down. 
¬†
i pray the dreams somehow subside ‚Ä¶..the pain eventually becomes tolarble and that i dont hurt a soul in the process. i am lost lord, and have been for so long, and to be told im a addict just adds to my negative self image of who i have become i wonder when will people just see me as martin, not as a person that has this or that wrong. waiting for me to fuck up or waitin to protect themselves from me. I know who i am and dont blame them but like i have said time and time again‚Ä¶..this isnt about you or the world,,‚Ä¶its my own battle that rages within and there have been lots of casualties throughout time, ‚Ä¶..i feel that the
re is no one that understands i feel even more angry when i talk about me all the damn time but it never stops the relentless self attacks and tearing down to build again‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.how did i make it this far‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶god help me.

This group speaks to my heart deep i love it, woke up this morning and worked out. I feel motivated as the sky turns to brightness in my eyes. I know that without god nothing is possible. I must continue on this journey to know all is going to be okay. I slept good last night and didnt worry about things that arent real and just really tried to let go of all the pieces that have hindered me in life and kept me down. I know that i am no where near perfect but i am on a path with my eyes looking forward instead of constantly trying to get there with my back towards my god my savior. I come to you lord, your son ‚Ä¶.a man on a destiny life that is only known by you. I know alot try to help me and alot have helped me but in time its your heart that must be full of my love and devotion i am yet a child in you and for once i know i am doing this correctly i feel you again unlike the times when i get you for a second of time then boom i give up and let you go. I know thru trials there will be fire, but without you, i get burnt time and time again of this world. I must resist all that i find as comfort, thank you jesus‚Ä¶.for you i breath in ‚Ä¶i breathe out‚Ä¶, for you i am for your glory oh lord almighty let it rain down peace upon my pieces of my heart‚Ä¶:) glue me back together so that i dont break so easily without ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶oh lord‚Ä¶i am yours!>

Perhaps i was addicted to the dark side Somewhere inside my childhood i missed my heart die And even though we both came from the same places The money and the fame made us all change places How could it be through the misery that came to pass The hard times make a true friend afraid to ask, for currency But you could run to me when you need me, I‚Äôll never leave I just needed someone to believe in, as you can see It‚Äôs a small thang through and true What could I do?

dear lord, all mighty please forgive me for as you have suffered these beatings so that humanity can continue to exist.

I know that we all sin and not one is worst then the other but i used to just be so ready to give up‚Ä¶..like doing that would make it any better.

I have a peace i have never known before. I gave myself to the lord yesterday. I got baptized!!! This song tells it all, i am so happy and feel so whole, for years i have seeked out and looked in all places for completness. I have always had a tug on my heart but i ignored it or tried to find it in earthly places. I am spoken for no doubt. I keep hearing this statement "" i make all things new"" ‚Ä¶.watched the passion last night too. I see thru different eyes no longer blurred or distracted. No pain today, i worked out, and just been worshippin all morning, my last two clients havent shown up, and no mistakes in that!. ‚Ä¶.just wanted to share‚Ä¶.god bless you guys!!

I just walked down the street to the coffee shop
had to take a break 
I‚Äôd been by her side for eighteen hours straight
I saw a flower growing in the middle of the sidewalk
pushing up through the concrete
like it was planted right there for me to see
the flashin‚Äô lights, the honkin‚Äô horns
all seemed to fade away
in the shadow of that hospital at 5:08
I saw God today
Chorus:
I‚Äôve been to church
I‚Äôve read the book
I know He‚Äôs here, but I don‚Äôt look
near as often as I should
Yeah, I know I should
His fingerprints are everywhere
I‚Äôd just slow down to stop and stare
opened my eyes and man I swear
I saw God today
I saw a couple walking by they were holding hands
Man, she had that glow
yeah I couldn‚Äôt help but notice she was starting to show
it stood there for a minute takin‚Äô the sky
lost in that sunset
a splash of amber melted in the shades of red
Chorus
I got my face pressed up against the nursery glass
She‚Äôs sleeping like a rock
My name on her wrist wearing tiny pink socks
She‚Äôs got my nose, she‚Äôs got her mama‚Äôs eyes
My brand new baby girl
She‚Äôs a miracle

good morning !
I woke up this morning happy! blessed and amazed at how god is continuing to work in my world. I shared last night with the group about my baptism and they were like all ears. I didnt do it for awww‚Äôs or any kind of feedback, i did it to hopefully plant seeds. This is the perfect song for the day. I am not trying to re-invent something that has already been done. This is me, no more no less. I am a precious child of god!!. I told someone yesterday ""you know for the first time in my life i can honestly say"" I love martin"" I dont feel like a failure anymore , i dont feel like i have to meet a certain point to be good enough i feel whole!! I feel like i am protected and i am full of a loving father that knows no boundaries. This is what was missing for so many years, so many years i spent lost seeking, and empty, having the lord as a fragrance but once it went away by the stink of the world, i was dirty again and was so heavy i would be not able to clean up fast enough. I dont feel like that anymore! its from within and i am clean!!! hehehehe‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.holy father thank you so much:) god bless the lost, the unconvinced, and the ones that still have doubts, how can you doubt how miserble you feel, if we were born in sin, then‚Ä¶.how do you get clean? cant do it by yourself, and surely the world will only add to it. I am just sharing the lovely feeling i have inside its like a constant laughter and giggle, and like a warm feeling that comes from within when i get fearful or scared. well kids gotta get back to work‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶have a great blessed day!!!

Good morning yall!
Just had a moment and thought i would get on here and write a little bit. I went to a service yesterday on serving. I was a little confused at first but as it went on i totally understood. I have had many times and moments to serve for the glory of my loving gracious god. I was to shy to stand up for his name, or even to plant the seeds, but I tell ya what, I have a fire within me that is burning bright and shines up the path in which i walk. The lamp is not needed to be hidden in the corner where there is already light, I was thinking bout my walk with god, and his son jesus christ. I have had alot stop talking to me cold turkey i mean like i am a outcast but you know what? I am okay with that because I know who i serve and he gives me all the love i need. He guides me to seeek out the lost the hurting and to plant the seed of salvation amist the demons of the times. I understand that i am not of the world anymore and im okay with that. I walk around with a smile on my face because i am free, free of bondage of self doubt, worry , and of the constant rememberance of my sins. I am alot more aware of them and feel such a pull on my heart that it reminds me who is boss. It is not me‚Ä¶for this i am happy and free!! oh praise you god!!!!! Praise all be the mighty alpha and omega of eternity that beats within me. I work with addicts and have a understanding more of the ""disease"" it is the disease of being spiritially dead, looking for anything to fill that void that only the lord can make whole. I cant judge or even critisize anyone on their journey but i know i am found!!! I may not be called to mission or to leave the country but my calling is to speak and worship in the glory of his name as all of ours is!! How great is our god to bless even the darkest souls to continual pullin us towards the light‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..good morning loving family, may this day be full of pleasure and grace‚Ä¶‚Ä¶all in the name of jesus who died on the cross and his blood spilled for my salvation‚Ä¶.amen!!

Going through my closet the other day
I found an old yearbook flipped right to the page of that senior trip
Down there on that panama strip
We all started yelling when we smelled the beach
Couldn‚Äôt wait to try our fake ids
We only had a few days
And a whole lot of memories to make
Oh man, we were livin‚Äô
Didn‚Äôt waste one minute
We talked, we drank and danced and said goodbye
We laughed until we cried
This past year my family
Was sittin‚Äô cross-legged around the Christmas tree
Listening to granddad
We all knew it would probably be his last
He was cracking jokes and we were taking turns
Telling stories about fishin or lessons learned
Out on the porch with him
We all felt like kids again
Oh man, we were livin
Sitting there reminiscing
We sang and talked and traveled back in time
We laughed until we cried
It‚Äôs like the best days under the sun
Every emotion rolled into one
A little of this, a little of that
Kinda happy, kinda sad
Just the other night the baby was cryin
So I got out of bed and rocked her awhile and I held her tight
And told her it‚Äôll be alright
My mind went back to a few years ago
We tried so long we almost gave up hope
And I remember you coming in and tell me the news
Oh man, we were livin
Going crazy in the kitchen
We danced and screamed and held each other tight
We laughed until we cried

this song makes me thankful of the laughter that i can now express‚Ä¶..now its the small things that make the ride worth it. laugh til you cry‚Ä¶.:) awesome awesome.

I woke up this morning
Texas on my mind
Thinking about my friends there
And a girl I‚Äôd left behind
The way she held me when we kissed
The loving that we‚Äôd done
And how I left her waving goodbye standing in the Texas sun
Chorus:
I‚Äôve got a half a mind to call her
Half a mind to go
Jump a big jet liner
And wing it on my way back home
And all the morning it was raining on the streets of Liverpool
So I stayed in and played guitar and sang the lovesick blues
My mind kept going back in time when we both had fun
And how I left her waving to me standing in the Texas sun
I‚Äôve got a half a mind to call her
Half a mind to go
Jump a big jet liner
And wing it on my way back home
In my dreams she‚Äôs still in love with me
But I‚Äôd have to travel home to see
If she‚Äôs found another man to take the place of me
Guess I‚Äôll have to keep on dreaming sunny memories
Wishing I was back there doesn‚Äôt help me much at all
When I want to hold her it doesn‚Äôt help me much to call
Stuck here in this seaport town longing for the one
That I left behind me there standing in the Texas sun
I‚Äôve got a half a mind to call her
Half a mind to go
Jump a big jet liner
And wing it on my way back home
I‚Äôve got a half a mind to call her
Half a mind to go
Jump a big jet liner
And wing it on my way back home

Sittin here at one in the morning I guess that is when i get the most inspired. I was in a sound sleep when I woke and this song was the last thing playing in my dream. I really cant remember all of it though. One thing for sure I do know is that this was my senior song, and at the time i was not a big fan of country music. I thought what a dumb song, about a dance. (laughs)‚Ä¶.I see today that this song was the perfect fit for the forecastors of our senior class. I will start with what is on my mind obviously its life, and all the things that are gone that I never let go of or grieved. I am thinking about my grandma at 86 I lost in 1994, and my uncle whom I lost in 1989. I think the latter shaped me into the career choice I have chosen in so many ways. I remember my grandma the loving smile and the caring of her tender heart. I never took the time to really love her back, i didnt know how and then she was leaving and i was lost, i remember wanting to cry so badly at her funeral but i just didnt. I froze there and just had to be the strong one. It has been the calling card of my life the ""strong one"" My dance at that point in my life was very chaotic to say the least. I look back and think of all the things I was doing, I was drinking, messing around on someone that loved me to death, and was trying to be someone that i was not. I was so lost that I chalked it up to immaturity and being young as the world says its okay to do. I know now that that dance was the dance of decadence and dystruction. I am writing right now and its flowing like a waterfall with lots of fluid motion of thought. I think back on my grandma alot these days because she trully showed me the love i see in my lil nephews eyes. He lights up when he sees me he holds me without intention and is just happy to see me. I cherish that love and i guess its a love that i have searched for on this earth for a long time. I have been being hit by the devil lately and it is not fun, it is a attack of the mind where he gets into me and my heart. I keep thinking man im 36 my dance is halfway over and instead of looking at all the great things i have accomplished and the great people i have in my life, i tend to get stuck in the negativity of the world that goes around me all day long. The dance got faster and the lifestyle progressed to nonexistance and more chaos and pain. It was a distruction in the wake of a anger that just engulfed the world up. I see that today and wonder how could i have gone thru life in the same way of the person that did that to me? so much shame/guilt in the areas that were keeping me drunk and in pain. I could have missed the pain‚Ä¶.the dance‚Ä¶‚Ä¶kept going and going‚Ä¶.heard you in the background as my life crumbled and i got back up again, keep going martin i made you in my image, at that time in my life i had no clue and i spit on everything that was good. I have been a fake in so many areas and in so many areas just dealing with life as it has came my way. The dance kept going‚Ä¶i became the dancing monkey on the shoulder of the guy looking for money as i would drink from his cup of misery. I kept going and the flame intensified til i could just sit in my flames of insanity and pray to god that he took me out of the world that i didnt understand or at times feel that i fit into. I had people that loved me but i didnt know the correct way to love them back, i had people in my life that cared and still i kept them at a distance because of all the ones i had let in had hurt me in some way or the other. I kept going and going as my heart seemed to beat and burn even hottter‚Ä¶.then I found you lord. I found you in the mist of the shadow of darkness that was my dance. I lost love ones that never knew how much i loved them, because of the inability to show it. I tried to show the ones that would only push me away or use my goodness for evil. I played the victim and just wanted one moment in time to make it all fit and finally dance the dance of peace. I cant take back what ive done and only one can make it all correct and t his i pray will happen before i leave this earth and my dance is over. Please forgive me if there has been any ways that i have hurt you or danced over your love for me ‚Ä¶.because i never knew how to dance so i just stomped out any thing that resembled a fire‚Ä¶.even if it was a good one. This leads me to the present. I have some that dont understand me, that still think i am immature in many ways, but its not really intentional. I am still trying to fit into the dance not stomping anymore but trying to learn the actual steps that create love, compassion, and patience. I look forward to things that are promised in living a life of love and passion. I know that i didnt give up along time ago because of someone stronger pushing me to go on. I played alot of sports and were many times when i would want to just quit and didnt. I see alot of people in my life that i have touched in one way or the other and they are smiling and i say way to go! you know what‚Ä¶..so many in the world want to change this or change that, but you know i have tried so hard on this journey to just stay on the path and i am a wobbling infant in christ. I in my mind have to be perfect and in my head if i sin then ‚Ä¶i take it back to the voices and music of the many years of my life. I started this with talking on my grandma because of the things i am remembering. I remember the smile the way she lit up the room when i walked in it. Her wanting to cook for me even the most simplest meals and the love she gave me. I would hear her late at night praying for so many and i wondered how can she go on and on for people that she either doesnt know or those that she does. All the ones that hurt her daily with words, with neglect and with shame. I would sit there and wonder‚Ä¶..she would sit there and watch tv with me even if she didnt understand the game that was playing. I would look at her eyes and i saw everything i wanted to be in those eyes. I guess that is why i have seeked it out so hard, in the arms of many and in the eyes of even more. I could have changed it for many and changed who i am but that would not have been me. It is better to have all of me and in the real form instead of the way you wanted me to be or at least that is what the devil told me.I remember my grandmas party at the community center one year and for some weird reason it was so surreal like it was the last one we would ever have together. We were danceing., and we were holding each other and i remember her telling me mejo i love you so much please dont let anything harm you. I love you grandma, and i know you are here with me because of all the things that you have taken me threw front and back in this cruel world. I danced that dance with my grandma and in her arms i felt the same security i so wanted to feel in my own mothers arms. I wish that she was here today with me to actually sit down and have a grown up convo with. I was talking in spanish the other day and the lady asked me who taught you how to speak in spanish and i said proudly my grandma, another thing
that even in not wanting to i did it cause i knew it pleased her. I am going to have to find a way to transfer my life to fit the same way i lookd at ama. thats what we called her AMA. I guess in your young years you think life is bigger then you and as you age it gets smaller and smaller. I wonder how much more of my dance has in store for me. I love you jesus and please hold my grandma and the ones that i have lost in time closely and heal the damage of my earthly deeds. I know that your playing my dance song cause i hear it loud and clear as my eyes swell with tears. Please continue to grow in my heart‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ to be continued‚Ä¶..

The moment an individual can accept and forgive himself, even a little, is the moment in which he becomes to some degree lovable.
‚ÄìEugene Kennedy
If we owe a bill and pay it in full, do we return to pay that same bill over and over again? If we did, someone would surely question what was wrong with us. Yet, how often do we ask forgiveness for the same thing over and over again?
How wonderful to know that we do not have to condemn ourselves, even for not living up to a goal we have set for ourselves. Once we say we are sorry, we need to be willing to forgive ourselves. After all, how else do we learn and grow except by mistakes?
When we have forgiven ourselves, we become free to take risks again without fear of unforgivable failure, and who knows what new successes we might attain?
Is there something I can forgive myself for today?

Owning Our Power
Many of us have someone in our life that challenges our ability to trust and care for ourselves.
When we hear that person‚Äôs voice or are in his or her presence, we may forget all we know about what is real, about how to own our power, about how to be direct, about what we know and believe to be true, about how important we are.
We give up our power to that person. The child in us gets hooked with a mixture of powerful feelings ‚Äì love, fear, or anger. We may feel trapped, helpless, or so attracted that we can‚Äôt think straight. There may be a powerful tug of war going between feelings of anger and our need to be loved and accepted, or between our head and our heart.
We may be so enamored or intimidated that we revert to our belief that we can‚Äôt react or respond to this person any differently.
We get hooked.
We don‚Äôt have to stay under a spell.
We start by becoming aware of the people who hook us, and then accepting that.
We can force ourselves through the motions of reacting differently to that person, even if that new reaction is awkward and uncomfortable.
Search out our motivations. Are we somehow trying to control or influence the other person? We cannot change the other person, but we can stop playing our part of the game. One good way to do this is by detaching and letting go of any need to control.
The next step is learning to own our power to take care of ourselves, to be who we are free from their influence. We can learn to own our power with difficult people. It may not happen overnight, but we can begin, today, to change our self-defeating reactions to the people who have hooked us.
God, help me identify the relationships where I have forfeited my power. Help me unhook and begin owning my power.
Forgiving does not simply mean saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry‚Äù or ‚ÄúI apologize‚Äù. When someone begs to be excused he is not actually confessing his guilt. Rather he would be attempting to justify his ways. He would be considering his sin as something light that can be dealt with lightly. Obviously, if someone steps on your foot unintentionally, it would be appropriate for him to respond by saying, ‚ÄúI apologize.‚Äù But when you bawl unreasonably, or show a haughty spirit, or lie, or do anything sinful, you may not simply excuse yourself. Your duty, in that case, is to admit your guilt and ask for forgiveness.
What, then, is forgiveness according to the Scriptures? David wrote: ‚ÄúBlessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered. Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth (charge, ascribe, credit) not iniquity, and in whose spirit there is no guile‚Äù (Psalms 32:1,2). When sin is forgiven it is done away with; the Lord no longer considers the sinner as guilty. God covers the offence and cancels all debt incurred, as He promised in Hebrews 10:17: ‚ÄúTheir sins and iniquities will I remember no more.‚Äù
So, effectively, forgiveness is a promise made by the offended party that he will no longer mention the offence. The sin in question will not be raised up again, neither with the offending party nor with anyone else. When you forgive your neighbour, you are practically saying: ‚ÄúI promise you that the evil-doing you did against me will not come between us any more. I won‚Äôt mention it at all in the future.‚Äù
As Christ teaches us, then, the sinning person is duty-bound to seek reconciliation. Not only that: the offended party is also under an obligation to seek peace. You may complain: ‚ÄúNo way! Let him come. He is the one who offended me.‚Äù The Lord Jesus teaches otherwise: ‚ÄúTake heed to yourselves: if thy brother trespass against thee, rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him‚Äù (Luke 17:3). He doesn‚Äôt tell us, if he sins against you, wait for him to come and ask for your forgiveness. The Lord evidently desires you to take the initiative; you must go and rebuke him. That is, you must seek him, to speak to him about his offence against you, aiming at reconciliation. In Matthew 18:15, the Lord Jesus insists on this duty: ‚ÄúMoreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone; if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother.‚Äù
In order not to forget this basic principle, our Lord Jesus tells us: ‚ÄúIf he trespass against thee seven times in a day, and seven times in a day turn again to thee saying, I repent, thou shalt forgive him‚Äù (Luke 17:4).

I have said alot and gone back on alot and hurt alot of people. I can only write a short note to the ones that i hurt. I repent. I know i have said sorry til my face is blue‚Ä¶then gone and done something else just as awful. I dont know really my intentions or my will of what i have spoken all i know is that i was angry at alot and just vented in a way that i should have kept it to myself.

at God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham.

I am writing this morning cause i am really upset and angry and i cant seem to shake it. I have prayed and it is just having a grip on me that i cant let go of. I talked to my boss and she didnt turn payroll in until yesterday meaning that we arent getting paid til later on in the week. I guess this wouldnt be so bad but¬† you know i dont make alot so i am on a very stringent budget. Oh well right, i am trying so hard to find something to be grateful of. Also the counselor they hired for over here is being wishy washy with the darn schedule that they can work., like working a half of day is really gonna give much support over here. Once again, petty right? Well doesnt seem like it in my head and about renting space up there no ones rented it cause for the most part i dont want to lease my head to anyone. I have the responsibility of alot up here and i dont really feel appreciated at all , and money doesnt make it all better.I recently was given a raise but for all that goes on up here for that amount was just ya know not worth alot. I know i am sounding negative on here but this is my dumping site always has been for the damn issues that go round and round in my head, cause for the most part if i try to vent to people in reality they just tell me to get over it, and quit being a baby martin‚Ä¶.thats whaat other counselors have told me that i work with. I guess maybe i am to sensitive to crap to work in this field. I am starting school on monday and i cant wait to get out of this pit of insanity that rules all other areas of my life. i know i have the choices to make my own decisions to make my own actions but its like i constantly analyze every F**&(& move i make and then it just boils up and up and then boom i explode! This may be the wrong way to approach things but unfortunately its a work in progress. You know if there is a afterlife and heaven and such ‚Ä¶.i cant wait to get there cause this life of mine is a pile of crap that just keeps stinking and keeping anyone and every one away from me due to the shit that i do. I guess i am just not able to make it all go away ‚Ä¶.doesnt matter how sick and tired i get of things i give up the fight for awhile and then its like a recharge, and im off and going. My will has been so strong from birth and i guess i am scared that if i dont keep fighting i will die and wither away. I know i wont be one that goes to my death calm and ready. I will fight til the day i no longer live. I fight for what though is the question? There is a constant fire in me that burns me up daily and sometimes where i dont want to wake. I tear people apart with stupid rationale‚Ä¶and then retract in victim mode.
¬†
¬†
yup‚Ä¶it is just going round and round my head‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.i guess ill stop for now‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.well i am back and decided to keep writing because i am just that heated up and disappointed with not only myself but many of the choices that i have made regarding my life. I know that you should just live it the best you can and keep going but it is hard to sit back and watch your world that is full of lonliness, and apathy. I dont have a friend that i can really do much with and the ones that i make at church i call on them and i feel out of the loop because they know so much about god and i dont . I feel like they are at peace while my insides are just continueing to burn and burn with a relentless over and over. Thank god i guess that i have this place to dump the insanity of my mind and actually let go of the feelings that im trying so hard to let go of. I know life really isnt that bad but it is really hard to find the sunflowers these days. I know that without rain there would only be withered vegetation everywhere. I just never could hold stuff in that was bothereing me or exciting me, never have been able to and i guess its not the best to always speak what you feel? hell this whole counseling stuff has my mind analytical as hell‚Ä¶and i analyze everything more then ever‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.oh well‚Ä¶.petty huh? who the hell knows‚Ä¶.cause right now i dont and really dont want to exert the energy that it takes to care. i will get thru this‚Ä¶always do and then ill be back to gripe about it later‚Ä¶.oh well‚Ä¶‚Ä¶life huh?

I was watching this today and thought i would put it on here. Not for anyone else but me. This guy was addicted to meth, cocaine, and everything else under the son. He was able to start a walk that many wish to do. I forget alot of times that its not a run. I am not going to the linkin park concert, after thinking about all that needs to be done instead. It saddens me not that im not going but the crap that came from it.. I am sitting here just about to read some out of my devotional. I write in this for me not to prove jack to anyone but myself. I dont care anymore if anyone is proud of me or not, god is gonna be the ultimate judger. I am happy today for some reason, got a couple tires for my car gettin it ready so when school starts next week i wont have to worry bout it breaking down or having a flat. I guess there is a reason for all that happens and my problem is i get caught in the pity party of it all and stay there cause i still need coping skills to deal with the evil that i do.I am working on it‚Ä¶.giveing it up to god my savior.

I wont ever to be able to show people my life so that they understand where i come from and really its not important anymore that they do or not. I was talking to my clients about the past and guilt/shame influenced by quick impulsive things we do to others. I told them that alot of time its not intentional but still hurts non the less. Really, I am not vindictive or one to want to deliberatly hurt others. I get sick though when i stop praying, reading, going to church, or get to lonely and angry, and i feel like a big old baby so i throw a tantrum. Is it right? no of course not. It is not understood by alot, but i am still human. I am not gonna talk anymore bout me. I want to just write on the direction that today i feel i am going ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.forward!!‚Ä¶‚Ä¶amen.
¬†
this song reminds me of someone i know‚Ä¶lol
¬†
¬†
you know maybe someday someone wont look at it as a chore or keep tabs on all the things i do that arent correct, i am hard nuff on myself‚Ä¶.so i beat me down further then anyone ever could. I hope to find this person someday have a family and kids,‚Ä¶.and loves me for the good times and the times i am sick.

I sit alone and watch the clock, 
Trying to collect my thoughts, 
All I think about is you. 
And so I cry myself to sleep, 
And hope the devil I don‚Äôt meet. 
In the dreams that I live through. 
Believe in me, and though you‚Äôve waited for so long,

Believe in me, this life‚Äôs not always what it seems, 
Believe in me, cause I was made for chasing dreams.

hello journal,
¬†
I decided to write in you today because it is a good day but found out that i was not getting a financial aid assistance like i thought i was. I bought one of my books yesterday and will get my second one when i get paid . I started to feel a little down for a second but i have to have faith that all will work itself out. I know it will. I have come so far and not gonna let any lil thing such as lack of finances to get me down. I wont allow it because my god makes a way for the things that are good for me. I am starting to move past the negative thoughts that surround my mind and be aware of them as they arise and give them to god. I have started this and trying to hard to let go of worry and despair cause you know in the end‚Ä¶it doesnt really matter does it? to sit and worry bout something that isnt here yet or something that i can even change. I thought alot about how i treat others and the way they perceive my progression. I know that I hurt out of fear of losing those that are closest to me. I lashed out at brittany because of the fear of losing her yet again‚Ä¶selfishly i didnt want her to go away. So i said alot of mean crap to justify my feelings. I honestly thought we were working towards possibly getting back together as bf gf‚Ä¶..I know that nothing i say or type changes what i did to anyone that i have harmed but you know alot of times people want to know what ""were you thinking"" when you type what you do. I tell ya ‚Ä¶fear kills and burns up everything around me‚Ä¶.it totally does.
¬†
I am lookin forward to this new start a new career opportunity. For once this doesnt seem like something that i already know and have to control. I will keep this up to date on the things that go on in the world of martin‚Ä¶..please keep praying for those that i have hurt and the ones that i love. God bless.
¬†
¬†
addendum: I had to come back to write about something that is hard to write about but it must be wrote on. I have relapsed not on alcohol but on ""ephedra"" it is the chemical component of what goes in meth. I was taking it daily for the last three weeks or so and it gave me severe anger and severe ups and downs. I was taking it so i wouldnt have to feel any of the lonliness, the despair, and all the stuff that was going around in my head. I have been taking them longer but never on a daily basis. I feel ashamed to admit this but it is needed to be stated. I have stayed up and just thought and thought on nights when i couldnt sleep. i havent done meth or anything but still just as harmful. I have not taken anything in two days. It takes me down down and makes me angry angry‚Ä¶when im on it. it is like the devil has a grip on my soul. I havent went to church in two weeks. I have to make up my mind where the hell i want it to go and ask god to guide me in knowledge‚Ä¶to get there. He knows where i need to go, not me.

When I‚Äôm Gone
By 3 Doors Down
Powerlinetours.com
Good morning journal,
I am sitting here listening to this song and it speaks alot of what ""feelings"" that are going on inside today. I am not angry but basically thru with everything that I have been holding onto that is a illusion in my addict mind. I have held onto people,places, and things that I thought were good for me. I must understand that at thirty six fixin to be thirty seven in a couple of weeks‚Ä¶.life goes on and it goes so fast its futile to spend a second in a negative state of mind or living in someone elses view of what you really are. I am me and like it or not i have so much good things that i am that it gets lost in the voices of what i am not. I am not meaing this towards anyone i am meaning the voices in my head that i tend to listen to when things go wrong or¬† i need a way out of a situation. I am tired of giving the best of me to others. I expect it back and when i dont get it i get angry frustrated and confused. I expect it from the wrong people, and so on. I just thought i would get this out ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶love me when im gone. LIfe is to short for all the bs and all the resentments and all the crap of life‚Ä¶he did this he does that‚Ä¶..oh well‚Ä¶..words spoken are already creating their cut in the flesh of the mind. I will keep my mouth shut on things other then me i was so much better off‚Ä¶.be silent and not speak when i shouldnt. ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..peace.

Somebody Said a Prayer Lyrics
Just a single mom raisin up the kids
Little Tommy‚Äôs seven now and her daughter Justine just turned ten
Pinchin every cent laughin and lovin and content
You would never think a couple years ago she almost let her job, her kids, her mind, her life go up in smoke
right there on the edge right before the fall
Chorus: Somebody said a prayer somebody had some faith somebody finally hit their knees and asked for help for heavens sake somebody finally found someone who really cares somebody said a prayer
He was seventeen and his heart was broke the middle of the night a bottle full of pills and a goodbye note
Sittin on his bed but then he bowed his head now I see him every week and every now and then he talks about that night and the peace that came over him talk about a sign
Can I get an amen well there were tears on his face he said look what happened lord
Chorus: Somebody said a prayer
somebody had some faith somebody finally hit their knees and asked for help for heavens sake somebody finally found someone who really cares
somebody said a prayer_______
Can I get an amen Ohhhhhhhh
can I get an amen Ohhhhhhhhhh
somebody somebody said a prayer somebody said a prayer somebody somebody said a prayer___________

I search for love, when the night came, and it closed in, I was alone, but you found me, where I was hiding, and now I‚Äôll never ever be same, it was the sweetest voice, that called my name sayin You‚Äôre not alone, For I am here, let me wipe away your every fear, My love I‚Äôve never left your side, I have seen you through the darkest night, And I‚Äôm the one that who‚Äôs loved you all your life, All of your life You cry your self to sleep, cause the hurt is real, and the pain cuts deep, all hope seems lost, with heart ache your closest friend, and everyone else long gone, you‚Äôve had to face the music on your own, but there is a sweeter song that calls you home, saying You‚Äôre not alone, For I am here, let me wipe away your every tear, My love I‚Äôve never left your side, I have seen you through the darkest nights, And I‚Äôm the one who‚Äôs love you all your life, All your life Faithful and true‚Ä¶ Forever, For my love will carry you‚Ä¶ You‚Äôre not alone, for I‚Ä¶ I am here, let me wipe away your every fear‚Ä¶ Oh yeah, My love I‚Äôve never left your side, I have seen you through your darkest night, Your darkest nights, And I‚Äôm the one that‚Äôs loved you all your life, All of your life

It is three in the morning and I cant sleep and I went to someone whose page i respect and this song just grabbed me. I am sitting here sobbing like a baby. It is amazing that this song speaks everything that I have been feeling for a long long time. She even looks a lil like the person who I look up to. I am saddend not because really anything other then the song is saying. I have been studying non stop and exhausted but cant sleep due to the fear of failing. It is not easy and i have felt a lil alone. This song really tells me alot because it tells me that i am not! I cant stop crying. The part of crying yourself to sleep is so true lately, not because im depressed or because im trying to be a martyr..facing the music on my own due to my own stubborness. I cant add to this song or take anything away from it. it is such truth. I am a addict on just about anything that can be placed in front of me, and thats not even the half of it. I live life based in fear, fear of failing, fear of not doing everything right, letting people down, and being perceived as a person that just cant get it right no matter how much i am told how to do something. Work is stressful the program that started at just thirty five clients is up to 80 plus. I have help but this person is not very receptive to suggestion on the guidelines of the place. I wont tear this person down because you know, we always have flaws. I have had a deep pull on my heart lately a pull that i cant explain, i go to sleep and wake up hurting from the inside out. I keep going on because really i know that it is only temporary and it will subside in time. I heard this song tonight and just felt covicted.
We have been doing inner child work in one of my groups and no matter what they say it cant¬† but affect you when you have unresolved things. I am never really good at carrying around alot of stress due to the environment i grew up in, and it just cripples me to the core. I am gonna be okay just needed to write a little and know that i can here openly. God has me, and even though i dont talk to certain people i know they love me and its hard because i talked about it tonight in our meeting how this freakin addiction or whatever it is at this point in my life has torn down the ones that love me the most due to the fear of being loved. That is what it boils down to. nothing else. if you touch me will i finally be home. i am keeping myself doing the next right hting even if its one second at a damn time. I will survive this! god makes no mistakes and i am not one . i keep listening to this song over and over , its like a warm bath cleaning away my dirt and healing my wounds. I am human and as much as i talk about my emotions there is alot that i hold back because fear rules all that i am.
i hold myself and have just given up and let go, and still i want to pick it back up knowing better, i have been in this along time and i know about things that i write about, but we are ones that take shortcuts and live life by past experiences, good bad indifferent. I put up a wall to the world in the look of intelligence, and unmovable, but on the inside i am usually lost and just going thru it hoping to do it right without hurting you or even hurting myself. I have told others this or that, while in the deepest pits of my soul it was me that i was talkin bout. because you know no matter how many people i speak to in meetings, on the phone, nothing replaces a hug, a kiss, a i love you‚Ä¶.the thing i want the most is the thing that keeps me crippled. i know that probly doesnt make sense, but it is the truth.
At thirty seven i have little left to hang on to really, i have let go of alot, but living life on lifes terms is not easy, i get to the point of arrogance, and complacency. I need to stop worrying so much about what god is and just step out of the damn way and let him be in me, not next to me in the passenger seat. i can look back on any entry in this damn thing and see the pattern see the same thing over and over. i told a client tonight maybe they create chaos and pain to harm themselves when in actuality theyr life is just as it is ment to be., because you know that is me. I have everything i need and could ever want. the things i long for i have had, and didnt want at that time, i was and still selfish with my heart, i dont believe anyone can ever love this person i am. no matter how much i change year to year, i cant shake that. is that my addiction? is that my own selfishness? is that just fear, that if they do i will hurt them?
with that can you imagine knowing that and living life trying to go on, with the memories the words that echo in your mind about what you really are‚Ä¶‚Ä¶martin your a user, your this or that. mostly created by me. CRAZY. I have said alot and even if it doesnt make sense its what was goin on in my head as i was typing. I will make it thru with god. I need to read my bible and get off the pity pot and what could have been ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶feel the wall going up? thats what happens‚Ä¶‚Ä¶to stay vulnarble makes me feel weak. help me jesus. you know which way i should go. sadness is not forever, even in just this moment i feel it going away. oh lord help me.

Where are the people that accuse me?
The ones who beat me down and bruised me?
They hide, just out of sight
Can‚Äôt face me in the light
They will return, but I‚Äôll be stronger
God, I want to dream again
Take me where I‚Äôve never been
I want to go there
This time I‚Äôm not scared
Now I am unbreakable
It‚Äôs unmistakable
No one can touch me
Nothing can stop me
Sometimes it‚Äôs hard to just keep going
But faith is moving without knowing
Can I trust what I can‚Äôt see
to reach my destiny?
I want to take control, but I know better
God, I want to dream again
Take me where I‚Äôve never been
I want to go there
This time I‚Äôm not scared
Now I am unbreakable
It‚Äôs unmistakable
No one can touch me
Nothing can stop me
Forget the fear, it‚Äôs just a crutch
That tries to hold you back and turn your dreams to dust
All you need to do is just trust
(Trust, trust, trust)
God, I want to dream again
Take me where I‚Äôve never been
I want to go there
This time I‚Äôm not scared
Now I am unbreakable
It‚Äôs unmistakable
No one can touch me
Nothing can stop me

Struggling With Sin
¬†7What shall we say, then? Is the law sin? Certainly not! Indeed I would not have known what sin was except through the law. For I would not have known what coveting really was if the law had not said, ""Do not covet.""[b] 8But sin, seizing the opportunity afforded by the commandment, produced in me every kind of covetous desire. For apart from law, sin is dead. 9Once I was alive apart from law; but when the commandment came, sin sprang to life and I died. 10I found that the very commandment that was intended to bring life actually brought death.
¬†11For sin, seizing the opportunity afforded by the commandment, deceived me, and through the commandment put me to death. 12So then, the law is holy, and the commandment is holy, righteous and good. 13Did that which is good, then, become death to me? By no means! But in order that sin might be recognized as sin, it produced death in me through what was good, so that through the commandment sin might become utterly sinful.
¬†14We know that the law is spiritual; but I am unspiritual, sold as a slave to sin. 15I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do I do not do, but what I hate I do. 16And if I do what I do not want to do, I agree that the law is good. 17As it is, it is no longer I myself who do it, but it is sin living in me. 18I know that nothing good lives in me, that is, in my sinful nature.[c] For I have the desire to do what is good, but I cannot carry it out. 19For what I do is not the good I want to do; no, the evil I do not want to do‚Äîthis I keep on doing. 20Now if I do what I do not want to do, it is no longer I who do it, but it is sin living in me that does it.
¬†21So I find this law at work: When I want to do good, evil is right there with me. 22For in my inner being I delight in God‚Äôs law; 23but I see another law at work in the members of my body, waging war against the law of my mind and making me a prisoner of the law of sin at work within my members. 24What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body of death? 25Thanks be to God‚Äîthrough Jesus Christ our Lord! 
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†So then, I myself in my mind am a slave to God‚Äôs law, but in the sinful nature a slave to the law of sin.

i just finished going over some notes , and am just wiped out. I dont have fear about this though. I will do fine. I have been keeping up with it like i have supposed to maybe a lil obsessive. But you know beats not doing it right? i went to a awesome sermon today, and just cant stop thinking bout it. Even though the bears lost, i have had the preachers words deep in my head. He spoke on sin, and pain , suffereing. He said its from god that we may feel these things and most of the time we dont need to know why. We must lean on him for all. It felt like the whole sermon was talkin to me.¬† we read out of the book of romans. out of job. I have been asking people lately about their salvation, something i never did before, i have struggles but you know its okay jesus brings the rain to cleanse me and make me new again. I walk by faith‚Ä¶..just wanted to write to any struggling dont give up!‚Ä¶these two videos talk deeply to me hope it helps you too.

Just thought i would come write a quick entry before group. I have been reading a book this last hour that has just been hard to put down. It is called twenty five words ‚Äòhow the serenity prayer can save your life"". I have gotten this book awhile back from my mom¬†and even seen my intials in it, i guess it does purtain to my actions/behaviors in the time we have known each other. I was just thinking about alot of the authors meanings. See the author has walked in my shoes and some sort of life that only god got her out off. I know for a long time it was not real recovery it was a temporary fix and manipulation to get what i wanted even if i didnt know what was good for me. I am what the book talks about being lonely and alone, even with people in my life that i tend to want to push away for the fear of feeling that feeling‚Ä¶of hurt and pain the one thing that i in all my life have kept around to have something to ""dictate"" my life. Without it who would martin be? who would i be with out chaos? who would i be without pain? well, i cant say i know but hell the record is broken time to toss it out and just let god sing the tunes i need to hear and the words that need to be spoken for my serenity. I am tired of empty promises, empty words so kinda gunshy to speak alot, lord‚Ä¶..its your call. I am not the driver anymore. I will ride with you guiding the path for my life. I am gonna finish this book and pick up some others that have just sat in that bookcase i see and gathered dust, thinkin HEY I know better or blah! ‚Ä¶sure such arrogance of the mouth of a addict. I am taking this time for me because i need to get these thoughts out before i go to group. this song ‚Ä¶.man‚Ä¶.i am gonna quote the book here:
¬†
when we are able to live in acceptance of those things we cant change, we will know a new freedom and we will find others are drawn to us in a different way. Because they dont feel judged, because we never expect any¬† more of them than they want to give, to be, there wil be a level of comfort and open sharing we never before experienced‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

such truth‚Ä¶im hanging to that ‚Ä¶gotta go to group.

I just finished reading my bible and thought i would write a entry before bed. I love this song so much because as many of you know my mother is in prison and the other one she has x‚Äôd me out. So, this song means alot to me and it makes me cry but i understand the messege where before i did not. I just read john 3:18-21¬† Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because he has not believed in the name of God‚Äôs one and only Son.19 This is the verdict: Light has come into the world, but men loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil. 20 Everyone who does evil hates the light, and will not come into the light for fear that his deeds will be exposed. 21But whoever lives by the truth comes into the light, so that it may be seen plainly that what he has done has been done through God.
I first read this verse last monday while i was counseling a client and we were talking on the bible. I turned and it stopped on this page. It tells the simplest most true statement., about light coming into the world and some men(i.e. me,) have loved the darkness instead because my deeds were evil. and then it goes to say all that is done in the dark will come to light and become exposed. Such truth and such conviction for me. I am trying so hard not to live in the darkness, but for alot of years it was shame which i learned is just fear/turned into sin. that i allowed so much to rule me and dictate who i was honest with and whom i hid stuff from. I still catch myself doing stupid crap out of habit and i try to change it though ‚Ä¶which i would see as repentence? My job has been tough lately because of alot of things that were never told to me are now coming out and it looks like i wasnt doing them. I am a perfectionist and take such things to heart. I am learning to let go , like i have said in previous entries i am reading the 25 words of the serenity prayer. I miss my mom both of them. I am 37 but sometimes i feel like that little boy ‚Ä¶.that just needs well.. a mamas love. I am going to bed just thought i would write a little before i layed er down‚Ä¶.here is another good song:)‚Ä¶.enjoy

how close can i get lord‚Ä¶my surrender‚Ä¶hmmm great thoughts from a fearful person. How close can i get lord until i have to lose the total control that you want me to lose. Lord I am taking it in day to day at the pace you want me to digest the newness i call my life. I am happy and sittin here reading a book before group. I am almost finished and it makes so much sense. Spend so much time on petty trivial things, when all that matters is your¬† connection with the lord. I think i can do this or can do that and add to it. FOol i will take your life, god will take my life as quick as i build that mansion ‚Ä¶..i love this song always have, but as many of you know i have been a ""carnal"" if you will christian or just a deceiver and spreading satans evil every turn i went. I am looking for that light in all i do today one moment at each time. This author of this book has faced addiction, abuse, dang all the subtitles of my life, and not hopping on board for the moment, i actually took the time to see how she is maintaining it, not just ""sound the trumphets"" for change. Sick boy, caught ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶somewhere between my heart and my hands‚Ä¶..this song i have posted before and i promise each entry is just a searching and fearful journey‚Ä¶you get that fearful‚Ä¶fearful of truth fearful of honesty, fearful of life changing events. I have blamed til i look around this room and guess what? no one in this damn room but me, so it would be insane to continue to cast out reasons and excuses as if to why i am who i am. ITs bout being obedient and haveing that final understanding. THE GOD WHO is and the god we want‚Ä¶they dont ever make sense as long as ""we"" are running things. I am choosing a side this time, tired of jumpin thru hoops trying to keep my stuff hidden and in the dark. ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..lord, please accept me even in times of my confusion and doubt, that you will tug on my heart as a horse is tugged from danger. I am not a calm timid one, so make it hurt if need be, i shal surrender as you wish. I I I ‚Ä¶.that is all that comes out of my mouth,,,,I does nothing but keep me sick. Yours am me. Thank you for a great day, oh lord heal me and continueing leading me where you wish, and please take all the demons from this office and allow myself to be nothing but a tunnel so that your messege my be heard, not for me but for all that you wish to reach. I am free‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..your son. Martin

I am sitting here thinking about how many teams actually are ""good"" and how many of the games are up and down. I support the chicago bears, and have for years 20 plus. I have reached lots of highs and lows with the bears, and today it just hurt cause feasibly we should be 6-0. I know what ifs and could have beens, but seriously we have a good team if all the things were going in the same direction, bs calls, long passes that are not covered due to our defence thinking they can just show up and the other team will just roll over for them. I am pissed off to say the least‚Ä¶oh well another sunday of frustration. on another note at least the horns kicked the sooners ass!! and oh yeah the cowboys lost too‚Ä¶so all is not lost‚Ä¶lol‚Ä¶oh well‚Ä¶gotta get to cleanin‚Ä¶:P

I just finished eating a late night dinner and had alot on my mind earlier and decided to come and vent to me and the air. ¬ß I work with addicts as most of you know and alot of times it takes alot out of you. I being one really understand at the end of the day just how special my job is and stressful at the same time. I listen to peoples problems day in and day out for a living. It is much more in dept then that just at times I wonder if the reflection that i give them actually helps them wake up from their lives of despair, and pain. I see alot that are hurting deeply and in society to no matter what they try to use to cover it up, its visible, and Its like a super power i wish i didnt posess. I feel peoples pain even if i meet them once or have known them a lifetime. I love the smile of a child, the look in a babies eyes when they are first born‚Ä¶.such innocense. Its a beauty that I wish the world had more in it. I was talking to my group tonight about not being a part of the problem, but part of the solution for a better world, and no matter how cliche‚Äô ish it sounds it starts with each and every one of us. Our country didnt end up the way it is due to ""everyone"" else but we became followers of the status quo, and now here we are years later, obese, unmotivated, and often times addicted to something or someone other then the right thing we need to focus on ‚Ä¶.
I have been guilty of all this so in no way am in putting myself up there and picking on others in this. I hope that you guys if you are part of a world that is crumbling around you, or if you are in anytype of pain or despair, look up to the sky and ask for forgiveness, seriously its the only way that it all makes sense. I was a doubter for alot of years and fought it and fought it, man honestly im tired of the fight and the older i get the more i see parishing and losing its grip on a world that redefines itself so much that yesterdays info is outdated. Where is all this technology taking us? the one with all the toys really win it all?
I believe in love with all i am and for alot of years never really understood what it ment to love, and receive it. I long for it like a drug at times cause i know the real love can possibly last a lifetime and it is a lifeline of many precious moments. I have lost alot in my life that really never knew how i felt about them. I have been foolish with hearts, and gambled with people who trully wanted the best for me. I know that life is short, and that it is what you make of it, but at my point in life i often wonder, where did it go martin? where did life go and why the hell did it go so fast? lol. I cheer for teams that most find as ""losers or underdogs"" to win, i cheer for the little guys that no one gives a chance i guess because for alot of years, i know what its like to be that and win‚Ä¶.its like a bright light that shines on forever. I have spent my whole life trying to regain the chants, the spotlight and the prestige of my youth, and you know what? it really goes down to the ones that are the closest that you mean the most too. I am in a good spot in my life today even though at any moment it could change, and most definately will. I am okay with that, cause I just know the next car will be a lil shiner, and the ride wont be as bumpy cause i have learned to miss those potholes‚Ä¶.

389,https://www.opendiary.com/m/rebornsoldier/detox-central-4538012/,2008-12-08,detox central‚Ä¶,"
Hey journal,
I started the context with that cause alot of you dont know I am working in a detox right now and it is full of people that are detoxing from heroin or opiates or what not. Not many meth or other drugs, mostly alcoholics and heroin users. I dont have to counsel with any of them mostly all paperwork and trying to talk them into staying and if they want to leave it is okay. They are voluntary and not a big deal if they leave. It is so full of freedom due to the fact that if they want it they stay and grab on to it but it is such a short process its in and out. I have worked in a detox at the very beginning of this whole journey. It is called homeward bound in oak cliff in dallas texas. I wish i would have been working here last semester or the last couple of years, the people are so friendly and it is mostly a medical floor so it is a different change of pace. I am not the only counselor and have alot of support. I can call my own hours pretty much and as long as i work forty no biggie. I get benefits after ninety days so im excited about it.
I just finished school for the semester and took my other final today it was not all that easy but think i did okay regardless. I have started to work out every morning and even doing the mornings different instead of just jumping out of bed and takin on the day it is praying and giving thanks. I woke up last night about two in the morning and i was having a dream that was full of water like a flood and i could literally feel myself in it being swept away like off into the ocean. I hung on to a fence and next thing i know im in a old house that used to be a mansion. I am walking around it and the owner has a tendency for excess. I am looking around in it and just thinking of all that the water has destroyed. I was fading in and out of this dream mind ya‚Ä¶.and then i was in a smaller house and it was full of laughter and familiar voices but no people or faces. I was happy and just going around between the two places and just enjoying myself not really doing much but i could breath for once and the air was so clean and non stagnent that i have ever smelt. I remember that after the rain there was a large hole in the ceiling and a light was shining from it. It was this that re assured me of the safety that i need in all situations. I am really at the lowest point in my life right now then ever, but you know what. I have been thru situations before and I know where to turn to. I will be okay and i guess that is the semblence of the dream. I survived floods, homes being torn apart, and in the end as long as i have faith all will be okay.
I know that is a strange dream to have but i know it all makes sense somehow to me. I am about to get going home in the sleet and ice so if i can make it thru a river flood pullin me this way and that, i can make a lil ice. I finally have started to use the things i have been talkin for years and things that have been given to me for years and years, i know sometimes there isnt people around to see it but as long as i know in my heart and god knows, they to will be proud. The holidays are around the corner and for the first time in alot of years i am gonna have to work. I dont mind it though, eight hours that is it then i can go home. I do miss alot of folks and they know whom they are. I still look at their myspace pages, and think‚Ä¶.thank you so much for believing in me when i didnt know i could believe in myself and the guilt/shame is reducing. Life is dearly to short to dwell on the past and all that is harmful to a heart that is wanting something different out of life. I wake up in the mornings still a lil sad, but then i get goin to the gym and get the endorphins going cause if i listen to my feelings, they lie to me and keep me unmotivated and in a pity party. I miss my grandma this christmas for some reason, and its been forever since i really spoke on her. I wonder how she is, and how all the ones that have pasted if they are looking down and can actually say‚Ä¶.way to go martin‚Ä¶..knew you could do it~!‚Ä¶.well gotta get goin home ‚Ä¶.love all you that know me and those that dont, thanks for the kind notes‚Ä¶.if you only knew how long it has taken to get to this point‚Ä¶to really understand the real stuff in life, isnt even in front of me‚Ä¶..its in the eyes of a baby, the smile of a child, it is the precious moments where you give just cause and have faith when y ou didnt before. Repent when you do wrong and try to learn from it and move on. at thirty seven i know this sounds foolish, but damn i have struggled aloooooooong time with this. well take care opendiary peeps‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.and god bless!!¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† martin:)

Numb
By Linkin Park
Powerlinetours.com
Hey kiddoes,
I just got home from work and had this song goin in my car and had my mind thinking of the endless nights this ment so many other things in my life but at this point i can think‚Ä¶thank god i can feel! I was a person that was so full of hatred and even evil at times and i speak of it like its been years and years but as recent as probly a week ago? I was at work tonight reading entries from 03‚Ä≤ and realizing how as much as things change in my life they have lingered around and around and around. I guess that is why this song has so much meaning for me. I am not numb anymore and finally in charge of the direction i want to go. I dont have a toxic person or friend pulling at me this way or that, dont have a toxic roomate tempting me to this or that. I dont have secrets that are keeping me sick. I am just me and I am really okay with that if only for today. I read alot in my beginning of my journal and thought of the moments that i wrote on and you know alot of the things i wrote on then i struggled to remember tonight? i definatley had alot of anger and f‚Äôbombs here and there. I think the one thing i wake up with is the word and spirit of the lord leading me, and knowing that i choose to not be a victim of anyone or anythings circumstances today. I choose if my day will stay good or if i will give myself tons of reasons why it shouldnt be. I am behind on my rent and doing the best i can, i have delinquent things going on and you know im not being naive or over zealous because I know in time all will be back to normal on that end, but the most important part of every day is that god allows me to rise. I rose today and that was a gift from him. I could have died in my sleep and all the bills and all the things i ""want"" to do wouldnt mean a damn thing. I read alot of the earlier entries when i was just so close so close to getting it right, and with good intentions., but one thing that was constant i always had someone behind the scenes whether it be old friends from the past or girls that i could not severe ties with because of ""what ifs"" you know what if‚Äôs take you to alonesville and you will be the mayor for sure. I try to surround myself with people that will be a positive not a negative, and its a small crowd,.lol. I know i have gotten on here and professed change, and this and that, im not doing that i am just happy at this moment and wanted to get on here and write about it. I am not depressed for this or that. I keep thinkin of the part in the bible where the sparrow doesnt need food or clothes to survive and still it exists‚Ä¶gods love. I also read on alot of other areas in my life that are no longer around which made me alot discontent and saddend me. One thing if i learned anything is there are no mistakes‚Ä¶.but sometimes even knowing that, its hard to lose some people in your life even if by your own doing.
¬†
This song plays on and it was a song that ment i wanted to be one with myself and god, i knew the ""good "" martin was with god, while the other was just a devient side of myself, and for years and years and years and years‚Ä¶.could never feel the good one very long. Like i wrote in my entry last night, i dont really counsel at this job and dont work tons of hours both of which are god sends. I am finally aware of the truth, the real reason to be if just for me is do it anyways even if it isnt instant and doesnt always feel the safest. I look around at my apt and it looks like a college dorm room‚Ä¶.sad in so many ways but at least i have shelter. If any of you are reading this and are younger dont waste your life as i have chasing the wrong things for years and years. I had timelines, deadlines, and unreachable goals where the ones that loved me fell by the way side to those demands and in the end i sit a thirty seven year old man still not anywhere near where i ""had"" to be to be happy, but one thing is different I am happy , but just because i finally woke up and punched the demon in the¬† mouth. Please dont waste words time on the unattainable especially if you lose your love ones for your own selfish reasons. I see so many young people angry, sad, depressed, and lost, and falling into the world of the addiction i myself started at eighteen. I thought i had the world by the tail and had it whipped. That way of thinking kept me self destructing for years and years and years. I surrender daily, because it is such a strong part of who i am i have to. I cant step off my bed without asking god to take it. I was so ignorant in some of my earlier entries referring to god as GOOD ORDERLY DIRECTIOn, he is the creator and the father of my savior jesus christ bar none. i read that and was like what a dumb statement martin‚Ä¶lol. but once again being lead by everyone other then my own thinking. I miss my friends i had that were good for me, i hate the fact no one believes me anymore because i turned on them and even hurt with so many actions. Honesty well this is it. It is honesty from a middle aged man who has spent most of his life trying to control and have some sort of excuse why not and why it shouldnt be. victim victim victim‚Ä¶..what a shame martin what a shame. You cry and whine about where your life is today, hell you did it., every bit of it. NO one else did but you. You made the choices that would sabatage any good thing that came your way. Your not special kid, your just a very selfish person who hurts people that is my friend why you are alone and without at thirty seven. Created your own prison to keep from harming but any chance you got you did it, and then swore you wouldnt do it again‚Ä¶
¬†
I love you though martin because at least being aware of this can finally at last if only for this moment get your butt going forward where it has needed since you took that first drink. Its not the drink that got you here, its not the abuse, its not the crap‚Ä¶its you wanting to die and fighting so many to let you do so as they watched. selfish selfish selfish.
¬†
I have this song going but i am not lost in it, im really taking in all im writing not to give my self accolades or affirmation as i once did. I am really reading what i write. I am not a loser but have lost, i am not a failure but have failed many, i am not a mistake but have made tons, and i am not a martyr, my lord already died for my salvation. ..nothing more needed to say. have a merry christmas you guys and god bless you all:)
¬†
Martin

Dear lord,
I come to you tonight with a heart that is heavy and full of questions that i ask you put to rest and at peace. I have a dear little boy on my mind right now as he is in a hospital bed fighting a infection. You know people i love this little boy more then i love my own self. I sat down today after i talked to my brother and heard the news i cried and cried which i never do and which has never came easily. I know my lord has him and will not let anything happen that will hurt Toby. I just have to write down my thoughts before I go to bed, I trully understand what love really is. Its not selfish and not boastful, Toby and jayleigh have taught me that, in their actions and their love with no condition. I am thinkin bout toby and wish i could just go hold him right now and be there to let him know all will be okay little one. Jesus has you as the angels protect you from the evil and pain. Please if you read this I ask that you keep Toby lifted up and that he comes home soon with a healed hand, and heart. I love all of you that leave the kindest notes. I would take all the pain for him if¬†i could‚Ä¶..but my lord has him and i am not that powerful. I must leave this at his feet. I will log off now and be still. in faith all will be done in gods hands not my own.

It is twelve twenty two and I cant sleep. I have been trying to call it a night since like ten thirty or so. I had a relatively good day today so its not like i have issues going on that are keeping me from it. I just thought I would get on here and empty whatever thought pattern is going on upstairs. I just have alot going on up there that I cant deciphere but know its really unchangeable things and things that just baffle me. I am reconstructing my life in a way that I have never had decipline enough to do before. I have stated in previous entries about getting rid of people places and things that cause me discomfort. Well, I just am trying to find positive things and people to put in those places. I dont trust people easily still so dont have alot of trust for just anyone to replace the people that were toxic for me. I have ventrued out some of my apartment but not to much. I get a phobia now that i just dont fit in worst then ever before. I have not been drinking or doing anything else, so it is just a real weird feeling. I have been even laying in bed at times and getting anxiety over such things i cant change. Last night i layed there and when i closed my eyes a reel came on and it was playing game by game of years of football. It scared me cause i was like oh damn what the hell, am i about to die? they say you life passes before you before you go and i was just a lil freaked out about it. Not that im scared to die, i just well..you get the point. Tonight I layed there and was almost asleep and the phone rang, it was a wrong number. I have changed my number again and so alot dont have any way to reach me and it is a blessing but still the temptation of contacting people out of boredom really gets trying at times. I went shopping tonight for groceries and instead of stocking up on crap actually started shopping a lil more healthy. I am implementing these changes, and it seems so freaking foreign like im tryin to fit a round circle in a square peg. I know at my age damn should be a lot easier but still struggle with things. I dont look back in regret, just wonder why the simplest things are so like weird and it appears like im a kid doing them. lonliness and fighting the urge not to just revert back to old behavior isnt so tough anymore, but i have been wondering do people really die with no physical contact, such as hugs, kisses, and such? just a thought out of my own mind. well, there is still work to do and at least im still above ground even though most times i fear it. I will survive. no self pity entry, just emptyin the mental process that is my own insanity. good night journal.

I Can Only Imagine lyrics ‚Äì Mercyme lyrics


I Can Only Imagine Video ‚Äì Mercyme Music Videos
Music Videos by VideoCure

good evening,
I was watching this video and started a lil bit of reminising on the begining of my journey with you lord. I know this song is a lil older then some of the music out now. I feel a close tie to this song because it reminds me of all the questions I had about the lord, all the aching that i felt that i needed gone. I remember how i was scared to trust in him and scared to pray because i really never believed people like ""me"" would ever get better. I was a lost soul and had been for years and years. I am sitting here thinkin bout how it will be like to see jesus! to see heaven and to know the glory of almighty god. I know alot of people that are confused on their faith and even more that dont have any at all or have walked away from it due to being exposed to it so much as a young child. I grew up not knowing much of anything but the darker side of life, and it followed me for years, so accepting christ was a hard transition for me but I have kept with it and i feel that now i have a relationship that isnt just a emergency god but a god that i understand and is my best friend. I rely on him when im having a great day or when i am confused and lost. I love you lord for that. I am not scared of you anymore. I continue to see your glory in all that is around me. I work with the most lost of lost. They come in half dead alot of times, and just clueless to how to get out of that rut they are in. I can be empathic with them, but really that lost feeling beats in my chest no more. I know what my destiny and life is for GOD. I am second on the list of the important things in my life. I had to humble myself enough to do that. I always wanted to be first and above all run things always. I am listening to bring the rain by mercy me and the rain used to symbolize pain, fear, and powerlessness in my life. I hated the rain but was like a dark cloud around me everywhere i went, and in my profession i see alot that carry that same darkness and lost feeling. I dont get frustrated at this job because for the most part they dont fight suggestion, but at times if you push to hard they get scared and fight back with arrogance, and a sharp tung. Its like taming a person who has been in the wild so long that they forget the simplest ways of humanity, how to live how to talk, and how to interact without fear. I have really started to understand fear alot more then before. I know that if it isnt real thru faith all will subside. all will subside in time, and fearing the unknown is the way of the devil to grip your heart mind and soul. I write in here not out of ""look at me"" but just to remind myself that sometimes life is really great and doesnt have to be much more then a relationship with god. thats it.
fear and powerlessness‚Ä¶two words that will kill the human spirit. How does one get to the point of admitting it and moving on, well for one you cant do it alone and another you need people in your life that will lift you up and not judge you. Even sometimes a simple critism no matter how constructive can tear down a wall of progress. we fear what we cannot change, we fear others perceptions of us, we fear everything that has nothing to do with how we are to live, but we act as if our god is small and cant do it all for us. I was this person i am describing so that is why i can talk so openly about it. i feared it all., love , acceptance, kindness, and you name it, it was positive i didnt want it in my life long cause i didnt know how to hang on to it , or if i would damage it. but i craved it like a drug ‚Ä¶dotn know if that makes any sense. Its like chasing your tail over and over year after year, day after day declaring change, and falling into the same pit you left ‚Ä¶.awareness is a wonderful thing.
¬†
I dont go to meetings, i dont do anything but go to church. I found all i need there. I have talked to some people that are kind and leading me to understand alot more. NOt that i havent ever had this in my life, just not fighting it anymore. thats hard to believe i know, but hey‚Ä¶im done.
¬†
thank you jesus‚Ä¶may i not be a deversion for someone wanting to know you, may i be a beacon in the dark to lead them to you.

wow is all i can say because isnt god so great that he motivates even the least faithful? like in the second one the coach asks‚Ä¶.what is your mind full of ? poison? no faith?I am sitting here so thankful for his mercy and grace. I cant really tell you how long i have wanted to be where i am at. Not because of a woman, not because of a job, not because of anything other then my relationship with my lord jesus christ. I feel great! so long i have waited to wake up and know and have my heart full of love and the lord. I have had it dont get me wrong but lately i just notice i am happier for longer, and not so negative, and finally understanding that life is a gift not a final destination and not treating it as such.

good evening diary, just got home from work and im a lil tired and decided to empty my head before my head hits the pillow. I have posted this song alot on my diary cause it is just a awesome song. I had a great day today and started the spring semester. I have my speech class first thing in the morning. I am really kinda looking forward to it, not scared of talking in front of people. I did a group today over the process of addiction. Went in and spit it out, effortless. My job is not that demanding that I actually have time to think and be okay with the process of detox. I still dont know alot about it, but im catching on. I was a lil upset this evening for a lil bit for no reason i started getting some anxiety going but i busted out some books i always keep in my backpack. I read the language of letting go for today and it hit on the head exactly what i was feeling. I need to carry my bible in there. I read for like a hour or two cause it is that slow. Detoxing clients really just sleep or want out. We spent alot of time on this person today and it was sad because she had family on the other end, that told her if you leave you have nothing here, no home, no us, so whoever picks you up go with them. Wow to hear that stated I tell ya for anyone you think it would open their eyes to just what they may lose. To this person the most important thing in her mind was smoking a cigerette. I am not a smoker so i cant really tell you the severity of not being able to, She left ama(against medical advice) thats not the whole story, she called her sister in rockwall to come get her which is like forty minutes from us, and i give the sister directions, well she goes downstairs with another client because she was discharged and hopped in a cab with that other client! we had to tell her sister that she had left. I have been pretty bad but i think that is downright low. Her sister had children she took out in the middle of the night all for the safety and well being of this person, and like addicts or anyone that is not thinking straight she ran from her reality. Anyways, got that dealt with and read out of the books i mentioned above. I am so grateful i am not there where that poor soul is or any of the others in our unit. I am so thankful for the ability to be able to stop the commitee in my mind today. I dont have to listen to it, and further more dont have to react to it! I was thinking while doing that group, wow these people are children of god, as i am. Time to spread some hope in their lives even if they dont act like they are getting it. I am excited about this semester of school, taking my test again in june. I feel that life has slowed down alot but as i have read sometimes its those times when god talks to us the loudest. one day at a time, sometimes quickly sometimes slowly‚Ä¶it is working for those that allow the miracle to happen. i keep listening to this song for some reason brings some comfort even though im not really listening to the words rather then the beat , and i guess just being naustalgic. Football season is almost over and really went fast this year. I got to watch alot of the game so that made me happy. Like i told my group i am not six feet deep so that in itself is worth being grateful for, that the lord gives you one more day to do his will and plant seeds. I guess this is all for tonight, just needed to get this random thought pattern out, god bless you guys!

Hate Me
By Blue October
Powerlinetours.com
I had to pick this song for the reason of anyone that has ever been struck by addiction it is the feeling of coming down and not knowing what kind of world your gonna land in. I want you to know I am not depressed, or sad, just being insightful‚Ä¶today was really intense and had alot of heroin detoxes, people coming off of any type of medication to keep from feeling. Well gettin to the point. I was sitting in my office with this young man age 22 and he was telling me about how he just was so angry he could just take a drink. He was talking about how he was taking up for this girl whom had terrets, and people were making fun of her, and he was trying to make her feel okay, and he was just worried for someone outside of himself with no expectation. That is it folks! right there, when you go outside of yourself to help another without expecting it back. This young man has been beat down so bad in his short life that he couldnt see the good he had done or even had a attachment to it, until he was showed thru alot of affirmations, and questions. I printed out the serenity prayer for him and told him that he was just given the biggest sword against the evil thoughts that go in your head. I told him that alot of times I would have to say that prayer moment by moment at times, and reassured him that he was on the road, but just to hang on and not let anyone or anything stand in his way of sobriety EVEN HIM. Some dont get that because it sounds so simple but sometimes someone has to stand in the way of another to keep them from killing themselves in a healthy way, so the one standing there wont get sucked into the storm of destruction. I thought this was amazing, it was the first time in about a month that i saw the light come on in that guys eyes. It was awesome! I told him that there is nothing that god wont do to help him overcome this and the abuse from his past. Told him that one day he will look back and know it wasnt his fault and that he is worth fighting for every moment of every day by the grace of god. I asked him if he believed and if he prayed he said¬† yes, so i asked him if he ever listened for direction, he said he didnt know how, i told him to be still and breathe, and ask for direction then stay focused on the direction that will come. I am not bragggin about this, I just was so happy that he got it if only for that hour he spent in my office., he didnt leave to go kill himself by a drink‚Ä¶, but staying to give himself a chance to live, to love, to carve out a direction for himself. He left my office and thanked me for all i did, i said hey ..its what people that care do. he has alot of work to do but sometimes the smallest of hope and faith can grow a tree as strong as oak. üôÇ thank you jesus!
¬†
on another note i started back to school tuesday and taking chemistry and speech, the speech isnt gonna be to bad because for some reason i dont shut up now‚Ä¶if i am quiet i am tired‚Ä¶.:) i will just do the best i can, i will do it:) this song is amazing in so many ways, we think of hate as the utmost insult to anyone. It is like a person being held under water and not being able to come up for air, that is the addiction holding someone down, so how can you tell me its about lack of willpower? I know so many that think ‚Ä¶why dont they just stop, or give up on the person due to getting worn down. I hear it on the other ends of phone calls that are made in my office, no one is to blame im not saying that, its just so sad to hear a mother or father cry begging the son/daughter to stay in treatment for a chance at life, while the addiction is holding the persons head down under water. This job has really taught me again sometime that i lost along the way, empathy. At my last job it was there in spurts, but for some reason I am at the beginning of their journey, like being reborn. I am just thankful enough that god can use me in the process is the simplest way i can put it. I know people that are losing¬† the battle to their addiction and withering away. I just am saying if you think you have a problem dont wait til you are drowning as your addiction is holding you down. I am just a simple man that was blessed in so many ways on this earth and finally like the sun going up in this picture at the back, I have risen and not looking back ever. I wont get arrogant, or forget, just use it as a teaching tool to give hope and faith. I dont regret any of it. It wasnt my fault and surely as a adult no longer the victim. Honesty and truth so long got those twisted. Honest is being open and not hidden from anything, truth is holding back and waiting til the right moment to tell. I choose honest today. oh well, i got a meeting at ten so just wanted to get on and unload some good stuff on my page‚Ä¶of hope and growth‚Ä¶oh thank you jesus! god bless you guys and have a great weekend!

Made to Worship (Live)
By Chris Tomlin

galatians 6:9
so dont get tired of doing whats good. Dont get discouraged and give up for we will reap a harvest of¬† blessing at the appropriate time.
galatians 3:11
consequently it is¬†clear that no one¬† can ever be right with God by trying to keep the law. For the scriptures say, ""it is through faith that a righteous person has life"".
¬†
Dear diary,
It is these two scriptures that used to keep me going back to square one so to speak, trying to live and be ""perfect"" under gods law, without having faith that he would do for me what i couldnt do for myself. I wanted to take god by the hand and lead him thru my day and say hey lord ill show you what i want YOU to see how I can run things. The first scrpture was and at times still is one that i do alot. Dont give up, which if you have ever been a addict, it comes wtih the territory. Giving up is what happens when life or people just dont move fast enough for us. I gave up on alot of things in my life at certain times because of this or that, and still was not certain why the ""blessings"" did not come. They were there all along, i was just going to fast to enjoy them and acknowledge the glory of god. I just wanted to get on and talk a little bout these two scriptures because this is what our sermon was on today at church.
I see many that fall short to the glory of our almighty, and first and foremost I fall short daily. I understand that if I just dont repeat the mistakes of the day, I have a chance to do it right the¬† next time tested. I have been going over my chemistry notes tonight for like two hours, and I am understanding them little by little. I was so freaked out last thursday in class because none of it made sense. I have to remind myself, that I have been taught how to do this stuff, in other classes, I just have to remember. I am taking alot of notes and have a ebook to study, so that helps alot!! I also have some people that have taken the class that have offered for tutoring. I am so blessed. This song i chose tonight describes it all. The sermon talked about dying daily to continue being reborn each day to be free from the bondage of the things we came up short with the day before. I will start to do this, i went back and read galatians tonight, and makes alot of sense. I am doing both studying my bible and studying for my classes. Both things that are going to give me a life more abundant. I am so grateful of all i have today. I havent really been down at all lately, i have moments of sad times, but nothing like i had in various parts of this diary. The confusion, the doubt, the questions are all having answers, in his time not martins. I must die inside to let god continue to guide me and live inside of me to direct me to good choices:)
see our god is great and graceful he used paul to spread the word after years paul killed and persecuted christians, now the same man that used to do that, is spreading the good news. Oh how the lord can use you and your experiences to show others in god we can do anything. Anything is possible for the glory of our savior. wow! isnt that great? I myself no longer lives but christ liveth in me‚Ä¶..do you hear that? in order to live again i had to be reborn, to die. , so that christ could live within me.
¬†
have a great night:) and may god bless those that seek the good news!‚Ä¶ask yourself this‚Ä¶are you still trying to be perfect and follow the law of moses or are you being lead by faith in our savior ‚Ä¶.amen.

Martin Phillips
Speech 1311
Informative
¬†
Goal is to inform.
At the end of the speech the audience will understand that addiction/relapse is more then a personal choice. 
¬†
I am creditable to speak on this topic because I have been a chemical dependency counselor for five years. 
¬†
The purpose of giving this speech is to educate my audience on the disease concept of addiction. Also my purpose is to inform my audience on the effects of not dealing with your feelings appropriately can lead to continual relapsing on chemicals to cope with the feelings.
¬†
Feelings: Is the emotional makeup that we all as humans have to deal with pleasure, excitement, danger, confusion, etc. 
¬†
These feelings are used to ‚Äútrigger‚Äô the disease concept of addiction. 
¬†¬†¬†¬† 
¬†¬†¬†¬† ¬†1. Feelings and 3 basic instincts.
¬†

As human beings we are programmed to deal with feelings on a basic level. Thus establishing 3 basic instincts to deal with our emotional state at any given time. 
One of these instincts is the social instinct which when used as its intended to be creates healthy relationships with people, places and things in our lives. When we are being lead by our feelings of restlessness or other negative feelings we react instead of thinking the outcome thru. This often times creates the need to be ‚Äúa part of ‚Äúa negative circle of people, places things. Instead of ‚Äúapart of‚Äù a positive set of people, places and things.
The security instinct when used appropriately creates the need to feel secure, safe, and stable. When used in a negative way it is just seeking a easy way out as fast as possible, as quick as possible. 
The sexual instinct when used appropriately causes reproduction to take place and humanity to continue. When used inappropriately it creates the need for lust or power over your negative feelings by the need for euphoria of a sexual act which may help you ‚Äúnot think about it‚Äù whatever you do not want to feel.
All these are ran in the circle by self will.

¬†
2. Emotional barometer
¬†

The emotional barometer acts as a ‚Äúpressure cooker‚Äù for the brain where all the feelings and emotions are looking to find a solution for. As you deal with this feelings and emotions inappropriately they create ‚Äúpressure‚Äù in the emotional barometer.
When you deal with a emotion with one of the three basic instincts or all at once, the pressure goes down. In time you run out of avenues to use the three basic instincts and thus the pressure just rises without a outlet. 
As this occurs we gain an idea from previous using drugs or alcohol. 

¬†
3. Mental Obsession
¬†

The mental obsession is defined as a thought overriding every other rational thought process. Once the pressure gets to this point in the cycle it is difficult at this point to turn back from using. 
Often time‚Äôs addicts think that at this point one drink or one drug will make the uncomfortable pressure go down, but instead it sets them off on the course for continual years of addiction.

¬†
<font face=""Time
s New Roman‚Äù size=‚Äù3‚Ä≥>4. At-ease stage
¬†

This is the first stage of abuse. Early in individuals drinking or drugging this is the scenario where you drink or drug until you felt out of control and you stopped. 
Often this is the first couple of times your body is exposed to a foreign chemical and builds up acetone to defend itself from it. Once the acetone level becomes high enough after numerous times of drinking or drugging this is called tolerance.
Tolerance is when you have built up so much acetone in the body that when you use chemicals it makes you feel in control and you continue on. A false sense of security that continues to bring the pressure down each time. 

¬†
5. Dis-ease stage
¬†

When you have developed a tolerance level so when you take that one drink or one drug you feel ‚Äúin control‚Äù and you continue until you realize the pressure has gone down in the emotional barometer. 
After you come down from the euphoria of the chemicals your body and mind have a physical allergy reaction to the detoxification of the chemicals in your body. These may include vomiting, sweating, shakes, tremors, diaherrea. 
This creates a phenomenon called craving. Craving is when your body or mind tells you that you need to use again so that you can beat the physical allergies. 
Once you develop the cravings and use again, you‚Äôre set on your well known spree. This is the point in your addictive behaviors and mentality that crimes occur, love ones are lost, or jobs terminated amongst other things. 
People go on the well known spree as long as they don‚Äôt face the next stage of the cycle of addiction. This stage is called the crisis stage. Once the addict faces a crisis they have two options a lot of times.
One to decide to change by finding new coping skills, different directions for their lives or developing a plan of action. The other choice is to act as if the crisis was not that important and continue not wanting to feel due to the sudden increase in pressure due to not using for a short period of time.

¬†
Conclusion: There is a way out of this vicious cycle of addiction. With the proper counseling, support groups, and continuum of sobriety the individual wanting help can change.
¬†
Finally in conclusion when you don‚Äôt deal with your feelings appropriately with other solutions the process of coping with drugs or alcohol is heightened. This may continue on for years to come if you don‚Äôt learn another way to function with your issues.

dear diary,
I woke up this morning at the same time as every morning. I have been sick the last weekend. Well, I took some nyquil to combat it and the nyquil just wiped out my antidepressant so been a lil out of it the last couple of days. I will be okay though. I have had so much to say but by the time i get here to write it down it is no longer around. I have noticed that alot of people at my job, and at school, in general are really scared of the economy, their futures. I dont want to think I live in denial of the situations but I just know that god has me and all that will be will. I try to tell them this and it just gets over looked like I am crazy or dont know what im talking about. I¬†picked this video because often times it seems like god isnt there or he isnt listening. I know different and life gets so fast that we replace prayer, meditation and listening or spending time with god with jobs, money, friends, people that we want to feel that void that only he can fill. I have really had a tough week but i know this too shall pass. I know where the answers are and it isnt in the world, isnt in all the things we as humans try to find it in. I¬†have a speech tommorow that has been in the back of my mind due to all the things that i struggle with still at times, like fear of judgement, fear of doing things correctly. I know I will be fine but at times I forget and just start listening to the devil and all his doubts that creep in my head. I dont struggle with addiction, or things that I once did for that I am thankful, as they say we are always a work in progress. 
all i can say is i love you jesus! good morning and thank you so much for allowing me to wake one more day! 
*pause*
I just finished reading psalms 40 and exactly what i needed to hear.
I will be good in your grace o father. Please hear me. Amen.

Just decided to come and write a lil bit this morning because I read so many peoples blogs or diary entries and so many in pain. Gods children in so much pain due to believing the thoughts or deceptions that encompass their thoughts or lives. It is not always true but a deception from the devil. Should I? what if? are questions I hear alot and at times ask myself‚Ä¶I had a bad week but it has turned out very blessed and for that I knew would happen. That is the difference then before in my life. I have tremendous faith in the unseen. I have no other choice. I know what living in pain, and suffereing is all about, but seriously life is to short to live one second in anguish or despair. When we turn to the world for our answers it will be temporary and often times come at a price. Who wants that? who needs to fill a void temporarily when jesus christ died for our sins and for our salvation? so many worry about never finding the one‚Ä¶instead of asking god for the one‚Ä¶so many worry about their weight, their blemishes, their finances, their lives in general‚Ä¶.fool you have such little faith‚Ä¶..its time to start waking up to the word, and this is strickly suggestion, because I know many will question me on verses and such, but I have read the bible just have not as much knowledge as I should. I thought I would come and write on this‚Ä¶get up and pray to the one that trully has the power to change all in your life. GOD lives and is waiting for you to join him ‚Ä¶to walk in the light not continue living in the darkness of humanity. He sent his only son to give us life¬† how great of love is that? ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.so this is your answer to the question who will love me? GOD and jesus christ thats who! its all you need‚Ä¶‚Ä¶! have a blessed day ya‚Äôll.!

1 Corinthians 13
1IF I [can] speak in the tongues of men and [even] of angels, but have not love (that reasoning, intentional, spiritual devotion such [a]as is inspired by God‚Äôs love for and in us), I am only a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal.
¬†¬†¬† 2And if I have prophetic powers ([b]the gift of interpreting the divine will and purpose), and understand all the secret truths and mysteries and possess all knowledge, and if I have [sufficient] faith so that I can remove mountains, but have not love (God‚Äôs love in me) I am nothing (a useless nobody).
¬†¬†¬† 3Even if I dole out all that I have [to the poor in providing] food, and if I surrender my body to be burned or [c] in order that I may glory, but have not love (God‚Äôs love in me), I gain nothing.
¬†¬†¬† 4Love endures long and is patient and kind; love never is envious nor boils over with jealousy, is not boastful or vainglorious, does not display itself haughtily.
¬†¬†¬† 5It is not conceited (arrogant and inflated with pride); it is not rude (unmannerly) and does not act unbecomingly. Love (God‚Äôs love in us) does not insist on its own rights or its own way, for it is not self-seeking; it is not touchy or fretful or resentful; it takes no account of the evil done to it [it pays no attention to a suffered wrong].
¬†¬†¬† 6It does not rejoice at injustice and unrighteousness, but rejoices when right and truth prevail.
¬†¬†¬† 7Love bears up under anything and everything that comes, is ever ready to believe the best of every person, its hopes are fadeless under all circumstances, and it endures everything [without weakening].
¬†¬†¬† 8Love never fails [never fades out or becomes obsolete or comes to an end]. As for prophecy ([d]the gift of interpreting the divine will and purpose), it will be fulfilled and pass away; as for tongues, they will be destroyed and cease; as for knowledge, it will pass away [it will lose its value and be superseded by truth].
¬†¬†¬† 9For our knowledge is fragmentary (incomplete and imperfect), and our prophecy (our teaching) is fragmentary (incomplete and imperfect).
¬†¬†¬† 10But when the complete and perfect (total) comes, the incomplete and imperfect will vanish away (become antiquated, void, and superseded).
¬†¬†¬† 11When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child; now that I have become a man, I am done with childish ways and have put them aside.
¬†¬†¬† 12For now we are looking in a mirror that gives only a dim (blurred) reflection [of reality as [e]in a riddle or enigma], but then [when perfection comes] we shall see in reality and face to face! Now I know in part (imperfectly), but then I shall know and understand [f]fully and clearly, even in the same manner as I have been [g]fully and clearly known and understood [[h]by God].
¬†¬†¬† 13And so faith, hope, love abide [faith‚Äìconviction and belief respecting man‚Äôs relation to God and divine things; hope‚Äìjoyful and confident expectation of eternal salvation; love‚Äìtrue affection for God and man, growing out of God‚Äôs love for and in us], these three; but the greatest of these is love.
Dear diary,
I¬†had to come and unload alot that keeps going round and round in my mind. I go back to this scripture in times of deep question or doubt, it really explains to me the true nature of life. Hope Love Faith‚Ä¶.the greatest of these is love. I¬†am not going to re-invent the wheel in this entry. I¬†just wanted to write on some recent events that are troubling my soul right now. My brother on saturday got a DWI and this is not his first but his second. I have been in turmoil about this because I¬†am having a internal battle with the counselor in me. It is not easy to be unemotional or not involved in the situation. If you think it is then please leave me some suggestion. Like i said it has been bothering me not being able to really be objective and unbiased. I¬†dont agree in drinking and driving not for one second. I¬†myself have done this many times and it is only by gods grace i was never killed or killed another or got a DWI. That being said, I¬†go back to the scripture and it talks about true love for self, and others. It does not say only love deeply when the situation meets your approval or withold love whenever you misbehave. I¬†read it as unconditional and forgiving of imperfection. I¬†know alot will debate this with me but you are free to. I¬†work with people that the whole world treats like a bag of trash that would be better off disposed of or someone elses problem. I¬†have gained alot of empathy along my journey and even though it is hard to regulate, in the past i had none. It was do this or that, and get what you get. It is never easy until you have it staring you in the face of someone you love. I¬†dont condone any of the behaviors what so ever, but we are inperfect and consequences should come harshly i agree. I¬†just dont get lost in the person that is obviously screaming in silance for help by acting out in so many terrible ways. I¬†have done that, I¬†have been so far on the other end of the spectrum. I am thankful for my god who has the ability to see beyond all I¬†have done for the life he has set for me. I¬†am just emptying my head and not meaning any of this to be concrete because its flowing out of my head as fast as i can write. I took a quiz today and i failed it. I¬†have a paper due next fri and soooo much to do between now and then, not enuff time in the day for all that needs to be priority. So many people a
re quitting here at my job, due to lack of money, lack of promotions, lack of alot that could be overlooked or accepted but isnt. I¬†wont quit because the insurance i have is great, paid for all my doctors bills when i was in the hospital. I¬†am trully blessed more then i am cursed ‚Ä¶.thats why when it happens I¬†get thrown back a lil going what was that?? I will keep goin forward and keep making my relationship with my savior stronger and stronger. Without him I¬†would be in such a place that has been wrote about in earlier entries. I am craving something sweet and wish there was a candy machine or something to grab really quick. I feel lots better after writeing on this stuff down. I¬†have finally realized that when things go goood my pattern has always been to destroy the goodness, well i dont have the energy or the need to do that anymore. I¬†want great things to happen in my life, I¬†just am still growing as a man that my lord wants me to be. I am not without fault mind you, but i know one day i will answer for those things. I am thankful for one more day on this earth, to prepare for my journey to heaven. I¬†am signin off now‚Ä¶.god bless*

I just saw this video and thought wow! it goes along with the sermon i heard yesterday, seeing that this next weekend is easter sunday. I have missed my father for alot of years, and in this i mean my lord and savior., not my earthly dad. I never really knew the earthly ones, and for alot of years for that felt like i wasnt worth loving or caring for. Since being a born again christian, I understand that the lord is the only father i need and gives me more then my heart could ever hold. I still have bad days, have days when all falls apart in front of my eyes, but you know what? It is all worth it because without that I would not know the love my lord gives me! I see people in my life struggle with addiction struggle with being obedient. Those two things were once my vices also so I¬†know the path well. I know that in gods time all will be made whole for these people i love. It had to happen that way for me, and it still is a journey that I embrace daily. I hope that anyone who reads this finds the glory my god gives to me daily, in the smile of a child the smells of the smallest flowers, the trees that are so green. For that amongst other things I am so thankful. Today has been a good day, just was long and tedious, I am glad its time to go to bed, I¬†enjoy that time more then ever. LOL. I just thought I would get on here and write cause after all ‚Ä¶this has been my hollow ground for so many years. Going on seven years, wow‚Ä¶how time flys. I have a speech due on friday about persuation on a topic, i picked the dangers in texting while driving. It is funny the more you live by obedience and not of the world the more your eyes open to the things that have been hazerdous all along. I am gonna go read out of my bible..night all‚Ä¶and god bless you all!

Hey diary,
I thought I¬†would take a minute and come and write because it has been aching at me tremendously. I¬†am at work and like many of you know I¬†work with the afflicted. I¬†say that not to demean or judge but to letcha know these individuals are homeless, faithless, and often times walking dead. I can relate to this in more ways then one. I have this client right now that is like looking in the mirror. It is not to the point it is ineffective for me to counsel him, just see alot of the ""old"" me in him. Woe is me No one cares, what if it fails, but‚Ä¶but‚Ä¶but‚Ä¶it never happens for me, you promised‚Ä¶‚Ä¶on and on. I¬†am being stearn with him, and he calls his behavior assertive, it is surely aggressive. There is alot of anger and alot of blaming. I¬†wonder alot of times like I¬†have heard so many times before, when the child is ready ‚Ä¶then change occurs. I cant work on his recovery or lack of harder then he is willing to. I¬†have to keep a safe distance and know that I¬†am not the sick¬† one, he is needing something he wants me to do for him, and when it fails he can blame me. I¬†wont do it and wont be feeding into it either. I¬†really think he has burned literally every bridge that has been there for him, hell i understand that more then anyone, I¬†myself did the same thing. I¬†wil continue to pray and keep this out of my hands because I¬†cant change it, nor can i fix it.I am gettin back to work, just took a minute to¬†vent. Or reflect‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.thank you jesus for takin me out of that mess‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..when he is ready you will do the same for him. amen.

You know im sittin here so thankful with all that the lord has laid on my heart and in my life. I went to a great service today and have been the last three weeks so we are studying the story of jesus. It is called vintage jesus. I picked these songs because it touches me deeply to feel the love and peace i feel when i hear this played. I have alot to worry about but i just lay it in front of the cross. I made my god so little in the past and know he is enough for every area of my life. I feel my health getting better. I am losing weight slowly but feeling healthier. I still have people around me that are struggling but its not my fight. I cant do anything my god can when he feels the time is ready. I lay it all before him. I see such sadness, such pain, but you know‚Ä¶we choose where we want to be dont we? its not easy to get out of that rut¬† but it can be done and what better way to do it then give your life over to the love of god and his son jesus christ! glory be to the king of kings! I¬†heard today that 39% of christians believed that jesus sinned while on the earth, isnt that insane to think that you believe your redeemer was earthly as we are? sad‚Ä¶and to think that everyone is a ""christian"" these days, its easy to be mislead by propaganda and falsehood. I¬†guess im just gettin older cause I see life thru different eyes and different thoughts. I am wide awake and know that god is so glorious and great! I think i will go outside for a bit and talk to my savior‚Ä¶.i can only imagine‚Ä¶how great it will be when i get to heaven:)¬† my soul has been fed and there are many that try to tear that down lately‚Ä¶.i will be side by side with the one that is big nuff to get me thru the toughest storms and turbulations.I am gonna go for now‚Ä¶.thank you to the ones that got the seed planted‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..love you!

Diary hi, 
It is me your long lost friend. I¬†have not written in here in forever and I¬†dont have any excuses or reason not to. I¬†decided to come and write in here today because something happend last night at work that trully moved me. 
I¬†did my first intervention ..yah just like you see on a$e. It was over the phone though. You say what is so great bout that martin? well, it was devastating to listen to people that loved this guy so much ‚Ä¶had to say goodbye to him and his addiction for their own sanity. He started the thing out knowing something was going down, just didnt know what? He was listening to his dad talk, nothing..listening to his aunt talk, nothing..then his mother‚Ä¶nothing. Then his fiance‚Äô got on the phone and said "" I am leaving you and your lies, I am flying back home"". He broke!~you could see the reality soak in all his bones, he slumped down and started crying. It was so hard to watch this because any of you that have read my diary., well i have been there not necessarily in a room , but have heard we need to let you go to save ourselves from this disease that is killing us also. I¬†finally got it last night, not that i am still in my addiction or anything near what i was doing, but it hit me straight in the face. The emotions on the other end, the anger, the disappointment, the fear, the truth, the honesty, and strength could only come from god. I¬†talked to this young man after the phone call ended and shared my story, because he asked me for it. I¬†told him how i too went thru life taking and lying about everything, and how i put people, on pedestals, instead of letting them walk beside me. He kept crying, and he kept asking me, martin will it all come back will it ever come back? I told him that his life would if he worked with people and took direction. I¬†asked him if he was a believer, and he said yes. I¬†told him that it did come back in my life for a minute then‚Ä¶I¬†destroyed it for good:(¬†i said at that point I¬†had no where to go but to god, and finally really accept him as my savior. I¬†told him that I¬†got baptized a year ago, and it helped so much with the filth, the anger, the denial, the pain, the fear, the lost feelings, and so on. He asked me if we baptize there where i work. I told him no, but as he continues going on in his journey, he can go and get it done if that is what he chooses. I¬†was so in awe of god working in that room. He asked me if i was tellin him this because its my job or because i am paid to do it. I¬†told him I¬†love people, and want them to see the glory that god has for them, and finally get the addiction (monkey) off their backs. No other reason, no self gratification. He kept talking to me before i left and he would cycle from hope to despair to lost. I¬†saw all these feelings in this guy., before it would have been taking me down also, but i am stronger now to help others instead of just identifying with their pain, i actually belive there is a way out. I¬†will be going back to work here in a bit. I¬†work on the front lines, and i see and hear such tragedy daily, and i want to try harder then i remember i am not god, but i can be a voice for god. I¬†didnt share this with you guys to boast, but to remember when times get tough and i want to just quit, one person at a time, and if one gets it , it can trigger the effect of many getting well. He hugged me¬† before he left and said thank you martin so much‚Ä¶.the thing about this whole story is i did two interventions yesterday, this one and the other guy are continuing their walk in sobriety, with a little help from god. Jesus i am understanding. I¬†at times struggle with my calling, but yesterday i walked outside and sat there for a bit, and thanked god for that opportunity to help another in pain. I¬†got into this as a chance to dress up‚Ä¶.and found out along the way, I¬†have something to give‚Ä¶.and its okay not to receive‚Ä¶but to watch someone grow again. I¬†love you jesus, I¬†have lost many due to this awful disease and still wonder what if? but everything happens for a reason. I see how your work daily helps so many so how could i argue with that? to the ones that no longer talk to me or are in my life i love you and trully thank you for all that you have said to me, it pulls me thru most nights when i want to give up. Do they come back martin? do they? Yes they never left you ‚Ä¶their love is rooted deep inside. I¬†have had thoughts of that time when all that happend to me, how could you not miss them also? everyday ‚Ä¶.once you tasted water how can you ever go back to wine? i finally found out what my issue is, it is puttin the earth before god, and all his goodness, i want to help so many and leave myself empty. Today is thursday and they are always tough i just ask for some prayers for my sanity and strength‚Ä¶i love you all even those that will never know, life is to short to hold that back, well, just wanted to come share this, not in arrogance but to show anyone that reads there is hope.., hope that it does come back the relationship with god you lost along time ago, and with that everything else puts itself in place., may you have nothing but joy on your journey once that happens. gotta get back to work, much love and hugs‚Ä¶.always Martin.

¬†ps‚Ä¶congratulations britt on all you have become always knew you could and would do it!~ love you sister‚Ä¶.keep going on~god bless.

hello diary,
I just got on here to write a lil bit and to empty my head before i go to bed. I¬†was thinking of my climb these last five years. I¬†didnt do it alone, and along the way it went soooo fast. I get my license in september and I just recently got a new job in a outpatient setting again. It is not as intense as any job that I¬†have had these five years. The supervisor that hired me is a christian which made the decision to go tons easier. He asked me somethings about me and without hesitation I answered I am a christian!~ dont know if that is something you say in a interview but I dont care anymore. For years i searched and seeked the lord and my place in the world. Like my last entry stated I¬†have had some thoughts that never go away, and a voice that tells me the same thing.¬† I never heard the lord for alot of years, and when i did i would still go against his will for me. I¬†was talking with a friend of mine just a few minutes ago and we were talking about god. Not the questions but the certainty of the truth. I have only had a handful of people in my life at any given time talk about god without shame, debate, or in hidden. It is amazing how many do not talk about god‚Ä¶but profess their christianity. I¬†heard a sermon on my way home, about being luke warm, and how to be more choosey,dont know if that is even a correct way to say it. lol. But the messege is true about not yoking yourself up with non-christians in all you do in life. I¬†struggled with this also and at times want to embrace the weak,lost, etc‚Ä¶but i have to remind myself i can have empathy and compassion, but I¬†am not god. I¬†feel really good right now, I go see my doctor in the morning to get a refill on some medication I¬†need for blood pressure and mental wellness. I am just relecting on my life, and how far I¬†have came, so many told me i could and would do this, no doubt~they were right and saw lots in me that i never knew was possible ‚Ä¶.man i miss them‚Ä¶.that is one reason for the song, sometimes to hang on you have to let go, doesnt mean you quit loving‚Ä¶i have been told. Its never easy because in my mind it still gets a lil twisted. I¬†wrote lots of being single and hating it, but you know‚Ä¶its worth it. Every step every moment‚Ä¶.has taught me about life and true value. I am single and know in my mind, its gods will if that changes or not. 
¬†this song started alot in my life and by my life i mean the part that really was my preparing for this journey, i didnt know or want to be sent then, not knowing what it ment to be obedient or how to worship someone i didnt even know. if you listen to the words‚Ä¶..UNASHAMED~ send me lord‚Ä¶I dont know if i really have a point tonight but i feel all this going on inside of me and have had certain people in my head lately, and they dont go away. I¬†know for certain even on my worst days on this earth, I¬†am loved because ‚Ä¶god does~ however could that be wrong?
¬†as we walk further down the journey‚Ä¶i have seen these missing pages he is talkin about‚Ä¶the addiction the lost, the ones that are the ones society doesnt want and most of all the ones that are walking dead and need a seed to restart their lives. I pray for them, and sooo many never see the part of man when he is homeless, addicted and half dead. Its not a sight for alot to be able to take and pulls at you ‚Ä¶but like this song says‚Ä¶there is one that one is god~ update on that guy from the previous entry: he went into our residential program and is doing great the last i heard~! thank you jesus for your grace and mercy are unmatched to anything this earth possesses. if your lost‚Ä¶if you are angry‚Ä¶if you are arrogant ‚Ä¶or selfserving‚Ä¶‚Ä¶it all comes to a head one day and the lord will be there waiting as he always has to hold you, comfort you, and bring you back home.., he loves his children‚Ä¶‚Ä¶more then we know‚Ä¶i guess im goin to bed now, long day tommorow ,
¬† yup‚Ä¶.you kids behave as someone used to always tell me‚Ä¶..no words were more heartfelt‚Ä¶.night all*

i found this and im about to start a new job where i have fridays saturdays and sundays off‚Ä¶.i am excited i found a meeting locally and its on friday night!..i cant wait i really cant. I¬†need alot of healing from my job, the hangups i still have, and just jump deep in recovery with all i am, i am feeding my soul, why stop? i cant save anyone but myself and for sooooooooo long have tried and given up. I encourage anyone that is burned out on alcoholics anonymous‚Ä¶or other twelve step groups to give this a try, it looks like a awesome program~! i cant wait‚Ä¶.another video‚Ä¶for hope and love‚Ä¶.god bless*

Dear diary,
I¬†am awake because as soon as i got home from my new job I was home alone, and my mind started racing the old thoughts, the old triggers. But something is different tonight and has been for a while now. I have been praying daily and reading my bible more. Like this song says‚Ä¶and this movie!~ omg!~ first time I have ever seen it. I¬†have wanted to see it for ever. just finished it, and in total awe. I have been going thru some earthly battles but I¬†am not repeating past behaviors. I started my first celebrate recovery meeting last friday night and i cant wait to go tommorow night. You know I¬†always felt ashamed of my vices and addictions. I¬†feel so safe and in gods hands in there. NO judgement no harsh words, only gods love and grace. I¬†was saying I could be doing what i have always done tonight at this time of night, after all for years i thought i am alone, no one knows, and then feel shame and guilt. I havent missed a service in three weeks. For a month i slipped off and didnt go, always found a more important reason to sleep in, or just not wanting to go. I¬†have a new job, and everything about it is spirtitual. My supervisor is a very godly man and has high hopes for me and wants to be my mentor for success. I used to just see how i could use things up and not take the time to give anything. lazy and not obedient. I¬†am putting my heart and love for the lord into this job. Another thing that is different. I¬†am not doing the work, but actually letting god. It is so much easier that way. I¬†am not getting on here to boast but to be thankful for all the blessings I¬†have received‚Ä¶..and still holding on to my faith while tribulation is all around me. I¬†stood my ground with some of my love ones and wont accept them killing themselves and all they encounter ‚Ä¶.if they want to do that, they can do it alone. I set that boundary and wont budge. I¬†am about to go to bed, but i know one thing for sure. When you are living for the lord the enemy constantly lurks to steal your faith and grace. I¬†am aware of that and I¬†wont let it happen because i give that fight up to god. My god‚Ä¶.not that god i created for years. He said something in this movie that hit me hardddd‚Ä¶.""I¬†never knew what true love was, and how could i give you something i didnt possess"". totally me‚Ä¶..and the one that got away but planted the seed‚Ä¶..i am learning and living love‚Ä¶.to all those that i dont see but still pray for me god bless you and hope your in great health and mind. Love you all, Martin

Good evening diary,
I just got back from CR meeting and this is my second meeting. I declared my want to give up sexual sin tonight. I¬†spoke on certain things that I have kept in since I¬†quit counseling with barbara my therapist. I feel good and not trying to over think what i did or just sabatage it. I got a call from a old old friend whom i grew up with. He is living in denton and has for about six years he says. Another mutual friend of ours gave him my number and it was just a shock! I¬†am happy we talked and caught up, we may get together this weekend or next depending on how things work out. I am growing internally and i know i always say that, but its a different growth not a self serving growth. I feel driven to change in gods will for me not martins will or interpetation‚Ä¶it feels so good right now and not the pink cloud of early recovery, its real its attached to my heart. Jesus i love you dear father, thanks for bringing understanding in my heart and life about the truth ‚Ä¶and taking me on your path not the continuem of my own‚Ä¶.

421,https://www.opendiary.com/m/rebornsoldier/which-jesus-do-you-follow-4538044/,2009-07-31,which jesus do you follow?,"
this song is so true, alot of times we claim to be christians but look so much like the world, whether we try to fight in and sell ourselves short due to the pressures of acceptance and even mistake love for other things. It was a huge sacrafice for jesus to die for all of our sins, and yet so many ""claim"" to know him but really dont have a clue, and that is not judgement it is truth. MAny are going to hell, thinking the masses of accumation we aquire on this planet is going to define us when its time to face eternity. I can speak like this because friends i have lived life to excess and without faith alot of years, and still struggle with issues, but one thing for sure I know without jesus in my life i could not have the energy to go one more day on most of my daily issues. I hope that if you dont know jesus, ask me ill tell you whom he is. Quit going one more second in pain, despair, and even numbness. The enemy wants this‚Ä¶‚Ä¶not my jesus he wants your life to be abundant and full of grace.HAve a great saturday you guys‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.stay dry.
Which Jesus do you follow?
Which Jesus do you serve?
If Ephesians says to imitate Christ
Then why do you look so much like the world?
Cause my Jesus bled and died
He spent His time with thieves and liars
He loved the poor and accosted the arrogant
So which one do you want to be?
Blessed are the poor in spirit
Or do we pray to be blessed with the wealth of this land
Blessed are they that hunger and thirst for righteousness
Or do we ache for another taste of this world of shifting sand
Cause my Jesus bled and died for my sins
He spent His time with thieves and sluts and liars
He loved the poor and accosted the rich
So which one do you want to be?
Who is this that you follow
This picture of the American dream
If Jesus was here would you walk right by on the other side or fall down and worship at His holy feet
Pretty blue eyes and curly brown hair and a clear complexion
Is how you see Him as He dies for Your sins
But the Word says He was battered and scarred
Or did you miss that part
Sometimes I doubt we‚Äôd recognize Him
Cause my Jesus bled and died
He spent His time with thieves and the least of these
He loved the poor and accosted the comfortable
So which one do you want to be?
Cause my Jesus would never be accepted in my church
The blood and dirt on His feet might stain the carpet
But He reaches for the hurting and despises the proud
I think He‚Äôd prefer Beale St. to the stained glass crowd
And I know that He can hear me if I cry out loud
I want to be like my Jesus!
I want to be like my Jesus!
I want to be like my Jesus!
I want to be like my Jesus!
Not a posterchild for American prosperity, but like my Jesus
You see I‚Äôm tired of living for success and popularity
I want to be like my Jesus but I‚Äôm not sure what that means to be like You Jesus
Cause You said to live like You, love like You but then You died for me
Can I be like You Jesus?
I want to be like you Jesus!
I want to be like my Jesus!

Dear diary,
sitting here just thinking bout life and how it has lead me to this point. I have been praying for direction and i have been convicted in alot of areas and i usually dont listen
to god. I do my own thing and go my own direction. I¬†have been convicted to go home. I m iss my neice,and nephews. Let me rewind to 2000 when i started this back and forth journey from san angelo to the dfw area. I would run from one to the other then finally settled here. I¬†am not running anymore. It is to much up here and just to fast and not personal at all. I¬†am older and miss the small area feel. San angelo is not little by no means. I have friends there and lots of memories, good bad indifferent. I will get my license in september and just save up to go back. I¬†will buy a house there and make it my home for good. I¬†am tired of wandering from place to place just wanting to always make it what i want, well the lord is in control and i feel in my heart that is my calling to go back. I¬†will pray on it and see where it leads me. I wil miss the people i have met up here but really never ever really call them close friends just aquaintances. I¬†spend alot of time alone and at least down there i can go to the lake like i used to so many years ago and just chill without the fear of this or that. I moved back here the last time in hope of making a failed relationship work or to at least try. It has long faded and so have the people that were in that era, I¬†miss them and wish everyone well, time leaves you behind and so do people once the closeness stops. I started my journey years ago in sanangelo and thus will return to make it my adult home. I am no longer a kid wanting more, but a adult seeking to serve. I will be successful with gods help and his son jesus driving my will. I love so many but yet am so alone people wise. I¬†will keep the diary posted. I will pray for guidance and direction‚Ä¶..not go on impulse. 

you can wander away from the area you were born in search of this or that, but you eventually find your way back. ‚Ä¶.with so much happiness and serenity to be able to be free and safe. 

god bless‚Ä¶til next time‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶god bless:)

hello diary/journal,
I am sitting here needing to vent before i go into group. I¬†hate chase bank‚Ä¶i have had nothing but problems with them
since switching to them a month ago! my bank was bought out and had no real choice. I woke up this morning as i do 
every morning and check my balance. I¬†had money to hold me over til i get paid on the thirty first. It was in negative standing 
because of a withdrawel the bank had taken and placed in my other account ‚Ä¶that would have been all fine but the other account
is overdrawn due to some automated withdrawels that hit it to early and caused all kinds of havoc. I have been talking to the chase
representatives daily about this. I was livid~then i call chase and get to illegal sounding people on the other end that obviously had 
no time for my problem and hung up on me! i was driving to work at this point and was just all i could do to pull what little hair i had out of 
my head. I¬†am besides myself and not really sure whats going on at this point. i finally get someone that listens and doesnt hang up on me
and even though it was the same outcome, at least this person spoke english and knew how to handle the issue‚Ä¶.he listened! I¬†take full 
responsibility for all that has gone on with this account but fear is a dreadful thing especially when its all the money you have for a week and a
half and your tank is on less then a fourth of a tank. INstantly all the past mistakes about finances creeped in and i just prayed and asked god
why ‚Ä¶.what is it that im not doing that keeps me in this rut im in‚Ä¶.i dont drink anymore i dont abuse women, i dont do anything that i once called
normal, and still i wonder what it is that he is trying to show me i need to clean up. I¬†have a new job and its great, but i havent really gotten to 
reap the benefits of it due to early paychecks, mistaken checks placed in wrong accounts, and having to pay back half my check til after the 31st 
yah fun times. I am done i am thru‚Ä¶..with what i dont know all i know its to much for me to keep because it is choking the life out of me. I¬†dont have a iden
of what im gonna do, ‚Ä¶just keeping it right in front of me. u dont realize how difficult that is for some one who is a controlling person like myself. I¬†am
holding on one second at a time‚Ä¶literally‚Ä¶i had to write before group cause hey this is all i have that will listen to crap like this anymore. its almost time

hey diary,
It is three thirty and im wide awake. I am just sitting here listening to this song and thought hey havent really written lately. I¬†have had a busy last couple of months. 
I tested last weekend for my lcdc licensure. It has been five years since I¬†started and looking back thru the years, like this song says I¬†was just passing thru not real 
certain where I¬†was going and really where my life began and where my job ended. I¬†have made lots of mistakes in life but hey we are all human and if it wasnt for 
the mistakes then there would be no growth. As the test was handed out on friday I¬†had a calmness I¬†cant explain. I¬†just sat there with the answers just falling off the 
page literally. Saturday was a different scenerio. The oral exam I studied for like the past six months on, and when I got in there my mind just went blank, turned off
if you will but I¬†took a deep breath and went at it with all I¬†had that morning. I walked out thinking omy goodness I¬†just let me career go down the drain in forty five minutes
because honestly I¬†didnt remember anything the whole time just knew my mouth was moving and words were coming out lol. I got home and went over my notes and realized
that all i had rehearsed I¬†stated. I¬†felt a little better seeing that. To say the least it was not the smoothest prettiest moment of public speaking i have ever encountered. I will do fine and like what i have been holding on to lately, if its gods will it will be or he will open another door for me to go thru. Another thing that has happend lately is that they fired a counselor at my job just a month and two weeks or actually last tuesday. So once again I am the lone guy, I dont know if it is that I¬†do such a good job or that it is a learning experience, whatever it is, it is just tiresome. I¬†am not depressed, just a lil wound tight.¬† I¬†really didnt get much of a weekend last weekend and felt it this week have been mentally exhausted since tuesday. One thing these five years have shown me is the ups and downs of self destruction and set backs. I¬†am continueing to prepare daily for that license that is either on its way or not. I¬†will be ready to keep going either way. I started my internship in west texas and met a woman out there that set all my learning in motion. She has since opened up her own practice and it is like one of the most successful treatment centers in west texas. She still keeps in contact and keeps telling me every conversation"" martin im gonna be contacting you and making a offer"". Those words scare me and excite me at the same time, because that area holds so many ups and downs and if you know anything about being a addict which obviously i am, old areas can trigger you faster then anything. I¬†have been starting to pray on this. I¬†want to go, but just dont know if it is where i would be able to give my best there. only god knows:) Preparation for your destiny even if you dont know or want to do what you are doing ‚Ä¶.all goes away when you quit fighting god. I¬†have since and i¬†guess really the last couple of days before my test‚Ä¶i just told god..its in your hands if you want me to be a licensed counselor then you will make a way, because honestly there has been times I¬†wanted to just walk away and quit, and kept at it. i¬†have doubted alot of decisions, and had lots of regret, but i can tell you‚Ä¶.at this moment‚Ä¶.because really that is all that matters‚Ä¶, im at peace no matter how untired i am lol. I¬†just turned 38..years old‚Ä¶which isnt to old, but isnt that young anymore‚Ä¶, and i can finally say‚Ä¶.i am okay with martin today‚Ä¶and know i cant save those that dont want to be approached. Letting go‚Ä¶of thoughts of insanity and thoughts of self doubt have been my demons for a lot of years.., and continueing to help those that all they want to do is use me‚Ä¶, or abuse me. its not worth that or any amount of lonliness that should ever take anyone there especially myself. I am just calming down the more i write‚Ä¶lol, wow what a epiphany. I used to work nights as a technician in a treatment center and used to wonder if this moment would ever be here‚Ä¶.and it is finally here. I¬†will be able to sign martin phillips lcdc., that is a completion that i can be proud of, and brings tears to my eyes‚Ä¶.this road has been rough, has had lots of bad turns, but it has ironed itself out and has been a steady continuem for a couple of months now., i have been blessed in more ways then i can ever just write about.., i am not gonna get on here and get all self righteous, no need for it. I¬†wont get on here and tell you how much different i am then last week, because really we grow or regress daily so its a continuem of‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.i am thankful i am alive at 38, i have a job, i have wonderful people in my life that love me and those that i havent burnt those bridges still talk to me. I¬†understand something and it really compounded tonight in my group that it doesnt matter how much knowledge you have on something if you lose your temper or fall into the trap of getting into a power struggle with anyone‚Ä¶as in life..you always lose¬† . It has taken me years to understand that. without love in it, its a empty plate of nothing. I think im gonna try and get some sleep‚Ä¶.to those that have stuck with me in all my accomplishments as well as my failures‚Ä¶thank you. This license is a piece of you as well‚Ä¶.may god bless you always and know that there really is no mistakes, just our own perception of timing lol‚Ä¶..goodnight ya‚Äôll‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.

427,https://www.opendiary.com/m/rebornsoldier/all-or-nothing-mentality-4538050/,2009-10-23,all or nothing mentality,"
¬†hey diary,
whats up it is saturday night and sitting at home just not doing alot. I tried to go back and read some of the entries at the
beginning and just couldnt go after like six entries. i have put those times behind me and all those negative thoughts for
the most part to rest. i was so unhappy and sad, angry that i sounded in my thoughts just as my clients do. nothing is¬†
ever right, no one cares, its all someone elses fault. wow., i cant stand that way of thinking now and it is just aggravating
to hear it. its like saying you dont have a way out or a choice and as well all know‚Ä¶we all have choices. It is just sinking in
that i am a liscensed counselor. i have thought in the mentality for a couple of years now that i was in my mind, but its reality
now and just a pass to keep going forward and continue to plant seeds in the mind of the afflicted and lost.¬†
thinking back on this road it makes me remember how sick i was and how much i have grown amidst so many giving up
on me and even walking off due to my toxicity. i knew somehow i wanted this and its finally here. i have the car i wanted¬†
the job i never wanted but have grown to love. i have a life that i never knew existed. the person i was reading on is me and
at a very sick time in my life. i am so grateful to the glory of the god of my understanding he delivered me from the ashes of
darkness and restored my soul with love and grace. jeremiah 33:3 call to me and i will answer. there has been alot of days
and nights i was blowing gods phone up and didnt think i would ever get thru, then i got out of the way and he was always on
time. I am just sitting here reminiscing to a point, a gauge of progression which i never want to take to often because it causes
me to get cocky arrogant, but i am not doing that right now just like i said relaxing and enjoying my night.
I noticed in some entries the desperaty of my heart screaming out‚Ä¶for what i didnt know, and i surely didnt know how to treat it
once i got it. so childish, and those ways are behind me ‚Ä¶.take tonight for instance i had friends call me up wanting me to go¬†
out and celebrate my big accomplishment at a bar. I have alot of clean time and not been drinking i dont even like that environment
anymore at ALL. People dont understand when you just go against all that is normal. i used to run from it and try to clone myself into
what everyone wanted or thought i should ¬†be. i am at a age where i dont really care peoples perception anymore. i really dont as long
as i am not hurting anyone intentionally who cares what you think about me. I wrote in my previous entry about being happy with a woman
in my life that is true but one thing i have also realized its not about what she brings but how much we give to god. i have placed lots of
things in front of females before relationships, friendships‚Ä¶.and always lost them then gave myself the reason to do this or that. I know better
and once you learn something you cant claim ignorance. shelley is a wonderful person with a kind heart. She teaches kindergarten and it
is exactly what is suited to her personality. She is very special to me.¬†
Once fear is gone then life begins. i have realized that life is to short to carry torches of guilt/shame and regret towards a single soul
much less yourself. it is what it is. its those that are lost that worry bout this or that, try to control this or that, measure sobriety by days
instead of measuring steps the person is taking to giving his/her life to the lord. i told my clients the other day that all the sobriety and
numbered days dont mean anything if you arent walking with god every step. you would be so surprised how many think that all it takes
is to pray a lil, meditate a lil, and not drink for the moment and think life will never go back to the way it was. I thought that for so long and¬†
i share my struggles and also give them hope that life does get better and no matter how others judge your progression its your own
candle you need to keep lit., only god truelly matters humans come and go so their words can fall to the ground on their measurement
or regression of this or that.¬†
i have been listening to this guy alot lately and listen to his sermons on his website
there are so many things that he speaks on that is life changing. i am getting sleepy¬†
just wanted to come and share some thoughts i haven written in forever. i am humble
i am saved, i am jesus‚Äôs son, i will be a survivor of this earth as long as i listen¬†
and be obedient. may you guys find god today if you dont know him‚Ä¶let the fear go,
let the silly questions that keep you from restoration of your life and your heart. god bless you all‚Ä¶night

I¬†saw this posted and decided to write on it underneath‚Ä¶just a lil time to relect on what i have learned on the subject.
is wondering why do we adore who ignores us, Ignore who adores us, Love who hurts us and Hurts who love us?
This simple statement got me thinking of so much this early hour of the day. It represents almost 50% I would say of all relationships of any kind. It is codependency at its finest or a seekers recipe for disaster. Its like this, you have a loving mother who represents(love) a authoritative father who represents(absent love) and you the one who wants what you cant have ie. dads love.You may feel betrayed by mom for staying with the unloving father figure so the distrust of real love begins. So that one thing you want the most is warped and represented by someone or something you dont trust due to betrayal of subjecting you to it, and having to earn it begins or ie‚Ä¶the chase. Or it could be vice versa, either way when you go thru life there must be represented in every relationship you possess a dynamic of three or more depending how good you are at juggling people. Get the point? the re-enactment of previous behaviors programming that come out in future relationships without being conscious of it just a torrential recipe for disaster which allows you to be the martyr in the end. Woe is me, no one will ever, i will always be, why not me etc. Lets take a starting of a new love, since you are seeking the chase, etc‚Ä¶you find someone that is absent, abrasive, unattainable, and if you are missing that in your earlier programming you are hooked ‚Ä¶ie the missing piece of all your existence‚Ä¶ soul mate ultimate love etc. IT is unattainable and thus deserves more time, more attention, the chase is bigger, being translated in the unhealthy brain as worth more love ‚Ä¶thus giving the brain a bigger high because ""fixing"" another is the ultimate payoff. Euphoria right? But remember the earlier statement of the authoritative father figure‚Ä¶.now without knowing it this new love interest has started to represent a person in your past that you could not somehow break thru to love, and the more you try to change this in the new relationship you fail miserbly and thus self distruct, and try harder to no avail. Lets get back to where mom plays a role, she represented real love but to the unfocused this was not a challenge thus not needing to be changed‚Ä¶kinda like saying i have that love it isnt the love that i see love as being and i dont need to work for it therefore its not real or unblemished so that if touched it would all of a sudden represent broken and throwing this dynamic out the window, because you cant have two broken representations of love otherwise you would be so tired and wore out from trying to fix both the payoff would not be as desirable as the love/hate relationship. Many times people talk about the ""bad boy"" bad girl"" dynamic in this way, men want the unattainable woman to ""play"" with but desire the ""trophy"" wife at home. If you have it you dont want it, dont have it you desire it like a drug, the forbidden fruit if you will. So you hook up with a loveless individual and spend the rest of your time in euphoria because they are broken unable to be fixable because you cant ever change another in desire to somehow unconciously gain a love from a earlier representation ie dad., which never happens or it does for a while then it starts to not represent dad anymore, if loves you back then its mom, where it is a given ‚Ä¶not representing a challenge anymore, thus losing interest in you. Want love but it has to be on your terms, not the terms of the automatic dynamic of two healthy people. Attraction is misconstrued by these individuals and they attach quickly. So without the three person dynamic they feel lost, so if they have the loveless they seek out the love to make it somehow balanced, the one that can give love automatically then changes to take on the abusers behaviors, such as being distant when being scorned or ignored to get the other to ""chase"" them into coming back equalling ‚Äòthey love me more"" look how hard they are trying to get me back‚Ä¶.then you come back and they lose interest due to it just being a game of control/power. The whole time being oblivious to this game your playing with others and your own emotions. To you its just another part of your world that was ""never ment to be"" if you do end up alone with just the one that trully loves you..ie. mom‚Ä¶without the broken father figure there is no true definition for living in this persons eyes. so you set out hunting or preying until you find a unattainable male or female to replace the one that wised up and got out of this dynamic of dysfunction. The whole time on the other end there is the one that is trying to ""love"" you back to health waiting around, pining, while you take them for granted, lean on them, but never wanting to get to close because if you do, real love may get you and then you wont be in control anymore because people know that the real thing is uncontrollable and not able to be tamed. Therefore giving the power/control seeker no real defintiion or power in the situation. It goes on and on and on until you realize this is the cycle you have created for yourself and others, and since there are people that are truelly healthy hopefully they disconnect themselves when they realize they are in this cycle, otherwise they are programmed to become another pawn in the game of hide and seek the heart. It is a deadly game, thats why you have stalkers, fatal attractions etc‚Ä¶.not really being in love for the right reasons, but seeking out the ""feeling of being"" in love is the drug of choice for these individuals. So you say‚Ä¶how do i fix this‚Ä¶how do i get out of this now that i kinda think i may have a problem well‚Ä¶there is 12 steps to help you out of it, groups, cognitive restructuring, therapy‚Ä¶all the above. it takes admitting and accepting that you are caught up in this otherwise its always going to be the other persons fault why you are scorned. Wanting what you dont want or need‚Ä¶and what is healthy for you ‚Ä¶pushing away. People wise up eventually of this‚Ä¶.or they go on having the ""gay"" male friends or female friends ‚Ä¶the married friends that are ""safe"" or unattainable to represent mom‚Ä¶ie love. while the whole time‚Ä¶trying to ""earn"" dads love‚Ä¶which if ever happens in a relationship represents success and accomplishment. Otherwise if it doesnt represents failure and victim stancing. so , you ask ‚Ä¶why dont they just quit doing it‚Ä¶because its a dynamic that started at the earliest roots of existance and so many dont want to blame, think about or even go back to the family dynamic that they dont realize they are doing it. So next time ask yourself what type relationships you have in life, who plays what‚Ä¶what are you ""seeking to find"" ‚Ä¶and who and what represents ""the one"" ‚Ä¶like many have said dont know what you had til its gone‚Ä¶thus when love leaves ie mom, your stuck without any balance and then you realize you spent the whole time trying to love someone or something that left you empty and lost. Then only then does the one that left all of a sudden become""appealing""‚Ä¶..the game continues‚Ä¶..and that folks is my theory on this whole thing‚Ä¶.take it or leave it‚Ä¶.lol‚Ä¶night.

I just came home from attending my first service here in san angelo. I have really fought against it out of fear,
but you know what is fear? yeah well. I just came from a service and it was totally different than any I have ever
attended. It wasnt bad at all, it was just scary and not very positive? it was but left me a little shaken. I needed that
I guess to evaluate my obedience and christianity i guess. I dont know it was just like wow. It left me shaken. It was
talking about the fire and wrath and the book of revelation. Not that I am ignorant to any of that, I understand gods wrath
and punishment of unbelievers, I guess I had not really taken the time to remember of gods holy and judgment. I guess
you get so caught up in the ""commercialized "" god that at times I worship the loving no wrath all is forgiven, and I forget
there are consequences for actions and they will be dealt with. I needed to hear it, just was kinda shaken by it. I am thankful
for being in church before and even baptized but I can tell ya if that was my first sermon ever it would have got me running¬†
and never came back lol‚Ä¶it was pretty frightening. I understand the severity of action and sin, and like I said it is so watered
down I guess we need messeges like that to remember the severity of our sins and accountability for all we do and speak or
view. ¬†I am taking it all in. üôÇ I am grateful for the messege and the ability to be reminded of such exists in this world at times we
tend to become so accustomed to no pain, no strief, just easiness. I will go back next sunday for sure!‚Ä¶.thank you jesus. I write this
entry in for your glory! amen.

Hey diary,¬†
whats up it has been awhile even though i have written in other places, this is home. I am wide awake and just finished
writing my mom a letter and honestly told her somethings i have been holding on for years. I have learned alot of lessons
on this journey I call my life. Some good, some bad,but I am still here. Thank you lord for that. I love this song by mercy me
because it talks to me and worship is more than a song, but it calms me down to listen to guidance ya know?
I was in group tonight and it felt for a moment as god himself stepped in the room and shined down on us. I am getting people
that want more counseling once they finish my program there at probation. they want to keep coming back for more each week.
I have heard a emptiness is in them when they dont speak in groups, individual sessions, and i know what that emptiness is.¬†
They have felt the spirit move theirs. Some are actually going to church, telling me about it. It is so awesome. I would say I would
be surprised but this isnt the first time any of this has happend. I am thankful none the less. I have definately been called to do
what i do. I dont care about politically correct, i dont care about what not to say, i speak as the lord commands and guides me.¬†
I gotta keep singing‚Ä¶.i gotta keep praising your name‚Ä¶your the one that is keeping my heart beating. For years, I worshipped thru
only music, and didnt really know how to pray, to look for guidance and strength. I have different knowledge now, and I am definately
blessed with information alot have yet to hear. Kindness breaks down any walls‚Ä¶i have learned that. The ones that are the most¬†
unloveable‚Ä¶need the most love. I have been there, and am only one small thing to be there again if i dont do the things i know
work. This is a tool that has helped me unwind my mind, and make the thoughts slow down. I know so many that are lost, torn, their
souls living for the world and at the same time in their own solitude asking asking‚Ä¶.when will this all stop, when will i quit this self
sabatage and accept. I walked that walk for years‚Ä¶lost torn broken all the words that describe a wretch of a person. I had to humble¬†
myself to jesus. I had to quit running and finally surrender. I have lived life to excess, have wandered around looking for anything to get
me not to feel, to be numb from the pain that was created in my own solitude. I was always on the go, always running dodging and¬†
making excitement to keep from really getting a life for myself, Then one day in april 2008 I was in church and they were baptizing people
at my church, and i knew i could not go any further on my own will. i was broken, i was seeping with shame/guilt, and denial and just knew
that i had heard this would finally restore me. I could not go on without jesus, i tried even in the times or ""happiness"" then would get complacent
and go back down‚Ä¶since that day i have not backslid as often and i sure dont drink anymore or self sabatage. i am not cured by no means, but¬†
i know that when i feel lost, or there is a questioning in my heart, jesus is asking‚Ä¶where are you my son, why are you giving so much to the world,¬†
when all it does is take and i am what makes you whole. i am the bread, the light the way. I go thru my days wanting to give more than i take, and¬†
its a walk not for alot, any christian will tell you, its not always the rosiest walk, ¬†and at times lonely ‚Ä¶that is where faith comes in and going to the¬†
people,places that restore you. I write, i listen to music, i read my bible, or you know I will become the world so quickly, me being a christian is
not any different than you other than trying to be obedient to a god i love with all my heart, and knowing my soul is gods‚Ä¶my sins are forgiven and
its a lifestyle of constant change and forgiveness. My self will used to take me places I hated, and i still ended up there. i get attacked now for what i¬†
say, what i believe, how much of a believer i am, and all the things that try to tear down my belief system. I have lost alot in my years, but you know
I have gained more than anything this earth could ever offer me. I will live forever in eternity as a clean undepressed, broken soul that walks on this¬†
path. It is not all that dont get me wrong, but just because i am saved doesnt mean i quit feeling‚Ä¶i am prepareing for the day none of this will matter
and i hope to see alot of my friends and family in heaven. Just saying you are a christian doesnt make it so, it taks obedience and humility and belief in jesus¬†
christ the son of man. only way to eternal life is thru the son. yet so many as i once was and at times still do‚Ä¶get arrogant and let the world become more
than faith, more than direction, more than salvation, more than peace, let it consume our all. I hope you know I am just a man, still learning to walk in this
walk and journey but that is no excuse to keep going backword, I know better. I have been fed, have been cleaned up, ‚Ä¶..god bless you all.

¬†Hey journal,,
Would have wrote on FB but the blog thing is messing up so decided to come and get my thoughts out
here. I havent really wrote here in a while. Maybe just to post some videos or what not but not really what
has been on my mind. I have recently started running/Jogging. I have ran 20 miles since may 7. I am proud¬†
of myself because at the gym I walked the first lap and ran the other seven tonight. I went afterwards and walked
another two at this trail by the lake. I am full of energy right now and tired at the same time. I have alot of naustalgia
running thru my mind. I prayed already and just need to empty these thoughts. I am thinking bout this song alot tonight
and it always brings up a time in my life that life was just so rocky and up and down. I also think of a person in that time
frame and I just wonder how they are today. I wish them nothing but the best. I like this song , and has alot of meaning
to my growth if you will. I ran thru those darken nights it talks about, and the song is wrong, I am almost forty and my nights
are cold, and alone. I havent really met anyone in a long time that has been a christian or believer. I have dated people, but
it always goes weird since my belief and job are so serious to me. I dont waiver either one for anyone. Either they are obedient
to god or I try to just pray for them and move on. It is a really lonely life to live even with other believers, I just find myself one year
older and try not to get into what if‚Äôs what might have been‚Ä¶but hard ya know? i am human and its my nature to ask myself exactly
how much growth have i made and the biggest question‚Ä¶WHAT THE HELL TOOK me do long!‚Ä¶It appears to me that when i was
my sickest‚Ä¶the darkest times of my life‚Ä¶were full of endless possibilities and i ask god what was it about when i couldnt hold
on to anything was when i had endless opportunities‚Ä¶i am not thankful or ungrateful dont get me wrong‚Ä¶.just those questions go¬†
round and round‚Ä¶well i guess im gonna try to get some sleep‚Ä¶.night yalll‚Ä¶..i love you all and god bless you.

434,https://www.opendiary.com/m/rebornsoldier/my-testimony-12-4538073/,2010-06-18,my testimony,"
¬†good morning,
I was sitting here worshipping and praying this morning. I remember at the very beginning of my journey how lost I was. How confused how angry, and how self destructive I was even though it all seemed normal because everyone I associated with did those things. I was introduced to the lord by one of my girlfriends and her family. I had been approached with all my life, but never really understood so I gave up and went about what I knew, a life of sin and hate. I hated my life, I hated people, I didnt trust anyone , and always always ran with the wrong group, because they offered me the shelter from my ""storm"". I remember when I was exposed to real love and the kind that doesnt go away by this family. They took me in all dirty and broken and never gave up on me or my sinful ways. I did everything in my power to rebel or to show them I wasnt worth their love. I would start to notice a difference in my life and get arrogant and go back into the world thinking I feel happy, it will be different. To only fall back into the world and all that I had been living. I was tested by so much and fell easily. I heard this song one night, and I thought hmmm‚Ä¶this isnt that gospel stuff that you hear in the churches but actually something that I can understand. I kept at it, I started to seek and search because I realized that slowly I felt not as sad, not as angry when I would sit and listen and when i let these people love me. It hurt like hell, and I still fell down, but I kept getting up. I kept at it because I knew my life back there was nothing glorious, i played with my freedom, my sanity, and my health every day. I slept around, I hung out with the lowest of the low, and still I felt ""dirty"" and unloved. I existed in this world while painting on a face of happiness and like all was okay. I would act one way round certain people and one way around my girlfriend. I hurt her due to my wishy washy ways, hurt her family but still they stayed around, and believed that one day I would surrender and totally understand the life i was carrying around was something i was choosing not something that was needed in my life. I blamed this i blamed that, i never took accountability for anything, but looking for fun, at any expense. I seeked love from everything the world offered. The faster it went the more i wanted to be a part of it because it kept me from thinking about my own stuff. I was miserble, and i did it because it beat being alone. I finally surrendered to the lord one day i was sitting at fielder road baptist church which i just seemed to walk in one sunday ‚Ä¶and they were baptizing that day. I sat there and i was hurting so deeply because when your a new christian you feel awesome like you have the world beat, but you dont know you feed this daily‚Ä¶moment by moment., so i would heal, go back out, get down, angry, resentful, and keep going back and forth back and forth, well, that sunday i was sitting there and i had this feeling, of i cant leave this church today i dont ever want to leave because every time i sit here i feel safe, i feel loved, i feel enough. and i sat alone. But it felt like a million hands were all over me every time, and washing me clean. I cried inside so loudly as to ask what lord, why not me? what did i do that keeps me from you, and then the pastor asked for anyone who wanted to dedicate their lives to the lord to stand up and go to the dressing room and get dressed. I without thinking stood up, walked to the dressing room and was asked by one of the decons, what makes you want to get baptized and i said i dont want to burn in hell. He was asking if i believed in jesus christ and he was the way to god, i didnt know that then, but that answer i gave was the first thing out of my mind, i needed god, as much as he wanted me. i was scared, i was confused but i kept going forward alone, no direction just doing it because i had always heard you go down dirty come up a new child in christ, well i was weighted down for sure with nothing but sin. I was always scared of dying before, but that day i could have died and been at peace, when i went under that water, it felt as if a sonic boom erupted and my soul was doused out. The flames went away, the anger the sadness, the turmoil all was gone. I came up new, i cried because i knew it was real. I am no saint and like i said when you dedicate your life to christ, everyone and everything will throw itself at you and i still didnt have boundaries, i still went thinkin i know god he will protect me, thru the darkness i place myself. In time, the happiness faded, but my heart felt different, i always knew how to refill it, and where to go, so i kept at it, because when you live a life as i did for so many years, you are scared to death of that ..the burning‚Ä¶the hatred and anger. I slowly started drifting away from old friends or they were taken out of my life because i wasnt ""funny"" anymore, i was serious and i was driven, i kept at it ‚Ä¶stopped drinking, stopped sleeping around, stopped looking for excitement, because nothing was the same, and still i pressed on. I eventually made it where i am today with gods help. I passed my lcdc exam the first and final time i could take it, studied for two weeks before nonstop and with gods help i almost aced it. I have some people in my life dont get me wrong that were there the whole time in the background praying for me, pleading i would keep going on this path which is narrow. I stumble i fall when i live life the way i want it to be, but when i stay in the light that i know keeps me safe, nothing i mean nothing is not able to be worked thru. I am human and i make mistakes that is part of living, but i know that if i died today, i will go to heaven not because i dont lie, dont steal am a ""good"" person, and ""believe"" in god, all those things mean nothing‚Ä¶..they help but to be a true christian is living a life of obedience to all that you know deep within is right as the bible says, your life is no longer yours, but you live it to serve the lord. I am stubborn and i am defiant at times, but i keep going forward. I know my life used to be full of hatred anger and self centeredness, i played the victim looking for a savior ‚Ä¶.and it wasnt until i found god that i understood all the aching feelings for love, acceptance, and safty were him calling out to me‚Ä¶the world taught me alot, and still does, but i am a better person for who i am today. I dont have much but i am rich beyond belief. I just hope that you will try it, and keep at it, and know not all people that protest to be christians are, and those that are at times will leave a bad taste in your mouth, but its about your service and your journey that matters, dont be a follower of the world, be a follower of jesus christ, and know who lives their lives as a example and who lives life in the world , and only seeks when they have troubles. satan is real, evil is all over, no fear needed to get you to believe im sure living long enough in the world has your heart aching for change, and no clue how to get there‚Ä¶..keep praying keep doing the right thing, stop doing what you used to do, hanging with who you hung out with, hang with those that truelly know the lord and direct you to scripture for answers, what do you ahve to lose, even if you dont buy into it, as one person told me‚Ä¶wouldnt you rather die believeing and not know‚Ä¶.than die and not believe and it is true? ‚Ä¶.well i gotta get ready for work yall‚Ä¶have a blessed day and be kind to yourself and stop the fire that rages within. ‚Ä¶god bless you all.

woke up with alot going thru my mind and its not letting myself live on my emotions but rather make some logic behind the insanity at times. I was thinking that I was starting to feel a lil guilt over some of the things I put on my page, but then I remember I am not of this world, and I should not care what others perceive or think of me, and even though I can sit here and say i dont, in the pit somewhere there is a lil there. I have lost alot due to my wreckless lifestyle in the past so if i lose due to being healthy than so be it. I want it clear, I wasnt always a christian and I lived my life as if I had all the time in the world to change., after all I was gonna take advantage of being ""young"" and experience all I needed to as a right of passage. I lived it fast, wreckless and without care, I dont regret my lessons because they brought me here at this moment as I write this. Some of my friends think that I am miserble and am like depressed, but I am really not. I am a answer seeker and since I moved back here i must admit I am not the same person as I was living in dfw but I have noticed the solitude of this town has brought me closer to god than any other period of my life. I call it a mini sabatical. I have wanted to give up and quit and go running back. I wont do that to myself, it isnt really that bad, I just see places and memories of who the person was that lived here before. I wonder how I spent so much time before self destructing in the name of excitement and ""living"". I wasnt living, I was killing myself as fast as my torch would burn, I used to say its my life gonna live it to the fullest, for all the wrong reasons. You see my biggest fear from the earliest memory was two things, dying and being alone. Well I should have died many nights as I played russian roulette with my fragile life. I didnt, and had I done so I would be burning in the pits right now with no way out, no excuse good enough, to get me a second chance to make it right. That was my calling card throughout life, always do it different next time, but if i have learned anything, those second, third, fourth chances never chance just get more manipulative, more secretive and more destructive. I have been able to reconnect with people to make amends and to say I am sorry truelly for the way I treated them, didnt treat them and so forth. I am making peace with my mother, and my past as well. It is a road that has taken me thru alcoholism, sexual addiction amongst other things. I have went thru ever imagionable way to cope with these things. To no avail. Like my last entry stated, until that time in my life‚Ä¶i surrendered.Today is fathers day, a special day to me now, before it was just a day to remember what kind of bastard son I was raised with. I have also come around and pray for his soul from time to time. It is difficult but I am trying to do so. I know for certain I will only get this life once., no doubt about it. I see so many die daily and I am getting up there in age where I cant deny it happens anymore. I dont lie to myself anymore, I dont try to find a life in some others approval, because you know we all have purpose and we were created for such. I know this sounds the same each time, but it is so simple that you can hear it a million times and never be able to grasp because self will will tell you its a lie, its crap, its scientific to explain life and death, but like I said earlier, I have seen death time and again and even witnessed being reborn in people. I see it in my line of work, the flames go away, and replaced with a soul again, a light that shines thru all adversary. I have been asleep for most of my life either in a stupor, depressed or just making poor choices and you know as much as i am writing here, its so easy just to act as if it doesnt matter as much and fall back to sleep. One day I wont wake, and all that I didnt make right will be something I will have to answer for. I cant claim ignorance anymore, not knowing or being lost, I know‚Ä¶and there are no more excuses. Accountability is one thing that this journey has taught me and being honest. Honest with me and others around me even if they dont like the truth, its their souls at risk. You see everytime you speak to someone or cross someones path its to plant a seed‚Ä¶not of doubt or of tryin to fit in its to better that persons existance thru testimony. If this helps anyone so be it, if it doesnt I am okay with that also. I am not god and quit trying along time ago to play that role in my life. I cant do it without him, and I am not him. I hear so much pain and hurt in the world and its covered up in laughter, sarcasm, extinction, and so on, any way to cope without coping, So many want love but have no clue what real love is, I didnt have a clue, I thought it was the romantic movies that hollywood tries to push, the nicolas sparks novels‚Ä¶.all the above, and you say but martin dont you ever have fun or just let go‚Ä¶.folks i have lived a life of falseness and of destruction‚Ä¶.the fun isnt needed today or tommorow. I may be gone or jesus come back at anytime and im in a bar or participating in something I know better than to be doing. ‚Ä¶.I am tired of paying the price with my heart and my soul. I may sound like a cynic instead of a person that is a true believer but I want you to know just because I am a christian doesnt mean it automatically makes my life ""perfect"" its abundant but not perfect. I still struggle as you do, because when you know the truth, there is no more lying to yourself, but you sure do try. that is is self will. I being a therapist have learned in my practice that I dont give up on people ever, and I guess I transpose that to my real life also, so when i come across someone that is broken, lost, or needs. I stick with them ‚Ä¶the difference is it takes a bigger toll because alot of times they arent really ready for change, just playing that wishy washy game of denial. I have some great christian friends and they live the life i speak of the life of not really fitting into the world, and at times feeling lonely and outcast, they have told me and its true, so many fit into the status quo and are okay to live there but quick to tear down a christian for wanting to believe in something different and not wanting to fit into a world that is built to destroy itself. Marraiges, family units , children , you name it are burning before our eyes, i was watching tv the other day and there is a new cartoon called family from hell. It is glorifying the devil and all the evils of the world and is brain washing kids to think its okay to think hell is funny and to laugh at. On those nights of drinking binges do you always feel like crap the next day emotionally‚Ä¶sure there are chemicals doing their thing in your mind, but the shame/guilt is from conscience‚Ä¶.knowing right from wrong and choosing to trick yourself out at your expense‚Ä¶for attention‚Ä¶.for a feeling of belonging to something that wont leave you‚Ä¶.it all does allthe friends you see yourself with if they arent going in a positive direction with you will eventually fade if you decide to change, only a select few will get what or where your trying to go. If you go to jail, or worse‚Ä¶those friends wont come visit, or send you money, or even write. But the moment you get out, they will be there because misery loves company, you can run run run ‚Ä¶i had the best running shoes on the market., and ran for alot of years until i couldnt run anymore‚Ä¶and i crashed and burned‚Ä¶almost lost a career that was just starting, jeoperdized my freedom, all because i was living a double life. I was saying one thing, but living another. Trying to cover up faster than I could the holes of denial in my life. while you are reading this if you have gotten this far the devil will let go for a minute and you may be inspired to change but the moment you stop reading or get a text or phone call and the world is calling‚Ä¶its easy to forget what you just heard. You must saturate yourself in the word‚Ä¶thats why i post what i do on my page, not for you but for me. I do it if you get something from it then good, but its for my self preservation‚Ä¶.i get away from the light one day two days‚Ä¶im in trouble quickly because you dont feed the soul it goes hundry and falls for any bit of food it finds‚Ä¶and in my case is not good food‚Ä¶.and starts to eat away at my salvation and faith faster than i can say my name. i may never travel the world‚Ä¶id like to ‚Ä¶i may never mission to no one other than the closest client‚Ä¶..but one thing for certain‚Ä¶i will live each day as my last due to knowing one day it will be‚Ä¶no doubt. i want to live my life for god here and in death. Nothing else matters. Nothing. all the arguements i hear for non belief is their or your opinion‚Ä¶dont try to discredit anything i say, you dont have to read this or even believe but as a believer i know where you are going and its your foolishness that keeps you at bay. Like i tell my clients and you arent my clients but i say this‚Ä¶..i am here to help you‚Ä¶not work against you‚Ä¶but i cant stop the fight that rages within you with you‚Ä¶.only god can‚Ä¶but if you want what i have i sure can direct you to what works‚Ä¶.surrender is first of all the beginning‚Ä¶knowing that you cant go one more breath on your own self will‚Ä¶.not one more. Honesty‚Ä¶..quit lying to you or others, quit playing the victim and be accountable, willingness to change and put a plan in place to achieve a positive result‚Ä¶.and on and on and on‚Ä¶.be involved but not using god as a copilot., but as the director of all‚Ä¶.we dont run the show we are obedient servants that are directed‚Ä¶.god doesnt need us‚Ä¶.we need him. even if no one else testified or planted anymore seeds‚Ä¶god would find a way as little as a mustard seed to get the word spread‚Ä¶.no one is above gods mercy‚Ä¶ask yourself this question..if you die right now in the next couple minutes‚Ä¶what are you leaving behind and where are you going‚Ä¶other than in the ground‚Ä¶..all the money, your kids, your job, your car, your clothes, all that‚Ä¶.wont go with you‚Ä¶wont be able to buy you into heaven. All the kind words, selfless acts ‚Ä¶the brownie points we try to get daily wont do it‚Ä¶.accepting jesus christ as lord thru the son to get to the father is the only way‚Ä¶and living a life of obedience‚Ä¶repentence‚Ä¶rebuking old behaviors and thoughts asking for forgiviness‚Ä¶.forgiving self‚Ä¶and others‚Ä¶‚Ä¶wake up people the world is asleep and heading straight to destruction‚Ä¶judgement day is going to be anyday‚Ä¶..how ru going to expalin your life when asked about‚Ä¶.what did you do when you read this..did you laugh, did you ridicule‚Ä¶did you feel guilty and cuss it‚Ä¶.this isnt from me‚Ä¶.i am merly typing it‚Ä¶..wake up‚Ä¶.wake up‚Ä¶..get your life in order as if you would live it for eternity‚Ä¶you dont want to die because you fear ‚Ä¶.well ease your fear and start changing everything one small step at a time‚Ä¶or dont‚Ä¶your choice‚Ä¶.well god bless you that read this and those that dont‚Ä¶.you didnt get harmed or saved either way‚Ä¶so you never will know‚Ä¶but god has his ways‚Ä¶.and he is bigger than all of us‚Ä¶.believe that.god bless.

good morning üôÇ
It is saturday morning and i am praising god almighty the creator the author the redeemer. I wanted to come and write a little
bit because I have not written in awhile. I picture this song in my head without the video and wonder how glorious and happy it
makes my god to know we love him as so. The ulmighty glorious light thru many darkend days my god has brought me thru them
and still is. I am getting closer to another birthday which this morning I was thinking you know that is not my date of birth. I was born
on April 12, 2008‚Ä¶I was baptized and died a old man of the world and arose a man of christ or born again. I have tried it all alcohol,
women, stimulants, jobs, places, and nothing has filled the void my glorious father does.The kind of personality i have i just cant do
just a little of one thing or the other i go all out and i am learning this is a lifestyle not a competition. ¬†I run into so many people that look
at me as if i am different or they stay away altogether which you know i feel is a blessing because i am protected from that which i have
been drawn to most of my life. I am listening to this song and thinking back when i was shouting out lord can you hear me? if your real
please please make all this stop. I tried so hard to do it on my own and all was nill til ""i let go"" and still i would pick it up and run with it
as fast as i could from god and anyone else that was trying to love me. i hated me for so long that i thought my job would help fill that¬†
void and complete me. I can sense a unhealthy person in a heartbeat or a couple of sentences now. I have grown so much and it all¬†
started years ago when so many took a chance on a broken soul. Thank you jesus for those loving people you placed in my life. I am¬†
so grateful that they dont hate me. i live in solitude because of fear of slipping but i am getting stronger in that cause i am on some new
medication that helps so much with all that temptation and need for excitement to slow me down. i suffer from anxiety and depression. I¬†
for so long would need something to bring me up if i was depressed(upper) excitement or something to bring me down if i was to hyper(downer) alcohol¬†
since I was not into drugs i would use people in the place of the excitement and then it would calm me down. i am not proud of¬†
admitting that but its honest. I am even and balanced today. thank you jesus! I just really want to rejoice in the glory! sing it with¬†
micheal w smith! ‚Ä¶holyyy! ¬† i am gonna go shower just needed to get a little off my mind‚Ä¶.have a great weekend people..;) love you and god
bless.

Hey journal.,
The day has been a lazy one i cant lie. i have been listening to music that restores my soul and keeps me focused
on the lord. i used to hate idle time and even more being alone. i am in this apt but you know what? it doesnt bother
me a bit. i was invited to see the above band but there are like almost three hours away. i didnt have the money for the
gas so just gonna wait til they come closer or i have a little more cash next time. i have just decided that the life of jesus
was a turbulant one and i can totally relate as my diary has suggested. i understand that the world has not changed in¬†
so many years, people still shun you or deceive you in ways that was even around in the days of jesus. i am excited about
going to see chris tomlin though in october. i will save up and make sure i have plans in place. i feel so at peace that i dont
need to be out amongst the world to be okay with who i am . i totally understand that my lord loves me and i will be obedient
no matter what the cost. thank you jesus for all you give and provide‚Ä¶without you there is nothing but turmoil chaos and confusion.
all that was in my prior life of living dead without the light of the son beating in me. thank you jesus!

It is right‚Ä¶five twenty in the morning and woke up with a feeling of sadness and tears going down my face. I wonder exactly what i was dreaming because i dont remember.
I went to a meeting the other night and actually saw a different side of the devestation of our society, and then I spoke. I noticed something. Its like you see your progression
and either in recovery or life, you always have a threshold to look at. I have grown so much and still have some unfinished issues. I wish I didnt understand sometimes what it means to hurt so badly that you turn to anything to make it go away. I do though, I just wanted to tell those guys its gonna be okay if you just forgive yourself. I cant turn my emotions off and its not such a bad thing to feel. I know that I am human and have empathy for people today where before I could have cared less. I dont know where my life is taking me and you know I am not even worried about it. I have reached a point in my life where I will go as it is ment to be. I like this song because it tells it as it is. As long as I have god by my side I will be okay. I am ready to get on a routine . This idle time is more than I can take. I can only watch so much tv. So much computer time. I feel that the world is really close to ending the terror that goes on as people sleep in their beds‚Ä¶.I can sit here and write that i never cared, never thought about others feelings, emotions and lack of.I look in peoples eyes and it just doesnt look the same anymore. I see lost, confused, masks, and much much more. I cant turn the counselor off. I am not in counseling mode all the time, but once your eyes are opened, you cant shut them or turn and act as if they dont exist.I feel like such a outcast because the only time i hear people talk about god or jesus is when times are the bleakest. I know some that arent ashamed and testify with vigor and i am glad they are unashamed to be a christian. It is not religion its a lifestyle. So how can you give all your life to god and then act as if he is a hidden part that no one needs to see. I fall , i stumble and i backslide, but i have never been so certain of anything in my life as the love i have for my savior. I lay awake at night just trying to remember what it used to be like in my life before i was baptized and if i think long enough i can but i dont like going backwards, it just keeps you rehashing and somehow in my mind saying well god you arent big enough to handle that let me go back and deal with it for you. my life may end one day without meaning to anyone but myself and my creator, but i hope that i lived here with purpose and with a direction that i tried to show others that change is possible. i love sports, love music and love humanity no matter how unaware of what people say to others. i went to take my physical today and this person weighed me and i told him i weigh about this much‚Ä¶and he said sorry amigo must have ate two extra chalupas this morning for breakfast, i heard it and was like wtf‚Ä¶..but i decided to just blow it off‚Ä¶not worth my energy. i have had to learn that because in the past i would have told him off and said something to destroy his sense of trying to be funny. It doesnt matter how people see me because stereotypes are stupid and unecessary. I am hispanic and to tell you the truth mexican food and tortillas‚Ä¶hot sauce and all the other things are not a part of my diet. I dont like that kind of food much. I was not raised like that. I was raised with a different culture and people try to demean me anytime they can by saying i act ""white"" or just cause my last name i have forgotten who i am‚Ä¶.i am me. martin. no marty not any other name i had at one point. i am just me, whatever food i eat, music i listen to , clothes i wear , shoes i get are things that i find comfortiing for me, i stopped caring along time ago about fitting into your ideal of what i should or shouldnt be. I am just speaking about it to show how idiotic it really is to think in 2010‚Ä¶.there is still such ignorance and bigotry left in the world. I refuse to see people as a color a race a habit a flaw. People are worth loving no matter how awful they are, it is written we are to love and pray for those that are the most unloveable‚Ä¶our enemies. if this sound punkish or weak then so be it‚Ä¶.it should say alot about a mindset that controls your perception of others as you see yourself‚Ä¶.and react to that by putting down others to raise your self up. i have people that think they know me and never have asked a question about where i have been. i dont know why i am writing all this at this hour but it just needs to come out‚Ä¶i hope that texas wins today‚Ä¶no matter who does it will be a great game i hope. even if they dont i will still cheer them on..,dont need build up the hype on anything other than the game‚Ä¶wish i was younger and playing out there would be the only thing i would be thinking. lol‚Ä¶.well ive said alot‚Ä¶and nothing at all‚Ä¶time to get back to bed‚Ä¶.god bless you all.

Good day of football‚Ä¶i watched alot of it today ending with a awesome ending in the texas game. I picked them by ten and people called me foolish. lol i dont care i know¬†
a good team when i see it, the quarterback is good just young. But I am thinking right now how much we need the lord in all areas of our lives ..should i say in my life because
I dont know what you need, I am not god. I know that as a christian it is hard to live in a world where the enemy is strong and always waiting to attack. I know that there is so much hatred in the world today and so much lost people it just shows up in posts from friends, etc. I get texts on how people want to just give up. Lord those people need you. I need you ever second of every day to remain in the mindset that is calm.stable for me.My back is feeling better day by day. I cant wait to start walking again and losing this weight i have packed on while i have been hurting. I have a social network page and i posted something about the longhorns or god videos and i get called gay or they make snide remarks about my faith. I wonder how sad it must be to tear down something you dont understand or you can control so you build yourself up at the expense of another well i have not allowed it to change me. I would have in the past and i am talking about it because it bugged me and i wanted to get it out. Just so that others can see how boldly they can call you out on a page on the net‚Ä¶.tuff guy. I pray for you and your misinformation.¬†
I can tell you all my life really there are people that either get me or they dont. The ones that dont have a hard time being around me due to the things I say and do, but the ones that do they get me and that is all that matters really. god gets me, he created me, so how could he be wrong?¬†
I am going to bed cause i have been up off and on since five this morning‚Ä¶.just wanted to empty some stuff before i go to bed. I can talk openly on here and empty things that either make sense or dont, either way its out of my head and therefore i am calm. ‚Ä¶.goodnite world‚Ä¶.god bless.

good morning journal,
I am just waking up and i have a mixed feelings going on. I dont feel sad or depressed, just feel empty and not certain of this
day. I have never been a good fake it til i made it person. I am concrete in the fact that it either is or it isnt. I am waiting on the lord
and each day I will keep doing that because honestly thats all i really have. i put him before everyone i know, everyone that speaks to
me, my lord is bigger and more definitive. I have been lead by so many in my life attempting to find the way to live and how to do this or
that and never went to god and got angry when it didnt work or didnt last very long for my ill attempt to try to control it since it wasnt comeing
from god it was coming from man. I am up early attempting to start my day with the lord. I have been busy over the last week and really the
time has flown and not really kinown why. I have seen alot of videos the last couple days that are disturbing to say the least. I am not backing
out on my position or people that have given me a opportunity it is just scary to watch. Then it follows a ""it doesnt happen here"". Then why show
it? I understand the answer to that question, it is just un-nerving. If there is anything going on inside of me it is that. I will make it. I am a survivor
and in all this time the most that has been done to me is having my car keyed twice so, i guess if they cant get to my car, hopefully they dont
key me. ‚Ä¶that is a joke ‚Ä¶lol. I wish this addiction stuff didnt have so much anger and pain attached to it., I see violence every day of my life, more
than the average man‚Ä¶.either in recounts of peoples stories, videos, actual demonstrations., i am having to dip into the person that protected me
before the cold , non feeling, just almost robotic individual because honestly that is the only way to survive in that environment. I dont guess the
average person understands just how badly all this is attached to the violence in the world. Its hard to shut down then just turn it back on once you leave
no matter how people think you can. I cant for a bit and need some time to process and defrag. I am gonna go to a meeting tonight and hope that it
helps me get in some kind of equalibrium. I crave peace today like a drug. I crave balance i crave serenity. i was made to be a strong indivdiual to¬†
be able to go to the battlefield and be amongst the sick the broken, and attempt to plant some seeds. Its not easy but i have done it for seven years
just venting a lil‚Ä¶getting this off my mind before we start the day today. I dont get close to people still for the fear of them letting themselves down and¬†
attempting to drag me with them. I am working on that but i have been working in this field so long it has taught me not to trust without strong boundaries
and how to take care of self without bringing in alot to maintain. I have people i talk to and i have people that i get advice from so its not like i isolate,¬†
i just dont share alot to everyone. I learned along time ago that comes back to you in times when you are hurting the worst. i really wish i would have¬†
started working a recovery program before i became a counselor. It just seems like i have learned so many CBT now that its hard to go back and¬†
even remember what it was that kept me sick. I know that sounds like denial and all that, its just hard to have knowledge of change, and trying to be
broken at the same time, needing to work on the past if that isnt a issue anymore. I guess since i never have done it or worked on it in a treatment¬†
aspect it is different and maybe i did do it‚Ä¶who knows. i know i feel nothing like i used to not even a inkling. i cant live that life and go to work and be¬†
someone else. it gets old and you get exposed anyways. oh well, only god knows. this morning i am reading on this.

Philippians 4:6-7
Don‚Äôt worry about anything; instead, pray about everything; tell God your needs, and don‚Äôt forget to thank Him for His answers. If you do this, you will experience God‚Äôs peace, which is far more wonderful than the human mind can understand. His peace will keep your thoughts and your hearts quiet and at rest as you trust in Christ.
lord ‚Ä¶.know my short comings, my insecurities and my areas of deceit and confusion and please hold them and
show me how to continue to rely on you for change. I know that I am not able to heal myself and lord i turn to those
that can guide me and even turn to the ultimate guidance the bible. your word. I heard something that angered me¬†
the other day ""if a addicts mouth is moving they are lying"". Does that statement give a addict hope for change? i underrstand all the lies, the manipulation, the deception and hurt i as well as others have caused. When i hear that it just brings more shame/guilt to the person it is being spoken about. Because if the person is no longer lying, it tells them well they dont believe a word i say one way or the other, so why not do the easy way out. quit trying to progress. I really wish that when people use quotes and statements they really understand the reprocussions. i cant believe this is taught today in 2010 ‚Ä¶..how far we have to go for the world to understand the mindset of the addicted and the afflicted. brokeness doesnt always have to keep a person working towards change‚Ä¶understand that one? there comes a time when you must live and not be so worried bout information that you forget to apply it and the only time you do is when prompted or when it doesnt matter‚Ä¶okay i will get off my soapbox. have a great one you guys and god bless!

Good morning:)
Let me tell you about my jesus‚Ä¶.i heard those words one day and my mind was just blown away. How great is my God? I can tell you and even with
some words not able to get the point across. As i sit here listening to this song, i am just understanding how much and how far a person can go either
way with or without Jesus in their lives.
1 Corinthians 13:11

11¬†When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I gave up childish ways.¬†12¬†For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I have been fully known.13¬†So now faith, hope, and love abide, these three; but the greatest of these is love.

I love this scripture because for so long I thought being a man was just being strong and unwilling to surrender when I was wrong. I find that all that was¬†
was pride and arrogance. I have a understanding that sometimes it doesnt really matter where you have been its where you are going that makes it more
important. It isnt about forgetting or acting like the past didnt play a hand in the decisions you have made for yourself, but really there is so much you cant
change about it. Take accountability and repent and hopefully it turns into a new behavior after that. I was trembling the other night in the meeting I have attending
not out of shame/guilt, but out of conviction. I am breaking those chains finally that I have heard so many speak of. I used to hear it and not really understand
the real reasons behind it all. I was clueless and lost. I thought just because i recited a scripture I was saved, i wasnt. I allowed myself to manipulate God
and keep him out of my life when i needed him the most, or give him praise when i didnt. I never spoke to long because those of you that know, when you start
speaking to long and your living a life that is not condusive to healthy living ‚Ä¶you say what you say as quick as possible and then shut up..hopeing to not be found
out. Well to be transparent ¬†is what i want in my life., to be seen as me, and no hidden agendas or preoccupation. I was a child for alot of years, a broken child, who¬†
thought and acted as such. I am becoming the man God wants me to be, and I am not running the show. I will rise for sure‚Ä¶just wanted to share that with you guys.¬†
Another thing, long winded people have lots that they want to say but believe very little of it usually, so I am trying to learn to get to the point, and then be still.
May you guys have a blessed weekend be safe and god bless*

Hey diary, been trying to write for like a day now. It has been down or something. I guess its a good thing. I dont know. I¬†
stumbled across this band today and it is about a guy that battled from his addiction to all that one can be addicted to. I¬†
am in better spirits today and finally back on the c. i worked out today and have lost seven pounds total. I know that alot of¬†
times words appear on here to seem so dismal or without hope. I dump those on here not because i plan on staying that
way but rather getting them out. I am a believer and have turned my life around, and still in the process, i will never be totally¬†
healed until i leave this earth. I was listening to this song and its alot of what goes on in the mind‚Ä¶.shoulda woulda coulda..
all part of the pysche of a addict. no matter how many times we hear its okay move on‚Ä¶its when the demons are strong that
we use this as a self cutting tool‚Ä¶to help us ""bottom"" out if you will. Once we bottom out , we start to rise back up, and unless
you have really been there it sounds like alot of excuses and alot of rationalization. I know many dont get what addiction really is
and then there are many that take the time to learn on it daily. It is like a picture that never stays the same long. a mirage and then
its like a blackened part where the alcohol drugs, porn, whatever has torn at the soul and left a memory of shame/guilt, and regret.
I know it isnt easy to write any of this but its part of keeping my mind free from all that harbors upstairs. so many times the ones that
love us hang on so tightly that it makes us run..it has me in the past and still at times i revert back to that behavior not intentonally. I¬†
dont make promises anymore or even say look where i am or where i have been cause you know what‚Ä¶.all i am is right now as i am
sitting here writing this‚Ä¶nothing else. I have made mistakes i have made triumphs and in the end all does not matter if at the core this
disease eats at all that i love and tears my heart in twos, threes, fives‚Ä¶.i put this up cause i heard it from a song‚Ä¶it is so fitting:Save me~Cause I still believe there‚Äôs something in me worth saving~Save me From this disease that‚Äôs feeding on a better part of me. I dont know what to say really because i get tired of
this and still i am not done i dont think. i am done with the porn, the drinking the acting out stuff, i just dont know about anything else. I¬†
get tired of hearing im still sick, im still this im still that i wont ever be, and if i dont i wont. imagine waking up everyday of your life with those
words echoed in the background of your soul and knowing you will try to overcome even if a minute at a time, to know you dont just let it
all go. hell i cant really say nothing about that cause i ran my life for years and here i sit still writing about the same crap. so my mind plays¬†
tricks on me. I guess over the years of drinking, ephedra poppin ‚Ä¶.fast living has just made me ultimately insane ‚Ä¶cause i read this and im
like really martin? really? ‚Ä¶.oh well‚Ä¶.that is all for now‚Ä¶.

Hey journal,‚Ä¶.i.e‚Ä¶diary,
This song has so much precious memories in my heart‚Ä¶it started basically the journey of my premature walk with the lord. My gf at the time
was and still is a very devout christian woman. I heard this song and went and talked to her about it, she knew who this band was and i had¬†
no clue, or the messege of here am i‚Ä¶send me. You know it is almost eight/nine years later and I understand‚Ä¶.it may be to the next town or
to another continent. I feel that my gift and purpose is as any christian is to spread the glory of our savior jesus christ. I have the ability to reach
many in my line of work, but cant give my father the glory of change alot of times due to restraint and red tape. I want to let the world know‚Ä¶‚Ä¶he can
send me any day of the week, any hour i want to prepare so i wont be scared, i wont be selfish i wont have anything but complete obedience.¬†
I went to a awesome concert last night and i was hearing God the whole night‚Ä¶I wont share all he spoke to me but he said get ready ‚Ä¶stop running
and have faith in all i have shown you thus far. I am going to use you for my glory‚Ä¶.i was crying because you know‚Ä¶.i dont think that highly of my self¬†
alot of times due to shame/guilt and low self esteem. I play it off by humor, anger and denial of the problem at all. I am tired of that and even though I am
saved and a christian man‚Ä¶.i dont really walk in all Gods glory for my life. OUt of fear‚Ä¶..well I want to just take a deep breathe in‚Ä¶and see where this journey
takes me‚Ä¶.prayers please‚Ä¶‚Ä¶that is all for now. God bless.

¬†You know I am a¬†Christian¬†man that has just been luke warm in the water and not in the blood. I listen to the music attend church and maybe write a couple bible scriptures down here and now‚Ä¶but as far as a walking testimony for the lord. I balk alot of time due to¬†ridicule¬†and being full of fear. I am not being true to my heart and therefore I live a life of unconstant turmoil due to trying to fit into the world and all it judges and sees as being accepted or shunned. I honestly alot of times say i dont care what others think but in reality i do and it keeps me either going up or backsliding fast. I have had periods of my life when i was on fire for the lord and had no shame, fear or the need to hide my faith. The more I have gone down this path I have lost that fire due to earthly things that I either thought i wanted or needed to be successful or to fit in. I know better and still fall into the trap of acceptance and therefore trying to do the double life thing. I always wondered why there was such turmoil and no real peace‚Ä¶.i know why‚Ä¶.cant live those two lives and expect to fully be at peace. Its either all in or all out cant serve two masters and for so long i have tried to do that unsuccessfully. I am at a point in my life where If the lord asks me to walk away from everything and everyone and go do his will‚Ä¶.I will. I want to prepare because honestly nothing in the secular and worldly life i live really gives me much peace or love. I can say if i had kids, or a wife i may be happy but seriously anything you place before the lord keeps you in turmoil and chaos. I want to be obedient in all areas. i have put my bible down and just started to live on just the cliff notes i read on¬†Christian¬†shirts, pens, catchy sayings etc. that hasnt gotten me anywhere and to be honest‚Ä¶has kept me losing the real things in life that will be forever in my life. I have so many in my life that i care about and have tried to help, but that is all i have ever been is the crisis person, well‚Ä¶God is that person not me. I have stood in the way and they end up resenting me or even never talking to me again. i dont want that anymore and if alot dont talk to me anymore because of it‚Ä¶.its perception. I want to serve the one that never lets me down and is always there‚Ä¶.My God. So, I am gonna start¬†preparing¬†mentally, physically, emotionally, and spiritually not in that order so when my lord calls‚Ä¶i will be ready to go where I am needed by him.¬†

I thought this song was fitting because alot of times in my life i have done it afraid‚Ä¶.and most of the time it has been me doing it, so you can understand the fear, well like this song says‚Ä¶God is great and sometimes life aint good,‚Ä¶.most of the time i had those backwards‚Ä¶living for the world when i knew that it wouldnt get me anywhere but i did it anyway‚Ä¶and it always left me empty. I want you to know if God isnt in it‚Ä¶then your going at it alone. There is no recipe for success there. I dont have alot to say tonight just happy with alot right now in my life and im letting God guide me where he sees fit‚Ä¶.im doing it anyways‚Ä¶.not so much fear involved now‚Ä¶but still the unknown sometimes is pretty freightening‚Ä¶..so maybe you should let go and let god‚Ä¶..he makes no mistakes;) God bless!
"
457,https://www.opendiary.com/m/rebornsoldier/people-call-me-a-dreamer-4538096/,2010-11-30,people call me a dreamer,"
¬†i could be if you look at life and love, faith on a pessimistic avenue then i would see how you would see me that way. I used to be very doubtful and at times still find myself going there when i dont pray, when i dont hang around positive people. Its like a wet blanket that you cant shake, it engulfs you and¬†doesn‚Äôt¬†let go. I choose today not to let anything get in the way of my serenity because I know the anger that rages when i do, i know the self inflicting self doubt i can become. Before we go any further ‚Ä¶i am not writing this about anyone‚Ä¶but me‚Ä¶you see that? ME . I work with people for a living ‚Ä¶.to instill hope and faith in the unseen and how can i push that belief if i dont live a life that echoes what i am trying to get others to believe in. How can i be a testimony of change if i myself dont live a life that resembles that ? It is a miserble place to be, I know i lived there not long ago searching seeking and trying to lie to myself and say im okay im not like the ones i counsel. I am not as sick, but in reality once I got honest Yes I was. My days would suck, my nights would be engulfed in miserble pain filled sabatage and resentments. I post alot about love today and the seeking of it, because in the bible it speaks of it as being the utmost thing you can ever achieve. Maslow calls it self actualization, to gain that perspective where you can deal with life without resorting to old behaviors that caused you nothing but confusion and pain, but to be free from the chains that bind you. I am not perfect dont claim to be but on most days i live a life that i can hang my hat on and say‚Ä¶i did the best i could win or lose, i still will believe in love. I believe that so many want it, but dont seek it in the right places, i didnt for years, and it got me nothing but emptiness. My family asks me how can you live alone, do things alone, and never get tired of that life. well for years i chased the unattainable, held onto the things that made me¬†miserable¬†but always justified it in order to be the victim. so, that no matter what i would have someone to blame for my lack of getting or keeping what i thought was the most important thing in my life. I have learned this‚Ä¶if its real it wont hurt, it wont cause pain that is unbearable, it wont be a constant battle of will, but a compromise with god bonding it together. Thats where i get..the your a dreamer, relationships, life is hard, there will be struggle and disagreements, and i understand this, but in a real genuine God lead relationship you talk it out, give it to God and find a way to patch it up so that you can continue to exist in love, but alot of times we want what we want and then when it doesnt happen the way we think it should, we try to control the situation until we ""attempt"" to mold the other into what we feel they need to be or vice versa, which always ends up in resentments in the end. This is in any relationship whether it be friends, or intimate. Today i make sure my side of the road is clean before i go looking at others side. I make sure that i love until the other doesnt want it then i still love from a distance, i feel deeply and its somthing that is hardwired, i am not ashamed of it, and many have tried to make it a matter for less attraction and a way to not be good enough in their eyes. Well those people also tend to levitate towards someone they can fix or control so that they dont have to focus on their own shortcomings and if you dont need to fix another then ‚Ä¶all you have left is you and hey thats the person you have been running from your whole life if you are this person. I have been this person have dated needy, unstable women so that i could fix them, control them and then they got strong enough to leave and i could play the victim and blame ‚Ä¶sick huh? well alot do this they just never admit it. Chaos, confusion and turmoil no matter how you want to turn it‚Ä¶is the devil ‚Ä¶its written in the bible. this is what god says about love:
¬†
¬†
¬†
¬†
¬†
¬†
1 Corinthians 13:1-8 and 13
¬†
""If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal. If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have a faith that can move mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. If I give all I possess to the poor and surrender my body to the flames, but have not love, I gain nothing. Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails‚Ä¶. And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. the greatest of these is love.""

¬†
¬†
¬†this is not a checklist but a guideline. Its clear but as humans we try to fill it in find the loophole to fulfill our selfish need. Then when it¬†doesn‚Äôt¬†happen we get angry and turn our back on love and¬†ultimately¬†on God. So if God is not in it‚Ä¶then it isnt worth having. Anything you place before God you will lose it‚Ä¶.anything. I just am saddend at the thought of so many hurting and repeating the same cycles over and over ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶while keeping the creator of love out of the equation. If self love doesnt exist then it wont be in another it will only be a train wreck once the love comes from one side and all you do is take, and dont return it‚Ä¶..believe me i know this one to well. this is just some things that have been on my mind‚Ä¶..i love humanity today and understand this‚Ä¶.God is great! he supplies all the love we could ever hold if we allow him to do it, not another human. be kind heal and let go of self will its a wonderful journey once you do‚Ä¶..may God bless you in all that comes your way my friends‚Ä¶..love martin.

¬†i got asked this question today and have before in what i do for a living. Who¬†doesn‚Äôt¬†hurt? Who¬†hasn‚Äôt¬†experienced pain? Its how you overcome and go thru even when your afraid and uncertain that defines the lesson. I just tell myself you know martin‚Ä¶help is coming hang in there buddy‚Ä¶.lol yeah i talk to myself like that. I have gotten to a point in my life where it is impossible to lie to myself and soothe the issue by not being honest about it. I dont know what is best for anyone really, all i can do is just tell them what worked for me? I know that God is number one in my life and has been for so long but I must still be obedient to get any peace. I cant hang out where i want and then put myself in situations and then get angry when bad things happen. Like in the last one i spoke on using people to fill a void in me that i couldnt fill myself. well, today i really do love me and it is solid. Do you ever struggle mr. phillips? of course who doesnt? ‚Ä¶.what do you do‚Ä¶well i keep doing what i would be doing if i wasnt struggling. i keep living in the positive way no matter how difficult it is. I sometimes get stubborn and angry‚Ä¶and backslide, but for the most part its my own doing that keeps me from being at peace. I was really hard on myself about the things i had done to others in my past and thus kept that a constant that kept me sick. I would self destruct when any re-enactment would happen that resembled any issue from my past‚Ä¶now i just take a breath, ask God for direction and to rid the crazy thoughts and ask for clarity and to keep me focused to get thru the situation. I teach people accountability and respect for self and others. It is not something many possess. Self centeredness and selfishness take the place of this most of the time. I am no saint thats for sure, but i do know something about change and self care never had the tools growing up so made it up the best i could and i have invested the last seven years to change. I have read, gone to seminars, listened to sermons, gone to church, prayed, meditated, music, healthy people, meetings, and most of all been willing to let go. I was a hoarder of emotional baggage. I stored everything for fear of being caught off guard at any particular situation. I would always be prepared and instead of living I would just be surviving. big difference in the two. i could never say i love you and mean it or be attached to it, today i feel that light that emits from the emotion. it has been a long tedious test of will and determination but i am proud to say at this point i dont hurt as much, i dont whine as much, i dont pity pot as much, and when i do‚Ä¶it doesnt last as long‚Ä¶.life is to short for one second of pain to keep you from living a healthy life of constant change. we lose things the older we get so what we can cherish why not keep it. I challenge you to invest honestly in your being in your life, and in your quest for happiness that doesnt exist in a pill, a bottle, another person, a job, money, family, but comes from within and is fed by a living relationship with God. Tis‚Äô the season for giving‚Ä¶how bout you give your love ones the gift of Jesus christ and salvation? because as fast as life is..wouldnt you want them to be saved ‚Ä¶then wait and then you never get the chance‚Ä¶just something to think about. well, gonna go work out ..something i still dont like‚Ä¶.but i do it anyways‚Ä¶.did you hear that? do it ANYWAYS‚Ä¶..and do it with a smile! love you guys.

I post videos and play music that helped me in my journey to peace. I hope that maybe something will inspire someone who is hurting. This video though is not about something many can openly talk about, its about the point in life when you have hit the bottom, no where left to go, no where left to run and hide, its the end of the road it is the do or die. there have been so many nights that i layed there in a stupor asking, begging, for change and for God to take away the emotional pain that kept me in bondage day in day out, not because i drank day in day out, it was because i could not let go of my shame, my guilt, and my backpack of misfortune. I had tried it all, tried all that could take the pain, and in the end i was in a puddle of mud, face down and no where left to go, i still fought God. I still ran and i still hid. I reached the point of no return a couple years ago‚Ä¶.I have never told anyone this but I was ready to end it. Ready to quit trying. I didnt want this life anymore that had granted me so much pain so much rejection and so much emptiness. I reached my end and I managed the energy to crawl into a church in arlington texas. I fought back all the reasons why not to go in and ran in‚Ä¶.to a friendly face, and i kept going back even if i wasnt changing much, i knew that i could not keep living life the same it hurt to bad, my stomach was in knots all the time, my nights were filled with dreams of death and destruction. I could not go on. Then on one sunday i was there and I had been telling people in my life I was going to get baptized for about a year and never did it. On that sunday they were doing open baptisms and a voice louder than i have ever heard went off in my head and said ""stand up""! it is time‚Ä¶so with my legs full of fear and felt like a ton of concrete i made it to a preacher in the hall‚Ä¶and he asked me what was i doing this for? I said without thought ""I dont want to go to hell"". Of course he wanted me to say I was giving my life to Jesus/God. I didnt know I just knew i needed this dirtiness to go somewhere, and i kept going ‚Ä¶until i went under and it felt like every ounce of my body was frozen and then as i came up‚Ä¶the chains were gone. I wanted to keep that feeling and even as great as it felt and I kept going to church, i made a mistake‚Ä¶i leaped out to help the ones that didnt want it and i gave up all my cleanliness and traded for their dirtiness. It wasnt no time before i backslid.This went on for about a year or more and I just got myself away from everyone that caused me doubt, caused me pain, and took from me., and i went on a sabitical if you will for my salvation once again, not saying i was unsaved, because i wasnt but i started to live by obedience not just luke warm. Today I dont have many friends, i dont go out alot, if ever. When i do i make sure its a safe place for my salvation and serenity. I pray alot more, give thanks MORe and not ask for things that arent realistic. I quit making my God small and give him everything. I work in a prison and I would never make it there without my God. He protects me daily and keeps me safe emotionally and physically. I also read alot more‚Ä¶.i saturate in the word, and I dont lie to myself or others. I quit TRYING and started DOING. even afraid ‚Ä¶this isnt to save anyone but it is a way to reflect on my journey‚Ä¶if it inspires dont stop‚Ä¶I knew anytime i heard just pray, give it to God it would anger me, because I didnt believe and I was angry at God because I kept score of all the things that werent answered‚Ä¶.instead of all the miracles daily that were provided for me. well‚Ä¶.im gonna go to try and sleep‚Ä¶.God bless you all! and much love.

The Conception of Jesus Foretold
Mary, a virgin, was living in Galilee of Nazareth and was engaged to be married to¬†Joseph, a Jewish carpenter. An angel visited her and explained to her that she would conceive a son by the power of the¬†Holy Spirit. She would carry and give birth to this child and she would name him Jesus.
At first Mary was afraid and troubled by the angel‚Äôs words. Being a virgin, Mary questioned the angel, ""How will this be?"" The angel explained that the child would be God‚Äôs own Son and, therefore, ""nothing is impossible with God."" Humbled and in awe, Mary believed the angel of the Lord and rejoiced in God her Savior.
Surely Mary reflected with wonder on the words found in¬†Isaiah¬†7:14 foretelling this event, ""Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign: The virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and will call him Immanuel.""¬†(NIV)
The Birth of Jesus:
While Mary was still engaged to Joseph, she miraculously became pregnant through the Holy Spirit, as foretold to her by the angel. When Mary told Joseph she was pregnant, he had every right to feel disgraced. He knew the child was not his own, and Mary‚Äôs apparent unfaithfulness carried a grave social stigma. Joseph not only had the right to divorce Mary, under Jewish law she could be put to death by stoning.
<p style=""font-family: inherit; font-size: 12px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; margin-top: 1.5em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; text-decoration: inherit; ‚Äú>Although Joseph‚Äôs initial reaction was to break the engagement, the appropriate thing for a righteous man to do, he treated Mary with extreme kindness. He did not want to cause her further shame, so he decided to act quietly. But God sent an angel to Joseph in a dream to verify Mary‚Äôs story and reassure him that his marriage to her was God‚Äôs will. The angel explained that the child within Mary was conceived by the Holy Spirit, that his name would be Jesus and that he was the Messiah, God with us.
When Joseph woke from his dream, he willingly obeyed God and took Mary home to be his wife, in spite of the public humiliation he would face. Perhaps this noble quality is one of the reasons God chose him to be the Messiah‚Äôs earthly father.
Joseph too must have wondered in awe as he remembered the words found in Isaiah 7:14, ""Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign: The virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and will call him Immanuel.""¬†(NIV)
At that time, Caesar Augustus decreed that a census be taken, and every person in the entire Roman world had to go to his own town to register. Joseph, being of the line of David, was required to go to Bethlehem to register with Mary. While in Bethlehem, Mary gave birth to Jesus. Probably due to the census, the inn was too crowded, and Mary gave birth in a crude stable. She wrapped the baby in cloths and placed him in a manger.
The Shepherd‚Äôs Worship the Savior:
Out in the fields, an angel of the Lord appeared to the shepherds who were tending their flocks of sheep by night. The angel announced that the Savior had been born in the town of David. Suddenly a great host of heavenly beings appeared with the angels and began singing praises to God. As the angelic beings departed, the shepherds decided to travel to Bethlehem and see the Christ-child.
There they found Mary, Joseph and the baby, in the stable. After their visit, they began to spread the word about this amazing child and everything the angel had said about him. They went on their way still praising and glorifying God. But Mary kept quiet, treasuring their words and pondering them in her heart. It must have been beyond her ability to grasp, that sleeping in her arms‚Äîthe tender child she had just borne‚Äîwas the Savior of the world.
The Magi Bring Gifts:
After Jesus‚Äô birth, Herod was king of Judea. At this time¬†wise men¬†(Magi) from the east saw a star, they came in search, knowing¬†the star¬†signified the birth of the king of the Jews. The wise men came to the Jewish rulers in Jerusalem and asked where the Christ was to be born. The rulers explained, ""In Bethlehem in Judea,"" referring to¬†Micah 5:2. Herod secretly met with the Magi and asked them to report back after they had found the child. Herod told the Magi that he too wanted to go and worship the babe. But secretly Herod was plotting to kill the child.
So the wise men continued to follow the star in search of the new born king and found Jesus with his mother in Bethlehem. (Most likely Jesus was already two years of age by this time.) They bowed and worshipped him, offering treasures of gold, incense and myrrh. When they left, they did not return to Herod. They had been warned in a dream of his plot to destroy the child.

Interview with God
¬†
I dreamed I had an interview with God.
""Come in,"" God said. ""So, you would like to interview Me?""
¬†
""If you have the time,"" I said.
¬†
God smiled and said: ""My time is eternity and is enough to do everything; what questions do you have in mind to ask me?""
¬†
I said ""What surprises you most about mankind?""
¬†
God answered:
""That they get bored of being children, are in a rush to grow up, and then long to be children again.""
¬†
""That they lose their health to make money and then lose their money to restore their health.""
¬†
""That by thinking anxiously about the future, they forget the present.""
¬†
""That they live as if they will never die, and they die as if they had never lived‚Ä¶""
¬†
God‚Äôs  hands took mine and we were silent for while and then I asked‚Ä¶ ¬†""As a  parent, what are some of life‚Äôs lessons you want your children to  learn?""
¬†
God replied with a smile:
""To learn that they cannot make anyone love them. What they can do is to let themselves be loved.""
¬†
""To learn that what is most valuable is not what they have in their lives, but who they have in their lives.""
¬†
""To learn that a rich person is not the one who has the most, but is one who needs the least.""
¬†
""To  learn that it only takes a few seconds to open profound wounds in  persons we love, and that it takes many years to heal them.""
¬†
""To learn that there are persons that love them dearly, but simply do not know how to express or show their feelings""
¬†
""To learn that money can buy everything but happiness.""
¬†
""To learn that two people can look at the same thing and see it totally different.""
¬†
""To learn that a true friend in someone who knows everything about them‚Ä¶and likes them anyway.""
¬†
""To learn that it is not always enough that they be forgiven by others, but that they have to forgive themselves.""
¬†
I  sat there for awhile enjoying the moment. I thanked Him for his time  and for all that He has done for me and my family, and He replied,
¬†
""Anytime. I‚Äôm here 24 hours a day. All you have to do is ask for me, and I‚Äôll answer.""
¬†
""People will forget what you said. People will forget what you did. But people will never forget how you made them feel.""

Blinking cursor how have you been? I have wanted to come pay homage but its been so long. I want to update, well I have my own business finally and 
have a fairly good job during the day. I am living in a town that is neither bad nor good. I have much more limited friend base then i have ever had in my life. 
I recently found out one of my ex girlfriends is engaged and I am happy for her. I wish her the very best she deserves it. I have had some ups and downs lately and 
mostly feeling emotionally tired and drained. I have had some conflicting thoughts and desires. I am not by any means where i was almost nine years ago
when i started writing this journal. I¬†have grown and in ways just learned to adapt to life better. I still struggle with holding on to things that could potentially 
be a danger to me. I work with criminal offenders still after all this time. I moved here to work in a prison and it lasted two and a half years. it was a hard time
and brought back some of the old wounds to the surface. there was alot of abuse at that place. Alot of pain and emotional determent. I sit here forever changed from the 
experience. I thought it would teach me something and i came out of it emotionally scarred for life. I feel like all my feelings are off and i cant shake the constant fear of
something getting me. I remember before i went to work at the prison i was lost due to a relationship that ended badly and i was bitter. it has been a constant in the 
last couple of years bitterness and dispair i dont know what it is really. I try to look on the positive side of most things and still it haunts me like a plaque. I read my bible i pray
i try to do things that i know help in times of darkness. It just has stayed lately. I guess its the fact that i have not accomplished the things that i thought mattered before
i allowed someone in. those things in retrospect are stupid and petty. i am here with money, with success and still sitting watching the rain fall outside‚Ä¶..alone as i sit in this
chair. The same i was years ago when i started writing in this thing. I guess for some reason i still hang on to crap? hang on for the sake of not being able to let go. 
I sit here in this office and just think and wonder‚Ä¶.think and wonder ‚Ä¶analyze‚Ä¶‚Ä¶worry‚Ä¶.allow shame/guilt to enter my mind as i fight so much to be healthy. I have relived this
for so many years‚Ä¶.such a long long long long road to haul this baggage down. I have worn myself out to the point of exhaustion. I¬†have torn myself up to the point of shreds
Lying all alone in bed
Crazy thoughts running through my head
Thinkin‚Äô about you
Tryin‚Äô hard to let it go
My head says yes but my heart says no
I wish I never had to choose
I‚Äôve been walking down the same old road
Tryin‚Äô hard to forget you
But I just can‚Äôt let you go
I still think about you
Do you think about me?
I still think about you
No matter where you go
Just as sure as a cold wind blows
I still think about you
Do you think about me?
Baby, I remember when
You and me were best of friends
We crossed our hearts and swore it lasts forever
But I guess that lovin‚Äô me
Was just a temporary thing
And I wish to God that we were still together
I hope you found what you were looking for
It‚Äôs been 3 years, a lot of tears
Ain‚Äôt got nothing but this song
I still think about you
Do you think about me?
I still think about you
No matter where you go
Just as sure as a cold wind blows
I still think about you
Do you think about me?
When you‚Äôre all alone
When you need a friend
I guess it doesn‚Äôt matter
‚ÄòCause what we had we‚Äôll never have again
Lyin‚Äô all alone in bed
Crazy thoughts running through my head
Thinkin‚Äô about you
I still think about you
Do you think about me?
I still think about you
No matter where you go
Just as sure as a cold wind blows
I still think about you
Ohh‚Ä¶
I still think about you
Do you think about me?
I still think about you
Yeah‚Ä¶
No matter where you go
Just as sure as a cold wind blows
I still think about you
Do you think about me‚Ä¶?

now this is what is going on and i will continue to keep writing like i did for years‚Ä¶..i will make this work i can do it ‚Ä¶i will do it and i am a survivor‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶i think about you‚Ä¶.i think about me‚Ä¶.i think about the moments of the tribulations ‚Ä¶..and success.

¬†hey diary,
Just sitting here after working out for a bit with my mind going round and round. I have tons up there and no real conclusion. I am just thinking about my place in life, i wish i could just be content with what i have accomplished so far in life. I know that i have no one to compete with, but still i feel unaccomplished. I just want to have someone that has my heart in her hands that doesnt have a million issues that have to be ironed out, or past issues that can stir their head up at anytime.
So many tears that swell up in my mind,
so many questions as the tides turn to rhine
the distance of a love ones hand, the turn of 
the clock one more day and im still stuck.
the gears grind in my head as the ashes fall from
space the memories fall around me as the night sky
shows the grains that could have been‚Ä¶.one more 
day chagrin.
There are moments and glimpses of hope as the 
frowns turn to smiles and then and only then the 
hope from existance allows me to continue on.
Running and dodging words of accusations that only
seem to harm, the total the final the laughter and 
only see the teeth in your face as I wish to only 
punch it and extinquish the flame that only seems
to burn each step of the way my heart beats. 
i ran in my past , i scored accolades, i had the world in my 
palms as now i look forward to a world that doesnt make sense
to much confusion to much pain‚Ä¶each step its all frozen acidy 
rain. There are families destroyed by the lack of structure and 
guidance, there are many destroyed by their own face.
To hurt to see the light to blind to let it in and see thru the dark
that has been the curtain call for years., its the status quo of the
desire of the craver.., the piercing of the skin as the blood flows
the rush of adrenaline as the pain the dark will soon be over
the pupils dialate as the skin starts to sweat the heart starts to beat
to the sound of a echo from the last train ride., here it comes wait in side
as the whistle sounds and then burns‚Ä¶.the soul is free from all that bounds
it to a memory that his mind cant erase.., for years this is the escape that
never has a beginning and the end always ends with tears and regret.,
there are moments that quitting sounds great, but then his skin takes a 
break to take yet another train ride inside the torturous heart‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ drifting off
to the beaches of yesteryear the heart starts to slow‚Ä¶.the burn calms as the
embers blaze on throughout the night‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.one more lost fight‚Ä¶..

writing always has helped me in the past well i dont know exactly what the poem is about but figure it out and tell me‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.i feel better already those words were going round and round in my head‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.ill be on my way‚Ä¶..peace*

¬†Speak of the devil
Look who just walked into the room
The guilt invaded
Notion of someone I once knew
All the perfects moments are wrong
All the precious pieces are gone
Everything that mattered is just
A city of dust
Covering both of us
Did you hide yourself away?
I can‚Äôt see you anymore
Did you eclipse another day?
I used to wake up to the colour of your soul
Did you hide yourself away?
Are you leaving through the ghost?
Did you finally find a place
Above the shadows so the world will never know?
The world will never know you like I do
So many silent sorrows
You never hear from again
And now that you‚Äôve lost tomorrow
Is yesterday still a friend?
All the bridges we built were burned
Not a single lesson was learned
Everything that mattered is just
A city of dust
Covering both of us
Did you hide yourself away?
I can‚Äôt see you anymore
Did you eclipse another day?
I used to wake up to the colour of your soul
Did you hide yourself away?
Are you leaving through the ghost?
Did you finally find a place
Above the shadows so the world will never know?
The world will never know you like I do
Like I still do
Did you hide yourself away?
I can‚Äôt see you anymore
Did you eclipse another day?
I used to wake up to the colour of your soul
Did you hide yourself away?
Are you leaving through the ghost?
Did you finally find a place
Above the shadows so the world will never know?
The world will never know you‚Ä¶<br style=""font-family: verdana; background-color: rgb(60, 60, 60);‚Äù />

sitting here thinking about the stillness of the night., thinking of all the times that have just went by ‚Ä¶..slowly and fast as the rain drops used to fall outside the window. I am thinking about where my life has gone, where it has came from and all the things that are different. I woke up to find a bed empty of accusations, a bed empty of shame. I listen to the wind as it calls my name. I
often wonder exactly what happend to you mom, what happend to you dad? how did this place become so sad that only questions remain?
they say a ghost is like a figure with no soul and with no real existance but a shadow of previous self. You ask many times in life why? where?
and when ? and only to figure out a moment of time that it was just that a moment that wont repeat itself or ever be the same. One day I wont be here anymore and only these words will live on forever as a legacy to my life ran by my inner thoughts and inner pain. We all have it, the ability to filter out just so much then and only then will it finally invade the stillness of the night ‚Ä¶to engulf you with desire to engulf you with moments that wont be again. It has gotten to the point where it is neither good nor bad to do as you do‚Ä¶.it is just kind of expected ‚Ä¶.anything to rid the pain. ‚Ä¶.to rid the memories of yesterdays yore. i see the faces on the streets and yet not one has a familar hue, we always lack what we want as new‚Ä¶..then the moment comes when it is achieved then and only then‚Ä¶‚Ä¶it is gone by self or life circumstances. waking up to the sound of the clock hitting midnight‚Ä¶.waking up to the sound of a thud when you dont know whether it will kill you or just a ghost of yesterday. IN the moments of air that come so smoothly and so crisp in those times enduring the calmness of space as it just goes thru the organs and for one moment in time alive‚Ä¶..finally alive‚Ä¶then as soon as you mutter the sound‚Ä¶.its gone. Only to engulf the faces as they give me a weird look as though i dont belong. oh well ‚Ä¶.one day all this wont matter in the madness of the picture on the walls‚Ä¶as they drip the ink as it runs down your face can you feel the ether as it burns you inside and out.., can you feel it ache and burn and pour from the veins of insecure dilusion‚Ä¶..run it run it‚Ä¶.til you cant feel no more‚Ä¶..

Speak of the devil
Look who just walked into the room
The guilt invaded the notion of someone I once knew‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.shinedown ‚Äù through the ghost‚Äù
So, happy that this site is back up and running. I have wrote in here since 2013. I am sitting here currently
reflecting on a weekend worth of miles that have been driven in my mind and my heart. I have recently started
so have more of a calm notion about life and the expectations I once had about it.¬† I go back to work tomorrow and
really just not dreading it at all. I have a new found notion about life that is this. All the times we spend dreading some
event usually just makes ya tired and its futile because it will come and eventually go. Why not just lace up and get thru
it. I felt a person tonight I havent felt in a long time. Four months to be exact. He felt strong and motivated. He felt like
he had never left. As, I sit here thought a soreness is creeping up but its a winners soreness. I may not be anywhere near the path I once
blazed but I know one thing for sure I will get there again. This song helped me through some tough nights while I waited for the meds
to kick in or even for the tears that fell to finally cease and the spasms stopped. I know that I haven‚Äôt really spoke in debt of my adventure
but it was definetly one of the battles I have faced in my life time. If you are dealing with any health issue I would say to keep going and know
your limitation and always pray no matter what! without God I would not be able to sit up much less walk‚Ä¶.All Glory to him!¬† I dont have a
lot to say tonight but just happy that open diary is back up and running. I have many memories on here that carved out the roughness that
ultimately created this guy you see today. The reflection I see is a man on a journey that has lots of life left to live and many things to see
love to give. Well, have a great night! Martin

Song: tin man :miranda lambert
mood: racing
Good evening,
Thought I would sit down as this song plays and empty out my head. I have really had a great day but for some reason after I got home I started feeling really lathargic and a little down. I often wonder if its the pain from the blown disc that I am healing from or its something else going on. I have started to work out again slowly and I continue to address my physical well being. I went to lunch today with a very interesting, funny, beautiful woman. She was very able to hold a conversation and be attentive to the conversation. Definately a plus. I am ready to start traveling again and today I think that is part of the downess if you will, its wanting to get up and goooo, I am a traveler and I am tied down to my job and its relentless. I will make it on the road again I am sure. I have been thinking of alot of things as the time goes by. It feels like I have been sleeping and now just waking up. It is a weird feeling to say the least. I see the pics, I see the status‚Äôs but for some reason it feels like I am thawing out? I know that makes no sense at all.¬† I really have alot to be thankful, this familiar feeling is just a recurrance of fear and unknown. I tend to try to sabatoge good things even before they present themselves. I am trying to not text this person non stop or even act like I am really into her. I sooo could be most deft. I know I am sounding crazy but hey thats why i use this page for to unleash these thoughts so no one really knows what I am thinking or the fact that I am able to just vent to myself. LOL I guess I will get cleaned up and try to get to bed and get some sleep. Have a great one ya‚Äôll‚Ä¶..mar10

mood: lathargic and full of doubt
I have written in this since 2003 and I was reading some of the entries and just seeing the growth I have made and still how life just seems to repeat itself in some areas. I have read on how life was so confusing and unmanageable I could not stand myself or anyone in my immediate path. I am writing today because of some of the same type issues even so many years later, medication later. I still have not been able to sustain a relationship with anyone longer than a couple of months. Well, the difference is that i am financially stable, have anything i need or want. I dont struggle like I once did in those areas and still its like

song : drowning by chris young
mood; spacey and inquisitive
Dear Patricia,
Sitting here listening to this song, makes me reflect on the things that have happened. At the beginning, of this song it states the person would call and please leave message in your case it was can I call you back? You know, I met you in 2004 as a intern at clover house, when I walked through that door you had the biggest smile on your face, the most radiant aura of anyone I had ever known. I was months into my own sobriety but wanted this so badly. You asked me ever done groups? uh, no Pat I have 0 hours. Oh, dont worry about it you are going to do great!! Now get in there. I went in and as a person with many of my own issues going on , I stumbled through the paperwork, the time frames, the program direction, the temperament of a counselor, and my relationship that I was neglecting for all the time it took to be a counselor. I almost gave up, and each time you would encourage weekly and give me re-assurance that I was right where I was meant to be. I stayed with your for six months then headed back to dfw area and thought I am never going to come back to this place. Such a great lady in a sea of darkness and despair. I was wrong!
I kept up with you throughout the years and even asked for guidance, one of the only people in my life that I truly trusted with all the insecurities of my being, the mistakes I made, the failures that I endured. I kept at it, and finally became licensed. I came back to visit as I often would when I was in town. I came to your first office, one office and a receptionist area. It was a vision you saw that many never guessed would happen.¬† Then another visit another office, Martinnnnnn!! you want that office? I could use some help! you cant afford me Pat! lol, okay mijo just know you always have a place if you ever decide to come back this way. Years went by and the next visit is where the current office is and it was fresh with new paint, new windows, new offices, new hopes, dreams and your vision. I shared my own progression, and you asked for any new knowledge I could contribute since she shared with me. That is how we did it, we would bounce ideas off each other and give each other booklets, ideas and dreams. I left that day back to east texas, thinking could i come back to work with her? during this time was still running from my own demons even though i was sober and a counselor still had not became the man I am today typing this. After opening up Spring Hope recovery and having my best trial and error in east texas it was time my mom was getting out and i came to visit once again. This time, I wasnt coming back to east texas and really did not know what i was going to do with my life. i took a couple weeks off and i gave pat a call. is there anything you have up there that i can do? file papers? audit? ill do anything just to get back in the swing of things. sure, come on! that is how it began six years ago. During that time, I grew as a man, not because I did much on my own growth but i finally saw what she had told me all those years, be kind to yourself martin! always buy the shoes! always go on vacation! you know i traveled more in three to four years when i started then a lifetime, and it was due to her making it so i could, schedules, salary, and inspiration. You could have a five minute convo with her and realize it lasted an hour. I always went in there like the student continuing to learn from the teacher. I always never saw myself as equal and still had a lifetime to gain that kind of knowledge, but she saw differently. when she brought me to san angelo, she told me ‚Ä¶.i know its in great hands, and i dont worry with you here. fast forward dec. 15th it was a typical day at alpha, we called her to vent and to whine looking back on it now, she was coughing and had a squeek in her voice, i instantly came to reality. Pat are you okay? yes, i am going to the dr today., Pat do you have covid? quirete; tonto! shut up idiot! the last words she would ever say to me. I have not slept a day since really good, I have went through sessions with the integrity and vision she represented and i stepped up my game, i was not going to let her down , i made that promise years ago. Then she left. I have yet to cry to deal with it. I am writing in this because it gives me the things that i need to get out. I wake up every day reaching to share a piece of good news, a joke, a funny story, or even a question and all that remains is a phone with your name in it. i have no voicemails, no funny texts, no memories but all in my head. I miss you so much! I know that it wont really hit¬† me until i go to midland office and you dont yell my name, you dont come around that corner or are there vacuuming ,¬† I am trying pat to use all the tools you left with me and be the best I can for the dream you started so many years ago. I know the passion you had, i would always wonder how does one care so effortlessly?! but since you left i have noticed myself re-arranging my emotions and making it not about martin, but about my fellow man. Thank you for the memories, and the belief I too could be great! I will always hold you close to my heart my dear friend! Much love!
¬†

Have not written in here in quite awhile. I must update with somethings that are going on. I have been on my new job for four months now and it is pretty chill. I started school, and in my second week and all is going well. I have been having headaches, red hot face, headaches, and just not feeling all that great in the last two weeks. I dont know what could have caused this because up until that point I had restarted working out, eating better and such. I got into a verbal altercation with my father and it shook me for a bit but I was okay after. I have just this feeling that something is looming on me and I cant define what?! Its like I spend all day hearing about this tragedy or that tragedy and often times I feel like I deal with it okay but who the heck knows? I am sitting here just emptying my brain because honestly I dont talk to alot of people. The people I do confide in are not very good listeners. So, I just tend to keep my stuff to myself. I do the social media thing and often times it just gets old. I dont have a gf and no children to pacify¬†the family dynamic. I guess life is just life and there are so many things that are stimulating at this point in life that this new job took away alot of the old job stressors and its almost like my mind is creating issues when there is none. Amplifying things when in reality it isnt that bad. I am heading to my condo this weekend for the three day weekend to just unwind and not cater to anyone or anything. It is always a great retreat and getaway. I have been talking with this woman for a bit and it appears its going well? she hasnt blocked me yet or ghosted so I guess that is a good sign. lol‚Ä¶..funny how i already feel better just by writing. this has always been the cure to the illness that is my thinking‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..have a great day yall.
Martin.¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† PS the breathing excercises dont seem to work, only the sleeping does lol‚Ä¶..

You know drowning can come in many forms. It could be the feeling of suffocation, the feeling of intense longing. In the end it all ends up with you coming up for air just to make it through another day. I have been in the helping field for almost two decades and I left it all behind to find something else to do. I work with probation and kids and its not a bad gig. I still find that there are days when i feel so lost and those feelings of suffocation and intense longing. Then I come up for air. I have always been a fighter. I fight for every laugh, every tear, every underdog that crosses my path. God has always paired me up with caring, loving people in my path. I am thankful for that. Its like I am thawing out from the grief I have not dealt with, the loss of time, space, money, and sanity. All those things are strong enough to walk in a constant state of stress induced‚Ä¶..anxiety. I also have struggled with weight issues for years now and am trying so hard to lose weight and be the healthiest version of myself. I am not a quitter, 2023 is a rebuild. A new time and space. 3.99 isnt a huge price for sanity‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.i just realized how much i have missed this‚Ä¶.even if nothing makes sense. i could always just put the ear pods in and drift away til the feelings are out. I am sitting here about to cry. but not tears of pain, tears of love, tears for another day, tears for all that i have on this day‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
There‚Äôs a barstool downtownWith my name on itThere‚Äôs a party crowd promising a good timeBut I ain‚Äôt goin‚ÄôUsed to be I‚Äôd be thereThrowin‚Äô a couple downBut now one leads to two and two leads to fourAnd before I know it I‚Äôm thinkin‚Äô about
Standing at the end of the driveYour tail lights fading in to the nightScreaming your nameIn the pouring down rainWatching you leave us behindSo I don‚Äôt go out on the townAll the whiskey I had I poured outMy heart needs time to get over you and meAnd that‚Äôs where I go when I drink

dont stop martin, this journey is far from over and great things ahead. keep the process‚Ä¶..trust it.

First and foremost writing in the perspective that I am putting it down on what I see in the world. I watch people‚Äôs eyes and see the lost, the annoyed, the anger. Somewhere to belong. It could be a cold morning, a bank withdrawal that you were hoping would wait, it could be lack of gas money, family member isnt doing to well. The list goes on and on. Its not that you dont belong , its that you wish the place you were at the present felt like you were a part of it without all the emergencies. I have known many that wake with a head full of hatred and heart full of angst. The day is there for the taking and still the look they see in the mirror wont let them see the grace. That look was me. I had times when I would wake cussing out this or that, not happy with anything that didnt end up with a ‚Äúmoment‚Äù or need to change the insanity. I see those looks in the faces of people I cross paths with, how do I know that is what I see‚Ä¶‚Ä¶you spot it you got it or have had it. I feel for these people because I just want to tell them, hey dont know what you are going thru, but it will get better. Unfortunately, that time doesnt live here anymore. If you happen to want to be nice to someone in dispair, they will either tell you to mind your own business or act like they dont hear you. Somewhere to belong. What causes this you ask? how can you make it change. I can tell you the formula but it isnt a quck fix. I drop hints here and there but most of the time they go unnoticed. One you have to have enough and cut all the ties that keep you from moving forward. That in itself is foreign to anyone who is used to the insanity that is their life. Family curse. They can be broken, they can be tamed and they can be destroyed. you must find a place where you belong, where it makes sense. Find yourself before the sand runs out, find your why, your reason to go on that is concrete not a person that may die tomorrow and your motivation goes from fast forward to anger and regression. Find it‚Ä¶‚Ä¶somewhere you belong. Isnt always where you have been‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.

song: Broadway girls Morgan Wallen
Good evening,¬†
Have enjoyed this day for the most part. It has been icy and dreary outside so not a lot¬†of things going on. I was sitting here listening to spottily¬†and emptying my head. I had to do a discussion topic on the word initiative.¬† It is a topic that I believe some in the world lack. It could be the simple need to step up and mention when something is wrong. All in decency of course. Also, it is lact in areas of needing to be proactive in trying to form friendships or even intimidate¬†relationships. It is often left unsaid the desires or lack of and then it is left up in the air to be materialized.¬† I had to do a gut check on this topic due to the fact I feel my initiative¬†is above and beyond. I have always been a go get er. One that doesnt need to be hyped up for a situation or for the fact that winning may be involved. It appears that humanity has lost its desire for some reason or the priorities have been shifted. It is easier to get someone to play video games then to be involved in a conversation. Most do not have the substance to hold a decent conversation and its like probing or almost interrogation. I hope for humanities sake most tings stop being status quo. That get a participation ribbon for just showing up seems to be backfiring on the effectiveness of success. It is viewed as quick and without the desire or heart to achieve and maintain. I speak to people that think ‚Äúoh ill just go do this in life and be rich‚Äù. It is a huge misunderstanding on their part the sacrifice of the situation. That is another thing many fail to want to do‚Ä¶..sacrifice. I currently am sacrificing alot fot the ability to finish up a degree plan to enhance my place in life again‚Ä¶‚Ä¶I never thought that I would be going back to school to progress in life once again. Guess what? , here I am. Is it easy? not at all. There are alot of reading, lots of late night studying. I am not the only one, I know many on the same road but one thing for certain they have the killer instinct to prioritize what they want out of life and go for it. It isnt just doing something hoping it goes viral or no founded research to be able to be speaking on things they know nothing about. Life teaches you alot of lifes lessons sure, but if all it did was teach you the lesson and not how to progress then it was just that. A moment in time that you havent learned how to progress from. There are some that believe just because we can agree on a disruption in time we are in agreement that we both have overcame. It does not happen that way ever. Life never changes that fast without certain things in place. Try to understand your WHY and how to get to the goal. without these things ‚Ä¶., just a dream with no steam driving it. Have a great evening yall‚Ä¶..much love.

It is never easy to have teens transitioning into young adults. They were once the little ones that wanted to spend all their time with you and were so courteous and sweet. They were kind, followed rules and were teachers favorites. Now, it seems that they have grown into reclused, introverted non-verbal hermits. You have doubts about their friends, their likes in music, their ‚Äúedgar‚Äù cuts. Hoping somewhere beneath all that change is that sweet little boy or little girl you were so proud to dress up daily. You may ask how do i get through without giving up? There are some things I am going to discuss with you that is interchangeable. Even though I am speaking for the male regard this is unilateral.
The thuggish mentality: Everyone wants to be a thug or gangsta until it comes to doing gangsta ISH. In general this means that when you are around others you want to be perceived as tough, loyal, able to be independent and down. Inside though you may have insecurities, self esteem issues, depression, anxiety or phobias about the identity that you have no clue what it is. You hang with these individuals out of survival. There is always someone calling the shots. This person has no loyalty to anyone but themselves. You may be doing some low level crimes, pushing pills, vapes, cartridges, etc. Living life under the influence of power and control. How do you get through to someone who has this going on when they get home? They are unapproachable, talk back, angry, demand you leave them alone.¬† You are the adult. Did you hear that? the adult. Never relinquish that role as the leader of the home.¬† You need to be in control of emotions, need to have a calm demeanor to get communication active again. Learn to choose your battles. Never argue with a kid under the influence of chemicals. How did it get this bad you ask? The examples that you show in your household are the outcomes that people gravitate to. You cuss, there will be endless cussing. You yell, endless yelling. You leave no authority in any situation there is going to be chaos and wanting an independence that is not grown into. That leads me to the next situation. Growing into the next phase of their lives. You must educate and guide always. The child knows what the child knows, regardless of having the knowledge. If there is no application to that knowledge there is no attachment to behaviors or thought. You start young. You start guiding and educating rather than punishing and no understanding for the child how to work through the problem to get to positive result. Guide the music, listen to the message‚Äôs that they see to follow as trending. Understand the lingo. Don‚Äôt be an extension or friend to challenge for likes on social media with your young one. If you have made it this far you havent gotten in your feelings and muttered something to the notion of who the f does he think he is. Understand your understanding rather than reacting on emotional stimuli. You after all are the adult or should be. These thugs that run in your midst are just looking for belonging and acceptance. If you give up on them, wont be long til they sit across from my desk with you there as well, being told hey you are out of control. Then I speak to the child. You are an example that you want to see in the world especially your childs. Are you always going to be perfect? No. Is it okay to use it as a teaching moment? Yes. This sweet.loving kid is still in there. They just are in transition. Don‚Äôt blame the peers, you allow them to come over. Don‚Äôt blame the video games, you buy them. Don‚Äôt blame the schools, they arent baby sitters or in charge of raising your child. Believe it or not the fight in most peoples lives is learning how to listen and when to speak effectively. IF you are having a substance problem, or criminal problem it is not a good thing to want to change their behaviors but not be willing to change your own. Excuses arent positive programming units. They are just lack of accountability, and its harder to say do what I say and not do what I do. If you have been locked up or in the criminal element or not around. It is difficult for you to come back in and be parent. You can attempt to gain credit by being present but you will never be trusted until that is gained in time. If they came to see you while you were locked up, or heard about your incarceration. It doesn‚Äôt matter how much you try to use this as an ‚Äúeye opener‚Äù They will see that you are alive, not suffering, and hearing some pretty cool stories from your time away. If you can make it in there, then its not a big deal if they may have to go someday. If you are in small town america there is so much to do to keep them off the streets. Be creative and teach them about the other part of living rather than just sitting in doors fearing the world.¬† These are just some avenues to start with regaining the love of the streets into love in the home again. These streets are romanticized over and over and no matter the useless violence that they hear about or may see. Being an adolescent is a invincible part of life at their age. Your threats, your bribes. your inability to be patient to let the seed grow ultimately leads to having others guide your child in not a so great light. Just food for thought‚Ä¶.and in reality when you were young didnt you have a role you tried to have as an identity.?

Mood: undecided
song: this little light of mine
I am sitting at my desk just listening to the ticking of the clock. Tik tik tik‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Today has been a good day so far, not much going on. I have just watched some crime stuff due to going to get my bachelors¬†in criminal justice. I chose this song because for so long in my journey on this earth my light has shined and dimmed, and shined and dimmed. I guess that is life as I see now. There are times when the dimming is giving the light time to recharge and not burn out. I have been talking with someone for almost a month now and it is going well. There is earthly things obviously that is going on there but hopefully in time God removes and restores. I have a different mindset that I always wanted when I wrote in here, the chase, the struggle, the obstacles. I see years later that life is going very well for me. I have had some issues with past struggles, but I see them and now just overcome instead of diving in headfirst.¬†
Some shine bright, some shine smallThe rains will come and the waters riseBut don‚Äôt you ever lose your lightIn this life you will knowLove and pain, joy and sorrowSo when it hurts, when times get hardDon‚Äôt forget whose child you are
¬†
There have been times I have let the world dictate what my light was doing. I would fight so hard to keep it lit that sometimes I just wanted to give up. I am glad that I did not. I keep giving to people even though I know its not my job to get people to heaven, just plant the seed and the light in the darkness. I hope that those that know me see my light, and see the grace God has in me. I have gotten closer with my parents, and my family in general. I know in the entries I have always had a distance there, but it is finally way better. I am not angry anymore and often times just wonder why had i ever held on to it for so long. ? Spend time with those that mean lots to you, life is short and you never know what will be the last word, the last memory or the last time it will be forever gone. My favorite verse of this song.¬†
One day there will be no more painAnd we will finally see Jesus‚Äô faceSo until then I‚Äôm gonna to tryTo brave the dark and let my little light shine
I had always wanted to get here to see no more pain, and I believe that I have gotten there if just for today. Thank you Jesus, and thank you open diary you allowed me to dump all the madness and move on in this short life. If you are hurting hang on, it ends., and if you need an ear. I am a therapist. leave me a note. Be blessed.
