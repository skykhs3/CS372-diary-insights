Ok…Im really sad right now…and..I dont know why.  Actually…I do…Im lonely
I mean…all my friends are online..all of em…My RL friends and I have grown apart.
I have no social Life…and..No love life
For two years…I spent almost everyday of my life with the same girl….Its really hard to be alone now
I wasnt even really happy with her anyways….but….damn….its hard…I have a “thing” for sooo many people….but..I lack any sort of fortitude to act on it….
I would like to try an online relationship…but…hell…who am I gonna try it on…All my friends of the female persuasion online are hooked up with someone…or..lust after someone thats not me…
Im like…their straight gay man….the one they confide in….
I mean..Im happy to be there for em…but..sometimes…I wish it was another role….oh well
Ill shut up now

Well, I swore to myself that i would not write in here..till i had something happy to say…unfortunetly..I thought I did….but..after further consideration…i believe it’s not.
You see….i went out with this girl i really really really like last week…and…even though the movie sucked…the date was great….we spent the entire night talking…and…holding hands….and..we had a wonderful goodnight kiss.
Ok…now…I have been in a dreamy state of mind ever since. But…something has been nagging at me….
The fact that i am moving to Tenn.
I havent told her….because..its not for sure yet…but….im scared…that..if we have a relationship goin when the time comes…it wont survive…but…I dont think i couldnt..not act on my feelings….damn..i like her…alot…..shit….i feel all my happiness is on borrowed time…i dunno know what to do.

*god damn…parents suck*
Ok..carry on
I have kissed 4 girls in my life. The first was in kindergarten…i think her name was Jessica…..but…maybe she shouldnt count?
The second was when I was 17..and continued until i was 19…The third occured within that time, when my g/f told me to kiss her(we were all drunk)
The last was just a week or so ago….I had a wonderful date…
I just got off the phone with her….saying she can’t handle a b/f right now.  Im not upset at all, even though…I am positive it was something with me…not her…maybe i called too much..or…not enough…
i dont know.
But, I am glad that i experienced it.  My last relationship was two years…and…i was a spinelss buffon who got pushed around in it.  Maybe i was scared, and..thats why this one didnt work…iunno…Im not gonna worry about it, I still like her…and…i would gladly be her friend.
Hey…kinda makes me feel better bout TN?
oh well….
my sinuses are killing me…slowly, and..now I have Bjork in my head.
She said she’ll call back.
We were s’posed to do a double date thing tomorrow, i think we are still gonna go.

I am kinda in a good mood…but…it is a thin veil over a very awful mood.

It is official..I am obsessed.
Every year…around this time…I get into my “spooky”phase…
When…I want to go out..and..scare the shit outta me….
But…I am a closet paranormal investigator wannabe…I have always wanted to do some investigative shit …but…i never have.
Not any more…this year..I am….and…i may be stupid…but…the place I am gonna go…is…rated…as….one of the 25 scariest places in the world, one of the top ten most haunted places in the states, the most haunted cemertery in the world….and…The most haunted place in Illinois.  Bachelor’s Grove.
Which..is..conviently located…15 minutes from my present location.
If want some info bout it….type “Bachelor’s Grove” in any search engine…and..you should get..about…..50 or so…good excerpts about it.
Ok..my plan…
first…i need people to join me
Yes..I admit…I am scared to go in there alone….Anyone would be…especially at night…..i should be ok in the day…..
Well….i think…..tuesday or wedsnday..I sneak(i have to…police dont like ppl in there) in there during the day…and..stake it out…make..a lil mental map of everything in there…maybe take some pics…and…see what i can find..and see*it is said that it is impossilbe to use a complete roll of film in there…and…not capture somethin…*
THen…I will gather my team*heh…it sounds good* and sneak in some night…someone will have to drop us off..there is no place to park..and…the police patrol regulary….I havent been in there….like i said….But…the stories I have heard…and..the pictures i have seen….There is no way….anyone can be prepared for how it is at night…
Ok….there is the blocked road……from the street….you walk in…..the sounds from the street slowly dissappate as you walk deeper into the woods….soon…you are alone in the darkness….you turn on your flashlight….and…the road seems to go on forever….as…you proceed deeper…an mist forms quickly…and…a sudden chill shivers up you…anyone…skeptic or not…can tell this place…is wrong…about a quarter mile in….you see a chainlink fence….eiter open..or locked…no matter…there is a huge hole in the gate….you slip in…you see a small….dinky cemartety* i know..i know..i cant spell*..only bout an acre in area….Bachelor’s Grove lacks grandeur….it shows signs of constant delapidation…the fence goes all away around the acre…woods surronding it on opposite sides….a small pond across from you…there is a large hole in the fence by the pond too.
This is bachelor’s grove.
There are several stories of…a vanishing house…*which..my sister has seen….she went there..and..saw a house….only to find out later…there is..and never was a house there* A weeping mother…..a farmer and his horse who drowned in the pond…a two headed monster/man….and…countless urban legends have originated there….from the Hook…to…the dead boyfriend….*i know…there are no truth to those urban legends….but…..BG…was a great place for people to set it*
I dont believe any of those stories….but..I do believe there is something there.
I wanna find out
who wants it?

Hmm…well…so many things racing in my mind…i hope i get them all down.
Well…for starters….I went to Bachelor’s Grove.
It was day time…i went with my bro in-law, Pete. The only feeling you get from there in the day time..is..sadness…it is a sad place.  A desacreated Cemertary….no bodies claim its home in there….and….countless drunkards coming in…looking for a cheap scare….ruining it…its sad.
I took a roll of pictures…I get them back today…we’ll see if anything turns up…I am still gonna go back there at night.
Another note.
People making people for sorry for em.
I mean…there are people with honest problems..and..tuff ones….like my friend Lenea…but…there are other people who have really..a great life…
there is this one guy….im sure if one reads this that i know..they know who i am talking about.
He has a woman that loves him with all her heart….a child…he has a family….he has love…
And he bitches….
He talks about how he’s all alone…..bs….I would be the happiest guy in the world in his shoes.
You see….my biggest problem i have with him…is…his little escapades online….Several times…I believe he has played with young  girls heads….making them think he loves them…and…letting them fall in love with him…2 of em…i am sure he has….but..im sure there are more.
I just dont get it….The first girl i know of…..she is completely fucked up because of him…
*sigh*
(yes..i am aware that i often try to make people feel sorry for me….and..yes…im tryin to stop)
I am upset….
Ok…I am no longer upset..my hand hurts though…
oh well
i guess ill depart
bye all
"
9,https://www.opendiary.com/m/sadmeatcart/sick-of-bachelors-grove-yet-781449/,2000-10-06,Sick of Bachelor’s Grove yet?,"
Well…my obsession goes on…
I went to BG this morning…and..took another roll of film.
That makes it 3 times now i have been there.
The first time…I went with my bro in-law, Pete.
I saw…and…felt nothing…other…then..pity for the torn and broken cemetary.
The second time…I again felt nothing….just…a glimmer of a presence…and..a feeling of trespassing…I did not stay long…there were some people doin some shady buisness in the corner…i think they didnt want me there either.
This morning…I definetly felt something.
I was alone…and had no distractions.
The second i set foot inside the gates.
WHAM!
the temperature had to have dropped 10 degrees…and…immediatly..my hairs began to stand on end…
Before…when i felt unwelcome…….that was nothing..this time..it was like”GET THE HELL OUT!!!”
I swallowed my anxiety..and…stayed in there for about an hour…moving very slowly..keepin my mind clean and clear.
I heard voices off in the woods….i think(hope) it was just sounds carrin in off the road.
I felt invisible hands brush against me…I felt like i was watched…and…i felt the strong feeling of me being unwanted..
As i walked out ….the feelings stayed with me in the all the way to my car.
As i got in…i belive i had filled my quota…3 times are all I get…all i am allowed…
One can only crossover into a spirtual place so many times before he himself inhabits it.
Maybe that is the ghosts of Bachelor’s Grove….
All the weary eyed travlers…who..venture there..lookin for answers, ghosts, monsters, fear….or death…
Trapped by their own desire to know the truth….Maybe i am next.
Yes…I believe 3 is all they will allow me……
but
I will go again….
One last time…
at night…

Im upset….
Im uptight
Im allright
Ive had the two most interesting nights
Saturday…I broke down
Sunday…I became omnipitent
On saturday….my reality closed in on me…Here i was…a…19 year old…….fat…ugly…..working at a deli…..no future…no hope….just…a failed life before he ever lived
I have no friends….nooone to talk to…
And..parents suck.
I broke
I cried
infact
I died
but…as always….sleep comes..and…washes away the pain….drowing it…..waiting for it to turn up elsewhere.
Sunday
I hung out with my best friend Russ sunday night…
he’s changed alot…
he was always the hot temper guy
he’s  the skinny hothead to my fat levelness
Now
he’s a witch…and….a pot head…..

We talked bout a lot of shit
Bachelor’s Grove
la la la
We both watched asshole for the first time
talked bout how hot that girl on Dark Angel is…

then…we talked bout religion…..society..and..the very nature of man….
Then
it clicked
I get it….i got it…..I know what it is
….
but..i aint tellin….
it’s not something you tell
it’s something you find out
I will…..never…ever be broken down again

It’s funny….my parents ask me sometimes why I hate man.
I hate Man because we have signed our own death warrant.
In High School
I had an environmental class.
We talked about ecosystems…niches…and….the max number of one species a environment can hold.
My teacher asked me once…if i could think of one species of animal that currently has exceceded that number
I said Man.
She disagreed..saying…we are beyond the rules of nature.
I replied telling her..that was the reason why we are.
She sent me out of the class.
She knew i was right.
I am
Most people dont want to admit it.
Most wont
I do…
I know..that man is a doomed species…a….virus that is destroying the world.
I told my parents this once…
they said i was deppressed.
Bah
I am the only one whp see’s this?
We have overstepped our bounds.
We are too smart for the planet’s own good.
We are not rulers…and are merely pawns with big heads.

but..now..Im 21 days from doing it.
So much has changed….
so much…
I am gong to miss my wonderful friends i have online.
I hope this is like my past fear’s of not being online…
I always found a way…or..was..temporary
I really do
You guys are all that keep me in check
I drift in and out of Despair
You guys are the tether that holds me
Im still not good in rl…
I still am anxious..
I suppose i still have a disorder..
I try…but…it’s still there.
perhaps it always will
There are sooo many people i blame for this.
But…mostley..I blame her.
Yes.
I havent complained about her in forever.
She who made me think i loved her
made me stay with her
made me propose to her
3 times
she
she shot me down at my brightest time
I had dreams
I did
Now
Look at me
Im 19….living with my parents…no social life
no foreseeable love life.
no goals
no ambitions
just..thankful every morning that i sleep at night
have dreams
and wake up.
Christ…..i sound like i am a survivor of some illness
DAMN YOU
DAMN YOU FOR MAKING ME LIKE THIS
damn you for making me doubt myself at every turn
damn you for making the fat idiot that i always feared that id become
damn you for being just like my mom
who
in turns a lot of the previous damn’s
DAMN BOTH OF YOU FOR KILLING ME
KILLING MY SPIRIT
DAMN YOU

No

noone knows

that you dont know
that noone knows
maybe
Here’s what I know
I am compassionate
I am attention-starverd
I have morality
I am selfish
I have profound thoughts
I am too self-consicence
I have a grasp of words
I cannot spell
I look into the night
Once, where I only say black, and the horror’s that most definetly lie just beyond it.
Now
I see the absence of light and the horror’s that were always there.
Day..or night….
fear recongizes neither.
fear is always there
you see
It’s not out where it can be seen
It’s inside us
We fear ourselves.
We should.
I like the night now
I prefer it
It has peace…and….closure…..
I am haunted.
I do not know what is wanted of me…
I do not know who it is that demands of me
All i know
I must do it before i leave.
I have an idea..
I hope it’s right.
I do not fear the spirit’s
I only wish to keep a promise i made, to them…and…to myself.
The answer’s i seek may only lie in the promise i made.
I am so torn inside.
I dont know
I feel something in me
I dont know what it is
I need to
maybe it’s who i really am?
maybe…..

A Man drives his car down the road.
He is late for dinner again, His wife always chides him for it.
No…not today, he thinks.
He puts his foot on the gas and races into the woods that lead to his home.
A butterfly dances in the air above the road, oblivious to the danger, it flies…..looking for a meal to sustain it till the next meal.
The man flies down the road, but, being careful of any hazards….but..still flying
The butterfly, tired by it’s dancing about…lands on the pavement to rest for a few moments..
suddenly….the ground begins to shake….and..the butterfly takes flight….
The man sees the butterfly in the road, he sees it’s splendid colours.
He sees the beauty it has
If he had time, he might have wept, for in that moment, he realized what beauty was.
The butterfly felt a rush of air..and….tried to move, but…it was too late.
The man tried to swerve, but..it was too late…..a life was lost.
The Man looked at the crumpled body.
The life was gone, it didnt even look real.
Another man brushed by him, to see if the was any hope….
The man knew there was none…
Right before striking the butterfly, he saw beauty that was beyond him.
He swerved
Into a tree, his bodly flew through the windshield…and….into a tree.
No
there was no hope what so ever.
The man prayed that his wife would know that he loved her, and that he had tried to make it on time, for one last time.
He did not regret what he did.
And, as he walked towards eternity, he watched the butterfly one last time, as it flew over his mangled body

I went to the museum
saw Sue(in case you didnt know Sue is the largest, most complete t-rex found so far)
I love the museum
I really do.
But
Then I came home
My mother came upstairs to use the computer….i walked the dog
Apparently, My mother went online and left icq on…and…Kell started to icq her..thinking it was me…
my mother didnt answer
so…here’s Kell…..thinking im ignoring her…and…arrrgh
my mom finally messaged her….
the nice thing is though..my mother never told me.
I found out lookin at the history.
To make matter’s worse
I left one of my journal’s out
and
of course
my mother read it
She comes down stairs..and…..reams into me…..wondering if that is how i really feel…and…..why am i soo deppressed….

She even had the nerve to comment on my grammar!!!!
I cannot wait to leave now

again
i realized
I am not obligated to write

I can only blame myself
I should have practiced more

what happens when making music stops being fun..and..becomes my job

this…

everything

something

i will want more

Ever notice how people behind “facts” 
It is well-known in most scientific state’s of mind…that….very few things are “facts”
We have no right to say this is absoloutley how this works…or…what this is
We dont know for sure
and we know it
2+2= 4…..that is thus far stood true..but
It is entierly conceivealbe that 2+2 one day will not eqaul 4
We as a species
assume too much
a theory becames a law if it stands the test of time….
time is irrevelent….
Time is a measure
Things change over time
we deal with a degree of ignorance
We dont know
we can only theorize
So
when a person says that a 14 year old cannot think as an adult.
I ask them why
i get no answer?
what am i supposed to think.
They say they have a degree in psych….so?
that tells me that they know what part of the brain releases what chemical and what it does
WHY does it do it
what triggers the response
They look soo deeply into how…they never..ever…ask why
They say experience
someone can experience more in 3 years…than most people do in a life time.
These people
they say what they say….
they say it because i book says it
I ask…what exactly does the book say
they say nothing
They make shielded comments about me…assuming who I am..what I am
I catch them on stereotyping…..
they twist and bastardize the concept of stereotyping and accuse me of it
I call them shallow and closeminded because that is how they are coming across
They call me the same because I dont agree with them
I ask them to explain to me why they think the way they do so I can understand them
They say nothing
They ignore me
They brush me off as noone..
I am noone to them
What am I to think?
I am God
and they are nothing to me then

in this visible corridor
I try to relieve my innermost tensions in the most violent way i can

My Ink runs low
My heart runs lower

But
I suppose it should be that way
What is life

What scares me is that 
I am certain
not that i am unsure.

Because I am still here….
I am all alone
Perhaps by choice
Fuck that
it is by Choice

Why do I feel no relief?

The night is still so young…
and
I have miles to go before I sleep

Where are my promises that I must keep?

I left them in some other Frost poem.
Why must everything be innerelated?

Homosexuality
Homosexuality
how the fuck do I feel about
Homosexuality
well
I am not a homosexual
I have yet to even meet a homosexual.

I probably have.
I wonder how I will end this
will it be tragic
or
will I kill myself?
maybe
Everyone on earth will realize that time is irevvelant…
then…
Time would cease to exist…
then
this night would never end…
but
my pen can still run out of ink
and
my paper can still be used.
too bad everything cant be based in time….
but
if life was based in time…wouldnt it become
irrevellant?

this way
someone will consider me

literary genius…..

In a factory
there was an assembly line.
This line turned lumps of plastic into valves for some assorted appliances.
Each day
this Factory produces millions of valves
Among the millions upon millions of lumps of plastic
there was one
One who could not be broken
burned
or
molded into what it did not want to be
But
It could be thrown out
So
it was.
As it rode to it’s new home, the trash compacter,
the garbage truck carrying it
tipped over
and
out the lump of plastic flew
into a window of a passing car
and
onto the lap of a 5 year old boy.
In this boy’s eyes.
this was not a lump of defective plastic
this
…
this…
was a spaceship.
And
so it was.
For the rest of the day…
this lump of plastic entertained a child
in the far reaches of space.
Then
when the sun went down
so did the spaceship
down
down to the ground
there it lay
a hunk of defective plastic.
But
if a piece of plastic could look back upon it’s life
Which do you think would be happier
A childs plaything..for a day
or

I hear the splatter of rain on the moistend ground
I see myself reflected in the rain-splattered glass
Through an open window
I smell mulch and wet trash
My hat and coat lie soaked beside me
My heart is pounding from the possible adventure
that
i so desperatley seek
But
still
no excitement for me.
Yet
the intrigue of it still keeps me awake.
This dark and looming night
strangely
it calls to me
I wonder what waits out there for me
within
this precipitated dark
I am so captivated by it.
I cannot stop thinking about it…
Even sleep
my constant friend these days
Cannot shake this obsession.
The night calls
i cannot refuse…
Yet
here i stay
Perhaps
my instilled fear of the dark
or
even more so
being alone 
in the dark
holds me back.
Ah
but
there must be someone
someone
out there
striving to join the night
yet 
also
holding back
waiting
waiting
for me…
Here I am
I can wait no longer
I must go

There
it is done
That wasnt so bad
was it?
Like i said before
that was the darkest time of my life.
In the last part
yes
i did go into the night
I am still there
It was my release from the dark
you see
the strange thing is
when
there is no light to guide
The best way to escape
is
to follow the lack of light
Light is not always the way out
Light
is
usually
the shining temptation that destroys you
I am still in the night
but
I am not alone
not for long
I bid you farewell from the darker parts of my mind
What you just read…is most likely the closest i ever had to a suicide note.
I am beyond that
And
as much as i hated being there.
I am still grateful for my chance to experince it
because
it made me who I am today
and
as I had said before
I am God

Man stands in the center of a vast and treacherous forest
In all directions, there are trails.
Man choses on of these trails.
It is a good trail
Not too rough
Not too much of anything
but
a decent trail never the less.
Man walks down this trail for awhile
A storm occurs suddenly
and
A massive tree is felled
and
Clears a way to a larger…smoother
and
an all together better looking trail.
Man stops, 
Looks down his current trail
and
looks at the other one
Man decides he will be better off if he takes the new trail
and
so he does
and
so he is
Man moves much faster through this trail
Too fast
But
man doesnt notice this
He is still very happy about his decsion to change trails
He moves much better
Man continues down this trail
moving
faster and faster
soon
Ahead in the trail
a chasm can be seen
But
Man doesnt see it
or
he does
but
decides
Maybe
It is not really there
or
It will be gone by the time i get there
Man seems satisfied with this
for the most part
But
some of Man is indecided
this part of man doesnt like where this trail is going
This part tries to convince other parts
that
the path they are on
leads nowhere but to death
The other parts ignore this part
so
This part separates from Man
and
Stops
Man walks on
the chasm waits for Man
the part left behind,
enters the woods
this part needs no trail
for
it knows
even though it will be hard
even the forest can be traversed.
and
other trails lay out there.
Man may walk himself right of the chasm
This part
this faction
will live on
and
never look back

Well
2 more days
Well
I shouldnt talk about it like I am going away forever…
I dont know that
In the past
I always found a way to get online.
why should this be any different?
Well
Anyways
this will be the “Im going away for awhile” entry
Most of you who read this
somewhat know me
I would be surprised if someone out of my social circle reads this
bah
Ok
Sunday morning
I am moving to TN
My computer is not going
and
I cannot afford one right now
My parents cannot either
That in it self
means nothing
Libraries all over the country offer internet access
so
I should be alright.
Still
I guess Im covering my ass.
I have started so many friendships online
I cant bear to lose them
In some odd way
I feel I have grown as a person thanks to my friends
I would thank you all individually
but
I would not say the right things
or
I would forget someone
One day
I will
Like i said before
I will most likely find a way online.
Damn
this is scary enough that I am moving away from where i have been my entire Life
but
now
I might lose you guys.
Damn you all
=P
I recently started something
and
I just wanted to let the concerened person know
that
I fully intend to continue this
so
she need not worry her pretty little head
It’s only a lil geography
I hope you are having a good thanksgiving with your self-made pecan pie
And
I hope you all have a Good Thanksgiving
And
I am trully thankful for the friends I have
and
I hope our friendships can continue

I wish I had something to write
I do
But
I dont
I am drained
empty
void of feelings
I am so tired
beat
broken
A thousand dreams assaulted me last night
not one of them
sad
or
good
or
happy
or
bad
They
were
just
there
my memories
19 years of existance
in
a 5 hour span.
It was so overbearing
This is so very new for me.
I went through my life
thinking i had nothing to lose because 
I had 
nothing
I was wrong
so very wrong.
Sure
people fucked me over
they screwed me
they hated me
they ignored me
they pretended to love me
But
you know what?
Fuck them
It’s their loss
I look outside my window
I see birds
I see tree’s
I see the light
My life isnt ending
just my life here
so
I say au revoir Illinois
hello Tennessee(look Kell, I spelled it)
Hello the rest of my life
Im not losing anyone online
They were never tied to me via a monitor
they are tied to my heart
last i checked, it still works(thanks hun)
There is so much beauty in the world…
so much
I have to get a new perspective of it.
How I can I claim divinty
if
I have only seen the world in one place
My eyes are everchanging
the picture isnt
Today
I go to work for the last time
Tomorrow
I will sleep in im my bed for perhaps the last time(will be back for xmas…so..y’all better be online and waiting for my ass)
I think I will have a few more entries before I go
but
I want each of them to count.
But
just because
I have started a theme
i will continue it
In my mind
In my heart
My spirit soars in the heavens
The only boundary I have
is my body.
In my eyes, and someday in yours
I am God

Ok
Come 5 am
Im gone
*sigh*
there are a shitload of things i wanted to do befroe i left
I wanted to go see my grandpa
and
my grandma on my mom’s side
I havent seen her in awhile.
(since she died)
I feel like
I am missing so many things by leaving.
But
i guess
If I experienced everyhting…..I would leave anyways.
There are some people I wish I had a chance to say goodbye too
I hope I will see them again…
Above everything that weighs on my mind
It is being online
yes
i know it’s sad
i am dependent on it
but christ
if it wasnt for my friends online
I would have killed myself awhile ago
I really hope that I find a way back
I do
To those people that I didnt get a chance to say goodbye too
Im sorry
send me an email…or..something
I will get back to you.
My eyes grow weary
I am taking a bunch of notebooks with me…
so
When i come back on Xmas
I will have a bunch of stories for you guys.
But
Now
I must go
heh
I am actually crying….
Bye you guys
see you at christmas

Id like to say first, Im back, sorta
and
second
I am abhorred with my rating
where do they get offf giving me a 76
and
only moderate use of profanity!!!!!
bah
I deserved a much lower score
and
some people deserved a much higher one
well
here it is
Reading “A page in the book of eternity” was a fairly easy task as the blue lettering on grayish-green backround is a good contrast.
The overall color scheme involved blue, dark blue and a grayish-green background. These colors well together to make a good color scheme.
No diarist description is given, but a single sentence in its’ stead. This question grabs your attention right away.
The location (The Land of Far Away) and the title “A page in the book of eternity” are both original. The title gives us pause for reflection.
Grammar use is adequate, writing much in clear fragments.
The diary has 57 entries, tending to be updated more frequently as of late. 
2.90 notes per entry showing relative obscurity of the diary…need to show some shameless self-promotion.
This OD Awards staff member found moderate use of profanity in several entries.
Each entry (including poetry) reads smoothly and cleanly.
This diarist shows unique ability to write about what is on his mind or on the passing thought of the day.
There is a dark, indifferent quality to a lot of these entries that makes them appealing. He shows us hints at something deeper behind most of us entries. His small following of readers have become avid fans.

The reports of my demise have been grossly overexaggerated
I am back
Just as I hoped I would be
and
my fears
gone
I am 
yet again
Happy
I had no idea it would be this beautiful down here.
no idea whatsoever
MY dad tells me it’s gorgeuous
Lenea says i will love it
Both are prolly right
It’s just
wow
I saw the night sky last night
I seriously cried.
I love the night sky
you want an instant feeling of insignificance
there ya go
Im kinda sorta irked cuz i lost my piece of paper that has my address on it…
so
if i get a lil lost
im kinda  sorta screwed
God 
there is something
so
peacful
or
sedative about this place
I never in my life imagined a place like this.
I could just stare out of this distant window forever
looking at the clock
i think i have.

day
uh
have no idea
it’s wed?
right???
bah
I am
and
have been
so very
very
bored
There is nothing for me to do
nothing
Noone’s online
i think
I hope someone calls me back soon about a job
that will atleast give me something to do
Atleast i get phonecalls
=D
I am still perplexed at my od rating
this diary does not deserve a 76
not at all
I sit here listening to my high school band
I miss it so much
The song I am listening to
is
the greatest song noone will ever listen too
I mean
noone cares about band music
Not even classical music people 
cuz
they prefer orchestral work
idiots
they claim to “know” music
Music is so much more than
intervals
minors
and
notes on a page
“funny. how they preach that, yet, refuse to believe it”
It doesnt matter if a saxophone plays it
or
a cello
it doesnt
it shouldnt
This song
it is called
“Apocalyptic Dreams”
by
David Gillingham
No song
illustrates a story
or 
an
image
better than this one
You could try to find it online
but
the one floating around on napster
sucks
As far as I know
there are only two excellent recordings of it
One
by my high school
Lockport Township High School
and
by my former college
Illinois State University
…
you know whats great about music?
It’s different for everyone
the picture we get
the thoughts we think
noone’s is the same
Nothing stimulates the mind
like
music
nothing
*yes, that includes sex*
*but, sex with music……oooooooo yeaaaaah*
I miss people
I miss spending hours online…talking to my friends
only leaving when my eyes can no longer bear to be open.
oh well
la la la
I think ive reached that point
where
I have nothing to say
or
type
yet
I continue
I go on
waiting to cross the point where
it is
just wrong
to continue
and
there it is
i see it now
im almost there
almost
Im running towards it now
im almost there

63,https://www.opendiary.com/m/sadmeatcart/chief-seattles-letter-4259872/,2000-11-28,Chief Seattle’s letter,"
This is one of my favourite written passages
I am posting this to let you know how much i endorse this letter.
It is hard not too
but
following this
there will be a rant…so
be prepared
“The President in Washington sends word that he wishes to buy our land. But how can you buy or sell the sky? the land? The idea is strange to us. If we do not own the freshness of the air and the sparkle of the water, how can you buy them? 
Every part of the earth is sacred to my people. Every shining pine needle, every sandy shore, every mist in the dark woods, every meadow, every humming insect. All are holy in the memory and experience of my people. 
We know the sap which courses through the trees as we know the blood that courses through our veins. We are part of the earth and it is part of us. The perfumed flowers are our sisters. The bear, the deer, the great eagle, these are our brothers. The rocky crests, the dew in the meadow, the body heat of the pony, and man all belong to the same family. 
The shining water that moves in the streams and rivers is not just water, but the blood of our ancestors. If we sell you our land, you must remember that it is sacred. Each glossy reflection in the clear waters of the lakes tells of events and memories in the life of my people. The water’s murmur is the voice of my father’s father. 
The rivers are our brothers. They quench our thirst. They carry our canoes and feed our children. So you must give the rivers the kindness that you would give any brother. 
If we sell you our land, remember that the air is precious to us, that the air shares its spirit with all the life that it supports. The wind that gave our grandfather his first breath also received his last sigh. The wind also gives our children the spirit of life. So if we sell our land, you must keep it apart and sacred, as a place where man can go to taste the wind that is sweetened by the meadow flowers. 
Will you teach your children what we have taught our children? That the earth is our mother? What befalls the earth befalls all the sons of the earth. 
This we know: the earth does not belong to man, man belongs to the earth. All things are connected like the blood that unites us all. Man did not weave the web of life, he is merely a strand in it. Whatever he does to the web, he does to himself. 
One thing we know: our God is also your God. The earth is precious to him and to harm the earth is to heap contempt on its creator. 
Your destiny is a mystery to us. What will happen when the buffalo are all slaughtered? The wild horses tamed? What will happen when the secret corners of the forest are heavy with the scent of many men and the view of the ripe hills is blotted with talking wires? Where will the thicket be? Gone! Where will the eagle be? Gone! And what is to say goodbye to the swift pony and then hunt? The end of living and the beginning of survival. 
When the last red man has vanished with this wilderness, and his memory is only the shadow of a cloud moving across the prairie, will these shores and forests still be here? Will there be any of the spirit of my people left? 
We love this earth as a newborn loves its mother’s heartbeat. So, if we sell you our land, love it as we have loved it. Care for it, as we have cared for it. Hold in your mind the memory of the land as it is when you receive it. Preserve the land for all children, and love it, as God loves us. 
As we are part of the land, you too are part of the land. This earth is precious to us. It is also precious to you.

Ok
upon reading that letter
I realize it refers to holiness and god
but
The Note means little about god
or
religion
er
it does
but
not like
christianity means
We are not anything important
and
at the same time
we are
We are a brick in a wall
without us
the brick falls
but
without
anyother bricks
the same thing happens
I have always believed religion is something we made
to
understand ourselves
and
the nature of life.
I read the Bible
I see it as metaphor
for Us
We concentrate on the wrong things
It is not all about heaven and hell
good and bad
It is about us
it always was
We are the spectrum.
We are God
We are Satan
I am not a religious person
I am spirtual
I believe there is more to life than the physical
but
I also believe it is perfectly natural
we
just havent looked into it
and
i hope we never do
We need mystery
I will never insult someone for believing in God
I dont
But
I understand the need to
for some people
I do not need a belief in a higher power.
I know most people need an organized religion.
I dont
I dont blame them, or the religion itself for the problems it has…or have caused
I blame the churches for destroying the true purpose for the bible
Hell
I belive Jesus lived.
Do I believe that he was the son of God
no
But
I do believe that he was right in what he preached.
But
All the great things he taught and said
are lost
lost because
Children are taught only the word of God that spew from Jesus’s mouth
Jesus wasnt about God
It is not about God
God is an entity created by man
the concept of God
is just that
a concept
God is something in us
a belief
a hope
infact
we are God
God is man trying to press himself into the world
So
Infact
God is the alpha and the omega
That is why I claim to be GOd
because
I am
we all are.

65,https://www.opendiary.com/m/sadmeatcart/11-29-00-2-4259874/,2000-11-28,11/29/00,"
upon rereading my last entry
I realize that i am not clear at all about my beliefs
That is because it is that complex
and
It is something that is hard for me to type
but
again
I am not a religous person
I just believe it all is a metaphor created by the vast and all powerful human psyche(god)
BUt
my rant was lost in that completely different rant
I was orignally going to rant about how I am sick of People claiming something to be refering to God, when it has litte or nothing to do with GOd
One
was that letter
I found it on a site that was saying how the Native American concept of God was different and completely wrong than the “true” and right concept, thus saying why God punished them into death and hell.
That thought process in itself is
idiotic
and
bah
Evenmore so
I stress
THAT LETTER IS NOT ABOUT GOD
IT IS ABOUT US
which
according to my last entry
is
the same
but
I am referring to the percieved God
not
what God actually is…
*shut up J*
YEstetrday
for
some odd reason
I was watching some religous show….
and
they were advertising the “Chronicles of Narnia”
saying how
if you wanted to prove the existance of God to your children….get em it
Now
I admit i have not read the chronicles of Narnia in like
forever
but
I really do not remember a mention of God in there
Actually
or
Implied
So
I assume
those silly christians are drawing those silly little lines of resembelance again.
Infact
my memory of the Lion, the witch, and the wardrobe…..seem to make me think that Christianic Purists would call that the word of the devil
but
oh well
I might be wrong
it has been awhile…
I feel that this has been a pointless and annoying series of rants
but
oh well

Why am I here
I find myself in a place
completely unfamilar
a place
where
I speak funny
and
look
even funnier(or hellish…pends who you ask)
I am sooooooooo lost
I could point out..and..tell you anything..about…any animal from Illinois to Wisconsin
and
most of the midwest
nothing surprised me
I knew it all
Now
I see a bird
and
I have no friggin clue what it is
everything.
Even at night
things are different
the nights…are…sinister here
No…It’s sinister because I dont know what is in the dark
it’s sinister because…I can feel it
the icy edge…knife like
cold
unfeeling
indifferent
There are spirits here…just as anywhere else
but
they are angry..so very angry
Each night
I feel them…
They are just as upset as the spirits at BG
And
they are everywhere
They are several violent ones around the apartment I am moving into in a few weeks
I am looking forward to it though…
In the past 3 months
I had been working so very hard to improve myself in a spiritual sense
I see things now(No, I am not insane..or..on anything…just…trust me..k?)
They are there..always are…you just havta know what to look for
and
feel
…
I got a forward today…
It was one of those surveys
One of my old high school friends sent it
and
contrary to my usual behaviour
I filled it out.
Yes
I know
nothing big about that…but
it was huge to me
I never do those
.
I did another odd thing today
I heard a telemarketer out…
scary..
….
Although I am lost…
I do enjoy the surroundings
It is so..
bright
and
colourful
Even,
the nights
albeit 
sinister
are beautiful
..
I do hope I find the beauty in the way of living down here
I hope I see it
I hope the light is real
and
the beauty is true.
The night is dark and sinister.
I am open and true
I will find the answers I seek
and
banish the fear I feel

I mean
There are only so many words
How many ways can you say
I love you
What will happen
when
the words we write
aren’t our words at all
and
someone elses
who thought the words where theirs
when
they arent
It’s kinda deppressing
but
then again
The Fact that we use up all the words
for love
shows that we a truly in love
and
the infinite amount of times 
that the 
same words are used
the meaning is never diminished
perhaps
it is only
multiplied.
Thats not so deppressing then..

My bed is cold
always cold
why is it so friggin cold
the rest of the apartment is warm
hot
actually
But
ever night
I crawl in between the sheets
and
I shiver
Thats how it is down here
On the outside
warm and pretty
on the inside
cold
I had so much pain yesterday
inner pain
why did I hurt?
why do I still hurt
my lip is bleeding now
the blood
a comfort
the iron like taste
a pleasure
a reminder that I
am alive
My eyes ache in the glass prison
I long to shut them
but
I fear the absence of light
so cold
Cold glances, that I recieve
who am I to them?
nothing
i should be nothing
why do they give nothing the benefit of glances
why look at nothing
They can cast their eyes away
They need not fear the absence of Light
They exist
I
am just a passing interpetation of pigments and light
I am nothing and everything
I am here
but Im not
but
to them
I am a game for their eyes
something to observe
something to see
I am a nonexistance that gives them an inane joy
whether they realize it or not
I am God
in that way
and
my bed is cold
so very cold
and
my tears are all that keep my warm at night

74,https://www.opendiary.com/m/sadmeatcart/a-lesson-in-tarot-4259883/,2000-12-03,a lesson in Tarot,"
Ok, there are some misgivings about Tarot
Tarot cards do not predict the future
Tarot will just bring to the surface some things that the subconcious has not noticed
Yes, if you realized some things, you could change things and appear to see the future.
But
Nothing is set in stone.
A Tarot reading is only as accurate as the querer is precise.
Tarot is only an interpetation of one’s perspective.
So
When someone asks me to tell them their future in love.
At best, I can only tell them what their desirable qualities are, and something, maybe deep-down inside they know, Like “I think he likes me”
Tarot is just a method of someone coming to grips with the reality and falsities that the subconcious creates.
Anyone can read tarot cards.
Interpetation and procedure only define the quality of the reading.
Yes
some people have latent “power” in them.
and that shows in the quality of the reading, and what other things one can do with a tarot deck.
When dealing with the supernatural
A Tarot deck is an invaluable tool for understanding
but
that is another lesson
for
another time

Empowerment
it’s an interesting word
The ability to give power
There are times
I feel empowered
I do right now
empowered by my self
empowered by this little fire inside of me
this little fire that flares up
fires up
burns away my fears
and
inhibitions
A fire with flames
the light
the way to my hopes
dreams
and
destiny
I have always felt that 
nah
I have known I am something different
whether i see the world differently
or
that
The world is different
I know there is something
Something about this…is
not right
That
just beyond the reality
is the truth
I need to find it
you see it sometimes
in your dreams
in your drug induced visions
even when your eyes are open
but
your mind is elsewhere
I know it’s there
I know it
There is a little fire inside of me
It burns redhot
in a cold existance
It is a key to understanding
knowledge
It is a key to myself
and
all of us

77,https://www.opendiary.com/m/sadmeatcart/my-sister-kim-4259886/,2000-12-05,"My Sister, Kim","
I dont talk much about my sister’s
Kim is my younger sister
she is 18
I used to refer to her as the slut sister
because
she had a new toy(boy)
every week
but
for the last year 
she has totally been dedicated to Chad
Chad is a son of one of My mother’s good friends
Chad is 21
Chad has some problems
on the outside
I suppose Chad is “hot”
he is a beachbum
He spends most of time enjoying life
which
in it self isnt bad
but
The boy
at
21
is an alcoholic
and
has an overall substance abuse problem
…
Ok, best let you all get a jist of the situation.
Labor Day weekend 1999
My older sister’s wedding
Kim and Chad met…kinda sorta
Kim and Chad had met years and years earlier, both prolly too young to know.
Chad was living in florida with his twin brother at the time
and
had come up to il to appease his mother.
Basically
Chad and Kim hit off right off the bat
They spent the entire night dancing
In the nice sense….it was very nice
I was happy for her.
Chad never went back to Florida
He stayed up
he stayed for Kim.
And
for a few months
everything was great
Kim was happy
Chad was happy
my parents were happy
I wasnt happy(but that had nothing to do with Kim and Chad…)
My parents and I noticed something about Chad…
his inability not to have a beer in his hand 24/7
Another problem was his lack of making money
He worked at a 7-11 about…..twice a week
He never pursued anything else..
It stayed like that for awhile…
At the end of her senoir year
Kim recieved a 4-year garunteed full-ride to a university
she was stoked.
Chad wasnt
He wasnt willing to let her go a measley 3 hours away and do something she really loved
so
he layed down an ultamaitum(sp??)
If She goes to school….He is going back to Florida.
Kim folded…she gave up her schooling..and…went to a junoir college….
so it went on
It kinda better…
Kim was working steadily….Chad still had his few hours at 7-11
Kim was going to school ….Chad was toking it up
Whenever Kim had free time..she was at Chads….
And then
Chad got a job
a real good job
installing entertainment centers
and
the job payed way more than was needed
Things looked good.
Then…on his last night at 7-11
they threw him a party
he got trashed
he then trashed his car.
And
allthough
He still could have made it work with his new job…
he decided….Cars broke…must go to Florida…
so
He did
And…when the semester was over….
Kim would join him…
Well…
Kim flew into a fit of deppression…
Chad….did…whatever….
he said he would get a steady construction job with his brother…
he works maybe…..once a week…
He goes out every night
gets high
gets drunk
for all anyone knows….gets laid too…
He has no car down there…
and
plans to use Kim’s truck once she gets down there…
leaving her…to get a job within walking distance…
and
killing the concept of school…again.
To make matters worse…
Kim was so deppressed at him being gone
she dropped out of all her classes…
and
He has the audacity to comment on that…
…
Since Kim has met Chad….she has isolated herself from all her friends…
she has been alone…
Even moreso..than…I have…
I have tried to get her to come online at meet my friends…because…i think she would be well liked..and..she’d love them…
but
she usually refuses any advice from me
When she goes down there…
she is going to be alone…
I do not trust Chad to take care of her.
I don’t
Yes
I am being an overprotective older brother…
but
comeon….I didnt list half the things he does
*sigh*
it gets me soo upset…
The sad thing is
She knows it
she knows his problems
she knows whats gonna happen to her
but
she loves him
and
cannot do anything about it.
Unfortunetly…
This has to play out
It’s sink or swim…
I just hope she has the awarness to swallow her pride..and…come home…..if it doesnt work out.
…
She’s my sister
and
she deserves more
but
who am I to comment?

As usual
I am bored
And
I have nothing to say
It is so cold in here
It is cold everywhere
It is so sunny and bright outside
It is almost wrong for it to be this cold
almost
It doesnt smell here
I mean
I cannot smell anything
Not trees
not grass
not the earth
not even anything of man
It has a degree of not being real
Maybe
This is just a dream of mine
and
I will wake up
only to find myself
in my car
drinving to Tn
sleeping behind the wheel
sliding into the other lane..
and
into another car
would that be a kicker
maybe I have already
and
this is the afterlife
my perception of the place..
never knowing my life has ended
never knowing my new life has begun
maybe it never has
maybe my life ended long ago
and
I have been dead for awhile
maybe
Oh

There are a few words
these words
hold a profound meaning
and
they scare me to death
not for what they stand for
not for what they mean
They scare me because
I do not know what reaction they will cause
They are so many particulars that play into it
What if It isnt the right time
what if it is too soon
what if i should have said it last night
or
just now
What if they mean more to me
what if they mean less
what if what if
I long to speak the words
but
my own insercurities hold me back

I am waiting to hear them first

no

you are hurt
That the pain she caused you by leaving

uncalled for

That pain?
It goes away
I know

you
Let go

you throw insults
you throw hate

What does it accomplish

Why
tell me

why

She doesnt deserve this

lash out at me

deep
hidden away from the light

dreams are envisioned

knew

Some awe
all beauty
There is beauty everywhere
in everything
one just needs the patience and desire to see it

What a dream I had
Pressed in organdy
Clothed in crinoline
Of smoky burgundy
Softer than the rain
I wandered empty streets down
Past the shop displays
I heard cathedral bells
Tripping down the alleyways
As I walked on
And when you ran to me
Your cheeks flushed with the night
We walked on frosted fields
Of juniper and lamplight
I held your hand
And when I awoke
And felt you warm and near
I kissed your honey hair
With my grateful tears
Oh I love you, girl
Oh I love you

They bundle up that pain
and
let it out

Whenever I need to
Ill lock myself away

locked away in my mind
with the sounds of Amazing Grace in my Head

I feel the anguish I feel for my friends
changing
not going away

morphing into something pliable
something else

I need music
Music 
in my mind..is the key to it all
the key to self-understanding
Next to tears, music is the most emotionally charged thing
Thats why I love to make it
I love to sit down

play all the lovely melodies

I wish I could show everyone my feelings through the sounds I produce
Hopefully
I will get that chance

yeah….ok
back in Chicago
funny
It doesnt feel like home anymore…
It feels cold and unreal
I spent the morning shoveling…
I will spend the evening doing the same
Heh
Snow is cold
Snow is unfeeling
Snow could be synomous with life
if I bothered to link them
Anything can work like life
because
Noone knows how life works
not until they are dead
Im not really in a typing mood
I just want to curl in the corner of my green room and go to asleep
I spent all day yesterday cleaning the apartment
My dad and I were s’posed to pick Chad up at an exit on our way up
He didint get there til 2 am….
At that point…I had been awake 24 hours
we still had another 9 hours to go
my dad and I spilt time driving…
Chad slept in the back…
Upon arriving at the house
My Dad and I immediatly broke out the shovels and proceeded to dig out the house…
Chad went inside to do who knows what with Kim

Merry friggin christmas

I am soooo bored
so alone
I feel like shit
why?
I didnt do anything
I just do
I feel
awful
Im so 
just
bleah
I need a hug
A
reassurance that everything is good
La la la
Im not deppressed
no
Im not
My thoughts are just plagued
with
images of dark
and meloncoly shadows
of sadness laced light
My heart aches 
My eyes tear
My soul bleeds
My mind thinks
of the happiness I dreamed of
the wonders that are
the fantasies that could be
and the memories that were
I am not deppressed
I am not sad
I am tired
I am sick of this
I hate how they are
I hate how I
must act
…
I sit here
staring
boring
wondering if I should just pick up the phone and call
Is she home?
I dont know
and
my fear overpowers me
And
here I sit
cowardly and miffed
My lips chapped
my head aching
my nose burning
Outside
the snow reflects the streetlight
Night covers the absence
I allow myself to stray into the cold
Letting the soothing burn of freezing
smother my twisting storm of emotion
so
that only the snow is left

the music I hear

Well
Guess What
Im alive
sorta
Actually
Im in some sort of limbo thing
Dream world,
perhaps
but
no dreams
just
abstract reality
Im not here
your not here
just
thoughts
memories
and
emotion
no physical
Just me
noone else
a wandering soul
in
a vast loneliness
..
Im in a religous mood today
I wanna start a new one
A religion without churches
without a father
a priest
a preacher
or even altar boys
no monks
no nuns
no cardinals
no popes
no messiah’s
no gods
just people
No God-fearing
no Satan
no alpha
no omega
just us
A religion that isnt about worshiping
praying
A religion that isnt a religion at all
It’s just…
life
A religion where we can just…live our lives..and 
not worry about whats gonna happen
when it ends
a religion where
kindness and compassion rule
what is right and wrong
A religion where it isnt right or wrong
it just is
A place where we can be grateful for being alive
but
not spending ourlives thanking an entity for our lives
Where the creator is one’s mother and father
where the child is yourself
When one man isnt racked by the desire
for power
or greed
or anything
where monetary value
is just a figment of abusurdity
Where man isnt the ruler of the earth
he is merely just a tenant
But
I lack faith in man to follow this
Man is corrupt
Man is too dependent on all those things to consider it
Man loves power more than he loves himself..and…
his fellow man
..
So
I sit here in my dream world
perhaps
never to dream
yet
I can dream this dream 
cant I?
sure I can
and until
it comes true
Here I sit
In eternity
claiming to be God
til
the title means nothing

This story is the first in my “Short Children Stories for Adults” series
In these stories, I use characters and techniques usually associated with children stories. But the the storyline, although childish, is often better suited for an adult mind…ala Watership Down.
There are only three stories thus far in the series.
I wrote “Skippy” for a friend from High School a little bit after Graduation.  I was a bit crazy at the time and wrote it in her yearbook instead of my name and a cute message.
The second story I wrote for my friend, Lenea, for her birthday.  She had demanded that it must be a happy story and have butterflies.  I did my best.  I hope it was adequate.  You can read it in her OD.
The third story in the series I did on the fly in a Private Message to a friend.  She wanted a story…I gave her one.  Right now, It only exists in my head, but, one day… I will put it here.
This “Skippy” will be actually the third version of the story. The original and best version lies in my friends yearbook.  A few weeks later I revised it in my head and sent it to Lenea via email.  The story was overly the same, but I added too much, and…well…it sucked.
So, Here I endeavor a third time, hoping I can recapture the essence that is “Skippy”
"
102,https://www.opendiary.com/m/sadmeatcart/skippy-the-sapling-4259911/,2001-01-09,Skippy the Sapling,"
Our story begins on a densely wooded hill
In these woods
A sapling had sprouted
His name
Skippy
Skippy was a good, strong sprout of a tree
He had to be if he had made it as far as he has
It is hard to grow in the woods.
All the older trees hog the sunlight, water, and soil
As far as Skippy came
He was doomed
And the older, bigger trees let him know it
They would constantly riducule him about his size
and
his lack of a chance to live
But Skippy stood straight
He wouldnt let their comments shake him
One day
Yes
One Day
He will be tall
He will be big
He would be grand
One day
He will be the tallest tree in the woods.
And this was all that kept him alive.
After one particulary awful day of chiding
Skippy felt all his reslove fade
and
He awaited his demise
The next morning
it came
…
Skippy awoke into conscienous by the sounds of a loud buzzing and the horrifying screams of his fellow trees
Odd, lanky creatures wielding hellish machines dug into his brethen
slicing them
killing them
cutting them down
Cutting all of them down
All
Soon
only Skippy remained
If he could cry
the soil would be swamped with his tears
He watched as the creatures approached him
Awaiting his fate
Awaiting for the searing pain
But
It never came
He was passed over
spared
He pondered this for a moment
and
In the presence of the dead
He came to a wonderful realization
He was the tallest tree in the woods
And
if he was capable of it
He would smile

I love mythology
really
I do
I didnt realize it until a few days ago
I was doing some stupid little trivia game with my mom
and
I like
killed her (=D)
And it was all mythology stuff.
When most kids read Cinderella and what not growing up
I read Arachnne and Oedipus and Persus
I guess it just stayed with me
After I learned all I could about Greek and Roman mythlogy..
I moved to Egyptian
and just recently Norse
im still going
I cant wait for when Christianity is considered a Mythlogy..and..not a religion
Poor Christians….when they find out the stories they follow blindly are more absurd than most Greek ones…
When the dreary Norse Mythlogy has more hope than 
theirs
When some wacko sex fiend develops an Abraham complex
instead of an Oedipus Complex.
heh
fun stuff
Right now
My favorite is Norse
Norse is entirelly based in the fact that the world will end
Everyone will die
Life is just what you make of it.
The greatest glory is just to die with a sword in hand
so
one has a chance to dine at the Halls of Valhalla
With Odin as Host.
Where man is just in the way of the feud between Giants and Gods
the feud that will lead to Ragnorak
The Ultimate End-Game
People dont realize how much we get from Norse Myth’s…
The days of the week are named after Norse gods…
Yes…
for right now
Norse is my favorite
One day…after Ive learned them all
Ill take my divinty
and make my own
and
maybe mine will stick…

104,https://www.opendiary.com/m/sadmeatcart/hatred-analyzed-4259913/,2001-01-11,Hatred Analyzed,"
Ok..someone got me thinking on this
Hate Crimes
thats a stupid phrase
Hate crimes refer to an act of violence towards another person
who happens to be different
I have a problem with this on many levels
First
Any violent crime is a hate crime
One doesnt beat the crap out of a person cuz they like them
And
When MTV does their anti-hate thing…
They fail to mention the incosistancy of the hate crimes
When a white baseball player uses many racial slurs…
he gets fined a couple thousand dollars…
and
is suspended a few weeks
When a black quarterback beats a white police officer to an inch of his life
simply because he is dating a black woman
He gets a couple off scotch free from the school he plays for…and will most likely be found not guilty for bullXXXX buecracy
I dont condone Hate crimes
I just wish we would remember the whole equal rights thing
Equal
We now are so concerned with racism…discrimnation…biggotry…
We make laws to protect
when
all we need to do is educate…
Educate…
A Black Man is no Different physically from a white man…except his skin pigment
One may have been brought up differently than the other
But
they are the same
A Gay Man is the same as any other…except in his sexual actions
People…drop the ignorance act
You know this…
People look for a scapegoat…
look in the mirror
Hell
Blame me
Ill be your scapegoat
Jesus did it..cant I
Funny…
Jesus’s death seemed to cause only more discrimnation…
I bet he’s all XXXXed in hell over that one…

And…I just mentioned him in hell thing just cuz I love irony

O luck,
like the moon
changeable in state,
you are always waxing

hateful life

and the next moment watching over
the mind’s acumen in gambling;
poverty,
power,
it melts like ice.
Fate monstrous
and empty,
a whirling wheel you are;
if badly placed
health is vain-
it can ever be dissolved
overshadowed
and veiled
you harass me too;
now at the gaming table
my bare back
I bring to your villainy.
The luck of health
and strength
is against me,
is attacked
and ruined
all the time, in your service.
In this hour
without delay
sweep the sounding strings;
and for that, by lot,
overthrows the strong man,
weep with me, all of you!

I weep for the wounds of luck
with brimming eyes,
because her gifts to me
she rebelliousy takes away.
Truly it is written
that the head may be hairy
but often there follows
a season of baldness.
On the throne of luck
I used to sit joyfully,
with proserity’s manifold
flowers I was crowned;
but however much I flourished
happy and blessed,
now I have tumbled from the top
robbed of glory.
The wheel of chance spins;
one man is abased by its descent,
the other carried aloft;
all to exalted
sits the king at the top-
let him beware ruin!
For beneath the wheel we read
that Hecuba is queen.

I watched the Knoxville news yesterday
I could only watch it for 15 minutes before it made me sick
First
They talked about how a local school had a bus driver
who
was a convicted murderer
Now
Im not sure on my views of punishment
but
this man had killed another man in a fit of rage
because
he was sleeping with his wife.
I can kinda understand that
It was wrong
but
rage is rage
And
I think he served his time..
and
truly regrets what he did
and
from what everyone at the school says
he’s a wonderful bus driver
He loves kids
and
takes care of them
Apparently
that is not good enough for the parents
I understand that they want their children to be safe
but
*shrugs*
dont they have books to ban?
Ok
After that story
They then told of how a girl died in a fire yesterday morning
Naturally
it was disturbing
but
what shocked me even more 
was
the appearance
that
the father didnt try very hard to save her.
He said he ran to her room
but couldnt get in because of a wall of smoke…
Ok…Ive never been in a fire
But…
a wall of smoke wouldnt stop me in trying to
save my children
I would continue trying even when my flesh is boiling off my bones
I just cant believe that stopped him…
It wasnt even a large house..
it’s not like he couldnt even hold his breath
if he was worried about inhalation.
but
I dont know the details
it’s not my place to judge
it’s not fair

I never knew that it would fill me up
make me whole
I never thought that it would be the light
in
my self-made darkness
I thought I didnt deserve it
I thought I blew it
I thought I would never feel it again
I never knew that I never really experienced it
I never knew that I could be so happy
So
In to it
I never knew it could be like this
I thought I knew Love
I was wrong

Rain
It covers my flesh
running down my body
and
into the earth
With it
goes all my 
inhibitions
fears
worries
and sorrows
They form a little puddle on the pavment
I splash 
I play
I slip
I fall
I drown
I always knew those would be the end of me
They seep back into my head
and
form a puddle in my mind
and
wait
for my soul to slip and die
in their murky depths
The puddle lays way to a pond
lake
ocean
Bit by Bit
I lose myself in the sea
my feelings creating
a
malestorm
the tiny ship
of my dreams
sinks away
Soon
the storm calms
and
the sea dries
absorbing
into my absoloution
and
leaving my terrestial mind
And
is washed back to the earth
where
it becomes a puddle
and the rain pounds that puddle
like
a tempting dance
promising of childhood joy
and
redemption
Waiting for someone to play in it’s depths
someone to slip and fall
someone to lose themselves in themselves
Waiting for the chance to grow
Waiting for the rain
to
cease
And
the sun to come out
and
whisk it away
to someone else’s
dream of reality

“Fate
Monstrous and empty,
a whirling wheel you are”
That has been going through my head all day
it’s so true
Funny how right
drunken people can be
Im kinda in a crappy mood today.
So much pain
but
it’s not my pain
Ive lost my feelings
since
I started caring for others
i think
but
the lack of my personal feelings
might be
causing their pain…
paradoxes need to stop haunting me
“Hateful life is one moment hard”
Im still trying to figure that one out..
At first
It seems pretty cut and dry
but
and second glance
It is infintetly deep
and
I am still trying to work it out in my head
I love that.
Something to think about.
I watched a movie last night
It was called
“the cube”
It was such a great movie
I cant explain it…
it was just…
wow

I know you care
I know you worry

why dont you listen
why
You want to know why I am the way I am
I tell you
No
Im wrong
You want to know what can be done to fix it
I tell you
No
Im wrong
I realize Ive made mistakes
but
damnit
I cant sit back and accept that 
I cannot do it
that its
not for me
Mother
I am not going to quit
My struggles are internal
How can I get any better
if
you wont let me fight 
my
demons
You decide im mentally unbalanced
I go along
Im given pills that are supposed to make me
all better
they dont
they compound the problems
I stop taking them
You strongly argue
I get better without them
You look harder for problems
you find them
You worry about my appearance
I worry also
I say I need help
you only give me grief
I say what I know
what can help
Im wrong again
you apply your own answer
I tell you over and over again
my problems
you dont seem to hear
you dont seem to listen
I always listen to you rant 
Mother

I may shut my eyes
I may wander off

I am always listening
I hear every harsh word you say
be it
intentional

I read the words you write
I see the looks in your eyes
I hear the words you dont say
I know
I am always listening
always
I accept that I have a problem
I want to change it
but
I cant do it like this
I cant keep fighting you
Pills arent the gateway to my happiness
Harsh words dont erase fat
It’s not my fault I am a total wreck
and
noone wants to hire me
I try
I need help 
Mom
I need you to listen
I need you to start loving me

Me
I know that’s a tall order

If you are going to continue
to be
an active role in my life
things havta change

wonderful
Im not sure why it resides in my dreams

for
an instance
one
shining moment

Then
It was gone
vanished

IT never left my sight

it changed
it became
ugly
not for it’s own doing

and
wonderful
thing I may ever see
gone

as quick as aluminum can fall
it was broken
broken forever
the can can be removed

the damage is forever

drenched

have the only say

the brightened heat of joy
seeps into 
my grief-stricken body
tears and sweat of
rage and fear
bleed down my sides

my blood runs warm
with hope
and
the wind
gently whisks
my
anxiety
away
As time goes on
all that is unwanted
is gone

all the remains

the apprehension

the light disappears

I do

Yes
the house you built
The house
where
I learned to roller skate
and
the house where my sisters
and
I
would compete for your attention
The house where you and your wife
had your garden
filled with 
tomatoes
and
sweet pea’s
God
I miss those peas
I remember sitting on the deck
and
watching the birds
There were so many birds
I could have spent hours watching
I remember you
teaching me to play football
I remember your laughter
I remember later
when you moved
and
you taught me
how to fly a stunt kite
I remembered how
we promised we would go golfing
Then
I remembered
how
I
stopped coming over
I was a teen
I thought I had better things to do
I thought I was “too cool”
for you
but
I never
ever stopped caring…
insided
I remember how I felt
when I found out you were sick
how I felt when I was told
that
you
wouldnt survive the week
And
I remember how you survived
and
kept on going
I remember 3 years later
when
you stopped fighting
and
layed down
and disappeared
I remember when I heard you had passed
How I
alone 
among my sibilings
came
to your deathbed
I remember looking at you
and
I wondered why
I couldnt cry
I remember
at your funeral
when
My aunt
spoke
she used an excerpt
from
one of my poems
God
I wanted to cry
Now
several months later
I am at a loss
Damnit
I wish I knew you
I wish you knew the kind of man 
your son is
The kind of father he is
Wes
All I have heard
is
what kind of man you were
a great
humble
man
I wish I had shed tears for you
when you
knew I could
You are the only Grandfather
I ever knew
and
I never really knew you
I love you Grandpa
and
Grandpa,
I cried last night.

they were back in my head
the man

the girl

there they were
last night
MAybe it was the lack of sleep

Will I be allowed?

broken
I need time to fix

there is no time
only absoloutes
Go To school
I tried that….fucked it up
Get into a trade
For some juvenille reason…I cant
Earn Money to go back to school
In this day and Age….you only get one chance at an education …
I blew it
I honestly believe there is no way in hell I can get back…
no matter how badly I want to.
So
I don’t know where to go from here
I dont have any answers
Only more questions
Noone really has answers
because
noone really knows the questions
Life is just math
An Ifinite amount of little
algebraic problems
suming up to an astronomical final figure
that we will never know
or understand
It is Simplistically Mind-Blowing
So…
Here I am
In my room of mirrors
forever trapped
I could break a mirror
but
I know the shards would cut at
my
resolve
and
make me do something I regret
and
I know that behind one mirror
there is only
another

If shame had a face
I think it would look kind of like mine
If it had a home
would it be my eyes
would you believe me
If I said I am tired of this now
Here we go now one more time
I tried to climb the steps
I tried to chase you down
I tried to see how low I could get down to the ground
I tried to earn my way
I tried to change this mind
You better believe I tried to beat this
When will this end
It goes on and on
over and over again
Keep spinning around
I know it won’t stop still I step down from this for good
I never thought I’d end up here
I never thought I’d be standing
WHere I am
I guess I kind of thought 
it would be easier then this
I guess I was wrong
Now
One more time
This is a sick cycle carousel
This is a sick cycle

I guess Im a lil more stable then yesterday
The only real problem I have
is me
True…
I do have a self-loathing thing
but
Im getting better
There are things 
I need to do
Although I am willing
to work hard
When the time comes
it never happens
and
I know
Talking about it does little
and
the only way I can do it
is
just doing it
…
I could sit here
and
try to think of
what point
in my life
did this happen
who’s to blame
But
no
that’s stupid
I’ve come to accept the problem
where and when and who
is pointless
only
casting blame
and hatred
and
I don’t need that.
I know there are people
who love me
and
are willing to support me
I
only need to love and support me
Funny
God hates himself
It kinda makes more sense out of
life

Usually
The OD theme  has
well
been stupid
I like this one though
Time is a wonderful concept
at least
to think about
But
also
Time is stupid
It just confuses us more
Time measures time?
Time doesnt exist
er
well not physically
It’s just a concept we employ
to simplify/complicate
our existance
an existance is subdivided down
from
milleniums
to centuries
to decades
to years
to months
to weeks
to days
to hours
to minutes
to seconds
it’s madness really
it doesnt even fit
10 decades in a century
10 years in a decade
12 months!? in a year
4-5 weeks in am month!?
7 days a week?
24 hours a day?
60 minutes  an hour?
and 60 seconds a minute?
Jesus…can we get any more confusing for an
imaginary unit
of measurment
and what is it all based on?
centuries and decades are a compoundation of years
years are based on the earths revoloution around the sun
month’s were based on the cycles of the moon….but..im not quite sure now.
Weeks are based on a set of days concerning Norse Gods
days are based on the earth’s rotation
and
seconds and minutes and hours
aren’t really based on anything but the subdivision of a day…which..whoever did it…well…was odd
Really
we make the concept of time a lot more difficult then it is
I mean
to compound the confusion
we have to have time zones
to account for the fact due to the earths rotation…
the sun rises earlier in london..than New York
AHHHHHH
add daylight savings..and…all the other crap
it’s mindblowing
all for a simple thing of judging
how long it has been from a set moment in time
So
In response to the theme
Is time, a friend…foe…or both
I truly think
that is an idiotic question
Time in it’s truest sense
happens no matter what occurs in it
it doesnt care
it doesnt exist
It is just a concept
So
In the sense of the concept
It is ruled by our definition of the concept
so
it isnt set
but
It doesnt exist
so..la la la
Time sucks
Don’t think about it
accept
that a certain amount of “time” 
has passed since
you decided
I am insane
and
that
although
you may never truly understand
the concept of time
It really isn’t
worth your “time”
and
effort
trying to figure it out
It’s not that confusing
we just like complicating things

One, I’d like to address the fact that when I checked all my favorites today
Only 3 of them had entered in their od
You see
In my OD obsessed mind, that presents a problem
As much joy/pain I get from writing in my OD
I get twice that out of reading my friends OD
Besides me being all creepy and insane
Im not sure why that is
But
I choose to take this as a direct insult
so
I have chosen to whisk you all away to
damnation
until I say so
Further more
I have come to a realization
After a week of observing 
the female’s definition of sexiness
I have learned the following:
Elderly men are sexy
such as
Alan Thicke
and
Rudy from survivor
And
I have learned that 
skinny singers with abnormally large mouthes are sexy
such as
Jason Wade from Lifehouse
So
From these two observations
I have decided that Steven Tyler must be the sexiest man Alive.
To continue on
My beloved earring is missing.
I belive it may lie somewhere on the projected site
for
the Spallation Neutron Source.
I wish to wish my earring good luck in the world
and
I hope it finds new joy’s as a part of the foundation
for
an atom splitter.
Along those lines.
Since my earring’s departure
There is now an openings for my left ear.
Any earring who is interested
please contact me at (423) 869-3327
Dangling earrings and massive hoops need not apply.
In case you havent noticed
I am slightly uninhibited
I blame the republicans
and
Everyone living Budapest
and
the funky headsche stuff I took this morning
and
Mancow
it’s all Mancow’s fault.
Thank You

cart a vehicle moving on wheels, and usually drawn by oxen (2 Sam. 6:3). The Hebrew word thus rendered, _’agalah_ (1 Sam. 6:7, 8), is also rendered “wagon” (Gen. 45:19). It is used also to denote a war-chariot (Ps. 46:9). Carts were used for the removal of the ark and its sacred utensils (Num. 7:3, 6). After retaining the ark amongst them for seven months, the Philistines sent it back to the Israelites. On this occasion they set it in a new cart, probably a rude construction, with solid wooden wheels like that still used in Western Asia, which was drawn by two milch cows, which conveyed it straight to Beth-shemesh. A “cart rope,” for the purpose of fastening loads on carts, is used (Isa. 5:18) as a symbol of the power of sinful pleasures or habits over him who indulges them. (See CORD.) In Syria and Palestine wheel-carriages for any other purpose than the conveyance of agricultural produce are almost unknown.

God (A.S. and Dutch God; Dan. Gud; Ger. Gott), the name of the Divine Being. It is the rendering (1) of the Hebrew _’El_, from a word meaning to be strong; (2) of _’Eloah_, plural _’Elohim_. The singular form, _Eloah_, is used only in poetry. The plural form is more commonly used in all parts of the Bible, The Hebrew word Jehovah (q.v.), the only other word generally employed to denote the Supreme Being, is uniformly rendered in the Authorized Version by “LORD,” printed in small capitals. The existence of God is taken for granted in the Bible. There is nowhere any argument to prove it. He who disbelieves this truth is spoken of as one devoid of understanding (Ps. 14:1). The arguments generally adduced by theologians in proof of the being of God are: (1.) The a priori argument, which is the testimony afforded by reason. (2.) The a posteriori argument, by which we proceed logically from the facts of experience to causes. These arguments are, (a) The cosmological, by which it is proved that there must be a First Cause of all things, for every effect must have a cause. (b) The teleological, or the argument from design. We see everywhere the operations of an intelligent Cause in nature. (c) The moral argument, called also the anthropological argument, based on the moral consciousness and the history of mankind, which exhibits a moral order and purpose which can only be explained on the supposition of the existence of God. Conscience and human history testify that “verily there is a God that judgeth in the earth.” The attributes of God are set forth in order by Moses in Ex. 34:6,7. (see also Deut. 6:4; 10:17; Num. 16:22; Ex. 15:11; 33:19; Isa. 44:6; Hab. 3:6; Ps. 102:26; Job 34:12.) They are also systematically classified in Rev. 5:12 and 7:12. God’s attributes are spoken of by some as absolute, i.e., such as belong to his essence as Jehovah, Jah, etc.; and relative, i.e., such as are ascribed to him with relation to his creatures. Others distinguish them into communicable, i.e., those which can be imparted in degree to his creatures: goodness, holiness, wisdom, etc.; and incommunicable, which cannot be so imparted: ind

A survey that forces you to elaborate.
1. Susie Orbach in “Nine Steps to Financial Freedom” says you can tell a lot about a person by the way they keep their money. How do you keep yours? (I can forsee the smart-ass answers to this one — I mean how do you carry your money around with you on your person :)) 
Well…on that rare occasion I do have money…
I would most likely carry that in my wallet which would be in my back right pocket…
2. I had banana split incident at Denny’s recently. Amanda and I thought a banana split was vanilla, chocolate and strawberry ice cream, pineapple sauce on the vanilla, chocolate sauce on the chocolate, and strawberry sauce on the strawberry, whipped cream, nuts, and a split banana of course. And cherries. David and Paul said no, and agreed with the waitress that banana split is all vanilla with chocolate sauce, bananas and whipped cream and everything else varies by establishment. Denny’s charged $1.50 more for our version and called it banana royale. What do you think a banana split is? 
by defintion…a banana split is a banana with ice cream and chocolate sauce…so…Denny’s is right…Denny’s is ALWAYS right
3. Tell me a cool drink name and its recipe that I probably don’t know or one that you invented or always wanted to invent.
It’s called…..Water…you take One part Hydrogen..and….two part Oxygen..and….voila…water
4. When replying to e-mails do you chop up the email you are responding to and respond to each part, or do you reply in bulk? I ask because my friend Cindy pointed out that only men chop them up. And my experience has borne that theory out. If you do chop them up — why? 
I don’t get emails..so..the question is moot
5. If you have ever had a service-oriented job (and I bet you we all have) what’s your most memorable encounter with a customer?
WHen I worked at the library…this old man asked if I was a european or something cuz I draw a line through my Z’s and 7’s..and..it was funny

Monday…I was at that shitty job..and….it was a mud hole..and..I got off this crane…into about 3 feet of mud..and..when I went to move…my boot pulled off..and sent my falling headfirst into the mud…Shut..stop laughing…
7. What’s the story behind the last time you got the “church giggles”? By church giggles, I don’t mean necessarily laughing in church, just getting the giggles and not being able to stop in a situation where it wasn’t appropriate.
It is always appropiate
8. Do you think small talk is bullsh*t? 
talk has size?

You know whats brave
Frying bacon without a shirt on
You know whats stupid
our government
it’s sooooo idiotic
We have this money here…so..lets give it back to the people
so
we can…uh
er
Exactly
I took 12 years to somewhat fix what Regan screwed up.
in 6 years from now
I predict the shit that Bush turns up 
will hit the fan
and
because of the dynamics of our economy
we will go into regression
and
who knows
nuked by the chinese maybe…
And now
just cuz big poppa oil has it’s hands in Bush’s pocket
they can whine about the wildlife reserve in the artic
that has oil
and
therefore should be destroyed and drained.
All…just to last
6 MONTHS!!!!!!
6 fucking months
dear god
they don’t realize what a valuable prize that reserve is…
Yes
Our government is full of idiots
and
now
I hate them for making me talk about politics in here…

The morning’s mist
an echo of the nights ritualistic dance
covers the earth
like a blanket of sorrow
fear and despair condense in it’s
gaseous entrails
In the void
a bird cries out
A cry of mourning
a cry of loneliness
A cry
Trapped in the cloud of absoloution
The bird cries 
Off in the distance
Another bird cries
a cry of the same melody
Together
the two birds
form a duet of
their personal pain
and joy
Now
as one
their past fades in the fog
and
their future
becomes a beacon
a guide through the mist
to the light
Such is
Love

I am disturbed
When I am at my strongest
I am at my weakest
My mind preys
on
itself
My dreams
grip at my sanity
and
play with my percieved
reality
What are they trying to say
Have I really changed at all
or
Am I still the little boy who hides from
his fears
in the comfort
of a flashlight
and
a blanket
Why does this inane fear
still eat at me
Why
I am not scared of the dark
I am not scared of what I cannot see
The unknown
does not
give me fear
But
It does
deep
down
inside
something is
chipping at my resolve
It must be
If I can be terrified enough to abandon my friends
in my sleep
I must be capable of it in wake
Are my dreams simply telling me that
I still have a ways 
to go
before
I have truly conquered my fears?
maybe
Even more so
Why did I have a dream last night
of
a place
that
haven’t been to
until
this morning?
*sigh*
I refuse to belive that
I would do what I did in my dream
My personal demons
and
whatever it is
that taps into my mind
while I sleep
will not win
I’ve made a goal for myself
and
I WILL accomplish it
And
even though the thought of it
does
terrify me
Deep Down
inside
I know what I must do

It’s amazing what you can see
when
you are running
a register
at k-mart
It’s a unique experience
seeing
someone’s face
when
they find out
their
hero just died
A woman
that I had never
even met
burst into tears
and
cried on my shoulder
for a good 5 minutes
when
she
heard the news
I feel bad
because
my reaction was
“no fucking way…that aint fucking cool”
perhaps I was in shock
I never was one to deal with death well
I had never met him
I just admired him
but
I felt like the yankee again
as the whole state weeps
hell
as a whole geographic region weep
I stand among them
feeling bad
I look for poetic justice 
in the tragedy
they look for answers why
Most of them
never even met the man
He wasn’t a superstar
in the likes of Jordan and Gretsky
but
he was an icon
a hero
to people
who never in their life
felt like they deserved a hero
He was the working mans man
He was a nice man
but
on the course
he was a monster
cold
heartless
intimidating
he never would help anyone
never lay down
never say die…
And
in the last moments of his life
he
was being selfless
doing his part
to insure a victory for his team
his driver
and
his son.
Dale Earnhardt will never be thought of
in the same catergory
as
Wayne Gretzky
Michael Jordan
or Babe Ruth
But
Whether founded or not
Noone
will have such an impact
on the south
as
He has
…
You know…Im reading back on this
and
I am mistaken in one aspect
I am not seperated
I am not alone
I am no different then anyone else down here
I weep
just as them
only
in
my way.

Interesting day…
inconsideration
somewhat revelation
mutilation
no elation though
doesnt seem fair
but
fairness is just a concept
made up
in our little game
of
“Im Better Than You”
I have Cumbersome in my head
That song always seems to get
caught in my head
when
I don’t feel Cumbersome
Man
my feet hurt
maybe I need better shoes?
I need to shave too
it hurts to touch my face…
This computer is writing in some funky ass font
so
writing in here today is doubely amusing
MY last entry was written this morning
but
the stupid library computers where too lagged to post
Come this afternoon
I didnt feel like posting it
but
I am obligated to myself
*pats himself on the back*
On the thoughts of computers
My computer is finally gone
whisked away
to the evil clutches of my elder sister and
her silly- looking
italian stallion
(please god….shoot me now)
Today has been awfully odd
I mean
it hasnt been an odd day
but
I have felt odd
Like
when you go on vacation
and
you feel a little disorientated
and
a little
well
out of place
thats how I feel today
Odd
God
this next month or so
is going to be so hectic
and
stressful
although
I want to move into a house
when my parents are involved
it becomes
a horrible
wicked
awful
affair
It’s never cut n dry with them
they wonder why they freak out
*gives them a chill pill*
(Btw I am in an 80’s mood…so…deal)
A man asked me if I go to church today
I said no
He said why not
I polietly said
that I have no need to
He said I should
I asked why
He said cuz Jesus is coming
and
is going to be upset
I nodded
and
said
I guess I should go to church then
He said yes
I said that he owed me 4.50
he gave me a check
He then said
that if he doesnt see me at such and such church this sunday
that
He will first complain to k-mart about how rude I am(bah)
and
then threaten to boycott the store if I am not fired.
A very christian-like thing of him to do
I am so glad someone is looking out for my best interest
Hypothetically
What would Jesus care if I didnt go to church?
But
Im just God
what do I know?

I believe this entry will
just
consist
of
whining
bitching
and
silly stuff that I have no
right to complain about
You have been warned.
You know
it’s sad
when
the one person on
the planet
that I want to talk to
I cant
because
I cant afford to
It’s not fair
She makes me feel
like
I thought I
was never
ever
going to feel
I love her so much
and
for some odd reason
she feel’s the same
and
I can’t afford to talk to her
I hate
costing my parents money they dont have
I hate owing people money
but
I cant
not
talk to her
I need to
My parents will never understand
how
alone I am 
right now
They may never understand
the
uniqueness of
an
online relationship
They will never understand
what my friends online mean to me
I don’t expect them too
I just wish
they could just
accept
that
it is important to me
That
my relationship with Kell
isnt
just
me talking to some girl
in California
to raise
my ego
I wish they could understand
that
I am in love with her
despite
Us never have meeting
in real life
They know
if
they had never met face to face
but
had met…maybe
by
pen pals
that
they would still do the same
Damnit
I know they know
I think
to a point
that
my dad can understand
He doesnt believe in online relationships
but
he somewhat knows
that
this is important to me
My mother
well
yeah…
I know she has the same problems too
*sigh*
I hope
this may get easier
whenever
I do get a computer
Then
I may be able to talk to her.
Til then
I suppose
The brief time
I can talk to her..and…vice-versa
is enough
It is still more than I ever thought that
i deserved

but
I dont
but I do

it would be more accurate

the horror that awaits me
is too much for me to bear
trapped in a prison

failures

reaching for
the light

yank me to

consistently
sends

it wont be as bad this time

Ill find the lyrics to
“What a Day” by Nonpoint
There’s a storm brewing to the north
it’s her
I can see it now
1030-1100 when I come home tonight
wham!
with the fury
of any storm
I’d see down here
she will descend upon me
and
kill my spirit
but
that’s ok
I can take
she won’t break me this time
She has broken me so many times
in the past
Im like putty now
Im just silly putty
she can try
and
try
but
I will just bend and stretch
soon
I will be in a new house
where
I can isolate myself
from
the upstairs
to work
to the hilltop that is behind it
and
when I get enough money
Im gone
Silly putty goes on forever
till it dries
so…you gotta keep it in it’s egg
this is my egg
my balancing board
She can’t break me
“Mama, they try and break me”
Im off to find the hero of the day
He’s somewhere inside of me
somewhere behind God
manipulating me
towards
the person I want to be
funny how
“Go with God” takes
on
a new meaning with me
please excuse me while I tend to how I feel

J J (j[=a]). J is the tenth letter of the English alphabet. It is a later variant form of the Roman letter I, used to express a consonantal sound, that is, originally, the sound of English y in yet. The forms J and I have, until a recent time, been classed together, and they have been used interchangeably.
Note: In medical prescriptions j is still used in place of i at the end of a number, as a Roman numeral; as, vj, xij. J is etymologically most closely related to i, y, g; as in jot, iota; jest, gesture; join, jugular, yoke. See I. J is a compound vocal consonant, nearly equivalent in sound to dzh. It is exactly the same as g in gem. See Guide to Pronunciation, [sect][sect] 179, 211, 239.

cute (kyt) 
adj. cut·er, cut·est. 
Delightfully pretty or dainty. 
Obviously contrived to charm; precious:  [He] mugs so ferociously he kills the humorit’s an insufferably cute performance (David Ansen). 
Shrewd; clever. 
——————————————————————————–
[Short for acute.] 
——————————————————————————–
cutely adv. 
cuteness n. 
Word History: Cute is a good example of how a shortened form of a word can take on a life of its own, developing a sense that dissociates it from the longer word from which it was derived. Cute was originally a shortened form of acute in the sense keenly perceptive or discerning, shrewd. In this sense cute is first recorded in a dictionary published in 1731. Probably cute came to be used as a term of approbation for things demonstrating acuteness, and so it went on to develop its own sense of attractive, fetching, first recorded with reference to gals in 1838.

Ok
Lets talk about the
day
that was
yesterday
shall we?
First 
I opened my eyes
from
my
“sleep”
I
walk into the bathroom
and
take a shower
I put in a new set of contacts
and
go to my room
and
choose what Ill wear to work
After that
I realize that my clock is an hour fast
so
I have another hour
before
I work
This presents a problem
That means
that
I will be forced to spend an hour with my mother
As you read yesterday
you know what happened
When I arrive at work
I proceed to work my ass off
cuz
I want to make money
I want to be the best employee
I can
because
well
I need the ego boost
When I go to check out
I get my asshole reamed by my boss
because
someone complained that I sold some beer without
checkin their license
Which is a load of shit
I always check
I enjoy it
So…
after leaving work dejected
I go to the library
in hopes that my spirits
can be raised
And what happens to me
there?
I find that my paranoia was well-founded
and
well
I was dumped
Now
since none of you really know me 
that well
Im emotional
Im a cry baby
The worst thing for me
was
not to cry
not in  the library
So
there I sat
trying to rationalize it
understanding her
And the kid next to me….just stared at me
as
I figdgeted….trying my best
to keep everything under control
So
I go home
but
there
I must act all happy and what not
no way in hell can I let my parents know right now
They wouldnt understand
and
they would overreact
think Im all…deppressive and suicidal
sure
Im deppressed
dont I have a right to be?
jsut for once
can’t I be sad
in public
that remains to be seen
so
When my parents asked me what was wrong
I just smiled
and said
I was tired
so
I went to my room
and cried
as quietly as I could
After dinner
as if my parents were the harbingers
of
Irony
I was presented with a phone card
It took all my strength not to cry there.
I smiled
acted excited
and went to my room
and
pretended to use it
but
really
who can I call
who can I talk to
When I went to bed
I didnt sleep
I just stared at the ceiling
and
wondered
what do I do now
Im not angry at her
Im glad she told me
I dont want her in a situation
like
I was in the past
I still want to be her friend
I just need time
I dont know how to react
Im lost right now
I just need some bearings
I think
I tried talking about it to my dog
I dont think she cared though…
this really does suck…
but
atleast I got a phonecard?

A tree
Is simple
It knows not
of
death
it accepts life
but
doesnt
ponder it
It takes in water and nutirents
and
a whole bunch of other stuff
that
I can’t quite remember
and
lets out O2 
simple
and
everyone once and awhile
it drops some form of seed
The tree needs not worry about these things
it is as automatic
to the tree
as
a heart pumping
is to us
I am not sure if a tree feels
pain
when his fellow trees
die
but
I believe
if it did
it would just look at it as
a better chance 
to
live
easier
If a tree is threatend
some will excrete
some nasty salve
some wont
again
automatic
like a machine
A tree knows nothing of love
or
emotional pain
A tree
just
lives
I envy a tree

There is a plate
that
my Grandma June
made for my mom’s dad
when he was sick
I refer to him as my moms dad
because
He had died before I was born
and
feel awkward
calling him Grandpa
This plate
had
a Ram in the middle
signifing
him
being an Aries
below the ram
his birthdate
March 24, 1915
and
around the picture and the date
are words and symbols
written
in alternating
red and green
refering to aries
Mars
the male symbol
jasper
red
the symbol for Aries
twice….one filled in…the other hollow
head
and face
now
I understand most of that put there
Aries is the greek counterpart to the roman god Mars
Male symbol towards this…being god of war(although…most times I have found that Aries tends to be a feministic zodiac)
Jasper is often associated with Mars(red jasper to be exact…but…oddly enough…jasper…in this case is written in green..and green jasper is associtated with venus)
Red being the colour associated with Mars….and..whole bunch of other stuff
the zodiac symbol(duh)
Head being representive of Aries in the Medical Zodiac
and face
which I have no Idea what that means
Now
I am particulary interested in this plate
hell
I am very interested about who Charles Reinhold was
He is the grandfather I never knew
and
even more so
I share his birthday
So
I feel like
I have a bond with him
I drilled my mom this morning 
about what kind of man he was
unfortunetly
I take the memories my mom
give me
with little value
A child
sometimes
will never know
the kind of person
their parent is
So
Im kinda at a loss
Even more so
The plate
baffels me
my grandma June
was a devoutly
relgious woman
she doesnt strike me
as
a person who would study up
on
astrology
Damnit
I just want answers
I have so many questions
that
I could never fit in here
or
maybe even comprehend
The spiritual side of me
wants to try to contact
“Chuck”
Each night
I ponder
finally doing an
automatic writing
but
I am so leary of it 
I know
I
am spiritually stronger than most
but
I am still a suseptable
I dont like the idea of letting down my guard
Not for this
Im sure Ill find other ways
sides
I lack the tools to insure the sucess
so
bleah
Im in search of answers
never really knowing the questions
lost in the dark
or are my eyes just shut
scared to open
for what I might see
my self-loathing
and doubt
my burden
my emotions
secondary
now
I think
solitude
is the path to
enlightenment
but
ignorance
is
the path to happiness

I got ambushed today
I wake
from
an hour or so of sleep
mostly dreaming of…Godzilla(!?)
and….
Jay…could you come in here
Suuuuuure mom
I just finished reading last months phonebill
fuck…
The spewing of hot air and malignous fire
that followed is of no concern
since
I dont think I paid much attention
I almost told my mother
that
dont worry…Im not gonna be calling ANYONE anymore
but
i held it in
too many burns for one morning
After the the phone bill was covered…
quite well
over the past 3 hours
the lecture turned a corner and hit a nerve
“Jay
why are you such a loser?”
Yes Jay
why
tell me
why does your life consist
of
waking early in the morning
watching shitty daytime television
taking a shower
eating last nights leftovers
for breakfast
going to work
then
going to the library
to get a spoonful
of discomfort
a lil bit of joy
and
making yourself feel like
itll be ok
by writing
in an open forum
to people
you will most likely
never meet
And then
go home
have dinner
and
turn on the tv and watch till you fall asleep
Why?
“I dont know Mom”
“Im just worried about you Jay”
“dont worry mom…Im fine”
Then…she proceeds to
remind of every little failure
or
misgiving
I have had
since I was 12
*sigh*
Like I need a reminder
those who forget the past…are doomed to repeat it
Im fucking trapped in the past
I can’t let myself forget it
And If I did..someone is bound to remind me…or….
FUCK
I shouldnt be upset
Life is wonderful
beautiful
la la la
see
Im singing
Im happy
I scream cuz Im content
really
Hello Misery
long time no see
You know
its funny
I hadnt even planned to rant like this on here
sorry bout that
looking back on this
it’s kinda stupid
I suppose this is just for me
la la la
I went to the zoo yesterday
I saw a bumperstickr
“Jesus is coming, save some weed”
I laughed
I work in an hour
Yay me
Shit…i did go to the zoo yesterday
I had planned on waiting
but
yeah
you know
One set’s goals
or
plans on them
when they dissappear
do you go in the direction you were heading
or
do you decide on a new course
Im going back to school this summer
for future thought
What should I major in?
Hello Darkness my old friend
I’ve come to talk with you again
la la la
It’s rather a nice day today
anyone want to come out and play
there’s a puddle out back
we can splash and play
until
the sun
dries it all away
but tears need not be shed
It was all but a puddle of my sadness
It will back someday
Are sure you don’t want to play?
My emotions are but toys
see how they range
come come
try them out
leave this one alone though
it’s all used up
one too many times…it was run dry
it’s tired now
it needs it’s sleep
but have no fear
I have plenty others that need to be exhausted
Please Please
Come out and Play

I tried to write some
stuff down
on my break today
to make me feel better
it didnt work
at least
I threw it out
so
I dont have to subject you to the
annoyingly
deppressing
and
all together
pitiful
words
I produced
Im glad though
because
I realized
I dont even know how I feel
I know
I should probably
be angry
infact
people say I should
but
No
I rfuse to
The
only thing
I have control
over
right now
Is my anger
and
Ill be damned
if I dont control that.
Am I being selfish
for
not acting selfish?
You know
most of the online relationships
I’ve observed
all
except
a select few
failed
and
usually ended in somesort
of
betrayal
and or
heartache
In the past
I thought of it as a game
I watched people play
sometimes
letting myself
be
an obstacle
in it
but
never
ever
joining in
Then
I played
and
I thought
I played very well
but
in the end
as most do
I lost
You win
There’s always a loser in these
sorts
of events
I can be the loser
Im used to it
and
quite good
all the pain and heartache
goes straight
to the
rage
that burns inside of me
like
the fire
that drives an engine
controling something
that only wants to do
two things
exist
and
destroy
One day
My fire may break free
who knows
i suppose
I can control that too
but
hey
cheap thing to run on
especially
if
stuff like this keeps on piling up
Id take some time off
the internet
but…
yeah
right
heh
I found out my sister and her b/f are going to
be
moving in with us in May
…
the shit keeps on piling up
burying
me
in it’s depths
and stench
shit burns well though
it burns very well
I care too much at times
I dont let enough anger out
I know
I do
One day
My anger will escape
and
Most likely
I wont care at all

What A Day
Nonpoint – Statement
Sittin’ on your ass all day thinkin’ about your hangover and the party you left your fuckin’ keys at and had to beg for a ride from a stranger that I never met before he acted so friendly that I had to take the ride but for some reason he resembled that guy wanted for a robbery and beatin’ on his kid “you remind me of my stepson” he chuckles with a grin. What was that move that they taught in self-defense where you block the killer’s knife move with some confidence the signal when you’re trapped inside a moving car I wonder if he’ll drive real far. What a day, you should’ve stayed home shootin’ the breeze all day, you should think next time before you start to play, I wonder what will happen today. Rub your eyes from no sleep this week tap your heels home then fall asleep. Sittin’ around looking for a fight kinda’ pissed off how I’m turnin’ My life up-side down from insecure insecurities makin’ up My mind through old hypocrisy up and out of harms way down cause I want to be there here because you want Me not because you’re caught in My stare. What was that move that they taught in self-defense where you block the killer’s knife move with some confidence the signal when you’re trapped inside a moving car I wonder if he’ll drive real far.

Rub your eyes from no sleep this week tap your heels home then fall asleep, asleep in bed you’ll do something tomorrow instead.

got me
a lil journal
to write in

since I stumbled upon this

this
me
so
to be fair to this journal
I will enter it
into
my new one
and
yeah
take in mind
this is along the same lines
as
my “Journal in the dark” stuff
I wrote this a few monthes later
and
I wasnt has deppressed
but
I was obviously something
and
if I had any sense in me
I would
have noticed it
ala
Journal in Denial
I will do an entry a page
dont worry
there arent many
The last page i wrote in
will not be put in
it concerns stuff
I wrote for when I was offline for a few weeks
and
fearing I wouldnt be back

I dont want people to know
even if they do
enjoy….

Our shadows taller than our souls

Blue Lake

Montague Michigan
was the last place
I ever really wanted to live
right on the shores
of Lake Michigan

it’s on a side of a hill
all up the side of this hill
is
land for sale
for
houses and such

all it has

dirt roads
and trees
I drove up it

there
like me

understand me

will make my life bearable

I loved it
anything somewhat to do with someone eating Ray Liotta
has to be
great
I kinda like the fact
that
no matter what Dr. Lector
does
in the end
he’s not viewed as the “bad guy”
It kinda shows how…
sometimes
the people we notorize
aren’t the worst people in the world
but
then again
he did eat people….
I went out
and got a Voicemail number
and
I dont know what to do with it
*sigh*
sauteeing brains…la la la(it’s sauteing….how come that doesnt look right???)
I had an idea yesterday
morning
for
what I could do with
my creative desires
I would make
a
faux
od
of a person
er well
the exact opposite person of me
one of those people
who
are
i suppose
“Bad” people
I think people refer to them
as
predators
but
I have some
issues
with the concept
Im not so worried about the response to it
some people may love it
most will most likely hate it
Im more worried about
it’s affects on me
If I make a character
and
make he realistic
some part of my mind
must be his.
At what point
do his imaginary thoughts
become mine?
when
do I start lving his life.
I guess
I need some feedback on this
I want to do something unique and creative
and
I would have dismissed it last night
if I wasnt serious
I guess
Im afraid of what would happen to me
if I do 
do this
Id be tapping into some
primal
male area of my subconcious
that
Id rather not go
but
Iunno…

of
Boredom

can fix this

I’ve had this song in my head
Once I read the lyrics
I decided I really liked it
Given to Fly  -Pear Jam-
He could have tuned in, tuned in, but he tuned out 
A bad time, nothing could save him 
Alone in a corridor, waiting, locked out 
He got up out of there ran for hundreds of miles… 
He made it to the ocean
Had a smoke in a tree
The wind rose up, set him down on his knees 
A wave came crashing like a fist to the jaw 
Delivered him wings – “Hey, look at me now”
Arms wide open with the sea as his floor
Oh! He’s FLYING! Oh, HIGH! WIDE! Oh… 
He floated back down cause he wanted to share 
His key to the locks on the chains he saw everywhere 
But first he was stripped, and then he was stabbed 
By faceless men, well fuckers… he still stands. 
And he still gives his love, he just gives it away… 
The love he recieves is the love that is saved 
And sometimes is seen a strange spot in the sky 
A human being that was given to fly 
He’s FLYING! Oh, HIGH! WIDE! 
He’s FLYING!

Oi
my feet hurt
such a burden
I carry
Wait
no
stop bitching J
I’ve been having odd dreams
the past two nights
I guess
I have been dreaming
of
my “dream woman”
tis sad too
I never see her
all I know
is her laugh
The first dream
we were watching “Army of Darkness”
and
she accepted that it was the greatest movie ever
and
in the second dream
she gave me an amethyst heart
So…
looking at this
I know
I will never find her
One
Noone except me
Thinks Army of Darkness
is the greatest movie ever
and
two
hmmm
two
who in their right mind would give me anything???
I see weird things at k-mart
people buying tobacco and fishing lures
over food
and
threatning
their wives
when they object
A mother
screaming at her infant
just because
the child
obviously
needs
a diaper change
a father
letting his
5 year old son
try some chewing tobacco
outside
the store
All in all
The Town of Oak Ridge disgusts me
people
in other towns
arent nearly as bad
but here
people
are too stuck-up
self-centered
to care
funny too
because
it’s their
tap water
that is prolly corrupt
with
radiation
I can’t wait to get out
There’s something
~Wrong~ out in the woods
like
a b-movie
no place is riper then here
One month
….
I feel like Im in an ever freefall
of change
moving on
I want to stand still
for a second
catch my breathe
my sanity
My feet hurt
such a burden
of
being me
But
thoughts of Dido
and
a blue sky
and
the potential
of a clear
night sky
Keep my hopes up
my spirit alive
and
Incubus
sneaks in
and
Drive
makes me
belive
that
whatever tomorrow brings
Ill be there
With Open Arms
and Open eyes

Drive ~Incubuc~
Sometimes, I feel the fear of uncertainty stinging clear.
And I can’t help but ask myself how much I’ll let the
fear take the wheel and steer.
It’s driven me before, and it seems to have a vague, haunting mass appeal.
But lately I am beginning to find that
I should be the one behind the wheel.
Whatever tomorrow brings, I’ll be there with open arms and open eyes.
So if I decide to waiver my chance to be one of the hive
will I choose water over wine and hold my own and drive?
It’s driven me before and it seems to be the way that everyone else gets around.
But lately I’m beginning to find that
when I drive myself my light is found.
So whatever tomorrow brings, I’ll be there with open arms and open eyes. Yeh.
Would you kill the Queen to crush the hive?
Would you choose water over wine….
hold the wheel and drive?

Im
kinda
mellowed
right now
reading
OD’s of friends
and
people
I enjoy
to read
their thoughts
It’s
a happy sad event
when
you read of someone
somewhat feeling what you do
Happy
that
you aren’t alone
sad
because
they are feeling the same
The fountain outside has
blue water
it’s like
someone stuck
a toilet puck
in there
oh well…
I was talking to 
a lady at work
about the shootings at California
and
I was joking about
who’s going to be blamed
I put my bet on Ozzy
he seem’s to get in trouble every 10 years…
so
i figured he’s due
It’s sad too
because
The only people I blame
is
the news media
and
the people
who seek to blame
they prolong the problems
silly twits…
Anyways
this lady told
me
that she bet
that
that boy
didnt believe in God
Usually
the christian babble
down here
doesnt get to me
but
this did
And
this brings me to a rant
Lets say
for a moment
there is God
(i dont really exist)
Ok
so
here is the situation
An all-mighty being
creates
everything
and
then
creates man…
to..
um
yeah
so
now that he created man
he tells them a bunch of silly rules to follow
or
they are going to 
a very very bad place
if they die
if they follow this
then
they go to a good place
Ok
I get that…
Now
If you don’t believe in God
or
even more so
dont accept
Jesus Christ(God’s bastard son)
as your saviour
you’re going to the bad place.
Now
if you’re born in someplace
where
the “word of God” hasnt reached yet
sorry
you’re screwed
you’re going to hell.
Now
That there…upsets me
because
if there was a God
It would suck
What does God care if
A person
who
compared to his glory
is nothing
doesnt believe in him
Why does God keep us around?
(duh, Jay, cuz we are his children)
Oh
But
Im confused
Yes
Basically
If there was a God
I think he sucks
yes
He sucks
and
I say
Fuck him
yes
Fuck God
If
Jesus didnt die for my sins
He died 
I didnt kill him
I wasnt alive
Im not gonna spend enternity
rotting in hell
because
Im not grateful to Jesus
dying
a couple thousand years ago
Fuck it
So
If there was a God
I would say to God
“Jay, you fucking suck…and..if you want to damn me to hell…fucking do it already….”
but
of course
God wouldnt 
because
one
he doesnt exist
and
two
That wouldnt be very christian like
if he did
but
What does God care
God cares not
He’s too busy fucking Satan up the ass while Mary
takes pictures

Old habits
are hard to break
I called in sick
to work today
It was well founded…
I was up alll night
puking
and what not
this morning
the thought of a
nine hour day
well
NO
Im really pissed that Ive been having odd dreams
lately
almost
divintory
dreams
last night
I dreamt of someone
I sorta know
from online
It was
kinda
an intimate dream
so
that bothers me
um
You know how you can dream of someone
from chat
even if you’ve never 
seen their pic
You
just know who it is
Well
yeah
so
I dreamt of this person
lets call her
um
R
yes
R
Now
It’s fair to say
I know little
to nothing about R
So
that in itself
bothers me
that I dreamt about her
and
even more so
the
melody
of the dream
was highly
unappropiate
for this.
So
now
I know Im gonna feel odd
next time I see here
and
that has me pissed
Oh well
Ill deal
I always do
Um
Ok
My dad left to go back to chicago
an hour ago
so
for
four days
Ill be all alone
Which
Is a good bad thing
good
cuz
I can actually act deppressed
Bad
because
for
four days
Im gonna be alone
completely
in the past
I could at least call her
now
well
yeah
so
What am I gonna do?
I dont work tomorrow
or friday
and
only a lil bit on saturday
and
I only have 5 bucks to live off of
so
it’s not like im gonna go and party
or
do anything
Bah
I hate my life sometimes
And
people are consistently pissing me off
I cried last night
I wish I hadnt
It’s been a lil bit
shouldnt I be ok now?
what’s the timeline on stuff like this?
it took her a few hours to get over me….why is it
taking me so long?
(shut up J….noone wants to hear about it)
There are a shit load of stuff
I wanted to say
get off my chest
but
I forgot it…
must not have been important….

Somber
Yes
I went
to a graveyard
this morning
I have been
for the past month
going to graveyards
I really do love them
so
full of peace
I feel so
im not sure
in awe
when Im in them
so full of beauty
I watched a little bit
of American Beauty
last night
upon a friends suggestion
Im like
the guy with the video camera
I look for beauty
in 
everything
it’s there
behind
the patterns
of life
Only
I dont need to remember them
I couldnt forget if I tried
There
are few things
more beautiful
then
a
cemertary
The aching
the memories
the love
it seeps with it
fills you up
Ever notice
how
there is so much
beauty
in sadness
you should
then
you can find happiness overwhelming
Sometimes
people are too quick to judge
to understand
evilness
is only
a word
we use
there is no
true
good
or evil
it’s one big
grey
intentions
are all that matter
and
intentions
are matters of opinion
I watched the latest Fear
last night
Despite
it all being bullshit
I do want to go on it…
But
even if I had the chance
they wouldnt pick me
One
Im too fat and ugly
Two
I wouldnt be scared..and..I wouldnt say anything
la la la
Im thinking about going to that
graveyard
tonight
Im not sure why
It’s not a 
“ooooo lets go do something creepy”
I just
want to see it at night
I think
it may be a full moon tonight
The night
is
so
not night like
when it is
I think I might have been high last night
although
I didnt take anything
I had a full in-depth conversation
with my dog, lizard, and bird
Cheyenne, my dog…claimed she loved me more then anyone else could
I can believe that
she’s a sweetie…
But
dogs arent my things…
DD, my bird….claimed that..he didnt want to kill me..as I suspected…but..rather….he wants to slowly peck me to death
till I get him a bigger cage…and..a buddy…
Tiamat, my lizard, told me to fuck off and die
I love her too

of deppression
of fear

always going..always 
forward always becomes backwards
up becomes down
endless
simple
I can handle that

nothing is smooth
not physical
not mental

it will crush me
cant stay still

gets crushed

is

I found myself thinking about death
earlier
I remember when I first realized I was going to die one day
It’s quite a humbling experience
I mean…when you first realize
that
you will end
I think I was nine when it happened
Scared the shit out of me
One morning
before school
It just hit me
I sat
and cried
I didnt want to go to school
or anything
I was so scared
My mom wanted to know what was wrong
I told her
Im not sure what she thought I meant
but
she didnt get it
I think she’s in denial
Most people dont think about it
I dont blame them
Im not sure what changed in me
but
after that
I started to think about it alot
Now
Im not sure
I think I may be in denial
but
I sometimes think
that
I will never die
That
when it comes
I will have a choice
and
I will choose life
I think Im into punishing myself
choosing life is sometimes worse
but
then again
I havent died
so
I wouldnt know
It’s sad
looking back
on my
“innocent” years
the only major death
I can remember feeling sad about
was
my dog
a childs emotions
can run deep
then again
we cry more for animals
then we do for people sometimes
Odd
One point
in my life
I thought
for sure
I would commit suicide
It seemed like the way I would die
I never thought about doing it
I just know that how it would end
I knew it wouldnt get better
I wonder why I never did
Why I never held that razor
walked to that ledge
Only once
was I close
but
I lack faith
in pills
so
I slept on it
I’d be one of those people
who
would attempt to do it
but
ultimately fail
just for the attention
I hate being like that
Now
it’s not an option
I think it’s rather stupid
why bother?
Noone I have ever been close to has
comitted suicide
I’ve wondered
about the pain
one must feel
when
they find out
someone dear to them
chose to end it all
I wonder if they feel cheated
if
they are crying because
they ended it
or
because
they didnt join them
Death
is a rich topic
to think about
unknown
unresolved
Reality is a funny thing
It’s so easy to
fit into the game
to trick our minds
into playing
We are lost
really
lost in a game
the only way you win
is when everyone else is dead
game over
Im not going to die
and
Im not going to play this game
but
Im still going to win
It’s sad really
callous words
caring heart
cancel eachother out
When ever I feel bad
I tend to walk with a limp
I just noticed that
am I tryin to induce pity?
do my feelings overrun me so much
that
it handicaps me?
There is nothing anymore
I have my wits
My imagination
and
my optimisum
Empty inside
no
but
I think I’d be happier that way

I dont feel this way..but..I found this..and..found it…um..cute
A is for Arteries. You know, the things that your ex-girlfriend ripped out because she really didn’t care for you you twit she was only after your money and could have given a sh*t about you. 
B is for Bitter. Who, me?? No way. I really hope things between them do work out. I hope they get married and have 2 children that are little devils and her hips get huge and his eyebrows finally grow completely together and they get fat and old together and then DIE!! 
C is for Call ya later. She won’t. She never has before. 
D is for Dumped. Does D need to be explained? 
E is for Eating like a pig. Remember when you took her out and she said ‘I’m not hungry’ so you figured you could take her to a nice place because you were able to afford a nice meal at this fine restaurant. Then she ate more than your Uncle Roy (you remember Uncle Roy the one with the mustard stains on everything). So you flip the bill and are broke for the next two weeks and she wonders why you were unable to call her that week and go see movies. 
F is for Friends. That is what she just wants to be. As if you can even stand to look at her. 
G is for Gun. And yes there is a waiting period. 
H is for Horny. Remember when she looked nice and even had a personality? Well, you figure it out. 
I stands for I still hate her. Odds are I always will, unless she calls me and offers me favors. 
J stands for Jim. This is her new boyfriend. Doesn’t Jim have a nice car? Doesn’t Jim have a good job? Why does Jim want to date her? I think Jim could do much better. I hate Jim. Jim is my mortal enemy. 
K stands for Kill (remembering it’s still illegal). 
L is for Love. It’s a great euphoric feeling that exists between two people and is shared upon by both parties. 
M stands for Mephistophiles. That is who she worked for. 
N stands for Necropheliac. She didn’t move very much, did she? 
O is for On top. When on top she has another O word. 
P is for Pill. She said she was on it. She lied. She is now sueing you for a few hundred bucks a month. 
Q is for Quitter. She couldn’t last. 
R is for Rich little Witch. She bought my love but I paid for it. 
S stands for Stab. Stabbing would be fun (Still illegal!!!). 
S is also for Steve. Steve was the guy that was sleeping with her. Steve is a bad person. Perhaps you should stab Steve. 
T is for torture. Torture is what she did. She tortured you with the truth.  She also tortured you with lies. She even tortured you with whips and hand-cuffs. 
U is for Understatement. Saying you hate that her is an understatement. 
V is for Voluptuous. That is the primamry reason you were dating her in the first place. 
W stands for Wine. The expensive wine she loved to order when you went out.  W is also for the water you enjoyed, not being able to afford anything else to eat. 
X is for Xylophone. Because X is always for xylophone. 
Y stands for You suck! Remember when she yelled that at you. 
Z stands for the last one…which she won’t be…
again..i dont feel this way..but..again..I found it cute…

Seperated from his peers
Escape

Death
probable

released from his cell
He wouldnt leave
He isnt capable

He knows not

All

his food

exposure
Ignorant of his situation
perhaps
his existance
He stands tall

blaming things
on yourself
When the entire

has a problem
Why would they listen to the minority
that doesnt?

to isolate them

separate
ourselves

why are we so afraid

Santa Monica ~Everclear~
I am still livin’ with your ghost
Lonely and dreaming of the west coast
I don’t wanna be your downtime
I don’t wanna be your stupid game 
With my big black boots and an old suitcase
I do believe I’ll find myself a new place
I don’t wanna be the bad guy
I don’t wanna do your sleepwalk dance anymore
I just wanna see some palm trees
I will try and shake away this disease 
We can live beside the ocean
Leave the fire behind
Swim out past the breakers
Watch the world die
I am still dreamin’ of your face
Hungry and hollow for all the things you took away
I don’t wanna be your good time
I don’t wanna be your fallback crutch anymore 
Walk right out into a brand new day
Insane and rising in my own weird way
I don’t wanna be the bad guy
I don’t wanna do your sleepwalk dance anymore
I just wanna feel some sunshine
I just wanna find some place to be alone 
We can live beside the ocean
Leave the fire behind
Swim out past the breakers
Watch the world die
Yeah watch the world die

It’s hard
not to be
renewed
by
a morning’s
fresh light
Whatever that was spelled
in the night
the words
evaporate
in the pureness
A blissful mix
of silence
solitude
with
the sounds of
life
and
indifference
towards
my
meager
intrusion
Existance
is such
a
unique
and
wonderful
corundrum

No

how hard
I’m
slammed down
It always
seems better

Bred
for servitude
Languishing
in
a
visible cage
pressue…
Their cover
whisked away
into
oblivion
Fate
the final destination
inevitable
Agitated
by
a tremor
of
unknown origin
and force
A mutiny
begins
Small
and
inconspicous
The roof
is removed
And
an explosion
erupts within
Each struggle
to the top
and
freedom
in
a volcanic
catclysmic
event
Quickly diffused
and
cleaned up
Deliverance
to
the predetermined fate
occurs

I see
a
man/
boy
infront of me
His eyes
tell
a simple story
turned
complicated
by
his
questing mind
and
tempered heart
The story tells
of
glory
and
minor
personal triumph
but
mostly
surrounds
self-applied
grief
and
common
day 
tragedy
Irony
being
the
harninger
of
tears
Wept
and
concealed
Back
in the
corner of his eyes
in the midst
of sadness
lies
a glimmer
of
hope
surrounded by
a
halo
of
understanding
He tries
to speak
but
my
own
thoughts
and
words
drown him out
His
trials
are
very much
like my own
Inverted
and
backwards
but
similar
none the less
So
now
I write of him
Wishing
he would read my words
so
that
his voice
would stop
being
drowned out
and
that
he stops living
across
from me
But
my
words
tend
to be his

from Emode.comHey, 
God, you’re a Lethal Weapon!
You’re smart, slick, and fast. You break rules. You start trends. MTV wants to interview you. You love loud, obnoxious parties where you can let it all hang out. No structure, please. You hate routine and boring, predictable people. You get cabin fever if you’re cooped up too long  say, five minutes or so. But you adapt to new situations as smooth as butter. Well, maybe chunky peanut butter.
You’re open-minded, enthusiastic, and popular with both people and pets. Sure, you had bad hair in high school, but now you’ve got style. Everyone wants to be your friend. They buy you drinks and give you nicknames. But at home, late at night with the shades pulled down, you secretly question your self-worth, wondering if you’re really all you’re cracked up to be. Then you go to bed.
You hate seeing the same old faces at work day after day. But at the same time, you’re a great leader among them. You’re motivated and serious, and you always jump at the chance to take on a new project. Innovation and abstract thinking are your strengths. But sometimes you’d rather just work on an independent project so you can do your stuff without having to deal with people.
*Well
I see that previous
opinion of emode
still stands
Flaming idiots….
I admit
that
on some points
they
do
strike
truth
but
Im hardly
the

a little
over
a month
ago
when
this day
meant something

now
sameness
special

the sun is
out

no

Today
also
happens
to be
the drop dead day
for
the people
up north
to decide
on
closing
on the house
If
they choose not
We lose the house down here
and
again
begin the search for a new one
and
even more
so
Delaying
me
having
a computer
and
a reliable
means
to come online.
Although
I know not
what
I’d be getting on to
Everyone’s
fading away
I talk to them more
playing
note-tag
then
anything else
My
exodus
from
online
romance
seemed
to have
rendered
some friendships
nonexistant
leaving me
the
one in the corner talking to himself
And
people
now
either
are
shunned from being online…
in a similar boat as me

to busy to come on…

how

out

Destined to never

it will always

Ever inching forward
No matter how close
I get

always
even
when
every
nerve
in your body
says

Mind over matter

your mind is matter?
If
nothing

traveling through reality
never

Rain drops
keep falling on my head…
Hmmm
My Uncle Bill died two nights ago
Unfortunetly
I never met the man
Only heard of him
through
my Mom’s
stories
of him
Which
Oddly Enough
I have forgotten.
So
My mom left this morning
for
Little Rock
to attend the funeral
And
Im
stuck here
to write my
Aunt Julie
an email
saying
my mother’s coming
Now
I beleive
My Aunt Julie..
isnt technically
my aunt
but
She’s been my “aunt”
all my life
so
old habits are not
going to be broken
Now
for those of you
who have
been unfortunate
enough
to
recieve
an email
from
Me
Know
that
my patience
and
effort
put forth
into one
Is
rather
er
um
Shitty
So
I’ve spent all morning
pondering
the
words
that should be used
in the email
So far
I have
Dear Aunt Julie,
I am very sorrowed
to hear about Uncle Bill
My mother left this morning
to attend the
events
She should be there
sometime
this afternoon
Again…I am sorry to hear about Uncle Bill
Sincerely
Jay
I don’t
know
what else to put
I don’t know my Aunt Julie well
I didnt know Uncle Bill well
Hell
I don’t even know the relation tween
the two
Bah
On other notes
The sky is still grey
and
I am still tired
and
now
I have a headache
Have you ever
held your breathe
to
the point
of
passing out
and
then
quickly exhale
and
watch
the little lights
pop
in your eyes?
It’s fun
I wonder

a turmoil inside

out
and

a beautiful day

per usual
I will miss it

for a butterfly
Would I?
Would

all
that
I may miss

the butterfly

I sit here

ponder
what
keys to press next

letters
to be used
to form words
to form thoughts

then
I reflect
and

Im cold

dont

let something out…
I don’t think I ever will be content

accomplish…
I will find something
else

suddenly
Im back where I was…
I sometimes wish I was pretty
So
I could look

rebuilding myself
for
the
first time
Finding
strength
in
those
around me
I wish
though
someone
could
understand me
Know
what
I see
and
feel
Appreciate me
I think
I ask 
too much
at times
I have more
then
some people
who am
I
to
want
Wanting
is an awful thing
Desire
is
even worse
I do both…
There are
so
many things
I suppose
I will
never be happy
Happiness
is
a forgotten emotion
I think
we lose
Happiness
at age 8
At 9
reality
takes effect
and
we stop living
and
start
surviving
Funny
how
words
make
a difference
In
perception
So many different
perceptions
Nothing
as it seems
anymore
and
I never know
what is
what
Except me
I have
only
one perspective
So
I cling
to myself
and
try
to understand
the
world
around me
I am a rock
I am an Island
Funny
how
words
of the past
reflect
and
are
reused
in the present
Recycled
Ideas
Still
so many things
to be said
I can’t hardly
concentrate
The pain
of
a bird
pains me
more
then
I can bear
sorrowfilled
disheartened…
negatives
balancing
the positive
Neuatral
base…
When
two
notes
are out of tune
the
more
chaotic
the
dissonance
the closer
they
are
to being
the same
My mind
is
still being shaped
by
the
clouds
Sometimes
I can
only look
up
and
dream
Dreaming
is
at times
the best thing
for us
Reality
is just
someone elses dream…

I cant seem to find my
own
Originality
dominating
Wrong
Right
Turn it around
it makes no sense
Perfectly clear
Distortion
Only in my mind

my eyes
My heart
is filled
with
the
wanting
of love
And
tainted
with
the
pain
of denial
Apprehension
Flows
in
and
out
like
a tide
of
ill feelings
and
black clouds
of remorse

the
gray

does
the grey
always
win
And
the BLue
always come back
Why
is
never
truly
dark
until
I open my eyes
Empty
inside
Never
Empty
Inside
always
full
only
desires
to be empty
rather
then
feel this way
Absoloution
is
a bitch
and
irrational
Not needed
Not applied
still here
Go away
and
let me
tend
to me
Allow me
to encompass me
to
force me
to
not
dislike me
Turning inwards

that falls
is
the
life
that
is
changed
Constant
changing

It’s only
a
cycle

another

back
it’s chaos
No

a game

Its morning
now
The bus pulls up
Takes me away
Destroys

my dreams
No
That was me
It’s not

Hope

everlasting

is failure
a balance

Flying

Why
Im using my break
to come here
I suppose
this
is best
relaxant I know
4 hours
of
staring
at my yellow
tinted reflection
with
red
ridges
slashing
across my face
Smiling
over
my
grimace
Saying
thank you
and
good day
when
fuck you
seems
to be
the only thing
thought
I have such
a
short fuse lately
It
angers me
that I do
My mother…
I know she means well
and
doesnt realize it
but
sometimes
I can’t take
her
rantings
that
arent even rantings
but
comments
but
to me
they seem
superflous
God
I hate it
when
Im upset
at nothing
All
I want to do
is
climb
into
my car
play
something
really loud
and
dissappear
I feel bad
for
snapping at people
or
being
bitchy
I think 
tomorrow
Im going to take Cheyenne
up the hill
and
hide out
for
a few hours
Relax
Listen to the sounds
of nature
and
man
subduing nature
Im wearing thin
And
not
a day goes by
that
I dont
mention that
I wonder
if
this
will
post
the first time
or
will it take
many many attempts
adding
to my fire
Elaborating
my explosion
Sometimes
I need
to take things
into
perspective
and
not
let them
get Me
down
So easy
to preach something
So
hard
to follow it
Sometimes
I want
to jump
up
and start
dancing
but
My body
can’t move right
I hate
that I can’t
I know
it’s all psychological
But
I envy
the people
so much
who
can
just
let themselves
go
and
get lost in the music
Im sure…
for some
it’s not
like that anymore
But
thats ok
Thats how it is for me
and
I can’t dance
I think
I might
try drawing again…
I can never get the lines right
but
hell
I need to do something
SHit…
I’ve totally given up on
my
instrument…
maybe…
I should do that again…
Maybe
thats my hole…
It becomes
empty
when
noone can hear you..
I feel better now
I did
need this
I think
I can go back..and
not manage to kill someone…

Out of

B movie
I swear
A peacful
country road
curves
into
Government
land
Nature
becomes
manicured
and
something
wicked
this way comes
Marked
only
by
the
feeling
of wrongness
and
graffiti
that
Be it
anywhere else
would
be
removed
by the righteous
community
Oh
the
journeys
of
horror
that my mind takes
while
I drive
through
Sealed
in my car
with
the sounds
of
complacency
and
peace
I don’t
expect
anyone
to get this
It’s
one
of those
Had to be there
things
But

you will

the way I came
past
the
box
Into
peace
Relief
flowing in
as
fear?
flows out
Most likely
my imagination
Excercise…
I almost cried
when
I came around a turn
So many colours
so many shapes
So real
so
there
I’m not used
to seeing this
I’m not sure
if
I will ever get used to it..
so..much
I couldnt quite
make it home though
Had to stop
had
to let
something out

so
many
in my head
I listened
to
me
play
on a cd
I forget
sometimes
how
wonderful
a feeling
it is
I never
do
anything
remotely
that
stands out
That did
for
a moment
I was
in the spotlight
and
it felt good
That
was a good year for
that
6 years
of
practice
somewhat
paid
in one
I live by regret though
Big year
as it was
It should have been bigger
better
I can run around
and
point
my finger
and
cast blame
but
when it’s all said and done
I would be
pointing at me
But
I can’t allow myself
to live
with
the regret
of failure
The
here
and now matter
Thats what decides the future
If
I work up
enough
courage
I may
pick it up again..
And
maybe
if Im lucky
the
first sound out
will
go over well
I know
the notes
that follow
wont be
But
I can work at it…
I have nothing but time no
No more excuses
No more goals that aren’t achieved
I can do anything
I can
Except fly
but
Im working on that

many
many nights

of these

by far
this one
is the worst
I won’t elaborate on it

fear

when I go home

to
find
it’s truth

I can
see it happening
It wouldnt surprise me

This sucks
this really sucks

fuck up
I hope he wasnt stupid
I hope
he didnt take anyone with him
There’s
too much of this
going around

Good time….
get slapped back down

my life is
I suppose
I can only bouce up
day by day
emotional trampoline
I always wanted one
of those big ones
Don’t want one now
though
I just
want
to go to work
Hope
that the day goes by fast
Go home
and
hope
that
The news I expect
wont come
and
that
sleep
will
be peaceful and deep
But
hoping
is only that

It’s all 
I see now
grey
my 5 day long
bad mood
Everything
gets to me
Everything is
bothering me
It seems
that
every word
spoken
is
a small
jagged
knife
twisting
in me
Intent
filled
and
promise
for more
I can no longer
stand
work
I know not
why
I am going to go back
after my break
Every 
single person
I meet
Rubs me
the wrong way
Oddly enough
the only thing
not
bothering me
is my parents…
I am
so tired
of
being alone
of my life
consisting
of
Waking up
eating last night’s left overs
going to work
stopping here
to relieve
some
tension
In here
going home
Eat a cold dinner
and
go back to bed 
watching tv
I don’t talk anymore
I mean
sure
I talk at work
but
that doesnt count
that’s not me
thats just a overweight
20 year-old
who obviously lacks the intelligence
to make it in the world
or
he wouldnt be stuck
behind
a cash register
in a K-mart
I have
small talk
with my parents
but
thats it
I have
a small notebook
Filled
with
words
and
thoughts
and
hopes
and
desires
I write
in my room
at
2 am in the morning
because
I cant sleep anymore
because
I am so
filled
with
discontent
and
remorse
that
to merely
close my eyes
forces
me
to think about it
and
I cannot take it anymore
it’s bleeding over
into my vision
and
my mood
making me irratable
and
overly
in a piss-poor mood
And
I know
Im ranting
But
If I don’t
I will just
AGH
breath
At night
I write
of
how
lonely I am
how
empty
I feel
and
how
all
I want to give
but
noone wants to recieve
But
I know
that
is
my fault
It’s not like
Im doing anything about it
All
I do
is sit here
and
mention it
maybe
deep down inside
Hoping
that
What
I want
will come to me
I know
it’s something
I need to pursue
and
face rejection
I know this
Im just
not sure
how to go about it
and
Im not
sure
if
Im secure
enough
in myself
to do it
On days like this
I don’t want
to live
day by day
I need
something to look
forward too
something
to keep me going
Something to believe in?
I can believe in my only so much
It’s a self-reducing circle
growing smaller
and
smaller
choking out
the
excess
and
leaving
only
thoughts
of
irratation
and
discomfort
Grey
it’s grey everywhere

anymore
I think
The time
I had
going
back
in my car
and
the
time
I spent
outside
watering
plants
cooled me off
I still
meant
and
feel
everything
I wrote
but
it’s not
as
pressing now
Btw
there are several things
I wrote
that
I planned
on putting in here
but
No
not anymore
Although
they stand true
I think
I don’t need to relive
the
moment
by
rewriting it…
bah
It’s taking me
too long
to write this

I put in

me

rotate

up there

Bachelors Grove
and

and
maybe
go to Bremen
and
see
a cheap movie
like
Oh
I love to do

sent
an email
last night
I think
I would have regretted…
I was so empowered
by
my
anger
and
bleh
that I was in the mood
for
some
punishment
So
I prepared
an email
of
one’s feelings towards
another
and
as I went
to
type
in the
destination
my
hand seemed to slip
and
promptly
closed the window
And
now
this morning
I am most
grateful
I know
that
if sent
and
if
someone
knew
someone elses feelings about
that person
The
simple
thought
would be odd
even more so
When
the feelings
are not
the same
Suddenly
that person
would feel
odd
simply
talking to that person
and
that
is
unacceptable
so
Bleah
Oh
look
it’s time to go to work
and
I forgot

rememberance
explode

Pain

no alternitive

as
A one

Instances are
ruled
by
the recent

the idea
of the same betrayal
linger

Repeat themselves
Imposing
into

disaese
Infected now
Doomed
to inflict
the same
pain
recieved
To
the ones
who should only recieve love
The tears that fall
are

Things
look
tarnished
wrong
Real
Reality has no place
here
My life
is too real
I don’t have
enough
dis-
reality
It’s amazing
how quick
my mood can turn

I let myself
laugh

allow
a real

And
appreciate
the
wrongness
the
Irony
the
Double Standard
that
often
exists
Nothing
is ever as simple
as a first impression
except
a first impression
I’m enjoying
the lack of pressure
Noone expects me to succeed
Noone expects me
to be the person they once wanted me
to be
No expectations
Just
figure me to fail
in everything
and
hopefully
Fade away
So that my failure 
is finally mine
not theirs
So that
They dont have to feel
bad
for me
When
I didnt
reach my goals
set by them
I don’t blame them
Im not even angry
at them
It was my fault
I am
the only one to blame
Now
Since I am expected to fail
I will do what
I have always done
Exact opposite
of what is wanted of me
Consistancey is a bitch
I forget
things
I say in the past alot
Mostly on purpose
I don’t live life
worring that I might
contradict myself
I know I do
I accept that
I try to hard
to be happy
I do
I put so much effort
into it
that
even when I should be
Im not
Relax
I need that
Relaxation

This email describes a facate of my issue
I will elaborate later
This is an Email that my Aunt nona sent all the younger
generation in my family
Sent: 4/27/01 2:35:24 PM 
Subject: Buffalo Lake
Please forward this message to Jay and Karl.  Thank you.
Dear Nieces, Nephews, and Daughters,
The time has come for me to finalize and close the estate of June R. Reinhold 
in Wisconsin.  Just as I sold her property in IL in 1986, and gave 1/3 of the 
proceeds to each of her children, your parents, I now am selling her property 
in Wisconsin.  I do not wish to sell the Buffalo Lake property, but it makes 
no sense at all to keep my inheritance tied to a property that I do not use.  
We will soon be selling our home in Orland Park, moving to Arizona, and, 
eventually, selling our Daytona Beach Shores property.  We need to simplify 
our lives by only having one home/property to manage, traveling as we desire 
during our retirement.
In 1995, I promised Jil that I would not sell the property or expect either 
her or Ross to purchase my share until her children were graduated from high 
school.  That occurred in June, 2000.   I have made many very generous offers 
to Jil and Ross through the past 10 years, and, fortunately for me, they did 
not accept them, for now the property values in northern Wisconsin have 
reached much higher figures.  Knowing that the property was an investment for 
me, I agreed to wait to close the estate business according to Grandma 
Reinhold’s Will.
Once again, I have offered to Ross and Jil that they may purchase my share; 
but, it is highly unlikely they will. . . unless, of course, they are getting 
extended family and friends together to “save” the beautiful Buffalo Lake 
property.  As you probably know, Brad is selling his Kerekes property.  He 
has offered it to Ross, Jil, and I until 4/30, and if we don’t want it, he 
said he’d offer it to the Sullivans.  Danny and Donna Sullivan are probably 
the only ones in that family who might be interested in the property; 
however, at the moment they don’t know that our property is also up for sale. 
In June, Brad said he will list it with a realtor if no family is going to 
buy it.
I had already made this decision prior to receiving Brad’s letter.  Indeed, 
last August I had two realtors appraise the property, and they were anxious 
to list it then.  With Aunt Cammie’s cancer and the roof leaking, it was not 
a good time to list.  The roof was re-shingled in October, making it just 
about ready to list at this current time.  I know that I’ve sent 
communications to you all regarding helping to do repairs on the cabin — 
well, that’s about responsibility and taking care of property.  Those repairs 
still need to be done.  However, I decided that I didn’t want to lose the 
prime time for listing/showing the cabin.
As a result, realtors may be showing the cabin sometime when you are visiting 
there this summer.  I want you to know that they are supposed to be there, 
and you should cooperate with them.  Mary Reinemann, a broker with 
Tri-R-Realty in Hayward, and her associates may show up from time to time to 
inspect the property or to show it to prospective buyers.
Once again, I am really sorry to have to sell the property, but I see no 
other recourse.  Currently, neither Ross nor Jil is communicating with me.  . 
. that is their choice.  Their silence-treatment will not manipulate me into 
changing my mind.  Throughout the last 14 years, I have been nothing but 
honest and fair to them both; but, I have been on the receiving end of their 
hostilities and manipulative attempts.  This a cooperative family does not  
make!  
When I settled the IL estate, I did so by myself and did not take the usual 
executor’s fee.  I also got no thank you’s from either of them.  I have dealt 
with a multitude of legal problems, requiring me to write letters and keep 
files.  I want to be done with all of that.  So, nieces and nephews, when you 
hear the nasty comments about me from your parents, please remember two 
things:  your parents did not help me at all with any of the estate business 
(gratis on my part) and they discount my rights as a beneficiary of Grandma’s 
estate.
Love,
Nona

Go me
I’ve successfully burned
myself
a cd 
for the first time
I had a revelation
today
while I was mowing the lawn
But
I must have washed it
away
with the sweat
in the shower…
Hmmm
Maybe i didnt
do so well 
on this cd….
I remember the last time I heard this
song
It always amused me
but
I also how
someone wouldnt let me listen to it
And
how I let her
control me
There is no 
begining
there is no end
there is only change
I know
I know
But
Changing scares me
Im scared of what
I could become
Im scared to try
But
I will
but
only
change
as much as I need to
Because
although
I hate it
I love who I am
If I found out
there was someone
else
exactly like me
I’d be pissed…
Oh look
I found my revelation
It seems different now
Time does that
to
thoughts
and ideas
makes them less
unique
We all
want to be unique
special
Stand out
to fit in
I love
how
the
things that 
seem so wrong
end up so right
Hypocrisy
Oxymorons…
Dealing with issues
that cant be dealt with
Fending off
hope
for fear
of
the pain it’s absence
creates.
Everyday
Every minute
Suddenly
nothing

Because everything is nothing,

with the flesh and the blood that you call your soul,
flip it inside out, it’s a big black hole, 
take your money burn it up like an asteroid, 
possession, though you’re never gonna feel the void,

Revenge~Papa Roach
Remember the girl

Remember the girl
Abused with forks, knives, and razor blades? 
She finally left him 
Had enough of her man’s rage 
Band-aids covered her scars she left him bloodied 
Beat his ass with a bat 
Face sunk in like silly putty 
Y’all can sit back so I could study 
Destruction of the family design 
And how the morals of society decline
Essentially its beats to rhyme like grapes to wine 
It’s alright 
We’re in love 
Can’t live with 
Or without 
You see she can’t live with him 
And can’t live without him 
Stress got her down she need to deal with the problem 
As the drama gets deeper 
I puff on the reefer 
Took the last step and sent his ass to the reaper 
Chaos, is what she saw in the mirror 
Scared of herself and the power that was in her 
It took over 
And weighed heavy on her shoulder 
Militant insanity is now what controlled her
It’s alright 
We’re in love 
Can’t live with 
Or without 
It’s alright 
We’re in love 
Can’t live with 
Or without 
Were in love
Were in love
Kill it before it reaches you 
Missiles won’t work it’s approaching the mainland 
What if it reaches the metropolitan areas?
Cosmopolitan areas 
Secure the lines and prepare for departure
Calm, calm, calm, 
It is a, a big business 
And seems to be 
Advancing underground 
Cuz my style is yo, is underground 
I’m green
With my red eyes mad tint 
Flea fly flo
Rapido, rapido 
She feeds plentiful
Electrifying the nation
Electrifying the nation!
Don’t you see that were in danger? 
How will we stop it? 
She is attacking 
Don’t you see that we are in danger?

content I am now
That scares me though

this isnt all I want

And
whistling..I keep on doing it…
The moon is out
I taunts me..I think

and
having me
tell myself
that I am being unrealistic
I can never win
It’s raining outside
I have my windows open
Hoping the rain will
sneak in
and
merge with
my skin
Simple comforts
of
a wet embrace
A single drop
multiplyed endlessy
until
It is all one big drop
Drowning me inside
Happily letting it in
to my lungs
heart
and mind
And
welcoming the watery
peace
it offers
But
The rain has stopped now
and
Evermore
I am alone

Funny
how
close
chaos
and order are
Look at something close..and
it’s intelligable..
take a step back..and
it’s suddenly something…
take another step..
and
it’s nothing again
on and on 
Are we just
side effects of existance
It’s scary
to think about
all that is out there
Beyond
our vision
and
understanding
Vainly…calling it nothing
simply because we
cannot begin to comprehend the void..
There’s this woman I work with
She’s the
atypical
bitchy old lady at work
who doesnt like anyone
and
never ever enjoys herself
A few weeks ago
she fainted
at work
and
was taken to the hospital
where
they realized she
has
some sort of 
problem with her gall bladder
When she came back to work
Suddenly
she was the most cheerful
and
fun person there
Im glad
she’s finally enjoying herself
I hope I never
become miserly
My mom’s best friend
has always had it bad
She has a condition that
is very much like
MS
it started about a decade ago…and
as gradually subdued her
to a wheel cheer…
Now…
She has a tumor in her neck..which is 
most likely
malignant

as
a side effect

to live
and breathe

mold him

change him
to what suits him best

exist

then live

I think I have
grown
addicted to living
and
I enjoy it too much

the imperfectness
that life presents
A self solving problem
Order with chaos
Chaotic patterns
Always balancing
and checking

seems to captivate me
The concept
of washing away..
always there
seeping in
polluting reason
and
logic
Mixing my mind
to be
one
little
factory
of
images
that
I could never
show
in words
I am limited alot
Trying to say things
which
words
cant describe
It comes out
sorted
and
conjuncted
I always feel that I am talking to someone in here
“You”
to be exact
I dont know You
but I always talk to You
You always seem to listen
never answer though
People just listen in on the conversation
Why dont you talk to me
You
I can only say so much
before
I repeat myself
I wish
I could sit here
and
describe something
meaningful

I am empty today
I am
tired
and weak
and
My resolve is gone
All i want is sleep
and
someone to be here
But
All I can manage is sleep
Atleast
I can dream someone here

The uncaring

Is not theirs

The darkness peels
away
Leading
to
the
absence
of said
So many walls
so many pits
traps
peeling away
like
my mangled flesh…
Self harm
self intent
dislike
Patterns
of association
flood
my mind
with
thoughts
contradicting
overflowing
Leaving me
dry
High
and
alone
Drowning in my own apathy
suffocating
on my own pity
And
dodging yours
I can be whoever you want me
to be
But
then
that wouldnt be me
For
I don’t exist
I am
just
a figment

Side effect…
unwanted
unknown

Reclaiming

throne
In the
dark of my
refelctions
Distorted by
words
of faith

My contradictions
and
carelessness
catch up to me
I can no longer

hopeful

are gone
I am too young to give up
but
too old to dream
I can’t keep
on pretending that
things will happen
and
that
my smile will no longer be fake
That
someone would love me
like I them
and
that I deserve any love anyways…
Denial
has broken

To whom it may concern:
You don’t know me
er
yes
yes you do
But
you have no idea
my feelings towards you
Chances are
you never will
No matter
how hard I try
I will never gain
the
confidence in myself
to tell you
So
I let it build inside
Slowing
consuming me
and
ultimely
pushing me away
Sometimes
I imagine
hints may slip out
But
no
I don’t think i could ever tell you
I could tell you know
But
I think you’re smart enough to figure it out
albeit
I wonder if you know who you are…
I sometimes wish
i could
hide
and
spy on you
Not to be all stalker like
rather
just to get some insight
of your feelings of me
Maybe that
would help my confidence
and
then
I could act
But
Im not going to sit here
and say that
that would help
It’s not your fault
it’s mine
Im sorry that I cant seem to climb out
of this 
I can pretend
that I would be great for you
but
chances are…and..history states
that
I’m not
Im too emotional
too
contrived
too
me
So
I hope
with this
I will let it out
and
continue on my way
of
caring for someone
and
never letting them know
Habits are had to break

A tidal wave
of
black mist
Rises up
and
crashes down
on my
hapless soul
Crushing
me
Breaking me
Yet
never ending me
Leaving me
there
to recover
and
become blinded 
in it’s

seeping
my will
to live
to the point
of
exhausation
a purgatory
where
death is the only escape
And
death
is the only
nonexistant
I think
psychology
is a very humbling field
I mean
examining the faults
in one’s body
and
environment
While knowing
that
themselves
are bound to have some of those faults
It kills one ego
I think
But
thats ok
I think most of em
are robots anyways
I wish
life was like
a fantasy world
with dragons
and
princesses
and
tangible magic
I would enjoy it more
Although
Im sure if it was
I would wish life was like
it is now
So
what’s the use in wishing
Regressing back
I wish
I could step outside myself
and
comment
on my flaws
and
upsides
But
I think I would hate me
I cant seem to shake this cold
I cant seem to shake anything
I need a change
something new
something
out of my routine
of life

thought process…

seperated from everything

There really are no second chances

I need to get away
break all my ties

I’ve crawled inside 
of myself

now I need to look out

everyones whispering in my ear
and telling my what Im seeing

pity is all that is meant for me
I don’t want
it
I don’t

engulf you
within the darkness
Inhaled into your mind
Spreading
the seed
of fear
and resentment
through out
your synapses
The brightness in your eyes
are clouded over
by
weary
condensation
of despair
and finality
Your limbs grow
weaker
as each one flails
in a futile struggle
to freedom
Finally
you are in the paralyze
and
all that moves
is the fog
around you
Petrified
Eyes wide open
Forced
to watch the swirling gas
Imagining it take form
and
taunt you
Still
you inhale
more and more
Until
your body fades away
and you become…
there is a light
in the chaos
It draws you near
You fly about it
like an insect
to a lamp
Desiring
what you once had
who you once were
Put
for each inch you near
another inch is gained
A torture of a
Tartarus
design
I can you see you in the mists
now
I can see you approach
I reach out
and
feel your vaporous flesh
Now 
you want my love
Now
you want my flesh
I inhale you in
And
process you inside
and exhale
what I once desired
and
consume
what I never could have

Storms have raged
I felt their call
I felt their need
I imagine
they felt mine
Images filled my head

walking out

Standing against it
flowing with it

within it
Letting it’s rage soothe

soothe it’s pain
Chaos to settle
my chaos
I can’t think straight
Inside
I heard it’s cries
it’s screams
And I pain no heed

within my shelter…

I denied myself

And the moon

Spinning in 
indecision
Praying that the turbelent waters

drown
destroy

secretly wishing the sweet
release of death
Would ease the pain of life
Moonlight days
and Sunlight nights
Paradox
being the only amusement
Tired eyes
long for sleep

Fear of what lurks
beyond vision
Demands
none
Desire to leave
Desire to change
But
it fades
when a hint
of difficulty arises
Moving in circles
getting
smaller and smaller

self-destruction
The water is calm now
Too calm
It runs deep
and Many things lurk beneath
Sleep imposes it’s will

Resistance is no longer

you have been pounding it in my head

I’ve let a little out
funny how all my life
I wasnt the biggest Bach fan
and
he’s the one who makes me feel better…
Thanks J.S.
Sometimes
I need to express myself
not in words
but
emotions…
audible emotions
I stopped
for a long time
Because
my notes
my passion
was never heard
It was drowned in a sea
of prudence
and
false compliments
from the ones
who should
Noone
could compute
that what
I played
was me
Me
I let it all down
I opened a window
and not a soul
looked in
So
I found other means
and my words
are now my
statements
and
my thoughts
are now
here…
I realized that
I put myself down
to make me
think
It’s ok
to be this
way
No
it’s not
It’s not ok
Be upset J
do something about
dont chuckle
and shrug
There was a point
that
if a girl just
acted nice to me
I would suddenly like her
I can’t stand to think back
to when I was like that…
Perhaps I still am
It’s hard to admit
to being in denial
when you’re in denial…
There are so many things I want to do
places I want to go
But
I need companions
Unfortunetly
I have none…
So

nothing

Close my eyes
I can see you now
The memories we had
the love
that I thought we shared
I can feel your touch
on my lips
Your breathe in my ear
I can hear
myself
saying 
I love you
and I can hear
your perfect little giggle
and
saying 
I love you too
I was always here
Why didnt you talk to me
Why did you just let it slide
I had a right know
If I had known
you were leaving
I would have changed
I would have done more
I would have loved you more
Your hair
Your eyes
God
I miss you so much
The way your body moved
they way you made me smile
Im crying now
Why didnt you let me know
Why did you leave me like this
Was the love you spelled
true
or were you 
just
meeting my
childish desires
I could have been a man for you
I could have brought the world to you
But you didnt give me the chance
You left without goodbye
Open my eyes
I can see myself in your 
monument
I can picture your face
deep
inside
cold
still
.dead.
I miss you
and I will love you
always
forever

The stars
are back tonight
I havent seen them
in a few days
And
Ive missed them terribly
When i was in
high school
about
once or twice
a summer
My sister and I
would have
a lil get to gether
thing
at our house
It was usaully after a big party
my parents would have
And
we would invite our fellow band geeks over
to clean up the left overs
It was great
we would spend hours
just talking
…
I miss that
I hate being alone here
Not alone in the relationship sense
Just
alone
noone
but my parents…
I hate myself
for getting in this situation
But
looking back
I think Im a hell
of a lot better
off
then if
I hadnt made
those mistakes…
I escaped
Of course
it’s going to be hard
But
I need to remind myself
To suck it up
Stop moping around in your bedroom
on the computer
Do something…
I rely to much on things online
Thinking that all I need is time
and
this computer will make it better
It wont
I know that
Only I can fix things
make it better
God
I love the stars
I think Im going to go stare at them
until
sleep comes….

The Only Living Boy in Tennessee
It was about two A.M. Sunday when I realized I had a problem.  Ever since Thursday, I had been wracking my brain, trying desperately to formulate a unique idea for my essay. And early that Sunday morning, I still had nothing.
I sat at my computer, staring blankly at the equally blank screen, surrounded by my usual instigators of creative writing: the haunting sounds of Tool and the wispy entrails of smoke and sweet smells from my incense, all lighted by the rich, red light from my candle.  Despite all that, I still lacked even a glimmer of an idea of what to write.  Dejected and forlorn, I went to bed in hope that the peace that sleep brings might also provide a spark of ingenuity.
Four hours later, I awoke to find that not only did I still lack a subject, I had left my CD Walkman playing all night, and now had Simon and Garfunkels Only Living Boy in New York in my head.  
Sullenly, I crawled out of bed and prepared myself for work.  I stared at myself, as I brushed my teeth, in hopes that perhaps my eyes contained a key to inspiration that otherwise would not be seen.  Alas, my eyes, reflected, were as clueless as they are from my vantage point. Paul Simons words, Tom, get your plane on timeI know your partll go finefly down to Mexico…da-n-da-da-n-da-n-da-da and here I am, the only living boy echoed in my head, forcing me to glare at myself for fogging my mind with such silly and playful lyrics.  
Once I was satisfied with my appearance, I exited the house and boarded my car.  Still plagued by Art Garfunkels discanting voice, I drove off towards work.  The lonely stretch of road between work and my bed seemed excessively so that morning.  As I zoomed by, my eyes scanned the scenery, searching for some stimuli to aid my lethargic writ, but the beautiful and exotic Tennessee did not accommodate.   And to make matters worse, whatever CD I played, I get the news I need from the weather report, I can gather all the news I need on the weather reportHey, Ive got nothing to do today but smile, da-n-da-da-n-da-da-n-da-da here I amthe only living boy, stayed in my head.
I arrived at K-mart about fifteen minutes late.  I suppose my dilemma affected my usually haste-filled driving.  K-mart, be it a wonderful place to work, demands way too much of my time sometimes.  It has been my Achilles Heel lately for any sort of creative writing, but is something I must cope with.
Since it was Sunday morning, no one really noticed me arriving late.  But I still felt bad and hurried to the break room so that I wouldnt be noticed.  Once I got myself settled in, I began anew trying to find some inspiration for my essay.  Every customers face told a story of great interest. Unfortunately, I lacked insight and talent to understand these unwritten tales, so they fell to the wayside of afterthought.  And all I could think was Half of the time were gone but we dont know where, and we dont know here.
After a day work and no progress on my paper, I left K-mart thoroughly upset.  For one final attempt to spur some sort of reaction from my numbed mind, I drove to one of my favorite places to write.  It is just a parking lot that shoots out into a lake.  I like to pull up and face the water, allowing whatever thoughts in my head to organize themselves into something resembling written words.  But Tom, get your plane right on timeI know youve been eager to fly nowHey, let your honesty shine, shine, shine seemed to be the only thing I could write down.  Drained of all resources, I gave up and turned myself home.
Once home, I retreated to my bed and stared at the ceiling.  I watched as the words that I had been searching for all day flashed in front of my lucid eyes.  And I was surprised to find that the words I wanted were the very same ones I had tried desperately to rid myself.  Da-n-da-da-n-da-da-n-da-daLike it shines on methe only living boy in New Yorkthe only living boy in New York.   Sleep overcame me before I could write them down; I just prayed that the words would be there when I awoke.

Perhaps the most watched movie of all time, The Wizard of Oz has entertained generation upon generation for over sixty years  (Johnson 5).  The joyful images of skipping down a yellow-paved road can excite even the most belligerent of old men.  And there is not a soul alive who doesnt yearn to sing aloud, Somewhere Over the Rainbow, while in the shower.  But does this cinematic classic hold a dark secret?  What horrors happen right before our very eyes when we watch this golden gem of cinematography?  
The Wizard of Oz was released in the late thirties.  For several years, it entertained us with its drug influenced music and underlying tones of a young woman coming to terms with her sexuality.  Despite all these wonderful family values, a legend arose.  An urban legend, if you will.  This tale told of a Munchkin, who took his own life on the set of the film, during filming  (Warinner).  It is said you can see him hanging himself while the main cast skips away down the yellow-bricked road.
In order to dissect this story, we must first understand what is a munchkin?   The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language defines munchkin as a very small person  (Munchkin, Dictionary.com).  But the Fanciers Breeder Referral List defines it as a cat with short legs, a result of a natural mutation  (Munchkin, FBRL).  Since the latter has a shorter name than the former, we will use the latters definition.
So a depressed short-legged cat hanged itself on the set of The Wizard of Oz.  But what was it doing there?  Apparently, It was hired to be in the movie.  In fact, the producers hired one hundred and twenty-four munchkins  (Warinner).  The producers were able to do this because  animal rights were only applied to exotic animals at the time.  Otherwise, they would have had actual Flying Monkeys.  The actual salary of the vertically challenged felines was not disclosed.  In order to escape embarrassment of using cats, the producers used the surname of The Singer Midgets for the cats in the credits  (Johnson 2).
But what would drive a cat to take its own life?  According to the warning signs of suicide, depression may be hidden by hyperactivity or acting out behavior  (Information: Warnings).  Could the influent joy a cat experiences when it plays with a ball of yarn really be a foreshadowing cry for help?  How many other cats have taken their lives when their cries of help were ignored? And what cat hasnt pretended to be a lion or some enlarged predatory feline of some sort?  How many cat have taken their ninth life because of our ignorance?
Today, only thirteen of the original munchkins are still alive.  Surprisingly fluent in people-speak, these vocalizing felines claim that they never heard about one of their fellow cats committing suicide. Although, one did threaten his wife with a firearm and was subsequently fired  (Warinner).  But no cat had allowed their curiosity to get the best of them while filming the movie.
Upon watching the scene in question, it is quite obvious that there is no cat hanging itself in the background.  Although, at one point, it does look like a very small person hanging, but that is absurd.  So what is it that everyone is seeing?
Some say what is being seen is actually a bird.  A bird is defined as any of the class of Aves or warm-blooded, egg-laying, feathered vertebrates with forelimbs modified to form wings  (Bird).  So what is this winged egg-layer doing on the set of a movie?  They were hired to legitimize the background of the mythical land of Oz.
So how is a bird the cause of all this misconception?  Apparently, one of these birds flapped its wings during the filming the scene.  And this, oddly enough, strongly resembles a Munchkin hanging. 
But that is not the only shady occurrence within this theatric classic.  The actor originally cast to play the Tin Man suffered an allergic reaction to the metallic paint required for the costume.  And at the Academy Awards that year, Judy Garland was presented with a small award, jokingly referred to as The Munchkin Award  (Johnson 5-6).
So what does this all mean?  To quote Glinda the Good Witch, WellI am a little muddled.  What we have here is a bird being mistaken for a short-legged cat committing suicide.  All with lethal paint and an Academy Award with a politically incorrect name.  This all points to one person: Judy Garland.
It makes perfect sense.  At the time, Judy Garland was living in Shirley Temples shadow.  Judy Garland needed The Wizard of Oz to be a hit so she can be propelled into stardom.  Intimidated by the actor originally cast for the Tin Man, Judy poisoned his paint to get rid of him.  She then created the rumor of the Munchkin Suicide to make sure the movie will last forever in our hearts and minds, insuring that she too, would be there.
With Judy Garlands treachery, The Wizard of Oz has made an impact on our lives.  And now several generations of Munchkins are too ashamed to speak.  The Munchkins are said to have been responsible for Judy Garlands overdose.  But that is another story for another time.

As a result of growing up in the lithic and confounding jungle of suburban Chicago, I feel that when it comes to what I expect from a major city, I am spoiled.  In my childhood, I basically allowed the wonders of Chicago to set the standard of what other cities have to offer.  So, when I moved to Tennessee, I was quickly heartbroken when I discovered that there was no Field Museum, where I can become absorbed into an ancient Egyptian Tomb, only to emerge face to open maw with the largest predator ever to walk the face of the earth. Nor was there a Museum of Science and Industry, where I can explore the human heart and tunnel into a coalmine, deep beneath Lake Michigan.  And then, there was the zoo.
Of all the things that Chicago has to offer, I frequented no place as much as I did the zoo.  There two zoos in Chicago. First, there is the Lincoln Park Zoo, nestled in the unnatural valley that is downtown Chicago.  And then, there is the Brookfield Zoo, located far away from the bustle of city life, hidden in the vastness of Suburbia.
Some of my fondest memories are of Brookfield Zoo.  There are many days when my parents would gather my sisters and I up and have a picnic in the middle of its cultivated center.  Not many places are held dearer in my heart than Brookfield Zoo.  I was very upset when I realized that one of my favorite haunts was now eight hours away.
I was delighted to learn that Knoxville had a zoo.  Literally minutes after learning this, I grabbed my mother and drove on down to the zoo.
When we arrived at the entrance, I felt a twinge of nostalgia; the gates resembled the entrance to the Childrens Zoo at Brookfield.  After paying the all too familiar fee, we entered the gift store.  Very much like Brookfields, the gift store was almost enchantingly expensive.  But this store was even larger and contained a great deal more items that almost beg to be bought.
When we exited the store, we headed over to the Black Bear exhibit.  This was new for me. Despite my familiarity with black bears from my familys cabin in Wisconsin, I had never seen a Black Bear up close.  Brookfield is too filled with Polar, Kodiak, and Sloth Bears to bother with something as common as a Black Bear.
Next, we headed over to the Red Panda Exhibit.  Now, at Brookfield, the Red Pandas are in a huge indoor environmental enclosure with several other species of animals indigenous to that particular part of Asia.  It may be hard to get a good look at the Pandas, but they are ultimately more at ease and happier in this faux habitat.
The Red Panda exhibit at the Knoxville resembles more of a Hamster cage than a Zoo exhibit.  There are several pandas in two cages, both very small and artificial.  Since I was close enough to see them, I imagined that they looked rather unhappy.  But Im not an expert on Red Pandas.
After leaving the overgrown Hamster exhibit, we meandered towards the older section of the zoo.  I found myself lost in a beautifully blended Tennessee woods merged with some sort of Asian geome.  We then came to the tiger exhibit, where the large cats fluent and concise movements hypnotized me.  I felt like I was inside with the tiger.   
Brookfield, despite its size and variety, has nothing like this.  The path that leads to the tigers is large and unsightly.  And the exhibit itself is elaborately artificial.  There are no personal moments with the largest of all cats.  They are just eye candy to an eager, naïve soul.
As my mother and I journeyed further into the Zoo, I noticed more and more things in it that reminded me of Brookfield.  There were manicured lawns, back dropped by a row of trees.   And there were birds flying freely throughout the exhibits.  It all resembled a Brookfield Zoo before all the additions, before all the indoor attractions.  It was the Zoo I grew up too.
I have yet to go back to the Knoxville Zoo.  I still miss Brookfield Zoo, and always hold that place in my heart.  But, maybe, there is room for one more.

isnt as it was
this morning
My mind is full
of play
and delight

this
mental high
lasts

I used to write alot more
So much has changed
so much has stayed the same
Funny
how I seem to use
the same words though
the same thoughts
the same feelings
just different
somehow…

how
a small joke
made me so
sentimental
I dont miss it

Fly away
away
up
down
Anywhere but here
Live
a life
live a life
within
the boundaries
of your
limits
Be redundant
just be
caught between
absoloute
and
interpetation
Perception
will
always be
divine
But divinity
is
corruption
and
indifference
In
the long run
nothing is absoloute
Just
percieved to be
enternal
Points
of reference
shadow
the places
of
truth
Dancing
along that edge
of past misfortunes
and
present’s fear
the Future
is a wide
and vast
unknown
Ever reflecting back
on each
individual
moments
that are never notice
never
cared
Stop to smell the 
flowers on the road
Look at the clouds
Pretend
to be
what you always wanted to be
A change is needed
society
dictates
and conformity
that
is superflous
and
unwanted
Or is it
Confusion
lurks
within the
routine
Lost in words
Lost in time
lost in it all
So gone
Im found
Look at me now
I am totally
clueless
totally ignorant
and totally enjoying it
It’s my path
it’s my life
I will dictate
I will choose
where I go
what I do
what I write
This is
about me
And
I am going
to take this
and
fly
off
to that place
where dreams come true
and
everything is not what it seems
The page isnt turning
It’s just a new paragraph
A new line
a new thought
a new perception
I can clearly see
that all is muddled
and
backed up
with 
complexity
and
deepness
that It is simple
and shallow
A self-diminishing
existance
I dreamt that I died today
But
today is tomorrow
and the day after is
beyond
care
I am
the space between breathes
I am eternal
When my light
fades away
I will have made
the effect
that I so
desperately
desire
And
so painfully
dont know yet
I will matter
I will be significant
I will
I shall
Look at me now
I’ve got a smile
on my face
a glimmer
of light in my eyes
and
my hands
are clenched
in a fiery
rage
of passion.
My heart
is to the earth
My mind is to the stars
And everything else
is to the written
ideals
of
a delusional existance
I’ve fallen off
my wagon
And
I can’t fly away
but
maybe
I can always pretend

strange
Calm before the storm?
So many
problems
unvisted

thought

Gone

always there

go
Somethings stay

Triumph
over
ignorance

short

A sabbatical

closest thing

I just
cant bear to now
Its weird
and hard

Haze
all around
I add to it
hoping
that the smell
of jasmine
will guide me home..
I have a necklace
that I have worn ever since october…
It was my grandmothers…
she bought it at Hati…
Im not sure what kind of wood it is..
It’s light..and…
it’s a string of flat beads…then it becomes several
oddly shaped pieces of wood
I like to pretend it means something
I know
it’s just some
cheap thing
that some tourist trapping native made
to get some money…
to feed their kids…
Maybe it does mean something
It has become
a part of me
I wear it everywhere
It’s my
mojo
I suppose
I have turned it into
everything that is me
It stands out
It looks quite odd
but
I think of it
as my
physical
determination
Not to care
about what people think anymore
I feel naked
here 
looking at it…
Im always
here
naked
My feelings
are free to view
and
my opinion
is always there
Just
abstracted
I need this too much
I need
to flash

skin

There are things
sometimes
I dont get
I can understand
But
No
I don’t get
I understand
why certain
people
had an issue with her
Yes she lied
Yes
she “backstabbed”
But
to people she hasnt backstabbed
why the animosity
why the
almost
legendary
stature…
Like I said
there are people
who have a right
to feel this way
be it…lied to and cheated on
or
doing something to 
sabatogae
a budding
relationship
But
It seems
It became popular to hate her…
and
thats my problem
I understand
why she acted
as she did
As all of us do
who come here….
to find support
friendship
love
Self esteem
So she lied
about how she looked…
So she had every single male in the sight
around her finger
so what?
I mean….looking back at it
People hated her before
she was found out…
I remember joking with her about it
She knew what has happening
be it on purpose or not
She played her games
or
just
did what she felt she needed to
and
for the most part
noone got hurt…
Then her secret got out…
I knew long before anyone else…but
I kept it…
I knew how important it was for her
She needed that facade..
the power
the feeling
of being wanted
desired
popular
Oh god…I know her how she felt
deep down inside….Thats what I wanted for me
to belong
…
So
I understand
why some people hate
her
and why she did what she did
But
I dont get everything else..
It seems like some silly little game
Politics
who’s in..who’s out
It’s played all the time
I hate that Im a part of that
And
to tell the truth
I miss her
I miss talking to her
I miss her friendship
Yes..she lied to me too
But..I can forgive…
because
I know
everyone lies here…
Most can’t help it

and festers

dying in bed

This is your husband

I remember my husband
I remember his love
I call him Pa
and he calls me Ma
He kinda looks
like
Col. Sanders
This man
is very sick
Why dont you help him
He’s not my husband though
Alice
doesnt he look like your husband
Yes
how odd
But no
he’s not my husband
Where is my husband?

gasping for air
tears in his eyes
Alice
scared now
Don’t touch me!
Where is my husband
Where is Steve!
Alice
he croaks
You Are not
my husband
You are not my husband!
I don’t know you
Where is my husband
The man begins to cough
up his life
This is man is dying
She cries
Doesnt he have anyone to 
be here for him
He does 
Alice
His wife
She should hurry
I think he’s going soon
Alice
are you sure you dont
know this man
No
I know my own husband
Have you seen him?
Alice is escorted away…
leaving the man
to drown in his own blood and tears
forsaken at the most painful time
He passes away
A lingering fantasy
of love and rememberance
Two years later
As Alice 
lies
dying in bed
Unknown of her condition
She cries for her husband
I used to have a picture of him
Oh
I miss him so
hundreds of miles away
his picture
rests on his headstone
To Steve with Love
Alice…
it says
She passes alone
and forgotten
How terribly tragic
how terribly sad

I will
actually
become
a toddling
man
on the verge
of realizing
that
I am past my prime
..
Its deppressing
I cant relate
I hold my tongue
I love my parents
and all
but
I
cant
do
this
This is all my fault
that it goes on though
I dont socialize
I dont go out
I guess…
I dont know what to do
Go out and hang..
at…?
work?
…
I suppose 
i am holding out
for school
Where
Im forced to be
with my peers
and maybe
bye some
faint miracle…
I will share some
common bond…
But again
the only one
holding me back
is me…

A few years
before my grandfather 
died
I avoided him
I couldnt stand
to
see
how he looked
How far he has
fallen
It hurt me
to see
the man I
loved
Dying…
I guess
I have a problem with weakness
maybe it reminds me
of my own demise…
Vain..
I despise myself for that

My Grandma 
came to visit…
I am starting to feel
awkward around her…
I dont know
how
to shake this feeling…
I dont wanna be

I am standing
still
I see people
suceeding
I am jealous
I am damned jealous…
Im sure
this all
leads
back

or
something
along those lines
I need
to sit
down
and
decide a course
It does me no good
to sit and talk about it
Suck it up…

Take a little walk to the edge of town, go across the tracks
Where the viaduct looms like a bird of doom, as it shifts and cracks
Where secrets lie in the border fires, in the humming wires,
Hey man, you know you’re never coming back
Past the square, past the bridge, past the mills, past the stacks
On a gathering storm comes a tall handsome man
In a dusty black coat with a red right hand
He’ll wrap you in his arms, tell you that you’ve been a good boy
He’ll rekindle all the dreams it took you a lifetime to destroy
He’ll reach deep into the hole, heal your shrinking soul,
But there won’t be a single thing that you can do
He’s a ghost, he’s a god, he’s a man, he’s a guru
They’re whispering his name through this disappearing land
But hidden in his coat is a red right hand
You don’t own no money? He’ll get you some
You don’t have no car? He’ll get you one
You don’t have no self respect, you feel like an insect,
Well don’t you worry buddy cause here he comes
Through the ghetto and the barrio and the bowery and the slum
A shadow is cast wherever he stands
Stacks of green paper in his red right hand
You’ll see him in your nightmares, you’ll see him in your dreams
He’ll appear out of nowhere but he ain’t what he seems
You’ll see him in your head, on the TV screen
And hey buddy, I’m warning you to turn it off
He’s a ghost, he’s a god, he’s a man, he’s a guru
You’re one microscopic cog in his catastrophic plan
Designed and directed by his Red Right Hand

Scenes are changing and you collect the sand on our souls. You can make it okay if you pave your own way. Bear down and reach the higher ground. Your momentum has swayed from all the shit in the world today. Lose track fight to get it back. Climb aboard, strap yourself in, and wait for the ride of life to begin even though you were the first to go you’re the last to stay. Long roads lead the shortest ways. The people the same the trip is what you’re waiting for. Scenes change and they’ll grow more…

Put down the book put up the walls I’m never givin’ up at all what’s yours is yours, what’s Mine is yours and I’ll mature. Endure. Not even with ten men holding Me back not even with a devious planned attack contemplating every move that I play willing the bad things all away keeping the worry-free happiness philosophy that’s what I let them see when they try to look at Me. Don’t want out. These issues arise everyday, though you try to turn your head and walk away, though it leaves you feeling insecure you’re gonna feel your life mature. Endure

I see a red door
And I want it painted black
No colors anymore
I want them to turn black
I see the girls walk by
Dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head
Until my darkness goes
I see a line of cars
And they’re all painted black
With flowers and my love
Both never to come back
I see them turn their heads
Quickly look away
Like a newborn baby
It just happens every day
I look inside my self
See my heart is back
I see my red door
And I want it painted black
Maybe then I’ll fade away
And not have to face the facts
It’s not easy facing up
When your whole world is black
No more will my green sea
Go turn a deeper blue
I could not foresee
This thing happening to you.
If I look hard enough
Into the setting sun,
My love will laugh with me
Before the morning comes
Wanna see it painted
Painted it black
Love is gone

In a soft spoken existence
The dove flutters
into
silence
It’s
ever
so
differnt
babble
of
deepening
sounds
A loss
to us now
The morning
breaks
without
the call
Of
love
and desire
The sun shines
no less
despite
the lack
of sexual fire
The echoes
of
rage
dillusional
in
exception
Faith
and honesty
fade away
Within
the preconception
that
this is right
and this is good
Pain is only
eternal
Life
and precognition
are
temporary
and better off
for it
The morning
Dances unto
The humdrum
Of mundane
Places and
Faces
Mold into
Melodramatic
Facades
Of
Intrigue
Skies turn grey
Within
The ever-blue
Dainty girls
And
Robust
Boys
Chance
The fear
And taunt
The eventual
Love
And desire
Return
In angst
Sappy feelings
And sexual tension
Drive the direction
Of chaos
Under control
Of course..
Soon
Absoloution
Arrives
Those who
Enjoy the flesh
Soon are owned by it
The rage that subsides
In complacent
Minds
Indentured servitude
Isnt bad
The fires burn within
Tendering
It out
Like
Siphons
Of blood
Laden ale
The dimly glow
Of a thousand
Broken hearts
Fused
Into
A massive
Geome
Of disenchanted dreams
That prey
On the minds
Of the innocent
The youth
Of tomorrow
The elders of today
The sun shines upon them
For their time has come
No longer
Their own persons
Rather
Cogs
On the wheel
Of the man made monster
Whos intentions
Are
Self-diminishing
And
Self-inflicting
Destroy it all
But have fun doing it
The day shifts
To the underrated
Black
Never so
Always
Mottled
Infected with light
Not as it should
But fear rules supreme
And reason
Has no authority
In the recess
Of the mind
The demons that lurk
In the darkness
Of ignorance
Resemble
The ones
Who chastise
And fear
Irony works
Like
There
The only thing to fear
Is yourself
Pain still exist
In some way or the other
Perhaps not physical
Perhaps not mental
Or spiritual
But it is there
That thing you feel
When you hold
The gun
To your head
That
Uncomfortable sensation
Within
Your loins
I know you know
What it is
That
Pain of existing
The sinfully sweet
Experience
That is undeserved
Among us
We destroy
What is near
What is dear
We endure the minors
Ignoring the
Ifinitely larger view
To absorbed within ourselves
Too attracted to power
To much
We cannot proceed
As planned
Change of ideas
Priorities
Consideration
Of
Other
Things
Beside
Our
Investments
Money
Is that
Silly little game
That we use to convince ourselves
That we matter
To
If anything
Ourselves
Delusional
And destructive
We march like
Lemmings
The chasm
To fall unto
Our piles
Of our formers
A lewd skyscraper of flesh
Reaching out
Towards the heavens 
We strive for
The pungent odor
Of ourselves
Precedes us
So
Let the blood flow
Let the tears drown out the cries
Of fear
And the eventual
Let the pain be temporary
And existence eternal
Let ourselves know
What we are
What we do
And who we do it too
Look in the mirror
Scry
Inside
You will see the blackened
Face
Of evil
In our very
Limited sense
Of it
Rage
All you want
The only one who can help you

Being considerate

Help you
Help me
I am as dynamic
As anything
I can see things
You will never dream off
I am the farthest away
I am God
In the purest sense
I have faith in my faith
That I have none
I believe that afterlife
Is awfully unexistual
I make up words
Because language
Is dull
I will make my mark upon you
As everyone else
I will matter
I do matter
So
Who the hell are you
Little bird
Fly away
To your pond
To your boullinbase-esque nest
Dance for me
Show me why
I should impress you
I dont impress myself
Why should I you?
Audition for me
I know your pain
I dont care
In my ever caring
My indifference is my caring
I bring only
Pain
And confusion
I separate myself
Not because you arent worthy of me
Because im not worthy of you
I am the worm
Ever important
Ever stepped on
You walk upon
And treasure my shit
As you drown me
Impaled upon your rusty hook
Do I swim away
When the pain is too great?
No I stay
And wait for it again
The pain is me
I am the pain
You can try
To look away
I wont mind
Im not here anyways
I am a million instances away
Dreaming
Of the day
You will care for me
Like
I have for you
This is not what it seems
This is not what it seems
This is not what it seems
It is simply more complex
I am not an entertainer
Rather
I am a simplifier
I am the one
Who looks around
And sees what it is
Not what it could be
I am a dreamer
I imagine
What it could be
And see it so
I am a hypocrite
I contradict
For the sake of it
Beauty
In perversion
In dissonance
That fact that it doesnt go
Makes it perfect
Perfection lies
In ambiance
And denial
It doesnt exist
For we are uncapable of it
Do make perfect
Is to undo ourselves

I dedicate this to thee
k-mart…
Cold and silent, soiled face I will wash it all away,
With my love,
That’s all she’s ever needed, from me
It’s my time, to mother,
One of my own in my life,
I am so alone, left with no one
In my life, I’m so alone 
Life submissiveness,
Hypnotizing the ignorant a little boy’s best friend’s always his mother,
At least that’s what she said,
Life of a simple man,
Taught that everyone else is dirty,
And their love is meaningless,
I’m just a soiled dirty boy,
I’m just a soiled dirty boy,
Sheltered life innocence,
Insulated memories, spark reflections of my head,
Duality in my consciousness,
Caught in the war of hemispheres,
Between the love lost in my head,
Mommy do you still live inside of me,
I’m so lost in my life without any guiding,
Protected me my whole life from everything,
Nailed shut the doors to the shrine,
To screen your dead eyes from me and my sickness,
Mutilate and sew my new clothes for masquerading,
Aprons of flesh corpse scalped hair with skin upon my face,
Deliver the remains from her womb of earth,
Prep the rack and tie up for new love’s rebirth,
Covert understanding of novice surgery,
I’ll focus concentration and only take just what I need 
For sickness I’m masticating,
Dancing and masturbating,
Celebrate in fields of night with skin upon my face
If I soak my hands in others blood am I sick,
If I wash my hands in others blood am I sick,
If I drench myself in others blood am I sick,
If I bathe myself in others blood 
Blame mother for the sickness,
Mutilate and sew my new clothes for masquerading,
Aprons of flesh corpse scalped hair with skin upon my face,
Dance and masturbate in night light by myself..
Nothing is left for me to gain they’re coming to take me far away,
Chorus
Life of a simple man taught that everyone else is dirty and love is meaningless
I’m so soiled
Soiled

~We gaze up at the same stars, the sky covers us all, the same universe encompasses us.  What does it matter what practical system we adapt in our search for the truth?  Not by one avenue only can we arrive at so tremendous a secret.~  Symmachus, 384 C.E.
~If I behled the sun when it shined, or the moon walking in the brightness; and my heart hath been secretly enticed, or my mouth hath kissed my hand:this also were an iniquity to be punished by the judgeL for I should have denied the God that is above.~ Job, XXXIII, 27-8
~The world is holy. Nature is holy. The body is holy. Sexuality is holy. The mind is holy. The imagination is holy. You are holy. A spirtual path that is not stagnant ultimely leads to the understanding of one’s own divine nature. Thou are Goddess. Thou art God. Divinty is the immient in all Nature. It is as much within you as without.
In our culture which has for so long denied and denigrated the feminine as negative, eveil or, at best, smeall and unimportant, women (and men too) will never understand their own creative strength and divine nature until they embrace the creative feminine, the sourve of inspiration, the Goddess within.
While one can at times be cut off from experiencing the deep and everpresent connection between oneself and the universe, there is no such thing as sin(unless it is simply defined as that estrangement) and guilt is never very useful.
The energy you put into the world comes back.~

I was once betrothed to the bonds of friends
But life too short to hold
Help me, to go…Away
Woo-wee, wander for warmth
Cold spreads throught out my body like cancer
Consumed by a quiestion, innately question the answer
An entrancer, traveling for truth portal to portal
To quell the parallel, heaven and hell, are we immortal?
A stepping stone of flesh and bone
A body loaned to serve our own
Time is running out, cant postpone
Cause death keeps ringing like the telephone
See, I dont know what direction I am heading
I dont know if theres something im forgeting
We are forlon hope
She doesnt stop, the torment hands me ways to make peace
with myself
You remembered me
Our memories play like motion pictures
Love was limited, pain and struggle were fixtures
I view you as I knew you, reflecting like a mirror
My eyes are the windows to your soul, becoming clearer
Without a trace of time and space
I see your face, an angels face
You and I just can’t erase
The meeting at your resting place
And now I know what direction I am heading
Now I know you’re the skin that ive been shedding
The moment I saw you I opened my etes and suddenly realized that I was to
Be engrossed in the fact that I am already dead. Your …Wrong!
Is this the end or only the beginning?
Is this the end or only the beginning?

in the heavens

within ourselves

As im sure
anyone
can tell
Im having a breakdown….
Im sure
it will be alright in the morning…
this is just a consequence

It didnt used to be that bad..

some deppressing

I have changed..and
recorded it..

where people
are ending one
and starting a new one..
a new chapter…a
new
direction…
I always wonder
to myself
When will
this
page
end?
I strive
and think
At
what number
would I end it
At what momement
would it end
What would I do after?
I think
Im in this for the long haul..
I am fused
to SadMeatCart now..
Maybe..this is all
one journey
in which
the destination
is
just
a definition
of Who I am
and
what SadMeatCart
is…
a page in the book of eternity
is
an impossibly
huge thing
and
I am not resolved to be just a character…
this may never end

me to flaunt

to the nature

It’s hard for me
not to be cynical

what you destroy
wont be there
the next time around
a species
that
despite
it’s ignorance
has mananged
to outsmart
nature
and
manipulate the way things
have gone
We are lost now
Lost to ourselves
and the path
we strived
to find
The closer
to climb to
perfection
the further
from it
you become
but
perfection
doesnt exist
That is a human concept
if it did
we ruined it
a
long time ago
I cant find the good
in a heart
that
beats the blood

We replace
the blood
with blood
and
we live
by
foolish codes

out of
fear
of the nothing
Well
WE
are nothing
Pardon
myself…
I am torn
between my sins
and the sins
I choose to burden
Too bad
Sins
are a human device as well…

Prepare for battle

From children dying at recess
Change a little late now

Hate, enslaved to live down
Chamber’s loaded I am ready

It’s apparent, you’re so transparent, you dont care
it’s just like you’re not even there
Taking steps in reverse but it’s too late to rescind
I shall finish the game and reap the whirlwind
As a parent, you’re so transparent

Taking steps in reverse but it’s too late to rescind

Firearms growing faster than the population
Armed like Octupi, preoccupied with bereavement
Growing old’s become a new benchmark or our achievment

inside
A temperment
of high expectations
Lowered
into
a subterreanian
toll
A rage
subsiding
within
Watering
down the fire
killing
the air
Killing ..
A taunt
of religious
origin
spacing
out
the anger
with
complacity
Load the pain
ship it out
Absoloution
awaits
Ever constant
Ever distant
Im walking
onwards
and
away
Never closer
never farther
Almost there
Almost

The destination

The journey

Just
a simple
idea
What
if we do nothing
Let
the blood
lie
and not add to it
What
if we become stronger
by
our resolve
and not
our
might
Would
imposing
ourselves
Stop
the terror
would
it end it all
No
it fuels
Hatred
breeds
more of the same
Why let
the rage
control
Why enleash
it
upon
something
we dont understand
The question
of wrong
is
superflous
Let our
strength
be
our Composure
not
our bombs
I just
can’t seem
to justify
killing
people
who
never
had anything
to do with anything
I cant seem
to justify
playing
into
one 
man’s plan
We are
the wicked
and
the evil
of his
perception
Why proove him right?
Let his
cause
become faulty…

I suppose
I have
viewed
all this
from
the comfort
of my
fleshy shell
I have never felt like an American
honestly
because
I don’t respect
what
the US has
become
A pc bloodbath
hiding
the the
contemptable
But
from
the
ashes
of
a broken
dream
There
is a shining
beacon
of wonder
and joy
that
one must endure
the shame
to view
I don’t
feel
this is
right…
And
I will not support it
~
I give
into
my rage
sometimes
I desire
to freak
out
and
break
something
beautiful…
I repress
I always do
I have very
few
standards
that I require
most importantly
Remembering
to take perspective
A wonderfully
wicked
blessing
I understand
everything
thus
erasing
my true felt feelings
of
hatred….
Remember
that there
are infinte

of views

Everything
is multi-faceted

that
this is for me

day
knowing
that if for

a moment
I reached someone
and someone..
understands me
Deep down inside
I have secret desires
that
someday
after Im gone
someone will look at this
And
be better for it.
I fear 
that this
is looked at some
teenaged
angst filled
poetry
that is more driven
by
age
and hormones
rather then desire
I desire this
Im not a poet
Poetry has intent
I am random 
in my goals

this

this is..

After you have finished your true stories sometime, why don’t you make up a story and the people to go with it?
Only then will you understand what happened and why.
It is those we live with and love and should know who elude us.
Now nearly all those I loved and did not understand when I was young are dead, but I still reach out to them.
Of course, now I am too old to be much of a fisherman, and now of course i usually fish the big waters alone, althought some friend think I shouldnt.  Like many fly fishermen in western montana where the summer days are almost arctic in length, I often do not start fishing until the cool of the evening.  Then in the Arctic half-light of the canyon, all existence fades to a being with my soul and memories and the sounds of the Big Blackfoot River and a four-cout rhythm and the hope that a fish will rise.
Eventually, all things merge into one, and a river runs through it.  The river was cut b the world’s great flood and runs over rocks from the basement of time. On some of the rocks are timeless raindrops. Under the rocks are the workds, and some of the words are theirs.
I am haunted by waters.
~A River Runs Through It, Norman Maclean~
I am touched by this
in a way
I may never know
Eluding my understanding
by
coming to me
on a level that
is of my own
and my certain trained thought
I too
am haunted by the memories
of things past
and lost
Despite
them still
found
There are some things
that
cannot be understood
if desired
No matter
what
mode
is used..
Somethings
make sense in time
Rushing only
increases the urge
the pain
Norman
was 70 when
he decided
that
he needed to reflect
and
understand..
A river runs through
it
Inside the waters
runs life
and the memory
In the waters
we are shaped and
formed
by
the people we knew
and the things
we experienced
You can only
know who you are
when
you have lived long enough
to
reflect
yourself
unto the surface
And understand
the
confusion
in the innocent
eyes
On your
youthful face.
I should
try to be
more patient

Life is a waterfall,
We’re one in the river,
And one again after the fall.
Swimming through the void
We hear the word,
We lost ourselves,
But we find it all?
Cause we are the ones that want to play,
Always want to go,
But you never want to stay,
And we are the ones that want to chose,
Always want to play,
But you never want to lose.
Aerials, in the sky,
When you lose small mind,
You free your life.

cool breathe

borrowed light

in with my left
and
expelling via right

passing

becomes laboured
and my heart erratic
I find myself
drawn
to a single
beacon
of cyan light.
I wander closer
to this
misplaced corona in
a dark scene
And shine my light
of curiousity
to gain
more insight
I find
a dying lightining bug
too cold to fly
cold enough to die
Yet
a light shines on
within
Perhaps
not warming thy self

most certainly
warming me
I trek on
smiling at the hope
filled
points of life
Until
I reach the top
and all is still.

I sit/stand
Inspired to
inspire
absorbing it all
with every pore on
my body
straining
for that
one
extra morsel
of magical delight
I then cover
my
seal
of life
and
stretch outwards and
upwards
and
downwards
every which way
Letting it all out
letting my self go
And
I sound out
soundlessy into the night
The stars
my audience
and the world
my stage.
My trail downwards
is different
than before
what was once ahead is now
behind
the sounds
are more concise
sans myself.
I find myself
looking back/up
as if I forgot
something..
Darker then before
my eyes struggle
with the absence
of something
that just seemed
not
lacking before
I feel the earth’s
love/hate
for me
as she yearns to
pull
my body into her
knee’s first
yet I resist
and
cross
back
into the homley
of lights
but
before
I open the door
I step back out
into the light/night
And stare upwards
remembering what was 
forgotten
Dead and gone
are those
who strived
to be
And shined
their lights
Comforting me
Forever
shall I remember those
harbingers
of hope
The smallest gestures
in the face of the cold
I mourn them now

of them

in

innocence
Dazed

still
an enigmatic
concept
barely awake
hardly alive
a force from below
shoving in
Invading

Grasping

pulling out 
away
from the calm
The Eden..
thrust into the light
and
the
sinful air

Of this life
and this existence

A blow is deliverd
and

intaked
Corrupt now
and never going back..
Forsaken.

still in his black clothes.
Tis a shame they had to
leave so suddenly
But
It’s shame that
they had a funeral
at all…
But she knows
this child
will grow up safe

It’s a shame
he’ll never know his sun

he never should have pushed

is a quirky thing
Passing
from cause to

The day is night

and rage
controls
reason

reigns
supreme
in the castle of the heart
Marriage being handed out
like
an obligation of life
as opposed to
a confident
of the love
I suppose
I am just
torn
in all directions
of
interest
So many
things
spur my mind
and
invoke
my query
and concern
I think
im spread to thin
and
can’t
concentrate on it
all
I need a vacation from
the world
and
nowhere I can
go
will ever
release me
of my mental
burdens…
Trapped within
the bounds
of what I hate
Society eats at me
and threatens
to cogulate
my love
and tolerance
to hate..
Leaving
bitter
and empty
Only my dreams
can save me now

I would most definatley let his wife tickle my abnormally large albino coal sausage.  You know…he must have been packing something along the lines of “Oh My Mother-Fucking God, he has a fucking telephone pole in his pants!”
That remindes me
There were these two pieces of ass that followed my home and begged to let me let them make out with eachother, and I was like “Well, if you must”  
I mean, what’s a love god supposed to do?
WELL. I told them to take their fucking lame ass LESBO show elsewhere and leave me to my fucking self!  I get tired of everyone making out in front of me. You think Tiny Tim had that problem?

Agnes’s eyes explored the horror that was

There were equine
body parts strewn
throught the room
And in the center lay
a Book

A Bloody Sock.
Despite being indifferent
The sock and the book
perked her interest
Being that the sock seemed
to stare at her
and
The book was the Necromonican Ex Mortis…
Which like any self-respecting Horse knew
was the book of the Dead.
“You will be the last, the final piece to my lifetime’s puzzle.  You, my pretty pretty thing…will make my worthless life worthwhile,”

Agnes stood

Farmer John ranted on

~Hey Floyd
does it
hurt?~
Somethings are infinitly
deep
but can be comprehended
Others
can be painfully
simple
And
never understood
The chasm that is
human nature is deep
and treachorous
We each deny
what feels right
or more accurately
We are trained
not to notice it
Despite
our numbers
and despite
our unforgivable
“sins”
Each person
has a right
to exist
Unhampered
Uncontrolled
Our destiny
is a path
determined
by each step we take.
I was asked 
recently
In
My mind
What is
the difference
between
existing
and living?
To simply be
is  existing
To know this
Is living
To know what a wonderful
thing
existence is
That is living
Too many times
We take it 
for granted
Play silly
power
trip games
To ease some
nothingness
We are only as powerful
as what Our
understanding is
Ambition beyond
survival
begets
only
reduction.
All things
connect
Not in a perfect
circle
but
a perfect hole
Whole
A chain
of chains
Cell by Cell
Soul by Soul
What we do
now affects
the future
and also
the past
What was
once there
is
forever
altered
by
how it is
percieved
in the here
and now.
Every instance
in
a million
instances
Surges
forth
Demanding
a memory
a thought
a feeling
Raging in sinde
it breaks
loose
and demands
Existence
And
it does get it
A lifetime
of instances
An
enternity
of lost
An Indefinite Future
and
A Misconceieved past
As in everything
It connects
And a chain
of being
links it all
Decisions
are made
and journeys
are endeavoured
Hearts are broken
and Souls
are saved
And Words
Are written
yet

Location: New York City, New York, North America
History:
The New York Bay area was inhabited for centuries by Native Americans of the Algonquian and Iroquois groups. The first European to visit the area was Giovanni da Verrazzano, an Italian navigator in the service of France, who landed here in 1524. Henry Hudson, whose expedition sailed under the Dutch flag, explored the Hudson River in 1609. In 1613 Adriaen Block, also sailing for the Dutch, was forced to winter on Manhattan Island after his boat caught fire. In 1624 the Dutch West India Company established the colony of New Netherlands (later New York). 
By the late 19th century immigrants from southern and eastern Europe, as well as from China, were flooding into New York City. International terrorism struck the city in February 1993, when a car bomb exploded in an underground garage in the World Trade Center in Manhattan. Six people were killed and more than 1000 injured in the blast, which caused an estimated $600 million worth of damage to the building. Four members of a militant Islamic group were convicted in 1994 on conspiracy and other charges in the bombing. In another case, ten Muslim militants were convicted in October 1995 of conspiring to bomb United Nations headquarters, the two tunnels that link New York and New Jersey, and other city landmarks in 1993. That planned terror campaign, which was not carried out, was intended to punish the United States for supporting Israel and the secular government of Egypt. Prosecutors alleged that the plot was connected to the World Trade Center attack. Just recently this past September, another teorrist attack was launched at the World Trade Center. This attack caused the fall and destruction on the world’s most popular trading facility and the New York City skyline was forever changed.

finest
and

horrible

not
even 
begin

What it
was like

the symbiance
to witness
first hand
not
by radio
not

feel
the impact

all of
in

Yester
day
I thought about
my life again
or
the end of it
A long while ago
I believd I 
would never make it
to 21
I always felt
that Id be the guy
killed in that car accident
or
hit by the stray bullet
And
for the longest time
I was afraid to
think past it
so
I didnt
and just lived
for the foreseeable
I eventually forgot about it
and
started to plan ahead
Then
one rainy night
that
was so magikal
and perception turning for me
I remembered
and
the tiniest of rememberance
sent me spinning back
I think
once I moved
and started to plan again
I forgot
once again.
But last night
What an awe inspiring night
It moved me to tears
on several occasions
I couldnt bear
to leave it alone…
And
then
It sprung back
The fear
that
I would not reach 21
and that I would not
ever
accomplish the
things
that I havent even decided to do
I broke down
again
Not
because of the beauty
but
because of the shame
The shame of My own
fear
and my own desires
I feel so much
sometimes
And I want so much
and Im not in a rut
I just sit here and dream
and never act
Which is fine for the dreamer
but the alive
needs something
other than some
forlorn hope
that hoping against hope will
produce some
vague satisfaction
There is a place to dream
and
a place to live
Why can’t i do both?

I try to let
my walls down
But
everything I accomplished
that short while ago
Is lost
And
I must build back
which
is impossibly
hard
for
there is growth in ignorance
Knowledge
is just a flat plane
When I went back.
I felt nothing
It was indifferent
uncaring
unnoticing
I had done soo much
and
it was gone.
I suppose
Im just at a lost
My spiritual
path
is lost
and
I must find center
again
to find
my path
Or
blaze
a new one.

Reading the votes now
People say using the anime
is less real than using our pictures.
The way I look at this
is that
In this game
It’s not about who we are
but how we play it
We can use these avartars
as extensions
of our
Survivor “personas”
I think the more indirect things
we show

speaks more

Fat and docile, big and dumb
They look so stupid, they aren’t much fun
Cows aren’t fun
They eat to grow, grow to die
Die to be et at the hamburger fry
Cows well done
Nobody thunk it, nobody knew
No one imagined the great cow guru
Cows are one
He hid in the forest, read books with great zeal
He loved Che Guevera, a revolutionary veal
Cow Tse Tongue
He spoke about justice, but nobody stirred
He felt like an outcast, alone in the herd
Cow doldrums
He mooed we must fight, escape or we’ll die
Cows gathered around, cause the steaks were so high
Bad cow pun
But then he was captured, stuffed into a crate
Loaded onto a truck, where he rode to his fate
Cows are bummed
He was a scrawny calf, who looked rather woozy
No one suspected he was packing an Uzi
Cows with guns
They came with a needle to stick in his thigh
He kicked for the groin, he pissed in their eye
Cow well hung
Knocked over a tractor and ran for the door
Six gallons of gas flowed out on the floor
Run cows run!
He picked up a bullhorn and jumped up on the hay
We are free roving bovines, we run free today
We will fight for bovine freedom    
And hold our large heads high           
We will run free with the Buffalo, or die
Cows with guns
They crashed the gate in a great stampede
Tipped over a milk truck, torched all the feed
Cows have fun
Sixty police cars were piled in a heap
Covered in cow pies, covered up deep
Much cow dung
Black smoke rising, darkening the day
Twelve burning McDonalds, have it your way
We will fight for bovine freedom    
And hold our large heads high           
We will run free with the Buffalo, or die
Cows with guns
The President said “enough is enough
These uppity cattle, its time to get tough”
Cow dung flung
The newspapers gloated, folks sighed with relief
Tomorrow at noon, they would all be ground beef
Cows on buns
The cows were surrounded, they waited and prayed
They mooed their last moos, 
they chewed their last hay
Cows out gunned
The order was given to turn cows to whoppers
Enforced by the might of ten thousand coppers
But on the horizon surrounding the shoppers
Came the deafening roar of chickens in choppers
We will fight for bovine freedom    
And hold our large heads high           
We will run free with the Buffalo, or die
Cows with guns

A long time ago…me and my brother Kyle here, 
We were hitchhiking down a long and lonesome road. 
All of a sudden, there shined a shiny demon, 
in the middle of the road. 
And he said, “Play the best song in the world, or I’ll eat your soul.” 
Well me and Kyle, we looked at each other, and we each said… 
“Okay.” 
And we played the first thing that came to our heads 
Just so happened to be, the best song in the world. 
It was the best song in the world. 
Oh, yeah. 
Oh, and it saved our butts, because the demon want to kill us. 
Oh. 
But he was forced to set us free, by the honor code that demons… 
Have to live by. 
Cause it’s Satan’s Surprise and it’s magic! 
And it’s a mystical disguise… 
It’s the devil’s song and it’s tragic! 
You are the mystical-eyed virgin and you’re rocking! 
Well needless to say, the beast was stunned. 
Whip crack, went the swampy tail, and the beast was done. 
He asked us, “Be you angels?” 
And we said “Nay! We are but men, rock!” 
This is not the greatest song in the world, no. 
This is just a tribute. 
Couldn’t remember the greatest song in the world, no. 
No! This is a tribute, oh! 
To the greatest song in the world, alright! 
To the greatest song in the world, alright! 
It is just the best motherfuckin’ song, the greatest song in the world. 
–skattin’– 
Oh mama, Lucifer. 
And the peculiar thing is this, my friends: 
The song we played on that fatefull night, 
didn’t actually sound anything like this song! 
This is just a tribute. 
You’ve gotta believe me. 
And I wish you were there. 
Just a matter of opinion. 
Ah! Fuck! 
Good god! And God lovin! 
There’s no surprise to find you can’t stop him!

Way back when I was just a little bitty boy living in a box under the stairs in the corner of the basement half a block down the street from Jerry’s Bait shop
You know the place
well anyway, back then life was going swell and everything was just peachy
Except, of course, for the undeniable fact that every single morning
My mother would make me a big bowl of sauerkraut for breakfast
Awww – Big bowl of sauerkraut
Every single mornin
It wa driving me crazy
I said to my mom
I said “Hey, mom, what’s with all the sauerkraut?”
And my dear, sweet mother
She just looked at my like a cow looks at an oncoming train
And she leaned right down next to me
And she said “IT’S GOOD FOR YOU”
And then she tied me to the wall and stuck a funnel in my mouth
And force fed me nothing but sauerkraut until I was twenty six and a half years old
That’s when I swore that someday
Someday I would get outta that basement and travel to a magical, far away place
Where the sun is always shining and the air smells like warm root beer
And the towels are oh so fluffy
Where the shriners and the lepers play their ukuleles all day long
And anyone on the street will glady shave your back for a nickel
Wacka wacka doodoo yeah
Well, let me tell you, people, it wasn’t long at all before my dream came true
Because the very next day, a local radio station had this contest
To see who could correctly guess the number of molecules in Leonard Nimoy’s butt
I was off by three, but I still won the grand prize
That’s right, a first class one-way ticket to
Albuquerque
Albuquerque
Oh yeah
You know, I’d never been on a real airplane before
And I gotta tell ya, it was really great
Except that I had to sit between two large Albanian women with excruciatingly severe body odor
And the little kid in back of me kept throwin’ up the whole time
The flight attendants ran out of Dr. Pepper and salted peanuts
And the in-flight movie was Bio-Dome with Pauly Shore
And, oh yeah, three of the airplane engines burned out
And we went into a tailspin and crashed into a hillside
And the plane exploded in a giant fireball and everybody died
Except for me
You know why?
‘Cause I had my tray table up
And my seat back in the full upright position
Had my tray table up
And my seat back in the full upright position
Had my tray table up
And my seat back in the full upright position
Ah ha ha ha
Ah ha ha
Ahhhh
So I crawled from the twisted, burnin’ wreckage
I crawled on my hands and knees for three full days
Draggin’ along my big leather suitcase and my garment bag
And my tenor saxophone and my twelve-pound bowling ball
And my lucky, lucky autographed glow-in-the-dark snorkel
But finally I arived at the world famous Albuquerque Holiday Inn
Where the towels are oh so fluffy
And you can eat your soup right out of the ashtrays if you wanna
It’s OK, they’re clean
Well, I checked into my room and I turned down the A/C
And I turned on the SpectraVision
And I’m just about to eat that little chocolate mint on my pillow
That I love so very, very much when suddenly, there’s a knock on the door
Well now, who could that be?
I say “Who is it?”
No answer
“Who is it?”
There’s no answer
“WHO IS IT?”
They’re not sayin’ anything
So, finally I go over and I open the door and just as I suspected
It’s some big fat hermaphrodite with a Flock-Of-Seagulls haircut and only one nostril
Oh man, I hate it when I’m right
So anyway, he bursts into my room and he grabs my lucky snorkel
And I’m like “Hey, you can’t have that”
“That snorkel’s been just like a snorkel to me”
And he’s like “Tough”
And I’m like “Give it”
And he’s like “Make me”
And I’m like “‘Kay”
So I grabbed his leg and he grabbed my esophagus
And I bit off his ear and he chewed off my eyebrows
And I took out his appendix and he gave me a colonic irrigation
Yes indeed, you better believe it
And somehow in the middle of it all, the phone got knocked off the hook
And twenty seconds later, I heard a farmiliar voice
And you know what it said?
I’ll tell you what it said
It said
“If you’d like to make a call, please hang up and try again”
“If you need help, hang up and then dial your operator”
“If you’d like to make a call, please hang up and try again”
“If you need help, hang up and then dial your operator”
In Albuquerque
Albuquerque
Well, to cut a long story short, he got away with my snorkel
But I made a a solemn vow right then and there that I would not rest
I would not sleep for an instant until the one-nostrilled man was brought to justice
But first, I decided to buy some donuts

So I got in my car and I drove over to the donut shop
And I walked on up to the guy behind the counter
And he says “Yeah, what do ya want?”
I said “You got any glazed donuts?”
He said “No, we’re outta glazed donuts”
I said “Well, you got any jelly donuts?”
He said “No, we’re outta jelly donuts”
I said “You got any Bavarian cream-filled donuts?”
He said “No, we’re outta Bavarian cream-filled donuts”
I said “You got any cinnamon rolls?”
He said “No, we’re outta cinnamon rolls”
I said “You got any apple fritters?”
He said “No, we’re outta apple fritters”
I said “You got any bear claws?”
He said “Wait a minute, I’ll go check”
“No, we’re outta bear claws”
I said “Well, in that case – in that case, what do you have?”
He says “All I got right now is this box of one dozen starving, crazed weasels”
I said “OK, I’ll take that”
So he hands me the box and I open up the lid and the weasels jump out
And they immediately latch onto my face and start bitin’ me all over
(rabid gnawing sounds)
Oh man, they were just going nuts
They were tearin’ me apart
You know, I think it was just about that time that a little ditty started goin’ through my head”
I believe it went a little something like this . . .

Oh, get ’em off me
Oh, oh God
Ah, (more screaming)
I ran out into the street with these flesh-eating weasels all over my face
Wavin’ my arms all around and just runnin’, runnin’, runnin’
Like a constipated weiner dog
And as luck wouls have it, that’s exactly when I ran into the girl of my dreams
Her name was Zelda
She was a caligraphy enthusiast with a slight overbite and hair the color of strained peaches
I’ll never forget the first thing she said to me.
She said “Hey, you’ve got weasels on your face”
That’s when I knew it was true love
We were inseperable after that
Aw, we ate together, we bathed together
We even shared the same piece of mint-flavored dental floss
The world was our burrito
So we got married and we bought us a house
And had two beautiful children – Nathaniel and Superfly
Oh, we were so very very very happy, aw yeah
But then one fateful night, Zelda said to me
She said “Sweetie pumpkin? Do you wanna join the Columbia Record Club?”
I said “Woah, hold on now, baby”
“I’m just not ready for that kinda commitment”
So we broke up and I never saw her again
But that’s just the way things go
In Albuquerque
Albuquerque
Anyway, things really started lookin’ upi for me
Because about a week later, I finally achieved my lifelong dream
That’s right, I got me a part-time job at The Sizzler
I even made employee of the month after I put that grease fire out with my face
Aw yeah, everybody was pretty jealous of me after that
I was gettin’ a lot of attitude
OK, like one time, I was out in the parking lot
Tryin’ to remove my excess earwax with a golf pencil
When I see this guy Marty tryin’ to carry a big ol’ sofa up the stairs all by himself
So I, I say to him, I say “Hey, you want me to help you with that?”
And Marty, he just rolls his eyes and goes
“No, I want you to cut off my arms and legs with a chainsaw”
So I did
And then he gets all indignant on me
He’s like “Hey man, I was just being sarcastic”
Well, that’s just great
How was I supposed to know that?
I’m not a mind reader for cryin’ out loud
Besides, now he’s got a really cute nickname – Torso-Boy
So what’s he complaining about?
Say, that reminds me of another amusing anecdote
This guy comes up to me on the street and says he hasn’t had a bit in three days
Well, I knew what he meant
But just to be funny, I took a big bite out of his jugular vein
And he’s yellin’ and screamin’ and bleeding all over
And I’m like “Hey, come on, don’tcha get it?”
But he just keeps rolling around on the sidewalk, bleeding, and screaming
(screaming sounds)
You know, just completely missing the irony of the whole situation
Man, some people just can’t take a joke, you know?
Anyway, um, um, where was I?
Kinda lost my train of thought
Uh, well, uh, OK
Anyway I, I know it’s kinda been a roundabout way of saying it
But I guess the whole point I’m tryin’ to make here is
I hate sauerkraut
That’s all I’m really tryin’ to say
And, by the way, if one day you happen to wake up
And find yourself in an existential quandry
Full of loathing and self-doubt
And wracked with the pain and isolation of your pitiful meaningless existence
At least you can take a small bit of comfort in knowing that
Somewhere out there in this crazy mixed-up universe of ours
There’s still a little place called
Albuquerque
Albuquerque
Albuquerque, Albuquerque
Albuquerque, Albuquerque
Albuquerque, Albuquerque
Albuquerque, Albuquerque
I said “A” (A)
“L” (L)
“B” (B)
“U” (U)
“querque” (querque)
Albuquerque, Albuquerque, Albuquerque, Albuquerque
Albuquerque, Albuquerque, Albuquerque, Albuquerque
Albuquerque, Albuquerque, Albuquerque, Albuquerque

bravely
into
the fray
Despite his fear
and his ignorance
It ends now…
Sword
at belt
staff at hand
Eyes
to the earth
searching for a smile
I am here
I Am

The wind shallows
and the sun
dissappears
between the two
Great
towers
of shame
There is nothing
But
he is there…
I am here
Planting
the oaken staff
firmly
into the soil

what was once
Leading to his brow…
linking
some
message

The wind rises from the mud
and wracks
the black figure
Eating at his resolve
The cold
chills
his fear
and forms
new
apprehension
in his withered heart
The absence becomes alive
with noise
and disturbance
He falls to the earth
Eyes skyward…
Mouth open
in a breathless
scream
I am here
His hand
traces
to his neck
and his belief
All is one
one is all
One out of many
into one
I am one
I am one
I am an instant
that
leads
to the next
I am one
I am one with you
I am one
I am here
I am one
Why won’t
you accept
me

tell me
I am one
I am you

he can’t avoid conflict-
he’s lost cuz he’s incomplete
he’s in between, somewhere in between, in between the sleepless shadows
battling to break the love that’s ‘guaranteed to make you bleed thicker than blood’
he don’t want it, but craves what he can’t escape
he’s staring straight through his fate and now he’s face to face
you wanna fall down, well this could make your dreams come true
because the devil was an angel too
look at me now, making the same mistakes i said i’d never make again-
but now i’m back in the same place
look at me now, somebody stole my soul-
i feel the breaks go and i’m spinning out of control
come step into a brave new world-
not even worth it
decent comes quick and now he’s anything but perfect
and still he worships that fundamental bullshit talk
‘the path you carve yourself is the path to walk’
now walk alone-
play it to the bone
don’t make it right just because he got his sickness from that venomous bite
we wanna fall down, well this could make our dreams come true
because the devil was an angel too

When I look into your eyes
I can see a love restrained
But darlin’ when I hold you
Don’t you know I feel the same
‘Cause nothin’ lasts forever
And we both know hearts can change
And it’s hard to hold a candle
In the cold November rain
We’ve been through this auch a long long time
Just tryin’ to kill the pain
But lovers always come and lovers always go
An no one’s really sure who’s lettin’ go today
Walking away
If we could take the time
to lay it on the line
I could rest my head
Just knowin’ that you were mine
All mine
So if you want to love me
then darlin’ don’t refrain
Or I’ll just end up walkin’
In the cold November rain
Do you need some time…on your own
Do you need some time…all alone
Everybody needs some time…
on their own
Don’t you know you need some time…all alone
I know it’s hard to keep an open heart
When even friends seem out to harm you
But if you could heal a broken heart
Wouldn’t time be out to charm you
Sometimes I need some time…on my
own
Sometimes I need some time…all alone
Everybody needs some time…
on their own
Don’t you know you need some time…all alone
And when your fears subside
And shadows still remain
I know that you can love me
When there’s no one left to blame
So never mind the darkness
We still can find a way
‘Cause nothin’ lasts forever
Even cold November rain
Don’t ya think that you need somebody
Don’t ya think that you need someone
Everybody needs somebody
You’re not the only one
You’re not the only one

I get
the oddesst
notions
in the shower
sometimes..
The water..
pounding my face
My mind
regresses to
a place
where
my past becomes
a moments memories
This morning
I remembered
Jim
When he lived across from me
I never did figure him out
an ass
a jock
a gifted nice guy
a kid with issues
Looking back
I take the last one
He really was a nice guy
awesome
at anything physical..
I wonder now
what drove him
to suceed…
I remember when he moved in..
We took our bikes
and rode in circles
behind
Caveats..
or..was it Hooks?
Later..much later
when he was less of a friend
and more
of
an ass
I remember
an incident
at the trail
My kingdom…
It was
a moment
of truth..
self-defense..perhaps..
I took
my stick..
and I swung..
It couldn’t have hurt..
but
the look
he gave me
I hurt something that day.
I remember the night
when
I was awoken
by an ambulance
out my window
I found out
the next day at school
that Jim had slit his wrists
He survived 
of course
And
at the time
I didnt think much of it
I don’t think I saw Jim again
He moved to away
not long after that
Only now
do I think of him
With my friends
He had
almost
of a legendary
status
So strong
so fast..
So…something
I remember
the one day
when
I was crying
I cried alot
back then
School…
the words
the taunts
One day
I broke down
I remember him talking to me
…
This was after
long after
the swing.
I realize
now that
he forgave me
And
I just never did.
I wish I got to know him better.

He awakens from this dream unable to remember exactly what is was, or much at all beyond the simple fact that he has dreamed about being a child again. He touches his wife’s smooth back as she sleeps her warm sleepy and dreams her own dreams; he thinks that it is good to be a child, but it is also to be a grownup and able to consider the mystery of childhood…its beliefs and desires.  -I will write about all of this one day,-he thinks, and knows it’s just a dawn of thought, an after-dreaming thought. But it’s nice to think so for awhile in the morning’s clean silence, to think that childhood has its own sweet secrets and confirms mortality, and that mortality defines courage and love. To think that what has looked forward must also look back, and that each life makes it’s own imitation of immortality: a wheel.
Or so Bill Denbrough sometimes thinks on those early mornings after dreaming, when he almost remembers his childhood, and the friends with whom he shared it.

There were some scientists. 
Trying to figure out the Sasquatch riddle, 
Then they figured out it was a missing link. 
In search of Sasquatch, 
that was a kick-ass In Search Of 
with Leonard Nimoy 
kickin’ out the jams…ha! 
He captured imagination, 
Of people all around the globe. 
His name was Sasquatch, so I’m told. 
His legend’s ancient 
in the ancient scribe of the indian tribe. 
Apache tribe. 
Scientists have proven that the Sasquatch, he is real. 
Take a look at the plaster cast of his foot, now you know he’s real. 
Listen real close to the audio tape, not human no you know he’s real. 
Couldn’t be a man in gorilla suit, no fuckin’ way. 
No, you know he’s real. 
Real, real, real real, real, real, really real, real. 
–Interrupted by J.B. & K.G. talking to Sasquatch– 
Sasquatch, 
We know your legend’s real. 
Sasquatch, 
We know your love is real. 
Sasquatch, 
You and Tenacious D, are…real. 
Take a look at the plaster cast of his foot fuck you know it’s real
Twice as fuckn big as fuckin Shaq’s foot- god fuckin now you know he’s real.
There’s no way he’s a guy in a gorilla suit.
No fuckin way! He’s real!
Did you see the film? The fuckin film? Fuzzy film?
Then you fuckin know now you know he’s real.
Listen on to the audio tapes, now you know that he’s real, he’s real.
Everytime i take a dump i know Sasquatch is real.
Look inside my anus and you’ll know Sasquatch is real.
Real.

the words of the past
reflect the
present
oh so painfully
Or
atleast
lovingly~
Your words to me just a whisper
Your faces so unclear
I try to pay attention
Your words just disappear
‘Cause it’s always raining in my head
So I speak to you in riddles because
My words get in my way. I smoke the
whole thing to my head and feel it
Wash away ‘Cause I can’t take anymore
Of this, I want to come apart, 
or dig myself a little hole inside
your precious heart
‘Cause it’s always raining in my head
Forget all the things I should have said
I am nothing more than a little boy inside
That cries out for attention,
though I always try to hide
And I talk to you like children,
but I don’t know
I’ll do the right thing
If the right thing is revealed
But it’s always raining in my head
Forget all the things I should have said

I’ve grown tired of this emptiness 
So deeper and deeper I dig into the dark 
Searching for tools to patch me up 
But the more I find the more I’m torn apart
Constrain it, let the subjects meld 
Like a mad disease the newborns divide 
All the walls have come crashing down 
So ball ’em up and shove ’em back inside 
Crack the shell and let the truth emerge 
Strain the brain, make it comprehend 
Breathe new life into breathless lungs 
And spread the word- it’s time to rise again 
Feel it, can you feel it grow? 
Now feel it, does it multiply? 
Feel it, change is coming soon 
Butterfly, you wanna fly? 
Open your arms and let me in 
I wanna spread new wings,
I wanna shed this skin 
Resurrect and reunite the kin
Wanna spread new wings,
I wanna spread new wings 
Butterfly- open your mind, open your eyes 
Prepare your senses as the sound excels 
The next generation of angst unveiled 
And spreads like cancer through these jaded cells 
Infect me, let me crash and bleed 
I can feel the sickness flowing through my veins 
Down my system and attack the seed 
Now you can have my pleasure if you’ll take my pain 
Lifeless eyes, can you see through the plastic? 
Life fucking myself when my hands are cold 
Dedication’s never been the problem 
But you say the words and I’m hard as stone 
Now I see the clock reverse, don’t you know- 
The pain gets worst the further back you go
Your own regrets gonna shallow you whole
Now brace yourself, come on, brace yourself
(chorus) 
Why don’t you open you’re arms? 
Why don’t you let me in? 
Give up you’re past 
And lets start this thing 
Jesus Christ, rip yourself form the cross 
My patience with you has been my life’s greatest loss
I’m tired of praying when nobody cares 
Can you hear me now? are you even there? 
I can see the surface, I can see the light 
And I can see it shining through your eyes tonight 
Now I can see the silhouette of seraphim 
Now I can see myself spreading my own wings 
Now tear off my garments and bury my face 
Whatever it takes to get out of this place 
Whatever it takes to hide what’s inside 
Hell, I’d sell my own soul for a piece of the pride 
Now open your arms and let me in 
Tear away my scars, wash away my sins 
Spread them like wings, spread them like wings and fly 
My little butterfly I’d like to see you try 
Now open your arms and let me in 
Come and take my hand 
And let’s start this thing

I think
I owe
some people an explanation
so it is known from where
I am coming from
I don’t like to talk about me
straight forward
I would rather
state the symptons
and reactions
rather then the source
But
in this case
I think I need
to be serious
if but once
I am a middle child between two
sisters
My older sister
Sara
is 5 years older
while
my younger sister
Kim
is a year younger than me
All of our lives
It’s been a little
unfair
to Sara
Being the oldest
Basically..My parents made all the mistakes on her
She was one with a curfew in high school
She was the one who had to wait until she was 18 to drive
Kim and I always lacked a curfew
and we both drove as soon as we could
Sara just had the unfortunate
luck
to be first
and
All of her life
she has been screwed like that.
Flash forward
Several months ago
I got word
that Sara was pregnant
This was one of those
“Great..it’s about time, Whats for dinner” things
I just didnt get very excited about it..
about a month ago
My younger sister
got pregnant.
This
of course
shocked the hell out of me
It’s so hard for me
to see her
pregnant
she has always been my little sister
kimmy..
It hurts me
alot
when i see her do stuff
It hurt
to know she was sexually active
It hurt
that day
at school
when she got shitfaced…
It hurts now.
Flashforward
Sara went into the hospital
last week
Apparently
Her cervix isnt strong enough
to support the baby
for
Her water bag
decided it
was time to exit.
She had some surgery to support it from the outside
But
that failed
So now
she has a difficult
decision
They can try operarte
and fix on the inside
But
this a dangerous operation for her
and a severely dangerous operation for her child.
And even if it works
there is a seventy percent chance
The child would be mentally damaged.
Or
they can take the child out now
and It is just too soon for it
and it would die.
And…further more
If they got pregnant again..
there is only a 50% chance it wont 
happen again.
So
my mom and my sister
go up north
to be with her.
It has to be killing her though.
My parents are planning for kim’s wedding and shower
And Kim is in there
pregnant
And Sara…bleah
This just isnt right for her 
she doesnt deserve it.
Now 
My dad
is going up to be with her.
and
I am stuck here
alone.
And all I can do is worry
It’s eating me up on the inside.

This morning I jumped on my horse
And went out for a ride,
And some wild outlaws chased me
And they shot me in the side.
So I crawled into a wildcat’s cave
To find a place to hide,
But some pirates found me sleeping there,
And soon they had me tied
To a pole and built a fire
Under me-I almost cried
Till a mermaid came and cut me loose
And begged me to be my bride,
So I said I’d come back Wednesday
But I must admit I lied.
Then I ran into a jungle swamp
But I forgot my guide
And I stepped into some quicksand,
And no matter how I tried
I couldn’t get out, until I met
A water snake named Clyde,
Who pulled me to some cannibals
Who planned to have me fried,
But an eagle came and swooped me up
And through the air we flied,
But her dropped me in a boiling lack
A thousand miles wide.
And you’ll never guess what I did then-
I DIED.
~Shel Silverstein~
there is something lacking
something missing
in 
all
this falseness
of glamour
Like
spilt
milk
of rotten blood
The dreams
seem broken
in the reality
of it
all
The ballon
on the light
I remember it now
The days
upon
days
Until
it was too much
and
it popped
I have a
picture
I think
the ceiling
seems
bare now
One day
Codi
will become
the Rain
and
perhaps
I can
get
out
of this funk
that
seems
to rise
from my form
and
stagnate
my heart
I am but myself
and
my dreams
are too large
for this
all
I can rise
above it
Really..

The mind is a powerful thing

Magic

in is
the willingness

of it all
Life
wonder
…
My mind aches from it
a dull numbing feel
that
covers my brain like cancer
making indifference
its
call to arms
It just doesnt seem
right..

I wish I could
delve into my vanity
and make me so
To let me
to make me
stop feeling
stop caring
Empathy is but a curse
I  know how you feel
Ive been there before
I know how you feel
Ive been there before

see that
impression of light
long after its gone
dancing in my head
taunting me in my sleep
Riding the waves of anxiety
and
typical events.

You are a very emotional and sensitive individual. Your life and love of life is dominated by your emotions … you have great feeling towards your fellow man and you are always full of enthusiasm .. but be careful … you tend to let your heart rule your head … and this being so.. you could be easily hurt … as perhaps you may have indeed been hurt in the past … 
You are full of stress at this time … It would seem that you are having more than your fair share of trials and tribulations and you are looking for a way out. You are not quite sure which way to go – but the advice is – Stop trying so hard – .. . 
You are a demanding egocentric and therefore quick to take offence. This attitude makes people feel somewhat inadequate when in your company … and so it is no wonder that at times you feel alone .. and unwanted..
Unacceptable restrictions have been forced upon you and this is resulting in severe frustration and stress. You are looking for independence and consequently you shy away from any restriction and avoid obligations of anything which might prove hampering.You are being subjected to considerable pressure and want to escape from it so that you can obtain what you need, but unfortunately at this particular moment in time you lack the necessary strength of purpose to succeed in this.
The tensions and stresses that you are experiencing at this time are, you feel, beyond your capabilities, or your reserves of strength to cope with. You feel inadequate and in a constant state of anxiety…You are attempting to escape from this situation into a secure environment in which you may be permitted to relax and recover, free from outside interference.

I feel dried
up

I lack the energy
to abstract
my problems anymore
When the beauty
is still seen
But I cannot relay what I feel

The Butterfly  11/12/2000  
A Man drives his car down the road.
He is late for dinner, His wife always chides him for it.
No…not today, he thinks.
He puts hit foot on the gas and races into the woods that lead to his home.
A butterfly dances in the air above the road, oblivious to the danger, it flies…..looking for a meal to sustain it till the next meal.
The man flies down the road, but, being careful of any hazards….but..still flying
The butterfly, tired by it’s dancing about…lands on the pavement to rest for a few moments..
suddenly….the ground begins to shake….and..the butterfly takes flight….
The man see’s the butterfly in the road, he see’s it’s splendid colours.
He see’s the beauty it has
If he had time, he might have wept, for in that moment, he realized what beauty was.
The butterfly felt a rush of air..and….tried to move, but…it was too late.
The man tried to swerve in time, but..it was too late…..a life was lost.
The Man looked at the crumpled body.
The life was gone, it didnt even look real.
A man brushed by him, to see if the was any hope….
The man knew there was none…
Right before striking the butterfly, he saw beauty that was beyond him.
He swerved
Into a tree, his bodly flew thru the windshield…and….into a tree.
No
there was no hope what so ever.
The man prayed that his wife would know that he loved her, and that he had tried to make it on time, for one last time.
He did not regret what he did.
And, as he walked towards eternity, he watched the butterfly one last time, as it flew over his mangled body

My mind thinks
of the happiness I dreamed of
the wonders that are
the fantasies that could be
and the memories that were
I am not deppressed
I am not sad
I am tired
I am sick of this
I hate how they are
I hate how I
must act

I sit here
staring
boring
wondering if I should just pick up the phone and call
Is she home?
I dont know
and
my fear overpowers me
And
here I sit
cowardly and miffed
My lips chapped
my head aching
my nose burning
Outside
the snow reflects the streetlight
Night covers the absence
I allow myself to stray into the cold
Letting the soothing burn of freezing
smother my twisting storm of emotion
so
that only the snow is left

Why am I here
I find myself in a place
completely unfamilar
a place
where
I speak funny
and
look
even funnier(or hellish…pends who you ask)
I am sooooooooo lost
I could point out..and..tell you anything..about…any animal from Illinois to Wisconsin
and
most of the midwest
nothing surprised me
I knew it all
Now
I see a bird
and
I have no friggin clue what it is
everything.
Even at night
things are different
the nights…are…sinister here
No…It’s sinister because I dont know what is in the dark
it’s sinister because…I can feel it
the icy edge…knife like
cold
unfeeling
indifferent
There are spirits here…just as anywhere else
but
they are angry..so very angry
Each night
I feel them…
They are just as upset as the spirits at BG
And
they are everywhere
They are several violent ones around the apartment I am moving into in a few weeks
I am looking forward to it though…
In the past 3 months
I had been working so very hard to improve myself in a spiritual sense
I see things now(No, I am not insane..or..on anything…just…trust me..k?)
They are there..always are…you just havta know what to look for
and
feel
…
I got a forward today…
It was one of those surveys
One of my old high school friends sent it
and
contrary to my usual behaviour
I filled it out.
Yes
I know
nothing big about that…but
it was huge to me
I never do those
.
I did another odd thing today
I heard a telemarketer out…
scary..
….
Although I am lost…
I do enjoy the surroundings
It is so..
bright
and
colourful
Even,
the nights
albeit 
sinister
are beautiful
..
I do hope I find the beauty in the way of living down here
I hope I see it
I hope the light is real
and
the beauty is true.
The night is dark and sinister.
I am open and true
I will find the answers I seek
and
banish the fear I feel

The attack
is upon
us
the flyer
said
The devils
word
is hate
and it’s wrong
to do so
so filled
with anger
so filled with rage
You cant see
the wrongness
in your
right
Looking past me
below me
for an absoloute
Having it glaring back at you
in one simple retort
Hate is the way
not to go
turn back now
And let love for it all
fill you anew
The attack is indeed
real
It’s you

what an
odd shade of blue
dancing along the
ceiling
of my
reality
never changing
constantly
boring
My nose
bleeds
internally
mocking
my face
with it’s red exterior
The pain
is but
a temporary reminder
that my face
is pissed off
My back aches
from countless hours
in this ten cent chair
My mind
is done
wasted
and gone
but
I have miles to go
before I sleep
and
My heart
is not
yet
ready
to go

such a poignant thought
for such a timid devise
That alone
could make me cry
But
now with a
newer
deeper mission
I feel
something
inside
too big to feel
too small
to explode
I hope it’s well recieved
I feel guilty
for not being there
for not letting my
Feelings be known
I should have been there
I should have met him
My tongue down my throat
my eyes
on the floor
No music box
could
ever
replace
what was gained
No tears
what was lost

thrusts
his

still 
insists

sees
the
ghosts
The terror

within
the heart
of a small boy
in a jar

sustain
a wonderful
image

this rock
It was the perfect
rock
Not
black
not brown
some
wonderful place
inbetween
I took it
everywhere
with me
ever in my hand
ever drowning in my sweet sweet sweat
It comforted me
In ways
I only now
understand
I don’t remember how I lost it
I don’t remember when
But there isnt a day
that has gone by since
that my mind hasnt wandered
to that rock..

When did trading
become
buying?
When did exchanging
become trading
When did
I lose track
of this though
and why?
the light is still out there
mocking
my something..
Making
my fantasies
real
and by
doing so
destroying them
The night
is cool
and uncaring
but
it’s warm
compared
to the void inside
My blankets
are soiled
with the rememberment
of what
was once.
Maybe I need a shower

Strange things happen
when Im asleep
they must
because my waking
eyes
never
ever do see
something that
seems
out of the “norm”
The things
that must dance
over my sleeping head
the 
Beasts
in my closet
the
one
under my bed
Oh
the strange
and curious
oddities
that never
see the light
of reality
in my wake
I wish I could
see them
But
if I did
I would
defeat the purpose

Nine hundred times
before
I have
sat
but
a mere
servant
to this
pasty
screen
spilling
my heart
spilling my soul
for a few notes
and
perhaps
a few days of
self-worth
and accomplishment
I still come back for more
This isnt
a celebration
of self
or being
It is
but a mere
statement
that Things
arent
as they are
and for
atleast
one mind
I understand that
My heart
and my soul
and my mind
and my bofy

bend and curve
to the weight
of it all
My eyes
grow
frantic
in my urge

this will ever end
Even when Im gone
For
I will have made my mark
and You will have
atleast
Tried
to understand

its nice
sometimes
when the morning
is brighter
than the night
that preceeded it
It doesnt happen often
most mornings
begin
with responsilbility

creeps

onward
To
some pinnacle

glory
unknown to me

and MOCKing

nothing

It’s nice to have goals
I am so close
to something
that really isnt so big
But
It is..you know
and
Im impatient
So
My plan is
By New Years Eve
I will have 1000 entries
Now..
These entries will only be counted in this time
as original
no song lyrics
and
no reiterations
Just Me..
Bleah
Shall we begin?
I doubt there will be anything left of me
when Im done
but
it will be worth it
No?

It seems but
a dream
but it
was painfully real
Today I realized
some things
Today
I feel like
a fifth wheel
at home
My mom my dad
Chad and Kim
Im just kinda here
J and the computer..
perhaps
But I can’t take you all
out shopping
and I can’t go to the movies
and your hands
Bleah
Im just lonely
my life consists
of the road between
here and k-mart
and my nights
are but
a lonely screen
with heartfelt empty words
on a digtized
platform
Im too young to be regretting
the mistakes in my life
Im too young to feel trapped
…
The sky opened up today
and invited me
to climb
into the heavens
and play among the stars
I turned it down though
I prefer
the mud down here
and I prefer
the colours
and
besides
What would I do
among
the stars
besides
suffocate
and die?

I can see it
in his face
Where age is attacking
and wearing him thin
I see
the lack of sleep
in his eyes

his restless
walks
Im not making it easier
my presence
is constant reminder
of his Failure
Yes..he takes my failure
unto him

a weight has been pressed onto me

I cannot feel it

trip

glimmers of

approval
the coy voice

self-belief

I like to 
retract myself
into my
mind

euphoric

it

about winning

I just wanted it
so bad
I betrayed
everything

done
up to that point.
It
did lose luster
I lost
it

a shimmering
spear
of comfort

myself

it was something
cold

that
I
came to expect

this
marathon
rush

cleanse myself

portions of it

morning
preoocupations

a dark
and fanciful
masquerade

routine
and broken memories

are all too
poignant

a breath

the comforting
discomfort

through
and through

and would
make it whole again.

is getting louder

Push it back

it when it
talks to you

is no longer a dance

a sinfully delightful
storm

and
dissonance

to look
harder

Open your eyes

The stars
stayed behind me
tonight
Shining their
ancient
and traveled
light
across
my withered
and decayed
field
of vision.
Empowering
my path
and
choosing
my
direction
ever forward
ever forward
can’t look back
It’s blinding
To much to see
Too much to do
It seems
like
I cant go on
like this
Running
to that
pinnacle
hoping
that
I have some reserve
That I lack
knowledge of
But
ever forward
I proceed
Hoping
to regain
what was lost
and
to clean
of the excess
and
Emerge
at the top
as a shining
and shimmering
form
of
self delusion
and
satisfaction
~
Cuz they
seem just like you
I wanna reach and touch you
All I have is me
All I want is you
Cuz they seem
just like you
I cannot forget you
All I have is me
with this
memory
fading
alone.~

the places
I escape
to
The Field
the Trail
the Basement

formed
a triage
of refuge
for the
infinite
insignificant
sorrows
of myself
The field
tested
the bounds
of
my imagination
with it’s level
footing
and it’s everchanging
colours
And I soon discovered
that were
no boundaries
There
The trail
picked
up
where
my imagination
failed
There
my fantasies
gained
a tangible
assist
by
it’s wooden
halls
and mighty
sentires
of leafy
consequence
There I learned
accomplishment
and from
the subtle
stress
of
a preteens
life
The
Basement
gave me
ease
where
the trail
failed
When reality
took
a face
first
dive
into
my heart
And
the trees
couldnt
wipe
my tears
away
The monotonous
sounds
and
the dusty
darkness
of the basement
filled in my shattered
heart
It is there
that my imagination
gained
it’s dark endge
adn my innocence
was lost
Now I sit in the dark
waiting
to regress
back to the trail
and back to the filed
Where my dark troubles
become
but
a mere
second thought
in my rambuctious
event
and my only
concern
is when
Sleep
will raise
it’s weeping
head.

there

full of potential
to my
young

playground
in the shadow
of the hill

the garden
with the sweet pea’s
Gone are the
pines
where
we chased the bunnies
Hoping
against hope

we may catch one
with out heart

The tree
where the dew 
gathered
into
some
earthly
magic
stew

Gone are the roses
yellow
red
and white
Gone is the basement

the mind haunts
and the memory
lingers

broken rememberance

image
A big
blue bunny
at the kitchen counter

easterly thing
hopping
to and fro

And I ran
and he hopped after me
Hop
Hop
Hop
I ran to my bed

And
I could hear him breathing outside
and he whispered in his girlish voice
Little Boys aren’t supposed to see the easter bunny
and little boys don’t
Im going to take you away

Im going to eat you!

a week
of

simply for the fact
that
It really isnt different
from
the previous
Nine hundred
and Ninety
nine
entries
Just another entry
A year ago
this was
a mere
brief thought
of
What will it be like
to do a thousand
To be honest
Im not sure I have ever done
a thousand of anything
that was worth doing
Or not doing
A lifetime
of breathes
blinks
smiles
tears
frowns
Dreams
I could try
and remember every word
or
atleast
some of them
But it would be wasted
There here
and now
are all that matters
The past
just shapes
the present
This is a turning point though
Originaly
I thought
I would just do 999 entries
and
just
dl and delete it all
The ultimate
~almost~ to date for me..
But
I can’t do this for myself
Because this is an ego trip for me
I need it
Beyond this green
these words
Its different for me
I can say what I feel
and what I want
and atleast
I will listen
and
perhaps
some other people
And
that is enough
Im happy to be here
and
Im really happy
that I made it
Because
It is the journey
that makes the difference
The shimmering
trek
through myself
to a point
and
then
Turn
Yes
this is a turning point
I can rest now
for
this leg is done
At least once
a day
I ask myself
when it’s going to end.
1000?
1001?
2000?
I don’t know
and I suppose
I won’t know
until
It does.
I’m not finished
I won’t stop
until
I convey
whatever it is
I need to
and
maybe I’ll find out
what it is
before I do.
Thank you to everyone

so lost
and twisted
that you cannot stay away
no matter how hard
and for how long you try?
Ever find that
something changed
almost over night

Something you weren’t even looking for
is there and
you cannot get it out 
of your mind
Ever felt something
that
sank itself
deep
into
youself

mold

on a branch

on top of a building

~some things
need to be said~
Dear Aunt, Uncle, and Mother
There once was a time when Christmas was a joyous time of
celebration and family sharing.  When all three of you were there, smiling and laughing along with the rest of us.
Now I wonder if that was all just a passing fantasy in the wake of the present reality.
This affair with the cabin has escalated to a point of ludicrisy.  A point where I fear a parental backlash for trying to talk to my cousins as well as a confrontation from theirs.  This two/three-headed conflict of mothers, uncles, aunts, and their respected spouses over an estate of a dead woman is poignantly illustrated in your attempts to quell it.
Instead of camly working out a soloution.  You three march out on your self-rightgeous horses and declare war on eachother.
Your disagreement upon the property is no longer civil.  It is as deep and childish as an argument over who gets to play with some little red ball.
But that is what this is now, a childish fight.  Each intent laced comment you make is not a step towards an agreement, but a vicious twist of an emotionally charged knife to entice and aggrivate.
Maturity and sensibility have taken a back seat.  Each of you are too proud, too stubborn, too idiotic to give eachother an inch.  Each suggestion, each idea proposed is rejected and forsaken before reason gets but a glimpse of it.  It’s amazing you three have lasted this long without your parent’s intervention.
I never knew my grandfather. And each day, the memory of my grandmother fades more and more.  Despite that, I know this is not what they wanted: 
Their children fighting over a family heirloom, a vacation spot, and a piece of monetary value.  There are some things more important than all of these.
You three are family.  The same blood pumps through all your veins.  I cannot speak for all your children, although I like to think that I do.  But this is destroying the family.  You may be fine with that, I, however, am not.  
Heal the wounds between yourselves and come to realize that things like this should not break the bound there is between you.  Your family needs you.  Become a family again…Then..worry about the cabin.
Love
Your nephew and son
Jay

up

the scream

Forming

of angst
Rolling

may fill it again

“Five Termes, there be, which five I doe apply
To all, that was, and is, and shall be done.
The first, and last, is that ETERNITIE,
Which, neither shall have End, nor, was begunne.
BEGINNING, is the next; which, is a space
(Or moment rather) scarce imaginarie,
Made, when the first Materiall, formed was;
And, then, forbidden, longer time time tarry.
TIME entred, when, BEGINNING had an Ending,
And, is a Progresse, all the workes of Nature,
Within the circuit of it, comprehending,
Ev’n till the period, of the Outward-creature.
END, is the fourth, of those five Termes I meane;
(As briefe, as was Beginning) and, ordayned,
To set the last of moments, to that Scaene,
Which, on this Worlds wide Stage, is entertayned.
The fifth, we EVERLASTING, fitly, call;
For, though, it once begunne, yet shall it never
Admit, of any future-end, at all;
But, be extended onward, still, for ever.
The knowledge of these Termes, and of what action,
To each of them belongs, would set an end,
To many Controversies, and Distractions,
Which doe so many trouble, and offend.
TIME’S nature, by the Fading-flowre, appeares;
Which, is a Type, of Transitory things:
The Circled-snake, ETERNITIE declares;
Within whose Round, each fading Creature, springs.
Some Riddles more, to utter, I intended,
But, lo; a sudden stop, my words have ended.”

The artificial
bears down
and boils me still

illumanition

myself
digitized

By

I saw
the stone
in the rumble
of itself
so
plain
so white
so sticking out of the rest
I was compelled to pick it up
and
watch
as the rain
cleaned it
in my hand
I ran my fingers across it
Studying
Learning
Understanding
This is
how it is
A rock
is forever
It doesn’t go away
I planned on
putting it in my pocket
To save
for a later
moments
ponderment
But
instead
I tossed
it
into
the raging
mini-rapids
that
attacked my feet
and I watched it
tumble down the hill
This is how it is
A change
of venue
Take it to somewhere else
where it will still be the same
A rock is always something
Even if you destroy it
It’s still something.

It was nice
to crawl up
the hill this morning
It was nice to feel the rain
pound my skull
and skin
into submission
Walking up
but always looking down
at my errant footsteps
and
my shattered non
existant dreams
Im above that now
they are being washed away
in the small stream
that is Nature’s defiance
to man
Slowy
and methodically
eating at the road
erasing
any trace
.
When I reached the top
I indulged my
insanity
and talked to the trees
the soil
the rocks
the mud
the birds
the earth
and myself
And I aplogized
for what I havent done
and what I might have
and what I should have
But never what I’ve done
and I turn around
and see
another stream forming
on the other side
and I know that Im forgiven
in the fact
that I laugh
and I smile
and I cry
It’s all the same to the rain
and the mud
and my footprints
Long since
washed away

The world
has drowned
outside
of my phentorine dreams
of the last waking moment
Before
the wicked place
where
sleep isnt sleep
and waking is but a dream
long since woken from
The weary
and the wasted
gather at my eyelids
and taunt my dancing eyes
somethings
seem
different
at night
When light hinders
vision in the fog
and
desire
burns
up
all
except for the goal
All that is constant
is the change
and the adaptation
of seeing
in the dark
or light
Images seem clearer
out of focus
and distorted
when proportioned
and the incessant beeping
of power outages
play as a soundtrack
to
an endless night
But
through
the clouds
The stars still shine
their ancient light
and mud dries
to soil
and rain fades away
And sleep will come
it always does
and always leaves prematurely
but with a promise
to do the same
next time.
~I get knocked down
but I get up again
You ain’t never gonna keep me down~

And she’s buying a stairway to heaven. 
When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed 
With a word she can get what she came for. 
Ooh, ooh, and she’s buying a stairway to heaven. 
There’s a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure 
‘Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings. 
In a tree by the brook, there’s a songbird who sings, 
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven. 
Ooh, it makes me wonder, 
Ooh, it makes me wonder. 
There’s a feeling I get when I look to the west, 
And my spirit is crying for leaving. 
In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees, 
And the voices of those who standing looking. 
Ooh, it makes me wonder, 
Ooh, it really makes me wonder. 
And it’s whispered that soon if we all call the tune 
Then the piper will lead us to reason. 
And a new day will dawn for those who stand long 
And the forests will echo with laughter. 
If there’s a bustle in your hedgerow, don’t be alarmed now, 
It’s just a spring clean for the May queen. 
Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run 
There’s still time to change the road you’re on. 
And it makes me wonder. 
Your head is humming and it won’t go, in case you don’t know, 
The piper’s calling you to join him, 
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow, and did you know 
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind. 
And as we wind on down the road 
Our shadows taller than our soul. 
There walks a lady we all know 
Who shines white light and wants to show 
How everything still turns to gold. 
And if you listen very hard 
The tune will come to you at last. 
When all are one and one is all 
To be a rock and not to roll. 
And she’s buying a stairway to heaven.

I wrote
long ago
about lincoln
~is he really gone
or is he hiding like
a fawn~
…thats how I think it went
It was long ago..
I visited his
marble face saturday
with his only son
He told him
about things
that had happened
He hugged him
as much as he could
in his
gentle
caress of the stone
etched
name
He asked him
to keep an eye
out for Joseph…
I wandered around
as did he
taking pictures
trying
to burn
an image
of rememberance
in my chilled head
I saw the men
the soilders
resting in the reflection of my face
on the smooth marble
each one
had a
story
has a story
I wish I knew more of them
But
I hardly know
the one I came for.
I walked out
towards
a near by wood
and just stared.
I took a picture
of the snowy moment
again
in hopes to preserve
The sudden flash
spooked a deer..
right in front of me
I didn’t even see it
It ran away
stopping briefly
to look back
Not at me
but
his son
Holding back his tears
at his fathers grave.
As the deer ran off
A realization
happened in my mind
A fawn..so long ago
a deer now
Running in the woods
in the snow
A child again
Running off to the other soilders
Playing in the snow…
I told my dad this
as his eyes reflected on his
dad.
“You know?”
I said as we drove off
“He’s out playing in the snow…with the rest of the guys
just out having fun
smiling
and laughing.”
He just nodded
and looked off
into the woods.

I wish to speak a word for Nature, for absolute freedom and wildness, as contrasted with a freedom and
culture merely civil–to regard man as an inhabitant, or a part and parcel of Nature, rather than a
member of society. I wish to make an extreme statement, if so I may make an emphatic one, for there
are enough champions of civilization: the minister and the school committee and every one of you will
take care of that.
I have met with but one or two persons in the course of my life who understood the art of Walking, that
is, of taking walks–who had a genius, so to speak, for SAUNTERING, which word is beautifully derived
“from idle people who roved about the country, in the Middle Ages, and asked charity, under pretense of
going a la Sainte Terre,” to the Holy Land, till the children exclaimed, “There goes a Sainte-Terrer,” a
Saunterer, a Holy-Lander. They who never go to the Holy Land in their walks, as they pretend, are
indeed mere idlers and vagabonds; but they who do go there are saunterers in the good sense, such as I
mean. Some, however, would derive the word from sans terre without land or a home, which, therefore,
in the good sense, will mean, having no particular home, but equally at home everywhere. For this is the
secret of successful sauntering. He who sits still in a house all the time may be the greatest vagrant of all;
but the saunterer, in the good sense, is no more vagrant than the meandering river, which is all the while
sedulously seeking the shortest course to the sea. But I prefer the first, which, indeed, is the most
probable derivation. For every walk is a sort of crusade, preached by some Peter the Hermit in us, to go
forth and reconquer this Holy Land from the hands of the Infidels.
It is true, we are but faint-hearted crusaders, even the walkers, nowadays, who undertake no
persevering, never-ending enterprises. Our expeditions are but tours, and come round again at evening
to the old hearth-side from which we set out. Half the walk is but retracing our steps. We should go forth
on the shortest walk, perchance, in the spirit of undying adventure, never to return– prepared to send back our embalmed
hearts only as relics to our desolate kingdoms. If you are ready to leave father and mother, and brother and sister, and wife
and child and friends, and never see them again–if you have paid your debts, and made your will, and settled all your
affairs, and are a free man–then you are ready for a walk.
To come down to my own experience, my companion and I, for I sometimes have a companion, take pleasure in fancying
ourselves knights of a new, or rather an old, order–not Equestrians or Chevaliers, not Ritters or Riders, but Walkers, a still
more ancient and honorable class, I trust. The Chivalric and heroic spirit which once belonged to the Rider seems now to
reside in, or perchance to have subsided into, the Walker–not the Knight, but Walker, Errant. He is a sort of fourth estate,
outside of Church and State and People.
We have felt that we almost alone hereabouts practiced this noble art; though, to tell the truth, at least if their own
assertions are to be received, most of my townsmen would fain walk sometimes, as I do, but they cannot. No wealth can buy
the requisite leisure, freedom, and independence which are the capital in this profession. It comes only by the grace of God.
It requires a direct dispensation from Heaven to become a walker. You must be born into the family of the Walkers.
Ambulator nascitur, non fit. Some of my townsmen, it is true, can remember and have described to me some walks which
they took ten years ago, in which they were so blessed as to lose themselves for half an hour in the woods; but I know very
well that they have confined themselves to the highway ever since, whatever pretensions they may make to belong to this
select class. No doubt they were elevated for a moment as by the reminiscence of a previous state of existence, when even
they were foresters and outlaws.
“When he came to grene wode, 
In a mery mornynge, 
There he herde the notes small 
Of byrdes mery syngynge. 
“It is ferre gone, sayd Robyn, 
That I was last here; 
Me Lyste a lytell for to shote 
At the donne dere.” 
I think that I cannot preserve my health and spirits, unless I spend four hours a day at least–and it is commonly more than
that–sauntering through the woods and over the hills and fields, absolutely free from all worldly engagements. You may
safely say, A penny for your thoughts, or a thousand pounds. When sometimes I am reminded that the mechanics and
shopkeepers stay in their shops not only all the forenoon, but all the afternoon too, sitting with crossed legs, so many of
them–as if the legs were made to sit upon, and not to stand or walk upon–I think that they deserve some credit for not
having all committed suicide long ago.

I, who cannot stay in my chamber for a single day without acquiring some rust, and when sometimes I have stolen forth for
a walk at the eleventh hour, or four o’clock in the afternoon, too late to redeem the day, when the shades of night were
already beginning to be mingled with the daylight, have felt as if I had committed some sin to be atoned for,–I confess that
I am astonished at the power of endurance, to say nothing of the moral insensibility, of my neighbors who confine
themselves to shops and offices the whole day for weeks and months, aye, and years almost together. I know not what
manner of stuff they are of–sitting there now at three o’clock in the afternoon, as if it were three o’clock in the morning.
Bonaparte may talk of the three-o’clock-in-the-morning courage, but it is nothing to the courage which can sit down
cheerfully at this hour in the afternoon over against one’s self whom you have known all the morning, to starve out a
garrison to whom you are bound by such strong ties of sympathy. I wonder that about this time, or say between four and
five o’clock in the afternoon, too late for the morning papers and too early for the evening ones, there is not a general
explosion heard up and down the street, scattering a legion of antiquated and house-bred notions and whims to the four
winds for an airing-and so the evil cure itself.
How womankind, who are confined to the house still more than men, stand it I do not know; but I have ground to suspect
that most of them do not STAND it at all. When, early in a summer afternoon, we have been shaking the dust of the village
from the skirts of our garments, making haste past those houses with purely Doric or Gothic fronts, which have such an air
of repose about them, my companion whispers that probably about these times their occupants are all gone to bed. Then it
is that I appreciate the beauty and the glory of architecture, which itself never turns in, but forever stands out and erect,
keeping watch over the slumberers.
No doubt temperament, and, above all, age, have a good deal to do with it. As a man grows older, his ability to sit still and
follow indoor occupations increases. He grows vespertinal in his habits as the evening of life approaches, till at last he comes
forth only just before sundown, and gets all the walk that he requires in half an hour.
But the walking of which I speak has nothing in it akin to taking exercise, as it is called, as the sick take medicine at stated
hours–as the Swinging of dumb-bells or chairs; but is itself the enterprise and adventure of the day. If you would get
exercise, go in search of the springs of life. Think of a man’s swinging dumbbells for his health, when those springs are
bubbling up in far-off pastures unsought by him!
Moreover, you must walk like a camel, which is said to be the only beast which ruminates when walking. When a traveler
asked Wordsworth’s servant to show him her master’s study, she answered, “Here is his library, but his study is out of
doors.”
Living much out of doors, in the sun and wind, will no doubt produce a certain roughness of character–will cause a thicker
cuticle to grow over some of the finer qualities of our nature, as on the face and hands, or as severe manual labor robs the
hands of some of their delicacy of touch. So staying in the house, on the other hand, may produce a softness and smoothness,
not to say thinness of skin, accompanied by an increased sensibility to certain impressions. Perhaps we should be more
susceptible to some influences important to our intellectual and moral growth, if the sun had shone and the wind blown on
us a little less; and no doubt it is a nice matter to proportion rightly the thick and thin skin. But methinks that is a scurf that
will fall off fast enough–that the natural remedy is to be found in the proportion which the night bears to the day, the
winter to the summer, thought to experience. There will be so much the more air and sunshine in our thoughts. The callous
palms of the laborer are conversant with finer tissues of self-respect and heroism, whose touch thrills the heart, than the
languid fingers of idleness. That is mere sentimentality that lies abed by day and thinks itself white, far from the tan and
callus of experience.

When we walk, we naturally go to the fields and woods: what would become of us, if we walked only in a garden or a mall?
Even some sects of philosophers have felt the necessity of importing the woods to themselves, since they did not go to the
woods. “They planted groves and walks of Platanes,” where they took subdiales ambulationes in porticos open to the air. Of
course it is of no use to direct our steps to the woods, if they do not carry us thither. I am alarmed when it happens that I
have walked a mile into the woods bodily, without getting there in spirit. In my afternoon walk I would fain forget all my
morning occupations and my obligations to Society. But it sometimes happens that I cannot easily shake off the village. The
thought of some work will run in my head and I am not where my body is–I am out of my senses. In my walks I would fain
return to my senses. What business have I in the woods, if I am thinking of something out of the woods? I suspect myself,
and cannot help a shudder when I find myself so implicated even in what are called good works–for this may sometimes
happen.
My vicinity affords many good walks; and though for so many years I have walked almost every day, and sometimes for
several days together, I have not yet exhausted them. An absolutely new prospect is a great happiness, and I can still get
this any afternoon. Two or three hours’ walking will carry me to as strange a country as I expect ever to see. A single
farmhouse which I had not seen before is sometimes as good as the dominions of the King of Dahomey. There is in fact a sort
of harmony discoverable between the capabilities of the landscape within a circle of ten miles’ radius, or the limits of an
afternoon walk, and the threescore years and ten of human life. It will never become quite familiar to you.
Nowadays almost all man’s improvements, so called, as the building of houses and the cutting down of the forest and of all
large trees, simply deform the landscape, and make it more and more tame and cheap. A people who would begin by
burning the fences and let the forest stand! I saw the fences half consumed, their ends lost in the middle of the prairie, and
some worldly miser with a surveyor looking after his bounds, while heaven had taken place around him, and he did not see
the angels going to and fro, but was looking for an old post-hole in the midst of paradise. I looked again, and saw him
standing in the middle of a boggy Stygian fen, surrounded by devils, and he had found his bounds without a doubt, three
little stones, where a stake had been driven, and looking nearer, I saw that the Prince of Darkness was his surveyor.
I can easily walk ten, fifteen, twenty, any number of miles, commencing at my own door, without going by any house,
without crossing a road except where the fox and the mink do: first along by the river, and then the brook, and then the
meadow and the woodside. There are square miles in my vicinity which have no inhabitant. From many a hill I can see
civilization and the abodes of man afar. The farmers and their works are scarcely more obvious than woodchucks and their
burrows. Man and his affairs, church and state and school, trade and commerce, and manufactures and agriculture even
politics, the most alarming of them all–I am pleased to see how little space they occupy in the landscape. Politics is but a
narrow field, and that still narrower highway yonder leads to it. I sometimes direct the traveler thither. If you would go to
the political world, follow the great road–follow that market-man, keep his dust in your eyes, and it will lead you straight to
it; for it, too, has its place merely, and does not occupy all space. I pass from it as from a bean field into the forest, and it is
forgotten. In one half-hour I can walk off to some portion of the earth’s surface where a man does not stand from one year’s
end to another, and there, consequently, politics are not, for they are but as the cigar-smoke of a man.
The village is the place to which the roads tend, a sort of expansion of the highway, as a lake of a river. It is the body of
which roads are the arms and legs–a trivial or quadrivial place, the thoroughfare and ordinary of travelers. The word is
from the Latin villa which together with via, a way, or more anciently ved and vella, Varro derives from veho, to carry,
because the villa is the place to and from which things are carried. They who got their living by teaming were said
vellaturam facere. Hence, too, the Latin word vilis and our vile, also villain. This suggests what kind of degeneracy villagers
are liable to. They are wayworn by the travel that goes by and over them, without traveling themselves.
Some do not walk at all; others walk in the highways; a few walk across lots. Roads are made for horses and men of
business. I do not travel in them much, comparatively, because I am not in a hurry to get to any tavern or grocery or
livery-stable or depot to which they lead. I am a good horse to travel, but not from choice a roadster. The landscape-painter
uses the figures of men to mark a road. He would not make that use of my figure. I walk out into a nature such as the old
prophets and poets, Menu, Moses, Homer, Chaucer, walked in. You may name it America, but it is not America; neither
Americus Vespueius, nor Columbus, nor the rest were the discoverers of it. There is a truer amount of it in mythology than
in any history of America, so called, that I have seen.

However, there are a few old roads that may be trodden with profit, as if they led somewhere now that they are nearly
discontinued. There is the Old Marlborough Road, which does not go to Marlborough now, me- thinks, unless that is
Marlborough where it carries me. I am the bolder to speak of it here, because I presume that there are one or two such
roads in every town.
THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD 
Where they once dug for money, 
But never found any; 
Where sometimes Martial Miles 
Singly files, 
And Elijah Wood, 
I fear for no good: 
No other man, 
Save Elisha Dugan– 
O man of wild habits, 
Partridges and rabbits 
Who hast no cares 
Only to set snares, 
Who liv’st all alone, 
Close to the bone 
And where life is sweetest 
Constantly eatest. 
When the spring stirs my blood 
With the instinct to travel, 
I can get enough gravel 
On the Old Marlborough Road. 
Nobody repairs it, 
For nobody wears it; 
It is a living way, 
As the Christians say. 
Not many there be 
Who enter therein, 
Only the guests of the 
Irishman Quin. 
What is it, what is it 
But a direction out there, 
And the bare possibility 
Of going somewhere? 
Great guide-boards of stone, 
But travelers none; 
Cenotaphs of the towns 
Named on their crowns. 
It is worth going to see 
Where you MIGHT be. 
What king 
Did the thing, 
I am still wondering; 
Set up how or when, 
By what selectmen, 
Gourgas or Lee, 
Clark or Darby? 
They’re a great endeavor 
To be something forever; 
Blank tablets of stone, 
Where a traveler might groan, 
And in one sentence 
Grave all that is known 
Which another might read, 
In his extreme need. 
I know one or two 
Lines that would do, 
Literature that might stand 
All over the land 
Which a man could remember 
Till next December, 
And read again in the spring, 
After the thawing. 
If with fancy unfurled 
You leave your abode, 
You may go round the world 
By the Old Marlborough Road. 
At present, in this vicinity, the best part of the land is not private property; the landscape is not owned, and the walker
enjoys comparative freedom. But possibly the day will come when it will be partitioned off into so-called pleasure-grounds,
in which a few will take a narrow and exclusive pleasure only–when fences shall be multiplied, and man-traps and other
engines invented to confine men to the PUBLIC road, and walking over the surface of God’s earth shall be construed to
mean trespassing on some gentleman’s grounds. To enjoy a thing exclusively is commonly to exclude yourself from the true
enjoyment of it. Let us improve our opportunities, then, before the evil days come.

What is it that makes it so hard sometimes to determine whither we will walk? I believe that there is a subtle magnetism in
Nature, which, if we unconsciously yield to it, will direct us aright. It is not indifferent to us which way we walk. There is a
right way; but we are very liable from heedlessness and stupidity to take the wrong one. We would fain take that walk,
never yet taken by us through this actual world, which is perfectly symbolical of the path which we love to travel in the
interior and ideal world; and sometimes, no doubt, we find it difficult to choose our direction, because it does not yet exist
distinctly in our idea.
When I go out of the house for a walk, uncertain as yet whither I will bend my steps, and submit myself to my instinct to
decide for me, I find, strange and whimsical as it may seem, that I finally and inevitably settle southwest, toward some
particular wood or meadow or deserted pasture or hill in that direction. My needle is slow to settle,–varies a few degrees,
and does not always point due southwest, it is true, and it has good authority for this variation, but it always settles between
west and south-southwest. The future lies that way to me, and the earth seems more unexhausted and richer on that side.
The outline which would bound my walks would be, not a circle, but a parabola, or rather like one of those cometary orbits
which have been thought to be non-returning curves, in this case opening westward, in which my house occupies the place
of the sun. I turn round and round irresolute sometimes for a quarter of an hour, until I decide, for a thousandth time, that I
will walk into the southwest or west. Eastward I go only by force; but westward I go free. Thither no business leads me. It is
hard for me to believe that I shall find fair landscapes or sufficient wildness and freedom behind the eastern horizon. I am
not excited by the prospect of a walk thither; but I believe that the forest which I see in the western horizon stretches
uninterruptedly toward the setting sun, and there are no towns nor cities in it of enough consequence to disturb me. Let me
live where I will, on this side is the city, on that the wilderness, and ever I am leaving the city more and more, and
withdrawing into the wilderness. I should not lay so much stress on this fact, if I did not believe that something like this is
the prevailing tendency of my countrymen. I must walk toward Oregon, and not toward Europe. And that way the nation is
moving, and I may say that mankind progress from east to west. Within a few years we have witnessed the phenomenon of
a southeastward migration, in the settlement of Australia; but this affects us as a retrograde movement, and, judging from
the moral and physical character of the first generation of Australians, has not yet proved a successful experiment. The
eastern Tartars think that there is nothing west beyond Thibet. “The world ends there,” say they; “beyond there is nothing
but a shoreless sea.” It is unmitigated East where they live.
We go eastward to realize history and study the works of art and literature, retracing the steps of the race; we go westward
as into the future, with a spirit of enterprise and adventure. The Atlantic is a Lethean stream, in our passage over which we
have had an opportunity to forget the Old World and its institutions. If we do not succeed this time, there is perhaps one
more chance for the race left before it arrives on the banks of the Styx; and that is in the Lethe of the Pacific, which is three
times as wide.
I know not how significant it is, or how far it is an evidence of singularity, that an individual should thus consent in his
pettiest walk with the general movement of the race; but I know that something akin to the migratory instinct in birds and
quadrupeds–which, in some instances, is known to have affected the squirrel tribe, impelling them to a general and
mysterious movement, in which they were seen, say some, crossing the broadest rivers, each on its particular chip, with its
tail raised for a sail, and bridging narrower streams with their dead–that something like the furor which affects the
domestic cattle in the spring, and which is referred to a worm in their tails,–affects both nations and individuals, either
perennially or from time to time. Not a flock of wild geese cackles over our town, but it to some extent unsettles the value of
real estate here, and, if I were a broker, I should probably take that disturbance into account.
“Than longen folk to gon on pilgrimages, 
And palmeres for to seken strange strondes.”

Every sunset which I witness inspires me with the desire to go to a West as distant and as fair as that into which the sun
goes down. He appears to migrate westward daily, and tempt us to follow him. He is the Great Western Pioneer whom the
nations follow. We dream all night of those mountain-ridges in the horizon, though they may be of vapor only, which were
last gilded by his rays. The island of Atlantis, and the islands and gardens of the Hesperides, a sort of terrestrial paradise,
appear to have been the Great West of the ancients, enveloped in mystery and poetry. Who has not seen in imagination,
when looking into the sunset sky, the gardens of the Hesperides, and the foundation of all those fables?
Columbus felt the westward tendency more strongly than any before. He obeyed it, and found a New World for Castile and
Leon. The herd of men in those days scented fresh pastures from afar,
“And now the sun had stretched out all the hills, 
And now was dropped into the western bay; 
At last HE rose, and twitched his mantle blue; 
Tomorrow to fresh woods and pastures new.” 
Where on the globe can there be found an area of equal extent with that occupied by the bulk of our States, so fertile and so
rich and varied in its productions, and at the same time so habitable by the European, as this is? Michaux, who knew but
part of them, says that “the species of large trees are much more numerous in North America than in Europe; in the United
States there are more than one hundred and forty species that exceed thirty feet in height; in France there are but thirty
that attain this size.” Later botanists more than confirm his observations. Humboldt came to America to realize his youthful
dreams of a tropical vegetation, and he beheld it in its greatest perfection in the primitive forests of the Amazon, the most
gigantic wilderness on the earth, which he has so eloquently described. The geographer Guyot, himself a European, goes
farther–farther than I am ready to follow him; yet not when he says: “As the plant is made for the animal, as the vegetable
world is made for the animal world, America is made for the man of the Old World…. The man of the Old World sets out
upon his way. Leaving the highlands of Asia, he descends from station to station towards Europe. Each of his steps is
marked by a new civilization superior to the preceding, by a greater power of development. Arrived at the Atlantic, he
pauses on the shore of this unknown ocean, the bounds of which he knows not, and turns upon his footprints for an instant.”

When I was nineteen, I moved to Tennessee from the Chicagoland area.  A few months later, I returned to visit my friends and family.  Upon arriving, I noticed that the way people acted towards me, the way I acted towards them, and even the familiar surroundings, made me feel uncomfortable. 
The first thing said to me by a friend was,  Heh der boy!  Yous bes a suddern boy yet?  That was followed up by more rebel speak.  Nearly every person I knew made some comment towards an accent that I lacked.  Each word I spoke was analyzed for some foreign drawl that I might have contracted from my new home.  Every tiny syllable was scrutinized in their search for an accent deviation.  This aural inspection left me speechless and terribly weary of my visit.
Everyone expected me to behave different.  I was frequently asked, Is this how you do this down there? and, Done any coon huntin yet? I tried to tell them that its not really what it is like down there, but they had heard too many atrocity stories to be thrilled by actualities.(Hemingway 146)   I knew they thought they were just joking with me.  But how funny is a redneck joke when youve heard it for the fifth time that hour?
I was looked upon differently too.  In their eyes, I should be wearing those long, floppy overalls with that pale straw hat.  Even they had never seen me in either of those, they still could not picture me without them.
During the first three months I lived in Tennessee, in the minds of my friends and family, I had changed.
To be fair though, I felt that they too, had changed.
After enduring comment after comment, I ran off to some silent, lonely corner so I could sort out my feelings.  I was livid.  How could these people, who I thought knew me and I thought I knew, assume such superfluous things about me?  How could I change so much in the course of three months?  How could they?
It was at that moment when I became bitter.  Upset over their comments, I began to over-analyze them.  In my head, I listed what was different about them and what they had done since I was gone.  What they did without me, in spite of me.
I became jealous over their lives.  I wanted to be with them when they went out.  I wanted to be the with the scissors when they got their haircuts.  I wanted to be the third wheel on their dates.  I was angered that their lives had continued in my absence.  I felt cheated.
I began looking for something that hadnt changed.  I was amazed to find that a lot of things can happen in a three-month span.  A street corner, where a cornfield used to reside, was now a Harley Davidson Dealer.  The Rosemount Horizon, where I once saw Garth Brooks, was now the Allstate Arena.  The woods, where I was anyone and anything I wanted to be, was now a bank.  The house, which I helped paint red and spent the majority of my life in, was now brown.  All these changes, big or small, gnawed at my memories and hacked at my desire for nothing to change.
But not everything had changed.  The feelings I got sometimes when being at a certain place were still there.  Driving by Solider Field on Lakeshore Drive still filled me with a sense of joy and wonder.  I still felt so wonderfully small and insignificant when I stared up towards the Sears Tower.  I still felt wary and excited when I walked upon Bachelors Groves hallowed grounds.  Yet at all these places, something was missing.  
Nearly every feeling I had ever felt anywhere derived from whom ever I was with.  Ever memory I have of any place Ive been, there has been a friend or family member with me.  For every tear I shed and for every laughed I laughed, there was someone there to share with.  The feelings I received from these places were not because I was there.  I felt those feelings because who I was with.
Change is a constant.  It will always happen and everything eventually changes.  When I moved from the only place I had ever known, everything did.  It was not the changes that made me feel uncomfortable.  It was my refusal to accept them.  Nothing lasts forever, except our memories.

~the greatest thing to learn is to love and to be loved in return~
Why is it
that the most
poignant of loves
are sealed in sadness
but filled with happiness
Is love a dish
best served tragic
The nature of love
is a deep
and winding thing
That no one person can discern
and noone can agree on
Alien to the
naturalities
of the world
driven on practicality
and need
love does not provide food
love does not reproduce
love may aid these things
but it is not required
Superfluos
love
filled with deep reds
and fanciful joy
A doubled-edged sword of
desire
laced in the blackest dreams of the heart
Where all good things die
in a constant cycle of unrequited moments
How can a petty thing
as love
Exist.
~come what may~
Such a quandery is lost in a moment
of reconigtion
that Love is that aspiration
that is set forth to be
the one constant in life
When the music and the dancing
and all the things
that don’t really pertain to it
Do pertain to love
And the smiles and the cheers
and the sweet talk
It all dwindles down to this one moment
where a call and answer
of
I Love You
echoes
resonds in the halls of eternity
For this single instance
in the endless scheme of things
One light is forever merged with another
and the combined
shine forth upon the night
Willfully
and wishfully
answering the call
the stars made eons ago
Knowing that the lesson will last that long
and the memory longer
Be it pointless
Be it
unpractical
But beyond the needs of survival
beyond the needs of a higher power
Beyond it all
There is Love
Like small tragic 
symphonies of exhaulted joy
It explodes and surges through every fiber and thread of existence.
We exist for Love
Love is existence
If but for a moment that love briefly
touches
and moves away
The memory of it lasts
and the glow of rememberance shines past the night
and still shines to the stars
Love isn’t contained by tragedy
Love is tempered by it.
A simple reason to be
and a simple answer to it all
Love.

funny how
I cannot
escape the anger
I have sometimes
It’s not a fiery rage

brooding storm of distaste
It’s more of
a 
cynical
patronizing smoldering
when I laugh at it
hoping to shoot out
and cling to the flesh
and tear
..
I suppose there will
never be the ending there should to this
There is too much bitterness
Sometimes
when you’ve gone so long
holding back
the slightest discomfort
when your life is winding down
you are felt
you are owed something
And that slight discomfort becomes
a chasm of untolerable
bullshit
that you cannot 
not
obsess over.
I can sit here and imagine
the quiet wishings
for a quiet dinner
knowing that
is asking too much
And
yes
I will echo her anger
It does hurt
but
inside
I will stifle my own anguish
Over a broken sisterhood
and
alone
in the indifferently
caring night
I will lucidly
stare out the window
at the unnatural light
and shed
some unshedded tears
crying softly in my dreams
over a broken family

in northern wisconsin
I have not changed any names or facts in these emails
My uncle is mentioned several times in these emails
for he is a 3rd head in this 3 headed affair
There is about a years worth
of BS on both sides that lead up to this
which climaxed in my mother and my uncle’s victory
in a wisconsin state court last month.
It would be impossible for me to bring you 
up to date with all that happened and I hope you can all
deduce somethings.
There are several mentions of “lying and slander” in these emails..
this is referring to missing funds
of my mother and my uncle that my aunt was in charge of
There is no conclusive evidence either way.
there seems to be a missing email from my mother to my aunt in which my aunt refers to things in her last email that do not appear in my mother’s emails
So I assume another was sent.
Please Remember that I have noones permission to post this
Even more so
I have noones permission to read them either.
I am just an interested party
that happens to know
his mother’s password

Sunday, March 10, 2002 Ross – I know that I received a letter from you. Picked it up at the PO as it wasn’t getting delivered to the house yet. Stayed in the car for awhile, and now I can’t find it. I do remember that you asked me to email you. The last word that I received regarding BL was that you agreed to the realtor listing of the property, and the new agreement (that I had on the table on 2/18) was altered from 6 mos to 3 mos, beginning 3/15, as per your request. Because of the seasonal nature of the use of our property, a 6 month agreement is usual and customary up North. A 3 month contract is U&C for more urban areas. I will lift the email receipt restriction as long as your communications to me stay civil. Your last email to me was an impulsive verbal lashing out that made no sense in addition to the innappropriate language. Not that you care, but I have been under extreme pressures for the past year and I do not need to read these types of emails from you and Jil. I reasoned that if you both had to go back to using “snail mail”, then you might reread your letters to me and rethink any nastiness therein. Email is used by me to facilitate business and stay in touch with people, not to send electronic nastiness. If I receive another such email from you, I will again block your email address — permanently. I remember that you lamented the using of lawyers and, therefore, having to pay them to communicate with me. No one forced you to do that. I did not block your telephone or the U.S. mail. You chose not to contact me. Those expenses were your choices. You have not only caused yourself (and Jil, I assume) additional expenses, but you have caused me more $. You have also caused the Estate unnecessary expenses. You have done this by your lack of communication and cooperation with me. I now remember your saying something about not dealing with the past, and concentrating on the present. I agree with you — however, the past can be a learning tool. Our past should be a lesson that making decisions based on anger do not usually yield good outcomes. I was ready to close the WI estate years ago, but every time I discussed this with you, you encouraged me to stop or warned me of how the lawyers will get rich on us. Do you remember your words to me: “Those cats (lawyers) get fat on uncooperativeness . . . “Can you put Buffalo Lake on the back burner for now . . . “Can you and Ken shelve the BL situation for now . . . “When the Kerekes family sells their property, we should rethink whether to keep our property . . . “Common sense says that we should dump the place . . . “Spending more than a few days at BL would be like going to a nursing home (referring to how boring it would be) . . . No, I don’t have such a fantastic memory — I just have all your letters. Also, I have from you the following: “Thank you for all the work you’ve done . . . “Your method of managing the funds is very appropriate . . . From Jil I have: “In your wisdom you set up the funds . . . “Ross and I trust you to continue to pay the taxes and insurance . . . What I DO NOT and NEVER have received from either you or Jil is any questions regarding my management of the funds.

You and Jil have given me ‘cart blanche’ since 1987, to move funds around seeking the highest possible interest. This I have done FOR YOU BOTH gratis. Do you even realize that the principal of those “set aside funds” was gone a long time ago. These funds were never a “Nest Egg” as you called them. The principal was not protected. Utilities were paid out of them until 1995 (nine years). You and Jil did not agree to make yearly deposits into this Buffalo Lake Fund, as I suggested back in 1987, to protect the principal investment. In order to earn a decent interest rate, I had to change the CD term from 3 and 6 months to 12 months (to earn the APY). The result of doing that was that our joint funds were not available to pay the taxes and insurance. Quite often I had to pay them out of my own pocket and then try to remember to pay me back. If I was in FL when a bill came in the mail and I left the BL checkbook in IL, I had to pay it out of my own pocket also. In Jan, 2001, I reinvested our funds in MBNA, the only financial institution I could find that would pay a good interest rate on our tiny principal left. Other places require a minimum of $15,000 or $25,000, and only were paying around 5%. For our small principal, we could have only gotten 3% locally. Because of Ken’s membership in NEA, we can get the highest rates (close to 8%) available with a minimum investment of $1000. So that’s what I did. THAT’S WHAT I TOLD YOU THAT MONTH — we talked of this on the phone. You did not object. Times change and the nature of our BL fund had to change as well. I told you (1/2001) that the next two years were going to be ones of legal and other expenses. The new CD’s were “In Trust For C. Ross Reinhold, Jil M. Smith, and Lori M. Kempton”, in the event of our deaths. As they have matured, I have deposited the funds into the checking account to pay the expenses — which include monies owed me. . . real estate taxes, insurance bills for two years, legal fees to transfer title or open probate (whichever method was decided by your actions), new roof,etc. We have about $5700 left (total). I asked you and Jil to contact me if you wanted to keep the property/buy my share. YOU DID NOT CONTACT ME. I told you both in the letters that if I didn’t have confirmation of your plans to buy my share, I would have to open Probate to close the estate. You both had refused to agree to sell the property, therefore I HAD to open Probate. You’ve had 10 years to prepare for this financially, and almost two month’s notification prior to the June 1, 2001 deadline given you. There were only two options: (1) Buy Nona out or (2) Sell the property. Since you refused both, opening Probate was indicated. YOU AND JIL MADE THE DECISION TO OPEN THE PROBATE CASE. The costs for doing this, according to Mom’s Will, were to be borne by the estate funds. These costs are estate expenses. I should not even be talking to you for the way you slandered me to the Court of Wisconsin. You and Jil lied. And you knew the real truth. You might have kept the truth from Jil so she could make an honest testimony. You and Jil never complained about the way I took care of all the IL business. I sent you a letter in November, 1987, telling you that all business had been concluded save a hospital bill from FL. When I had proof that we owed no money on that bill, I gave it to the lawyer. We all assumed that this lawyer finished his job. It came as a shock to us all that the JR Probate Case in IL was still open in 1993. I did not receive a Court citation. I did not receive a Court reprimand. I did not receive a Court penalty/fine. The lawyer was found “at fault” — ROSS, YOU AND JIL KNEW THIS AND YOU BOTH PURPOSELY MISREPRESENTED THE FACTS TO YOUR LAWYER.You have treated me in a despicable manner. One year ago this month I began the process of closing the JR Est. in WI. I informed you via certified mail three times! I was following the directive of our mother, as I did in Illinois. Ross, you don’t need your individual lawyer — you never have needed one. All you needed to do was to communicate with me directly. Now, because of your “victory” in court, selling our property will cost us more. No inspections would have been needed if the property had been in an Estate (that was in the original RE agreement). Now, we must make a statement to the condition of the cabin, and usually the buyer has an inspection done. The results of that inspection usually end up as buyer credits which come after the agent’s fee is calculated. We may have to concede money for needed repairs. If you and Jil had not contested my appointment, I would have done just as I had done in IL. Why didn’t you just ask me about the administrator’s fee business? I took none in IL, and you knew that. That fee business was just “padding” to your slanderous allegations. CALLING ME A THIEF!!!! Shame on you and Jil. Who do you think has paid the bills????

I will send you a list of the bills I’ve paid, but it will have to wait until another morning when I wake up early. We have been working extremely hard with unpacking and getting the landscaping done. This planting and all had to be done right away, according to our homeowner association rules. I’ve not been having an easy time of it with my OA, and my operative hip slips out of the socket when I bend too much. I’m back to using my dressing tools, trying to follow my post-surgical rules, icing my hip and taking extra anti-inflammatories. Not that you care. Also, my operative leg is numb from the knee down. I need to get to a doctor, but there’s too much work here to do. Also, a 6 week wait to see someone. Ross, please just cooperate with Tri-R Realty. They’ve been extremely active all winter long, and we’ve met with Mary Reinemann. She’s the broker and owns the realty. Very personable, very respectful, very tactful. She’s a good representative for us. Several other realtors have been and are in contact with her regarding our property. One more thing: Before we left OP, Kim Zach called me. His uncle, whom he says is wealthy, is looking for a place on BL. Kim said our price was too high for him, but that his uncle will be very interested. You have to know that they would be at any auction. I think Kim thought that I did not know the value of our property and that he could get it for a song. I could tell by his voice that he was disappointed. I may not have said things in this email that you have liked, but I have not called you names either directly or by using analogies. Therefore, please show respect with your response, if you have one. I have always been honest and forthright with you and Jil. Thank you. Nona cc: Don Smith (I deleted Jil’s email and am not sure of her email address)

I don’t know if this is going to get to you, but this is my response that probably won’t be received well by you anyway. I have kind of given up…you seem to read into all that I say, and somehow read me “name-calling” you. I, like you claim for yourself, have only meant to be honest and forthright with every message I have ever written you, snailmail or high tech. I speak only for myself. I am not going to argue with you over this past year or this past decade of events on who said what, or who did or didn’t do this, or whether I did or didn’t ever inquire about the CD money. I have tried to convey to you that I wanted to trust you all these years. Had you been an attorney assigned by our mother’s estate to administer to the distribution and disposition of the monies, I would have demanded a regular accounting of how the CD balances were effected (photocopied receipts of payments made, and copies of the monthly or quarterly statements). I didn’t demand these from you, but I did suggest an interest in knowing. And so, now it is painfully obvious to you that both Ross and I would like verification for the money as of January 2001 to-date. This request shouldn’t be met with anger or resistance. We have the right to have this verification, and I am frustrated at your reaction to our request.
This past year has been like a storm for us all. The storm is settling down, where it has left a litter of ill feelings, but the sun is coming out. I haven’t talked with Ross since your latest email you have just sent him (and Don), but I am guessing he will still be game to cooperate in putting the property up for sale. Nona, neither Ross and I really want to lose this family property, but well, this storm has gone on long enough…and now, feeling a bit bruised from its assault, I am willing to enter into a real estate agreement with a realtor of our choice, and let fate unfold what will happen. If Ross somehow materializes a buyer for your share, and thus rescuing the property from leaving the Reinhold Clan, then so be it. 
I wish your recovery was better. My knee operation left me with months and months of recovery. My big toe was numb for several months, and I was told that it was perfectly normal. To this day, 15 months later, the toe is still a bit numb. I have had a relapse too, just from one night of dancing, that has thrown me back to hobbling. I am looking forward to the summer weather and swimming to get my legs working again. Surprisingly the waters of the Tennessee River where it converges with the Clinch and Emory are very warm. We are very near one TVA site that emits heat into the waters. Water therapy seems to have been my best recovery method. I will hope you will have better success with your recovery. I can only imagine your discomfort. 
Please attempt to accommodate Ross and my desires to have an accounting of the money. With your accusations of claiming us to be liars (hmmm. To say we are lying is to say we are liars, yes? That is name-calling, isn’t it? hmmm.), doesn’t work. That may be how you feel, but I happen not to agree with you. We only claimed what we believed were true. Your truth is obviously different! And if we three are to move forward and resolve this matter, you need to put away your threats and accusations. I will not tolerate being treated as a child when you command what form of communciaton I am to use. Email is convenient, it is the most reasonably priced, and more importantly, it is the fastest mode whether it be for personal or business use. If you choose to block me again, I will take that as a clear indication of your resolve NOT to cooperate with us. I would hope, also, that you give Ross the fair attention he deserves. He has laid on the table a nice package for how we might proceed. I am game to cooperate, and I will hope you are too – since, it was your goal all along to sell. -jil

1. I never said you called me any names, Jil. Ross did. My email was to him. 2. You have written in letters that you trusted me to do “my job” as the administrator (only it wasn’t my job; it was a favor I did for you and Ross). 3. Not once in these letters (1987 to 2001) have you ever asked for financial accountings. >>”This request shouldn’t be met with anger or resistance. We have the right to have this verification, and I am frustrated at your reaction to our request. 4. I do not know how you have construed anger or resistance on my part about your request for a financial accounting for 2001. I have no problem with doing this for you as there’s nothing to hide. It will just take some time. I had all the documentation with me in Court on the 18th of Feb, but I wasn’t even allowed to speak. Ross could have asked me to show it to him when we met afterwards, but he didn’t. I will prepare a statement and get it to you as soon as I can. MY “REACTION” TO YOUR REQUEST WAS . . . Okay, as soon as I can. Does that sound like anger or resistance? 5. I sent Don the copy of Ross’ email because I wasn’t sure of your address. If you prefer that I not send copies to you, just say so. 6. I did not call you a liar. Ross knew how and where I invested our money. If you truly did not know this information, then he withheld it from you so that you could make an honest testimony. If you knew, then you did lie to your lawyer and the Court. 7. Whether I receive email from you or not is absolutely no indication of my willingness to cooperate with you and Ross. You have a sharp tongue and a sharp pen, Jil. If you have to address an envelop and put one of those pricey 34 cent stamps on a letter, you are slowed down a bit. Perhaps you might rethink the words you send to me. I’m not treating you like a child. I am protecting myself from your hastily sent, emotionally-laden, words. 8. Ross has not laid any “nice package” on any table for me to see. I don’t know to what you are referring. 9. My goal all along was to sell MY INTEREST IN THE WISCONSIN PROPERTY. Period. You and Ross have had 10 years to plan for this. When you sold your IL house and bought a new one in TN, did you even consider this? You have never, ever indicated that you would buy my share sometime in the future. I don’t fault you this. Ross has stated directly and inferred that eventually the property would have to be sold. This is not my “good memory” at work here. I have letters from him wherein he writes these things to me. When push came to shove, he (and you) decided to put up the wall between us and stop the communication. Not me. You and Ross. You both used me to take care of things financial. I trusted that you both were taking care of the cabin. Well, I did my part. Did you do yours? In August 2000, when you returned from BL, you cried on the phone to me how upset you and Don were because Ross never listens to you. . . that he’s always got the final word. That’s the way things are in his world. I sat in your livingroom, and your son was right there echoing his frustration with what his uncle’s family can do, but not his. Don was willing to get the roof job done, but Ross wasn’t. When Ross and Jo came by the cabin when we were up there, Ken convinced him the job needed to be done asap. On Labor Day weekend, when Ross, Ken, and I were on the phone, the men were talking about the roof job. Ross asked the reason for doing the job — was it so we could sell the place. Ken responded that the reason doesn’t matter . . . that in any case, it had to be repaired and soon. When Ken and I went up there to get the job done, by the way, the tarpaper that Don had tacked down over the leaking areas was torn and blown up and away from the roof already. If Ken had not worked like he did to get the job done, the framework of the cabin would have been exposed to the elements. One question: Did you all repair the eaves and the plywood last August like you all said you would do? It was stated in the assessment of 5/01, as something needing repair. Ross got a copy of this. Jil: If you want me to receive your emails directly, I will remove the block again. However, you are going to have to try harder to limit your communications to facts, not emotionally-charged allegations and not inferences that you make based on facts that I send you. Also, I refuse to discuss past family issues. They’re dead. When all this is over, I’m going to burn all the letters from you and Ross. Right now they are evidentiary materials that back up the statements I’ve made. No court in their right mind would want to read all that crap. If you persist in making allegations and being so darned defensive, I’ll block your email again, and it will be done permanently this time. Please don’t bother commenting about my health situation because I do not believe you care one hoot about it. In fact, I don’t know why you would want to email me. You have always disliked me, Jil, so let’s not pretend anything different. Since I got your email forwarded from Ross, I still am not sure of your current email address. You were using earthlink at one time. So I am sending a copy to Don’s mailbox, too. Don’t be offended.

Ross and Jil:
I have removed the email blocks from your addresses tentatively.
You are not responsible for the content of each other’s emails; therefore, do 
not forward on each other’s messages to me in the future.
If I find the content of your emails inappropriate, I promise you that I will 
re-block this method of communication again.  You’ll then have to use the 
U.S.P.O.  for future mail.  So, re-read your messages to me, and, perhaps, 
let your spouses read them also prior to sending them to me.  Ken reads mine 
prior to sending them to you.
Should I block one of your email addresses and you persist in forwarding 
messages (either as a forwarded message or copied into your email), I will 
block the address  of the sender of the forwarded message.  Got that?  
I would like to keep this line of communication open.  No need to lecture me 
on the benefits of it.  It is wonderful to have this technology, but 
responsibility is needed.  Do not use it for sending nasty comments any 
further.  Use it for discussing business with me.  If you have no business 
with me, don’t email me.
You’ve both ruined our relationship, and you don’t care about me personally.  
You teamed up against me, slandering me.  So please don’t feign an interest 
in me or my family.  If you’re interested in the girls, write, call or email 
them directly.  Thank you.
My printer got jammed in FL when I was printing up all those papers you made 
me write.  I had to borrow a friend’s printer to finish the job.  Ken worked 
on it a bit, but I haven’t tried it yet.  All my BL financial records are on 
a zip disk, so do you want me to email the financial info to you?  It might 
be awhile before I can print it up to mail to you.  Are you still retaining 
an independent lawyer?  Should he be receiving a copy?

There was a boy 
A very strange enchanted boy 
They say he wandered very far, very far 
Over land and sea 
A little shy and sad of eye 
But very wise was he 
And then one day 
One magic day he passed my way 
And while we spoke of many things 
Fools and kings 
This he said to me 
“The greatest thing you’ll ever learn 
Is just to love and be loved in return”

I think it
was my first
true experience
in loss…
Despite my few months
of preparation
I wasn’t ready when it happened
When I came home
and saw…
I couldn’t go and be there
for the procedure
Looking back
I think I regret that
I should have been there
I remember running to the basement
not caring about the dust
the cob webs
the spiders
The usual things that 
prevented me from going there
I delved into them
allowing them to blanket me
hoping
that
my fear of them
could overcome
that huge hollow lump
of
shock and remorse
Anything to stop those tears
the screams
I think that was the first time
I clutched my face 
as to soothe some
deep-seeded thought
I still do it now
a somber reminder.
A small time after
I remember my father came down
He didn’t say anything
he just put his hand on my shoulder
and left it there.
He must have stood there for over an hour
just
letting me cry
I eventually crawled out of the basement
and my parents
feeling obligated to do
anything to make me feel better
took me out to this quaint little
burrito resturant that closed the next week
…
I don’t remember that night
and I guess it’s better that way
I can’t imagine I got any sleep.
The next day at school
I was ok for the most part
I didn’t really talk
I didn’t really have to
I knew if I did…
it would have been heard in my voice
I would have heard it
and the tears would have come again
I really didn’t want to be there
I felt like I shouldn’t have been
but
it wasn’t and acceptable excuse for my mom
so
to school I went
It was in band where I lost it.
We were learning amazing grace…
I learned Amazing Grace that day
In the bathroom
in a stall
open to whoever wandered in
watching my heart
leak out my eyes
and drip onto the floor
Someone comforted me in there
I forgot his name
but he was there
telling me it was alright
He didn’t even know what was wrong
but he was there
just the same.
He never asked
I never thanked him
I regret that too
Time went on
as it always does
and eventually
the pain faded
and I laid the memory to rest
at the cabin that summer
At a base of a tree
I buried it
seperated from the world
by a fanatsy
esque
I was content to let it rest there.
And I never thought more
than I passing image of my drifting away in
a sinfully red canoe
And today
after stepping outside
searching for some inspiration
in the sky
or on the ground
The memory came back to me
And I feel at a loss
all over again

thing I had ever done
It wasn’t how I wanted it to be
Filled with missed notes
and disgraceful tuning
The tone was awful

inconsistent
But
Damn it
I played
I got up
in my weakness
In my sorrow
In my apathetic patheticness
and fucking played
It didn’t have to be perfect
It didn’t have to even
be good
With the rain as my metronome
and the lightning my
discant
I played a melody
of my heart
To the storm
and to those
who I try not to forget
The things I never said
are in those notes
And the savage chaos
took my song
and made it
it’s own
Leaving me behind
shirtless
and gasping for breath
staring at my
distorted
and inverted reflection
in the tarnished silver

images last night
And your face
was most preminant

was it the “x” acting

should answer that for me
You just don’t seem to give a fuck
but
…
thinking more
I ask if you changed..but
I really don’t think you did
I did
I abandoned you
In school
I went away
you stayed home
I ditched class
You got high
It was before that too..
She..
I couldn’t hang out with you
like we used to
because of her
I was such a fool then
I’m sorry for that
And then
when I came back from school
Who was there?
You were
And then…just
as things were like they used to be
I up and left again.
Fuck man…
I can look back
and think
that perhaps if
I had not ditched you
Would things be any different now?
To the night
and to the wind
It’s all the same
Blessed be
I heard you say once
And I’d like to think
it wasn’t the weed talking
…
Who knows
In two weeks time
We’ll be hanging
and chilling like before
and erase my doubt
I still worry sometimes
I’m sorry for not
being
there.

nothing seems real
when realism is taken as it is
The things we beleive
and the thing we say we do
sometimes are different
Life seems empty 
when a driving intelligent force
is removed from it
What would the point be?
Just to exist
for the sake of it
I read somewhere that chaos is an illusion
that everything is done in patterns
and it’s just the simple looking at the complex
Patterns may be the paper
but chaos is the pen
The words that come forth maybe a result of
an etertnity of a second deliberation
But the conception is random
Feelings may be just hormonal spurts
But the concept is chaotic
over chaos is order
and over order is chaos again
and endless loop
ouroborus
It all comes down to that in the end
A perfect circle that is neither chaotic
or orderly
just…existing
And that is the key
Existence is what matters
Let chaos and order fight it out the rest of the way

I find myself sitting here
listening to a emilyesque melody
and I find myself thinking of you
This in itself isn’t very odd
since I find myself there
often
There are times though
that I feel that you should know this
that somewhere east
you are on someone’s mind
What you are doing
what you are saying
what you are thinking
what you are feeling
it all dwells in my head 
and in my heart
I find your name 
on my tongue
soundlessly speaking in 
constant repetition
slowly hammering inside my daily functions
forming a temple of one-syllabled solice
in my mind
My eyes and ears are accustomed now to alert me
when something reminds me of you
however vauge
And this time of year
your name gets thrown around lots
I know they aren’t refering to you
But each mention
dives me into a million tangent thoughts
of you
combining together in some radiant expression
of sheer joy and wonder and awe
I’m lucky to have these thoughts
I’m honoured to have you grace my mind
I’m happy to see you in my head
I’m thinking of you
And I just thought I should
let you know

The cloistered grey
isn’t so bad
There’s more to life
than sunshine
mist
rain
and birds
there are the mice
in their huddled masses
within the walls
There are the ants
cleaning up my messes
with methodic exhuberance
And there are the roaches
who exist
and that in itself
is something
The cockroach doesn’t get much adoration
or respect
does it?
Why?
Insects get such a bad reputation
for adapting
they one thing man has yet to dominate
We can eliminate every other living thing on this 
planet
if we wanted to
But the insect
It will always survive
And if there is any justice
Insects will be here long after we are gone.
Disgressing back
Why is the cockroach hated
Because it lives so well in our presence?
Because it can reproduce so easily
because it reminds us of ourselves?

There is something inside the grey
maybe not pretty
but it’s something
I need to learn 
to be not so

it’s weird
my mother raised me to be an 
atheist
she told me reasons
why there wasn’t a god
and this
and that
And it all made sense in my head
and it still does
She raised all of us like that
While most children were
learning about Adam and Eve
my sisters and I
were learning about the dinosaurs
And now
I find myself in reasons
of my own
of why this
and of why that
But I know enough
to say
I don’t know
I know me
somewhat
and that should be enough
and it is
I no longer consider myself
an atheist
I am by no means christian
or jewish
or islam
or neo-pagan
I am me
I am not a religious person
I am a spiritual one
I’ll worry about the soul
not where it is going
but that is just me
I think most people
would classify me as agnostic
but that doesn’t apply either
I believe in magick
and I believe in things that
the eyes cannot see
I believe in the power of
perception
and that free will
and self-awareness
are key components to everything
and
I believe in love
as silly as it is
I believe in it
And I believe that I am a fool
the fool..if you will
I believe that each person has a right to 
believe in what they believe in
for them
it is true
What you think
and what you feel
are really the only things
you have control over
God, Allah, The many pantheon of Gods and Goddesses
They’re all inside
inside your heart
and inside your mind
I could never say they do not exist
Existence is a tricky thing
If someone believes
they do
atleast in their own head
And that is enough.
But that’s not what is weird
It is weird that I was raised an atheist for
all the “right”
reasons
By my mother
who was an atheist
because she was angry
that her mother died.
It’s just odd
And now
she’s gone back
And now that my sister’s are married and what not
they’ve gone back
I’m the only one left
It’s weird
But to each their own
Just because they are clouds
that doesnt mean that
the little white rabbit
you see in them
isn’t there.

and feed the ducks

there were deer there too
It couldn’t have meant much more than that for me

I never knew her husband
She was buried next to him

reading a whale picture book that
someone had bought for me 
~i can remember the book, but not 
her face~
i’m sure i cried
but i’m sure i didn’t cry for her

It was easy to cry then
I cried because everyone else was.
She was buried in the rain
I had to sit in the car
while they huddled over her
casket
I think it was white
yes..
it was

and then we left
I wanted to see them lower her
I wanted to see her in the ground
I wanted to see her buried

We drove off
in the rain
away from this gleaming white
box that shone brightly in the lucid grey
Inside was the lady
who sat me on her lap
and played the piano
that I still cannot play

the woman who showed me the joys
of grapefruit and egg sandwichs
the lady who introduced me to
the spanking paddle

From Taking Refuge in LA, text by Rick Fields 
The French had finally been driven from Vietnam after the battle of Dien Bien Phu in 1954. In the partition of the country that followed the Geneva Accords, thousands of Vietnamese Catholics had fled to the South, where President Ngo Dinh Diem had taken over from Bao Dai, the last of the Vietnamese emperors. 
Diem’s family had been among the first Vietnamese converted to Catholicism in the seventeenth century. He favored the Catholics who had left the North, rewarding them with position, power, and status. His younger brother ruled Central Vietnam as his personal domain, while his older brother was teh archbishop of Hue. 
The Buddhist of Vietnam had grown increasingly frustrated with Diem’s favoritism toward the Catholics. They had also found themselves the only voice for the masses of poeple who were being torn apart by a bloody civil war and called for negotiations and peace in an increasingly polarized situation. 
The Buddhists’ frustration reached a peak in the central Vietnamese city of Hue on May 8, 1963, as the Buddhists gathered to celebrate the 2,507th year since the Buddha’s birth. Just a few weeks before, authorities had allowed blue and white papal flags flown to celebrate the twenty-fifth aniversary of the archbishop’s ordination. But now they cited a law, dating back to the French period, that reduced Buddhism to the status of a private religion and made it unlawful for Buddhists to meet or gather in any number without permission of the authorities. 
The immediate cause of the dispute was that the authorities would not let the Buddhists fly the Buddhist flag. The Buddhist flag had actually been designed in Ceylon (Sri Lanka) in 1880 by an American, Colonel Henry Steel Olcott, a fact that would no doubt have amazed the American military men and intelligence gatherers stationed in Vietnam. Olcott had been a founding member of the Theosophical Society, and one of the first American Buddhists. He had been of great help to the Buddhists of Ceylon, who had then been fighting their own battle against Christian favoritism and control. 
The flag he designed contained the colors said to have been exhibited by the Buddha’s aura during his enlightenmentsapphire blue, golden yellow, crimson, white, and scarlet. In time the flag had come to be accepted by many Asian Buddhists as a symbol of a new Buddhist internationalism, as it was by the Vietnamese Buddhists in Hue on May 8, and as it still is by Vietnamese Buddhists in Los Angeles and other cities who display it prominently in their temple. 
In Hue, on the evening of Buddha’s birthday, many people ignored the government’s order not to fly the Buddhist flag. Realizing that the situation was getting out of hand, the mayor of Hue allowed the flag to be flown. However, the following evening, when thousands of Buddhists gathered outside the radio station to hear a rebroadcast of the Wesak (Buddha’s birthday) celebration, they heard music instead. The station manager claimed that he had canceled the broadcast because a speech by Thich Tri Quang, one of the Buddhist leaders, had not been reviewed by the censor. 
While Thich Tri Quang and the mayor of Hue were inside the station discussing the situation, five armored cars arrived at the scene. Orders were given for the crowd to disperse, then shots were fired and granades thrown. Eight people died in the confusionseven children and one woman. The Diem government blamed the Communists, but reports by journalists on the scene, as well as by a respected physician who examined the bodies, disproved that claim.

1248,https://www.opendiary.com/m/sadmeatcart/eternal-prize-4261058/,2002-03-25,…eternal prize,"
Two days later, on May 10, Buddhist leaders presented the government with five requests: that the government cancel indefinitely the ban on flying the traditional Buddhist flag; that the government grant Buddhism the same rights as Catholicism; that the government stop detaining and terrorizing Buddhists; that the government give Buddhist monks and nuns the right to practice and spread their religion; and that the government pay fair compensations to the victim’s families and punish those responsible for their deaths. 
A few days later, the Buddhists clarified the nature of their movement. They stated that they were not trying to overthrow the government to form one of their own but merely hoped to change the anti-Buddhist policies of the government; the Buddhist struggle for equality was nonviolent; and the Buddhists did not represent or support the Communists or any other political group. 
The Diem government reacted with further repression. Then, on the morning of July 11, as Jerrold Schecter reported in The New Face of Buddha: 
The orange-robed monks and grey-robed nuns appeared to be part of a quiet protest as they walked slowly down Phan-Dinh-Phung Street in Saigon on a hot June afternoon. Heading the procession was an automobile filled with monks. At the intersection of Phan-Dinh-Phung and Le-An-Duyer streets the priests got out of the car and lifted the hood. It appeared that they wer having engine trouble. The procession parted around the car as if to move on, but instead the monks and nuns formed a surrounding circle seven and eight deep. Slowly they began to intone the deep, mournful, resonant rhythm of a sutra. The priests in the auto walked to the center of the circle and seventy-three year old Thich Quang-Duc sat in the lotus position, a classic Buddhist meditation pose. Nuns began to weep, their sobs breaking the measure of the chant. A monk removed a five-gallon can of gasoline from the car and poured it over Quang-Duc, who sat calmly in silence as the gasoline soaked his robes and wet the asphalt in a small dark pool. Then Thich Quang-Duc, his Buddhist prayer beads in his right hand, opened a box of matches and struck one. Instantly he was engulfed in a whoosh of flame and heavy black smoke that partially obscured him from view. The chanting stopped. The smoke rose and, as the fierce flames brightened, Quang-Duc’s face, his shaven skull and his robes grizzled, then blackened. Amidst the devouring flames his body remained fixed in meditation. 
Some monks feel to their knees in prayer and began anew the ritual chant of the sutra…Thich Quang-Duc burned for nearly ten minutres before his charred body fell backward, his black flesh and the remains of his robes still smoldering, his serene face fixed in a death mask. Still clutching the prayer beads, his right arm reached to the sky. 
The Venerable Thich Quang-Duc, abbot of the Quan-Am temple in Gia Dinh, had left a simple note: 
‘I pray to Buddha to give light to President Ngo Dinh Diem, so that he will accept the five minimum requests of the Vietnamese Buddhists. Before closing my eyes to go to Buddha, I have the honor to present my words to President Diem, asking him to be kind and tolerant towards his people and enforce a policy of religious equality.’ 

I know I am
I always do
I find myself filled with apprehension now
Will I actually enjoy this trip?
chances are
I won’t see who
I want to
and I won’t go where I want to
but it’s still
the place I knew as home
for so long
and
it is
not here
I do need a small vacation
I just get worried
that it won’t be one
that it will just be
some quivering knee
clock watching debacle

I think I just really want 
to see her
I suppose
there is somewhat
of a blessing in that…
I don’t want to dissappoint

Ask me and I will play 
So sweetly, I’ll make you smile

Take it, don’t turn away

In stories
Such vicarious thrills
we get
in fictious passion
and in ink-ridden
sentiments

faux heart.
But off
the pages
and off the screen
Something is traded
and something is learned
Love is as real
as you want it to be
The rain has washed away the perfect

it’s odd
the bittersweet day
that was yesterday
I visited my Grandma June
And
My mom’s dad
My Grandpa
That I never knew
Their grave seemed to be well 
kept
But the cemetery did not
The pond that was there before..
gone
filled in for more plots
But I was there
After that
We went the zoo
since it was on the way home
It was just a walk in
and out
visit
But I got to kiss 
Olga
My Dead Pinneped true love
I got a picture!
But
It really wasn’t where I wanted to go
And wasn’t at all who I wanted to be with
…
I miss her
…
And then I went out bowling
I suck at bowling
But I was just out with my friends
and  I haven’t done that
..in a while
Now
the morning after
I miss them
My social event
for the next few months…
Tonight
back to solitude.

She does too

She is completley taken by you
Sitting quietly
in your friendship
Waiting for the day
You’ll see
what you mean to her

She was near tears last night
Seeing you with her
Seeing her flaunt her cleavage in your face

and whispering to her
how badly you want her
and how badly she’s
going to fuck with your head
Dood
I’m not going to tell you
what to do
I spent 3 years being jacked around
I’m the last one
to tell you

Look behind you
She’s in love with you
She will do anything for you
You have been unhappy in love for so long

turn her tears into tears of joy

You will come around

and the gnarled branches
Overlookd giants
in a glass view peace
What stories
have they heard
What horrors
have they endured
I can take my left hand
and run it down
their rough skin
and the silent scraping
Speaks to me
the years of life
From the beginning
they say
the first animal
the first cage
the first picnic
the first parade

and have survived it all
Quiet in their presence
Deafening in their

I dreamt of seeing your eyes
admist all the people
I saw you

I saw those quiet
insecure moments
when we are scared to talk
scared to look
uncomfortable
without a monitor between us
I saw us open up
I saw you smile
I felt your hand inside mine
as we laughed our way
around the wheel
My dream ended in the wheel though
Hands held tight
suspended at the top
Your head on my shoulder
and my head on yours
Our eyes closed
and just soaking in the moment
and watching it all
passing us by

are foggy
and gone

ridden with pain

The red
winged harbinger
teases my mind

One of these days
I’m actually going to
keep a
promise to myself
and go
"

and the night
flashes
itself
so vaguely
in the presence
of this middle period
no light
no dark
but something nameless
It is those things
without names
that drive us
those undiscovered
normalities
that are taken for granted
just accepted
and ignored
those
uncreated words
that taunt
the tip of our tongues
and haunt the holdings
within our heads
the silent beat
can’t break the silence
of
lack of
and might have been
The day is gone
as are the oppurtunities
and that
not so distant tree
is still unattainable
The forest of thorns
stand strongly against my blade
and against
my developing beliefs

Lets go to the show
lets hold hands
and go
We have the entire world
at our doorstep
and the night sky
dancing in front of our eyes
Lets go to the show
and be an audience to the stars
let their ancient light
enlighten our hearts
and let’s
bask in the
pale moon’s
borrowed light
Lets go to the show
and cover ourselves
in blankets
and hold eachother close
and tight
Spending the night
in the filtered dark
And waking to the morning dew
of a new day
together

~I think sometimes
that world is lessening
itself
when it can’t hear
the lovely music
that my wicked alarm clock
makes
an hour too early~
there are words
that long to come out
when I hear certain things
those awkward goodbyes
and the latent
inability
to press a button
there are things
I wish to say
lay them out
in the open
make them real
it’s easy to silently
speak them
in my head
in my words
With my voice
I am a coward
the words
they rise up from my heart
only to stall and die
on my tongue
leaving me speechless
and lost
but one day
I hope
they will endure
~I cut my finger on a brass
sun
I bled on a brass moon
But I cried to a cloudy sky~

the green ink splurges forth
and entices the word
to become misformed
and lost
the view outside
these plastic windows
is dark
despite
the over abundance of light
blinding
but close
eyed systems
prevent it all
from being seen
dreary is the day
as it passes on
slowly
obscenly
viciously
the only relief brings more of the same
just a different location
an urge to just
scream aloud
and blow it all the fuck away
in a single
explosion
of feeling and
existence
And then lay wasted
underneath the sun
and let the wind
hide it away
Such passing
fantasys
in the head
of a lost mind

some primal odor
of canine design

There is light outside

The sun is nowhere to be seen

you looked at the sun

rain
dripping down their 
plastic petals
like the plastic tears
from
a commuter’s mindseye
who lost their life
on this stretch
of pavement
who’s child
who’s parent
who’s lover
who’s friend
a modest monument
to an unknown soul
no more
than a passing thought
passing by
Don’t look back
a solemn reminder of safety
A memory reduced to 
a warning

beat me down

the dull rage
ignites into something more
something sinisterly
sedated
The contridiction
and the realism
they all dance
in the fragmented understanding
and the shattered whole
healing together
all is one
all is one
one of many
one of the same
It all comes down to this
this moment
this time
this chance
Time rages on
in the absence of sensibility
and in the discant
of the heart
But it won’t end here
the remnants of the day
and the memories of the past
They become one 
too
In the future

the belief

it is always gained anew

of wavering confidence
when words don’t soothe
only invite more of the same
it’s always the same
at times like this
it’s always the same
An intent of good
and self
worth
all blown away
in the stillness
of an instant
never more
never was
never nevered
But it is still early
and the time is still young
the day is long
and so is the idle
ness
Sleep will come eventually

aloud

wind blown day

searching for warmth
I find none

with a thousand wounds
of nothingness
I can’t tell if my eyes
are open or closed

dying in my very real cage
of my promises
I know where I want to be
But I know I will see
there as a prison
as well

enticing me

There is a something to be said
past the sights
and past the sounds
There is something
within it all
driving
moving
creating
God?
no 
it’s apart of that too
And sitting here
fighting it off
I can’t help
but feel manipulated by it as well
Boredom is absolute

hands behind head position

and yelled at us
then the power went out

and everyone went home

Black
to the southwest

and the sirens went off

transfixed

with his rage
Great is his compassion
and equally great is his anger

and leave his nest
Vowing to visit
but never to return

without a second thought
Time passes
and his blood still flows

slowly killing their father
with their ignorance
they insert their
misgivings within his veins

into the void
Punching through

Hello darkness my old friend 
I’ve come to talk with you again 
Because a vision softly creeping 
Left its seeds while, I was sleeping 
And the vision that was planted in my brain 
Still remains within the sound of silence 
In restless dreams I walked alone 
Narrow streets of cobble stone 
‘Neath the halo of a street lamp 
I turned my collar to the cold and damp 
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash 
Of a neon loght that split the night 
And touched the sound of silence 
And in the naked light I saw 
Ten thousand people maybe more 
People talking without speaking 
People writing songs that voices never share 
And no one dare disturb the sound of silence 
Fools said I, you do not know 
Silence like a cancer grows 
Hear my words that I might teach you 
Take my arms that I might reach you 
But my words like silent raindrops fell 
And echoed in the wells of silence 
And the people bowed and prayed 
To the neon God they made 
And the sign flashed out its warning 
In the words that it was forming 
And the signs said 
The words of prophets are written 
On the sub-way walls and tenement halls 
And whisper’d in the sound of silence
"

it all seems still
when life
rapidly moves around you
the warm intentions
of a cool wind
run softly
on a vacant
trapped stare
and a drifting scent
of flowers
drift through an
open window revery
of this wet day
cloistered in deep thought
striving for answers
when they are none
The questions are the answers in themselves
A thought for the future
and promise to the past
the poignant images
of what might be
and a solid purpose
make a simple memory
of what has yet to come
Washing down the fragments
of happy
ness
In the absence of hope
the plain songs
for a plain day
When the rain washes the
dirt away
and everything seems clearer
This heart beats still.

~ What are you studying to be?
I don’t know~
a process of elimination
I don’t know what I want
but as I go through life
I know what I don’t
I’ve gotten over the past
but it keeps on coming back to haunt me
The mistakes I made
the bridges I burned
No matter how often I try to forget
no matter how often I overcome
I don’t
I can’t find my way out of this
because I don’t know where I to go
each time I take a path
in time
I find that it leads to where
I don’t want to be

isnt it
Do I deserve to have
what I want
is it what I need
Should just give up 
on trying to do
something I want in life
and be happy with whatever it is
I recieve
Am I clinging to these nameless hopes and
dreams
of just being content
with myself
and what I do
So when I die
I can look back
and be happy with 
what
has passed
Am I being vain
selfish
childish
inconsiderate
All my life
I have been setting up 
goals
At the time I was sure
I could manage them
because
afterall
anything is possible
But not when you don’t do it
not when you sit back
and think of it
as it will happen
it has too
I didn’t fucking try
and here I am now
with not one fucking goal
achieved
Maybe they were too high
Maybe I’m just not smart enough
fast enough
anything
Fuck that…
Fuck me…
Deep down
I think this is vanity
…
the tales of not
a underachiever
a neverachiever
And now I find myself dwelling
in the past again
I’m working hard now
trying hard
to fix what I broke
And to be a better me
But I still lack direction
and I’m already feeling trapped
on the path that doesn’t lead
where I think
I need to be
Despite not knowing
what

Somewhere out there someone’s saying a prayer
That we’ll find one another in that big somewhere out there
And even though I know how very far apart we are
It helps to think we might be wishing on the same bright star
And when the night wind starts to sing a lonesome lullaby
It helps to think we’re sleeping underneath the same big sky
Somewhere out there if love can see us through
Then we’ll be together somewhere out there
Out where dreams come true
And even though I know how very far apart we are
It helps to think we might be wishing on the same bright star

You were all that mattered
You were once a friend and father
Then my world was shattered
Wishing you were somehow here again
Wishing you were somehow near
Sometimes it seemed if I just dreamed
Somehow you would be here
Wishing I could hear your voice again
Knowing that I never would
Dreaming of you won’t help me to do
All that you dreamed I could
Passing bells and sculpted angels
Cold and monumental
Seem for you the wrong companions
You were warm and gentle
Too many years fighting back tears
Why can’t the past just die?
Wishing you were somehow here again
Knowing we must say goodbye
Try to forgive, teach me to live
Give me the strength to try
No more memories, no more silent tears
No more gazing across the wasted years
Help me say goodbye
Help me say goodbye

Love at the lips was touch
As sweet as I could bear;
And once that seemed to much;
I lived on air 
That crossed me from sweet things,
The flow of-was it musk
From hidden grapevine springs
Downhill at dusk?
I had the swirl and ache
From sprays of honeysuckle
That when they’re gathered shake
Dew on the knuckle.
I craved strong sweets, but those
Seemed strong when I was young;
The pedal of the rose
It was that stung.
Now no joy but lacks salt,
That is not dashed with pain
And weariness and fault;
I crave the stain
Of tears, the aftermark
Of almost too much love,
The sweet bitter bark
and burning clove.
When stiff and sore and scarred
I take away my hand
From leaning on it hard
In grass and sand,
The hurt is not enough:
I long for weight and strength
To feel the earth as rough
To all my length.

Just Words
Words are a form of classification.  They organize a concept into groupings of letters to convey a specific idea to another.  But the meanings of words are based in a specific, individual reaction to the origin.  Not everyone reacts in a similar way.  In William Faulkners As I lay Dying, Addie, Darl, and Vardaman all share a bond in the way they each struggle with the concepts of words and communication.
Of the three, Addie has the firmest grasp on the differences between what someone says and what someone really means.  In her single chapter, Addie reveals her personal outlook on words and touches on higher truth pertaining to words:  Some things are just too vast and comprehensive to simply put a name on.
“That was when I learned that words are no good; that words dont ever fit even what they are trying to say at.  When he was born I knew that motherhood was invented by someone who had to have a word for it because the ones that had the children didnt care whether there was a word for it or not.  I knew that fear was invented by someone that had never had the fear; pride, who never had the pride.  I knew that it had been, not that they had dirty noses, but that we had had to use one another by words like spiders dangling by their mouths from a beam, swinging and twisting and never touching, and that only through the blows of the switch could my blood and their blood flow as one stream” (171-2).
Addie lived her life according to that perspective as well.  She strictly paid attention to what was real, not what was implied.  Addie believed that trying to use a word to describe a feeling was superfluous; most feelings are easier understood without words. 
Darl is very much like his mother when it comes to words.  He knows that the words that people use are not always what they are trying to say. 
The reason you will not say it is, when you say it, even to yourself, you will know that it is true: is that it?  But you know it is true now.  I can almost tell you the day when you knew it was true.  Why wont you say it, even to yourself (40)?
Also like Addie, Darl has a firm grasp on what words technically mean.  As Darl tells Vardaman, I havent got ere onebecause if I had one, it is was.  And if it is was, it cant be is.  Can it(101)?  And as Dewey Dell states, He said he knew without words, Darl understands that some things need not be spoken to be conveyed (27).  But unlike his mother, Darl differentiates between what he says and what he thinks.  Throughout the story, Darl is the most articulate speaker (Hewson 7).  He takes the reader on short and wonderful discants by describing what he is viewing, leaving the reader to determine its revelence to the story.  But when he speaks, Darl is direct and straight to the point.  Darls perspective is unique in the story, but Darl seems incapable of relaying it exactly aloud.  He can only hint to it in short, direct statements.  
As the youngest character in the book, Vardaman struggles the most with his feelings and with what is going on.  In an attempt to comprehend his mothers death, Vardaman deduces that his mother is a fish, therefore, cannot be inside the coffin.  
“My mother is a fish.  Darl says that when we come to the water again I might see her and Dewey Dell said, Shes in the box; how could she have got out?  She got out through the holes I bored, into the water I said, and when we come to the water again I am going to see her.  My mother is not in the box.  My mother does not smell like that.  My mother is a fish” (Faulkner 196).
Vardaman grapples with reality and his coping-mechanism of logic.  Vardaman can only speak what he feels and knows.  Because of his young age, he does not understand how someone can say something and not literally mean that.  Marc Hewson of The Mississippi Quarterly believes that Vardamans difficulty with words lie in that words are arbitrary and he cannot easily give up on logic (6).  
In As I Lay Dying, Addie strives to devalue the concepts of words because to her, words are hollow.  Of her children, Darl and Vardaman seem to share her perspective of words, at least, partially.  Darl can differentiate between what he thinks and what he says, while acknowledging both.  And Vardaman can speak what he thinks without having to inhibit his process with superfluous, unmeant words.  Through their words and thoughts; Addie, Darl, and Vardaman each help the reader understand their respective characters and provide a unique insight to human nature itself.

the distorted visions
of a mason jar
filled with recycled water
they don’t really matter
the quantities
they just grow smaller
and smaller
a mere victim
to my raving thirst
It all comes down to me
doesn’t it?
it’s only natural
I suppose

I am me
it’s understandable
that my thoughts
are of me

storm
that is life

I am certain of
is me

Do those

hued

searching for pleasures 
of the carnal variety
care of what
I

existence

Or even more so
Care of the words

tap tap tap

do they

should I?
The glass 
as I drink from it
grows less
and less
full
with water
But does not air matter
The spaces between
are still spoken for
or
atleast should be
Beyond it all
and most of all
beyond me
There is something
and beyond that
more
And endless expanse
of something
that is not me
Do I ease myself
in consideration?
No
I can either
delude
or accept
But pondering that
sitting in
this ten cent
chair
shirtless
and slowly becoming
sweat covered
from this hot
balmy
night
Can I see beyond me
I accept that
I can
But
from within
that acceptance
I ask you
Can you see past my
glass
of diminishing
and increasing volume
can you see past the 
screened window
into and beyond
the insect
esque
passion play
in the night
Can you see past your self
and through
these green soiled
words
on a screen
Can you see past me
sitting here
looking out
to eternity
And can you see past
my spindrift gaze
and see yourself
in my egoist
eyes reflection?
It all comes full circle
and turns within itself
and comes back
to the last place you expected
and the last place you would ever look
Because now
it’s not about me
it’s about you.

I had an epiphany
while I was driving home
through  the rain
You see
I was watching the mist
rise from the northern ridge of mountains
It naturally took my thoughts of the cabin
and lake
Every night
every morning
Just like that
except
up there
you would hear the loons
I haven’t heard the loons in so long…
and it was right there
when I realized
that I’ve been approaching this all wrong
I’ve been too nice to you
Just because you’re my aunt
I’ve been trying to look at this from your eyes
But
I’ve been looking through
rose coloured glasses
Let us look back
on what transpired
for the past ten years
you have been living
between Illinois
and Florida
up down
Hell
I never knew where you were
Then
your husband retires
and your knee’s get bad
so
you make the atypical upgrade from
florida
to arizona
Once there
you realize that
hell…
My husband was a teacher…
he didn’t make squat for a living
So you sell you condo in florida
and your house in illinois
And you sit back
and look at the money
and decide
well
this just isn’t enough
to buy some decked out
manor
out in the middle
of the yuppie desert
Where can I get more money?
Then your eyes brighten up
because you remember the cabin
Dear god…the property is worth over 300,000 dollars
but wait…I only own a third
my siblings each have shares too
unfortunetly
that dollar sign has already flashed in your head
so you slink down
and try to figure out how to get your share
First, you try the direct/indirect approach
You nonchalantly mention the cabin’s worth to your siblings…hoping to spark their interest
But
they don’t bite…the cabin isn’t a monetary value to them
too bad…
So you regroup and refocus your angle
Since they were not interested in selling
then you’ll mention that…one day..I’d like to be bought out.
Now…you don’t get an answer to that
and honestly..you don’t expect one.
Between the two of them…they cannot produce almost 150, 000 dollars….
so…into the shadows you creep
and a few months later
you emerge
Armed to the death
with legal actions
40 years worth of letters
and a “poor me” complex to boot.
You take them to court…
If you cannot get them to buy you out
you will force them to sell
And now here we are…
Throughout this…
the word you preached
and lived by
was realism.
“Oh Jil, you live in TN now, you can’t possibly visit the cabin as much as you used to.  Lets be realistic, let it go.”
Yes..let us be realistic
You are a 50 + woman..who now spends roughly 23.9 hours a day on the computer…who has become miserly and ultimately bitter to her entire past and family.
Money should have never been an option for the cabin
If you wanted no part of it
then have no part of it
but no
you wanted money
And you’ve screwed me over
Yes 
me.
What about fucking me
Because of your greed
I am robbed of the place 
I loved more than anywhere else in the world
Come let me be selfish like you
please
There is so much inside now
that I’ve realized that I don’t have to protect you
in my head.
I won’t hate you
I 
still have some family respect
But
I won’t respect you.
Your actions…
I
could never fuck over my sisters like that
I
I 
me
I can never forgive you
And you know what’s sad
You can most likely live
with that…

when they are being scrutinized by the heart
Some things
wither in absence
and bloom in comfort
The gaseous fumes
dancing around
prissy leather

down the asphalt road

I cannot handle
But in this suggested flight
away from myself
I find peace in the noise
and absoloution
in my wind induced
tears
phentorine moments
and milky chocolate memories
upset

happiness
The vigile withered

I’m running

a thousand deer
lie dead
on sixty-five
Their blood
strewn across the pavement
drying to a crisp
plan for the future
that seems so much clearer now
~
The gentle feeling
of comfort has left me now
I never realize
how badly I miss the place
until I am there
Never enough time
never enough..
~
I dissected time today
and now I’m
lost
~
I wanna start a cover
band again

multi coloured
fancies
dragging across
the still air
refracting and
reflecting
the artificial light
off their
roundish
edges
The joy of life
and the joy of being
cry out
within the cries
of children
Dancing in circles
without a care
Some moments
can make a day worthwhile
and almost
bring
a
homesick heart
one step closer
to home

there is a tree
a small pine
a living memory to what was
and yet
never really was
I am haunted by his picture
they gave the tree to us
to let his roots
mix with our soil
I am haunted by his feet
They hope to visit
him/
it
this summer
but now they won’t
she’s got see the doctor
I am haunted by his name
I am haunted by his life
I am haunted by his death
they can’t come visit their son
she pregnant again
and I don’t know
what to think
I should be happy
I should be happy
I am happy
I am just haunted by a tree
My nephew is a tree

i spent
the majority
of yesterday
watching the cracked
and sun
ravaged pavement
pass me by
I found myself drifting
to a painful subject
my future
I had so many plans
contingent on eachother
that when one fell
they all fell
And I fell too
And I am
was
lost in the
memory of them
unwilling to start over
too gunshy
too scared
to dream
But then
somewhere around
Louisville
a possibility
shined through
my wasted self
and gave me a slight bit of hope
for myself
that is still with me
lingering

it all disappears
in some
stagnant sweaty
funk
of irkesque
moments
all the things
all the thoughts
everything 
that made
today
a
good day
it all evaporated away
in this steamy
fucking place
humid thoughts
and boiling discontent
slowly erases it all
my head hurts for no reason
as does my heart
And I have nothing good
to graspe hold of
and weather this storm
no hope for me
no hope at all
At least
for the moment

~cuz I’m losing my sight
losing my mind
wish someone would tell me I’m fine~
I can’t justify
justice sometimes
Does killing someone
who killed
someone
you cared for
Does it make it better
does it quell your loss
does it bring them back
Or
does it give you the satisfaction
that
perhaps
the killer had?
~a feel like a weak link
a weak like~
Love conquers all
Do the right thing
and
follow your dream, your heart
How come those are things
we are expected to 
“grow up” from 
Reality isn’t a harsh place
“adulthood” is
~there’s no money
there’s no possessions
only obsession
I don’t need the shit
take my money
take my obsession~
I…I..just want to be heard
and
I won’t let
it all go away
not like this
Its hard not
to cling to a faith
in someone else
is pulling all the strings
and ultimately
knows what’s going on
Chaos is a scary thing to graspe
and terrifying to live by
No control tends to be that way
But
there is comfort in the freefall
and there is beauty in world
Somethings
just get in the way
of seeing that
~There it is Wendy, second star to the right and straight on till morning
When there’s a smile in your heart
there’s no better time to start
think of all the joy you’ll find
when you leave the world behind
and bid your cares good-bye
you can fly! you can fly! you can fly!
you can fly! you can fly! you can fly!
you can fly! you can fly! you can fly!
you can fly! you can fly! you can fly!

the acrid
smell of
burning desire
to escape from this cage
and from this box
and let the humid world
take it all in
and spit it out
in some
glory
filled spectacle
of light
sound
and innate wonder
And when it’s all over
to crawl into the waters
of forgetfullness
and float away

the hazy blue
turned a quickening
grey
as the air froze
and the tender fear
that was nearly forgotten
deviantly raises it’s
harsh little head
In the distance
the silence
can be heard
Slowly 
drowning out
all else
the still consumes
A crack of light
a snap of panic
Not enough road between us
A feathered heart attack
explodes
and fades away
Not enough road between
Not enough time
until
The rain will come
the rain
will come
and wash it all
away

find their way home

Can I understand you
can you understand me
I see the look in you eyes
I see me
Why can’t listen
to the words
they scream
why can’t you
read the
words
that I bleed
why can’t I
yes
it’s still
all about me
I find myself
and I lose myself
all by myself
selfless for me
for you
for me
It all comes back to
it all
and All
is everything
and everything is nothing
and nothing is me
An introverted path
into my lies
I find truth in it all
all lies
It’s all points
for viewing
and perspective
relatives
I can understand it
why can’t you
reality is what you make of 
it
Truth is
just a personalized lie
everything can turn around
and be what it’s not
but it is if you say it is
People don’t think like you
people don’t think for you
But their wrong
and you’re right
now it’s not about me
I can atleast
attempt
to graspe the concept
that I’m an individual
as is
everyone else
my opinion is as true
and real as there’s
Thats good enough for me
but not for you
So I’ll sit up here
bored out of my mind
and slowly pick
your faults apart
behind you back
beyond your eyes
I’ll take solice in your
ignorance to this
Because your life
revolves around you
and everyone elses opinion of you
Up on your pillar
down in your hole
surrounded by those who 
love
and those who
hate
Congratulations
It’s all about you

youth

echo

nostalgia

chords
of experience
molding with
the artificial
moments
of factorized
explotation
In the end
all that matters
is that F
and it’s tendency
to be flat

logs lie idly
on a sandy
forestfall
laden beach
The river 
divides
the land
and finds itself
divded
bye the land
in this point
of
time
I
too
have found this point
to soak
my ugliness
in the 
waters
and to submerge
my
sun
dried toes
in the
finely
cut grains
of sinister sand
The sun
shines differently
on
the waters here
Someplaces
that light refracts
cleanly on the surface
Reflecting the world
above
and around
it
in perfect
mirrored
fashion
And
in someplaces
The waters open forth
and reveal their black
murky depths
to the light
and close in 
around 
swallowing it whole
leaving the aura
of nothingness
and impregnable despair
I find myself 
crouched 
in the
waters
Slightly off the bottom
letting humanity’s wake
rock
me harshly
back and
forth
again and
again
and again
until I enter
a fugesque state
as I gaze at the slight 
waves
when the come for me
come through me
come to
forget me
I reach down
and cup a
handfull of
some muddied clay
sand
and watch it
softly
diminish
against
the water’s
unforgiving
and unknowing wrath
As time
slips through my 
wrinkled hands
the hourglassy
waters encroach
onto the logs
and slowly
consume them
until
the logs
are but another cog
in the 
lucid cycle of 
instances
But
I suppose
they always were.

I saw them cry
But the sky is not falling
the sky is not falling

But I have a feeling that it 
will
Because I saw a piece fall this morning
fall through you
And for your sin
you went to hell
And I guess you cried
because your tears
put out the fires
and now it’s heaven on earth
Because the hellish fire
has gone away
and there’s no hot air
to hold up heaven
and I watched the sky fall
unto us
But the sky is not falling
never never falling
Crashing heaven with your tears
quelling hell
with your tears
Never never falling

I sat on my
pleather chair
and wrote
an entry in my head
It was about
what to write
when you have nothing
to write about
I think I was
going to have fun with it
and
it was going to pass time
and
maybe
someone would have liked it..
But
this movie
playing in the background
it was
just
so
sentimental
and what not
It distracted my mind
and that
entry
it’s gone now
But
something new popped in
A guy
picked up a trumpet
and started to play
Nature boy
and it brought me
back
to a place
that I am
ever scared
to go back to
It was moved into the
guest room
The music room
as my mother likes to call it
I can see it in my mind
dirty silver
hidden away
in my misgivings
and my regrets
an unfortunate casualty
in a war within myself
and with pride
But now
I yearn
to wander over
and press
that cold metal to
my lips
and see what comes out
I have a pretty good idea
what would
better than I would expect
worse than I wish
I could most likely 
get to where I’d be happy
if I just practiced.
No
that’s not true
I would never be happy
I was never happy before
why would it stand true now?
I would try it once
and be so disgusted with
the result
that I would
hurt on the inside
The lucid realism
that lingers in that almost
shimmering song
A poignant reminder
of my failures
and of my faults
and all my mistakes
that have led me here
And despite
everything I have going for me
now
I still can’t look at myself at my mirror
and I still can’t quite 
convince myself
that I deserve anything
that I have
.
But maybe
the my face
distorted
in curved bell
would be a welcome
truth
to the pain
that a mirror
often brings
Chances are
I will meander over
and see what happens
Just another slash
to who I was
and I am now
I hope my parents 
leave me alone
when I go
Their blind support
can’t help me deal
with me
I just need
to feel 
to be
to something
…
I would have enjoyed writing
that entry..

fog is an interesting thing
sometimes
like
In the morning
when I’m out
taunting the pavement
and I look ahead
and see
that white evervesent wall
billowing outwards
grasping me
pulling me in
swallowing me whole
Cutting through fog
is a unique sensation
The your skin slices through
the misty white
and then
it seems like
it cuts back under your skin
Some lewd chilling circle
of aired flesh
It softens your eyes
and your vision
into some lucid pallat
of distortion
and danger
But it all fades away
in the morning’s light
And I find myself in the
white no more
But
my flesh still tingles
and my body 
is still saturauted
Those are the only things
that remind me
that is wasn’t dream

~i apologize if I’ve already posted these
lyrics~
Spent my days with a woman unkind,
Smoked my stuff and drank all my wine.
Made up my mind to make a new start,
Going To California with an aching in my heart.
Someone told me there’s a girl out there
With love in her eyes and flowers in her hair.
Took my chances on a big jet plane,
Never let them tell you that they’re all the same.
The sea was red and the sky was grey,
Wondered how tomorrow could ever follow today.
The mountains and the canyons started to tremble and shake
As the children of the sun began to awake.
Seems that the wrath of the Gods
Got a punch on the nose and it started to flow;
I think I might be sinking.
Throw me a line if I reach it in time
I’ll meet you up there where the path
Runs straight and high.
To find a queen without a king;
They say she plays guitar and cries and sings.
La la la la
Ride a white mare in the footsteps of dawn
Tryin’ to find a woman who’s never, never, never been born.
Standing on a hill in my mountain of dreams,
Telling myself it’s not as hard, hard, hard as it seems.

harrowing escapes
from the crevice
of reason
and sound preference
to the dank
and dark
lovely sunshine
of the open air
Letting the cage fall apart
and having
everything that
is anything
come in
and pound
me away
Don’t let them
tell you its the same
never the same
never ever
the same
A diet of seeds
allows
for
a plethroa of
possibilites
except the one you want
And that Has
made all the difference
since nothing is the same
anymore
And the daylight
is flooding me away
for ever more
Shoulda tuned out

in my head it has
And
I can’t bear

the journey begins
as I turn
onto the circle
and follow it
until it becomes a road
And from the road
to  a mill
and back to a road again
And then it becomes a street
to a route
and that
is where
I noticed the sky
Disenheartened
greys
lace
a lacey white orangish
backdrop
of dreamciclesque
design
The glowing ball
of daytime fantasy’s
hides behind
this molten stew of air
ever waiting
to spring out
and ambush
the hapless souls
of the earth
To the side
the clouds
have opened up
to reveal
a surreal blue eternity
A man can see forever in that window
A man can see himself
~
the road dips down
and dips away
A constant chase for the eyes
I
on my pale 
mechanical steed
follow the road
in eleven second incremints
Living life
eleven seconds ahead
there is forever in that too
And as the road twists away
I come upon a queer notion
~
People paint pictures like this
to make themselves
a small part of it all
through a stroke of colour
a splash themselves fall unto the canvas
A stab at being
a pebble in the stream of existence
~
What if there isn’t any road around this turn
What if 
I swing around this bend
and there is nothing
Logic tells me thats
not really likely
But what if
my eleven second 
gaze wouldn’t help me
What would I do if the road
just
wasn’t there
As  much as I know that road will be there
I have faith in the possibility that
road might not be there
I have faith 
that he is not there
I may see the road
continue on past my
eleven seconds
but what is there
within
Nothing?
~
In my head
I hear someone saying
that
a scene like this
There is my proof
Only god
can paint like this
Only god can bleed the sky
just right
and let loose the colours
just right
to make a gash
in the morning
as awe inspiring as this.
Some people find comfort in control
in a wielding hand
of dictation
turning the crank on life
Some even find beauty in that
Life within a box
I however
find beauty is chaos
It’s not because this event
is some demonstration
of control
and power
Its because
this happens
every morning
It just
happens
radom consitency
No hand sets this into motion
It just occurs
and we are truly fortunate
to bear witness
to the mathmematical wonders
that chaos sometimes provides
~
I head into the turn
my hand firmly
accelerating me
through it
past the speedlimit
fuck the speedlimit
If there is nothing waiting for me
then I shall embrace this nothing
and make it something to me
~
People are too anxious for answers
Sometimes we need
to blindly accept things
Just because noone tells the sun to rise
doesn’t mean
it won’t
~
I snap around the bend and race along
the existing road
The only nothing is what is behind me
and I have nothing but pavement
that goes on forever
Nothing but eternity between me
and the sky
I nudge my white steed
onward
Burning in the morning’s
pale indifferent light.
~
And just because no one dictates what
happens in life
doesn’t mean
we don’t control
the direction
of ours.

I wasn’t quite sure
what I had
planned on accomplishing
by disappearing
letting the shadow
merge into the night
so all that remains
is a glimmering remider
of what was
or never was
You can’t ever
be too sure
But the air
was pristine
and the sun was divine
and the scents
clogged my senses
and the view
blew my mind
So I wasted some cash
and inked my body
with some
image
of what I didn’t know
hoping
what I chose
would match
what I gained
And then I slept
soundly
in a foreign bed
and let the alien sheets
comfort me
I awoke to a new day
and a new pain in my arm
Pain to let me know 
I was still alive
So I mounted my steed
and let the glimmer of white
race me into the woods
Daring the curves
and chancing the drops
I ascended past
and above my past
and ignored the future
And in my present
I climbed to the top
And in my head
and in my heart
I cried out
“Well lookie here
Momma’s boy
Jay fucking
wesley smith
has found his wussified
derriere to the top of the world
Who’da fucking thunk it?”
Sure it wasn’t much
But as I meandered down
with a triumphant song in my heart
and a victory of a smile on my face
I realized what I came for
I realized what I found
I lost it long ago
and I don’t know how I managed without
it
But Yesterday
For myself and all who
cared and care for me
Yesterday
with feet in the clouds 
and my head in the heavens
And as the wind beat at my skin
and as the air flooded my eyes
I
yes
I 
gained my confidence back

how life
precursors life
and irony needs but
a slight nudge
to motivate it
a word
an act
a thought
Looking back
I don’t think I am wrong
I still don’t
even though
there are words
on the screen
that say I am
To me
the penalties
are high if I’m wrong
I don’t think I’d be able to forgive myself
But I’m not second guessing
I don’t buy it
Maybe
it’s not something to be bought
or purchased
or even comprehended
I should be able
to let my better sense
flail in the wind
and just go with the flow
of apathy driven sentiments
I should be able to mourn now
But I never believed him
and I hate him for occupying my head
with his reality
or his lies
It shouldnt matter to me
I’m just as bad as he is
except
I’m not dead
And I don’t think he is
either

sometimes
you can just tell it’s going to be
a bad day
Absoloutely nothing can be wrong
but
deep down inside
you know something will be
Some gut feeling
that the world is just lulling your defenses
down
so it can strike
quick
and devastating
leaving you
alone to pick up
the pieces
of yourself.
I feel automated
artificial
unreal
surreal
nothere
And it’s killing me
inside
I find myself
getting
upset
and angry
at stupid little things
that have nothing
to do with me
or
happened in the past
that no good is done
now
by thinking about it
Everything seems
like
a deep pool of despair
and I’m drowning in it

These ideas are nightmares for white parents, whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
Like whatever they say has no bearing, it’s so scary in a house that allows no swearing
to see him walking around with his headphones blaring, alone in his own zone, cold and he don’t care
He’s a problem child, and what bothers him all comes out, when he talks about, his fuckin’ dad walkin’ out
cuz he just hates him so bad that he blocks him out. If he ever saw him again he’d probably knock him out
His thoughts are wacked, he’s mad so he’s talkin’ back, talkin’ black, brainwashed from rock and rap
He sags his pants, do-rags and a stocking cap, his step-father hit him, so he socked him back
and broke his nose, his house is a broken home. There’s no control, he just let’s his emotions go… 
C’mon! Sing with me 
Sing for the year 
Sing for the laughter
sing for the tear 
Sing it with me
Just for today
Maybe tomorrow
The good Lord will take you away… 
Entertainment is changin’, intertwinin’ with gangstas, in the land of the killers, a sinner’s mind is a sanctum
unholy, only have one homie, only this gun, lonely cuz don’t anyone know me
Yet everybody just feels like they can relate, I guess words are a mothafucka they can be great
or they can degrate, or even worse they can teach hate
It’s like these kids hang on every single statement we make, like they worship us/plus all the stores ship us platinum, now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen?
From standin’ on corners and porches just rappin’; to havin’ a fortune, no more kissin’ ass
But then these critics crucify you, journalists try to burn you, fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you
To get they hands on every dime you have, they want you to lose your mind every time you mad
So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon. Any dispute won’t hesitate to produce handguns
That’s why these prosecutors wanna convict me, strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly
But all they kids be listenin’ to me religiously, so I’m signin’ CDs while police fingerprint me
They’re for the judge’s daughter but his grudge is against me. If I’m such a fuckin’ menace, this shit doesn’t make sense 
It’s all political, if my music is literal, and I’m a criminal how the fuck can I raise a little girl?
I couldn’t. I wouldn’t be fit to. You’re full of shit too, Guerrera, that was a fist that hit you! 
C’mon! Sing with me 
Sing for the year 
Sing for the laughter
sing for the tear 
Sing it with me
Just for today
Maybe tomorrow
The good Lord will take you away… 
They say music can alter moods and talk to you, well can it load a gun up for you , and cock it too?
Well if it can, then the next time you assault a dude, just tell the judge it was my fault and I’ll get sued
See what these kids do is hear about us totin’ pistols and they want to get one cuz they think the shit’s cool
not knowin’ we really just protectin’ ourselves, we entertainers, of course the shit’s affectin’ our sales, you ignoramus
But music is reflection of self, we just explain it, and then we get our checks in the mail. It’s fucked up ain’t it?
How we can come from practically nothing to being able to have any fuckin’ thing that we wanted
That’s why we sing for these kids, who don’t have a thing except for a dream, and a fuckin’ rap magazine
who post pin-up pictures on they walls all day long, idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs
Or for anyone who’s ever been through shit in their lives, till they sit and they cry at night wishin’ they’d die
Till they throw on a rap record and they sit, and they vibe. We’re nothin’ to you but we’re the fuckin’ shit in they eyes
that’s why we seize the moment try to freeze it and own it, squeeze it and hold it, cuz we consider these minutes golden
and maybe they’ll admit it when we’re gone. Just let our spirits live on, through our lyrics that you hear in our songs and we can… 
C’mon! Sing with me 
Sing for the year 
Sing for the laughter
sing for the tear 
Sing it with me
Just for today
Maybe tomorrow
The good Lord will take you away
C’mon! Sing with me 
Sing for the year 
Sing for the laughter
sing for the tear 
Sing it with me

develepment
and construction
of a former notion
and state of being
where euphonic awakenings
and melodic understandings
are common events
dancing sentiments
in euphoric constitutions
finding solice
in the solistice of a new
morning
and in the equinox
of a new life
that is hardly that
recycled thoughts
and reused dreams
Retented to a poignant point
of weary eyed
dreams
looking past the signs
and looking into the words
and letters
Letting it all fall away
in lazy circles
into the crevice of
indifference
The time is anew
in the pointlessness of itself
And the shadows
are just a product of the light
in the hope for the moment

and shined through
the soundless lightning
that discanted my path

my heart

of my journey
I found the voice of the chant
was my own
and it echoed agaisnt the distant
storm
of heat
I am the thunder

and leave a white

ruining it in my eyes

Life has seemed to slow down
to a painful crawl
itching at my irratation
screaming out at
the mundane cycles
wishing it would all
just grant
some variation of a reprieve
But it just meanders along
dragging me by the neck
of my discomfort
painstakinly snapping my resolve
and replacing it
with a wanton lust
for sleep
But sleep is not be
a vicious tease

remember in middle school
or even high school
when it made sense
the freedoms
the liberties
the basic human rights
When the unity in united
didn’t just apply to those of natural 
geographical birth
But to everyone
to grace
the new world
when those voted
to represent
your concerns
and your thoughts
in the grand stage
for existence
when the constitution
had constitution
Was it all propaganda
Dead is the manifest destination
of the human condition
No longer do we find ourselves
in a democracy of our peers
No we bow down to the dictatorship
of the almighty economy
Money is power
and those with it wield it 
and abuse the now forgotten
substance
that this was all formed on
Hate and fear
dictate decisions
Right
and wrong
faded into the turmoil
of
childish bickering
Our streets flow
with the anguished blood
of our corrupted nation
No longer for the many
for the one
Has everyone forgotten
the standards
that were handed to us years ago
We have dropped the ball
tripping around the ruins
of a wonderful dream
We have failed our fore fathers
and everyone who bled
and died
for this dream
It was never about politics
it was about fighting back
agaisnt
the fear
and anger
instilled
in our human geonome
A stab out into the dark
a tiny flicker in the shadows
that is nearing snuffing itself out
Remember when every man
Every man
was created equal?
And remember when one could 
truly be proud to be an american
Remember the pride
remember the dream
remember hearing the stars and stripes
for the first time
Remember the piccolo solo?
I do.

Counting helps the hiding, but what I seek I’m not finding.

~The press spoke then of suicide, but in the essence, it is not. It is not even a protest. What the monks said in the letters they left before burning themselves aimed only at alarming, at moving the hearts of the oppressors, and at calling the attention of the world to the suffering endured then by the Vietnamese. To burn oneself by fire is to prove that what one is saying is of the utmost importance. The Vietnamese monk, by burning himself, says with all his strength and determination that he can endure the greatest of sufferings to protect his people. To express will by burning oneself, therefore, is not to commit an act of destruction but to perform an act of construction, that is, to suffer and to die for the sake of ones people. This is not suicide.
Suicide is an act of self-destruction, having as causes the following: (1) lack of courage to live and to cope with difficulties; (2) defeat by life and loss of all hope; (3) desire for nonexistence.. The monk who burns himself has lost neither courage nor hope; nor does he desire nonexistence. On the contrary, he is very courageous and hopeful and aspires for something good in the future. He does not think that he is destroying himself; he believes in the good fruition of his act of self-sacrifice for the sake of others. I believe with all my heart that the monks who burned themselves did not aim at the death of their oppressors but only at a change in their policy.~

are there
in eternity?~
The cool air
staving off the

bulbous

A result
of the inclement weather

much

giants
And it seems
that for this moment
it’s just me
And there is hollowness
in that
The moments
when I feel right
a part of the earth
It’s just me
noone to share
even if I’m not
I’m alone in my feelings
Sometimes
I just want someone there
to share it with me
and 
understand
me.

somethings I just cannot
seem to come
to grips with
I try too hard to be
a poet
I’m not a poet
I don’t know if
I will ever be one
If a poet is decided by
his form
patterns
modes
rhyme
then I am not a poet
If a poet
is but a state of mind
I am most certainly
not a poet
A little while back
I pretended to be a poet
I took some words
and I dressed them up as a 
poem
I went to a website
and donated my words
as a poem
Not to be known of course
no
no
I sent it off
in hopes of winning
Yes
money
I masqueraded this tiny
little entry
consisting
of my thoughts
on a certain
misty morning
in feburary
A month or so later
I find an email
stating
my stature as a premier
new poet
and how they
wanted my words
to be published in
a coffee table rendition
of poems in america
I 
of course
in my selfish dirvish
of ego-centricism
was only to happy
to sign my name
and send the check
Soon after
another email was found
inviting me
to washington
to read my words aloud
and recieve a reward
for my outstanding achievement
And
if I do 
bless them
with my wonderfully superfluous
presence
I may be
named
the creme’ala creme’
of poetry
The next coming of frost..
poe
you name it
My ego was far from in check
Look at me
I’m a fucking poetry god
But as in all things
These wonderous gather’s of poetic 
sentiments
hide themselves
within the words
the speak
All this 
wonder
all this 
glory
is contingent
to but one thing
The prowess
of my
wallet
Yes
they would make you
their
poetry king
if you
could afford the crown
In an instant
of realism
I find myself
not a god
not a wonder
not a poet
not at all
Disgusted
and disturbed
I am ashamed with
myself
and I am abhorred
with these
poetic guises
Preying
on those
who bleed themselves
unto paper
and use
that blood
mixed with  
their sweat
and tears
to form the written
expression
of their very souls
Only to have it
ripped away
from their mortal grasps
and sent to the grimey clutches
of broken dreams
and shattered hope.
I still recieve their emails
asking for my check
begging me
to reserve my spot
So I can speak my words
and play with those
priveleged enough
to be there
But
those emails meet
my delete button
after a moments reflection
of what could have been
and inside
my ego dies
just a little more
But it is not to be
I have no buisness at
a poetry convention
I am not a poet

This is why 
This is why I don’t care
what happens when I die
This is why I don’t judge people
This is why I don’t go to church
This is why I don’t pray
This is why I look past miracles and see numbers
This is why I see hypocrites hiding behind their beliefs
in the name of themselves
This is why you don’t respect me
This is why I keep still my mouth
This is why I’ll never say your wrong in your feelings
just your action
This is why you don’t get christianity
this is why
this is why
This is why I am a better follower of jesus
than you’ll ever be
This is why I am an atheist
It’s a matter of faith
or lack there of
Man is scared
we
are a frightened
that in all of our grandeur
all the things we
come to conquer in life
that we have no right to
We can’t control death
We can hinder it
but it always comes
so
we make a god
and have it
“control” everything
including the end
And deep down inside
where we hide secrets from ourselves
we vainly believe we can control death
by controlling the face
we flung up to the heavens
we might control our fears
This is why
This is why
We are slaves to the games
we play
We
are lost
in the puzzles we make
I may be wrong
or I may be right
either way
I’m living my life to the fullest
and I’ll beat death
in my own way
after I’m gone
I am just that
but
hopefully
the memory 
of who I was
who I am
who I will be
will live on
in the minds
of those I loved
I can take solice in that
This why I can love
This is why I can be the best I can
This is why I smile
This is why I have faith

this week seems
themed

I get tired

insulting and berating me
with their outspoken

of going to hell
and being evil

in a dwelling
of uncertainity
what sort of atheist
am I
or am I just a misguided agnostic
Maybe I’m just me
a dreamer
an open eyed
little boy
indifferent in his caring
for all
a spiritualist
in the sense 
of poetic terms
and written fantasy
I have faith in 
what is
right and wrong
when discerning the infinite
shades of grey
I am realist
I am a crypto
I know that there are unknowns
and I know that there isn’t
a divine mind
wielding it all
I won’t worry about where I am
going
for it is the here that matters
and I find release in abstraction
confusion and chaos
nothing is chaotic
and everything is
Embrace the paradox
Outside of your minds
There is no god

To whom it may concern 
I’ve taught about life, and learned about the burn 
I never knew what it was, or if I could continue because 
It changed what I saw you as, and formed the picture that passed 
In my mind and out of my head 
I wake up, sweating in bed 
And I’m feeling some kind of ride 
See the sun shine 
And still I’m alright 
I’m breathing just fine 
I look the same to you 
But I see you through 
A haze 
On these 
Doublestacked days

blowing in my face

is howling outside
Whipping across the edges
rounding the cube
Until
everything
is a perfect circle
of normality
in the name
of individuality
Cornering angles
broken angels
Red ink
and red paint
doesn’t replace
the blood
I make
available
for the world to see
In the things
I do
and the things I see
It’s in the things

and things
I feel
that it all matters

drags on
and weighs the waking
down
Until the sun is gone
in spite
of itself
and the night
is here
in spite of me
and Then confusion
descends
and makes it all
go away
In ignorance
I can’t be ashamed

I think
not many people
have much of
a clue
as to
who Iam
I think
I don’t either
so
let me introduce myself
My name is J…Jay…whatever
I am 21
and I
live
in tennessee
hmm
thats not enough…is it?
Shall we try the beginning?
I was born on 
March Twenty-Fourth
nineteen eighty-one
at Palos Hospital
in Palos, IL
…
I pretty much 
lack
a memory of my first four years of life
so lets jump ahead
to
little five year old Jay
living in Lockport, IL
Now
I think this time of my life was
rather typical
running around
playing in the fields
finding
and catching anything I could
urinating
anywhere I wanted
and showing off
abnormally large fecal matter
that happened to be
produced via
me
Normality abounding
Then
the single most influential thing
in my life happened
School
It all went down hill from school
You see
at school
I learned all sorts of wonderful things
Like
how my freedom to run in the fields is now
somewhat limited
and that freedom to urinate wherever you choose
is now
frowned upon
But most importantly
I learned I was fat
and I learned about being popular
or..even more so
How I wasn’t
It’s amazing really
how someone’s life
can be traced all the way back to first grade
You see
it’s there that all your important life decisions happen
You’re either accepted by people
or you’re not
Sure
things can change as
time goes on
but it’s that first intial
initation that makes all the difference
So
I spent my years trying to find my niche
in the average school
I spent the first couple
a bully
but that wasn’t very fufilling
then I tried being a troublemaker..
but I started to miss recess
then
I finally settled in as a nothing
Non-existant
non-speaking
non-being that would walk the hallways
in silence
trying not to be noticed
trying not to care
This
unfortunetly
sucked
Because it was then
that the ridcule came
It was from this time
that I can truly say
I can understand why kids now
bring guns to school…
It seemed like some people
had nothing better to do
but make my life worse than it already was
Looking back
I can’t help
but feel
that empty coldness
of rage
I’d like to think
that if things
would have different
then
things would be different now
But I know better
I think…
So
I continued being nothing
all the way through high school
Where the bottom
dropped out on me
again
and everything changed
and I found myself
lost
all over again.
But
I think
that’s a story
for another time
because
I have lost my train of thought

I do think
You misunderstood
the situation
You think
my rage
fuels this fire?
You think my pain
is my anger
and strength
is my revenge?
I may see red
but it is
a calmer shade
than that
More of
a earthish
hue
Where peace
and calm
Force
reason
out
to play
I hurt
I know
you know
But this cannot
fix
what is ailing me
This wound is deep
and this wound
is infected
with all the 
bullshit
and the crap
in the world
today
In my mind
I can
fly
off the pavement
and soar
But outside
of my heart
I know that
the stones
eagerly
await my blood
at the bottom
This rage
This hate
I need not
I can love
and I can feel
and I can rise above this
I can soar
even with my eyes open

Believe me, if all those endearing young charms, 
Which I gaze on so fondly to-day 
Were to change by to-morrow, and fleet in my arms, 
Like fairy-gifts fading away, 
Thou wouldst still be adored, as this moment thou art, 
Let thy loveliness fade as it will, 
And around the dear ruin each wish of my heart 
Would entwine itself verdantly still. 
It is not while beauty and youth are thine own, 
And they cheeks unprofaned by a tear, 
That the fervor and faith of a soul can be known, 
To which time will but make thee more dear; 
No, the heart that has truly loved never forgets, 
But as truly loves on to the close, 
As the sun-flower turns on her god, when he sets, 
The same look which she turned when he rose.

I’m not saying there’s no god, that’s not for me to say,
all I’m saying is the Earth was not made in a day.
Fuck, fuck, fuck,
fuck the Creationists.
Break it down.
Ah damn, this is a funky jam!
I’m about ready to kick this bitch back in.
Check it.
Fuck the damn creationists I say it with authority,
because kicking their punk asses be me paramount priority.
Them wack-ass bitches say, “evolution’s just a theory”,
they best step off, them brainless fools, I’ll give them cause to fear me.
The cosmos is expanding every second, every day,
but their minds are shrinking as they close their eyes and pray.
They call their bullshit science like the word could give them cred,
if them bitches be scientists then cap me in the head.
Bass!
Bring that shit in!
Ah yeah, that’s right, fuck them all motherfuckers.
Fucking punk ass creationists trying to set scientific thought back 400 years.
Fuck that!
If them superstitious motherfuckers want to have that kind of party,
I’m going to put my dick in the mashed potatoes.
Fucking creationists.
Fuck them.

Harm me with harmony.
Doomsday, drop a load on ’em.
Entropy, how can I explain it? I’ll take it frame by frame it,
to have you all jumping, shouting saying it.
Let’s just say that it’s a measure of disorder,
in a system that is closed, like with a border.
It’s sorta, like a, well a measurement of randomness,
proposed in 1850 by a German, but wait I digress.
“What the fuck is entropy?”, I here the people still exclaiming,
it seems I gotta start the explaining.
You ever drop an egg and on the floor you see it break?
You go and get a mop so you can clean up your mistake.
But did you ever stop to ponder why we know it’s true,
if you drop a broken egg you will not get an egg that’s new.
That’s entropy or E-N-T-R-O to the P to the Y,
the reason why the sun will one day all burn out and die.
Order from disorder is a scientific rarity,
allow me to explain it with a little bit more clarity.
Did I say rarity? I meant impossibility,
at least in a closed system there will always be more entropy.
That’s entropy and I hope that you’re all down with it,
if you are here’s your membership.
You down with entropy?
Yeah, you know me! 
Who’s down with entropy?
Every last homey!
Defining entropy as disorder’s not complete,
’cause disorder as a definition doesn’t cover heat.
So my first definition I would now like to withdraw,
and offer one that fits thermodynamics second law.
First we need to understand that entropy is energy,
energy that can’t be used to state it more specifically.
In a closed system entropy always goes up,
that’s the second law, now you know what’s up.
You can’t win, you can’t break even, you can’t leave the game,
’cause entropy will take it all ‘though it seems a shame.
The second law, as we now know, is quite clear to state,
that entropy must increase and not dissipate.
Creationists always try to use the second law,
to disprove evolution, but their theory has a flaw.
The second law is quite precise about where it applies,
only in a closed system must the entropy count rise.
The earth’s not a closed system’ it’s powered by the sun,
so fuck the damn creationists, Doomsday get my gun!
That, in a nutshell, is what entropy’s about,
you’re now down with a discount.
Trash Talk 
Hit it!
Doomsday, kick it in!

~I never really understood the whole idea of serenity or peace until I saw this guy in a gas station.  I was getting some air in my bike tire, and he pulled up to get some gas in a van.  When he got out to work the pump, a small dog jumped out of the van and trotted away.  Cute little dog.  So the guy stopped pumping gas and called, really soft, for the dog to come and get back in the van.  But the dog didn’t come.  The guy called a little harder, kind of walking just in back of the dog, and it still wouldn’t come, and so he called a little harder, then a little harder, and pretty soon he was screaming and swearing and chasing this little dog all over the gas station, insane with rage, a wild animal almost frothing at the mouth.  And when he was just about ti gi completely into a state of crackers, the dog looked at him, wagged his tail, and jumped into the van and sat on the seat while the guy went back and finished pumping gas.  I figure the dog had serenity.

Birth Totem Falcon is one whose outer personality is full of movement as he flies through his daily existence seeking to forge the way ahead so that others may benefit from his ability to scout new territory. 
Yet while the Falcon desires to lead, if she has not yet explored both the outer skies of her own personality (as won on the wings of experience), and integrated this Knowledge into the Life Path (as represented through her Power Totem), then she will not have the tools necessary for true leadership 
Only by first thoroughly exploring her own territory, discovering the motivations behind her desire to lead and the thirst to blaze new trails, may she then have the sufficient strength to carry her further into unknown territory without causing harm to either her own inner psyche, or to lead Others into a hurricane of spiritual angst. 
When one with Birth Totem Falcon has integrated the Personality with the Life Path (Soul Lesson/Power Totem) then the beauty of the falcon on the wing is a glorious one to behold. She will rip through the sky as an arrow speeding toward its target. His approach to his lessons will be as though they are prey to be perceived, tackled and consumed so that the lesson will not need to be repeated. 
In ancient times, the falcon was the hunting companion to the aristocracy. As such, these splendid creatures were treated with honor and respect for their keen eyesight, speed of flight, and precision of movement. Likewise, the individual with Falcon as their Birth Totem possesses the ability to time their movements along their Life Path with grace and awareness, resulting in a quickened integration with each Direction that is faced along the Sacred Hoop of Life. This then brings them the requisite experience to fashion the tail feathers of true Leadership, and thus satisfies the Higher Selfs motivation.

Apparently I wasn’t
I’m sorry that
my
brainwaves
don’t match
up to
to doctoral ones
in your head

I know that
why don’t you
Is that too much
for you
to comprehend?
I’m sorry that you have issues
with this
I don’t

your problems

You made one
by bringing it up again

of this funking feeling

how to say
That I move this
fast

development

circles

pointing to nowhere

of summer
lies
in the bitter stormy night

Another dream that will never come true 
Just to compliment your sorrow 
Another life that I’ve taken from you 
A gift to add on to your pain and suffering 
Another truth you can never believe 
Has crippled you completely 
All the cries you’re beginning to hear 
Trapped in your mind, and the sound is deafening 
Let me enlighten you 
This is the way I pray 
Living just isn’t hard enough 
Burn me alive, inside 
Living my life’s not hard enough 
Take everything away 
Another nightmare about to come true 
Will manifest tomorrow 
Another love that I’ve taken from you 
Lost in time, on the edge of suffering 
Another taste of the evil I breed 
Will level you completely 
Bring to life everything that you fear 
Live in the dark, and the world is threatening 
Let me enlighten you 
This is the way i pray 
Living just isn’t hard enough 
Burn me alive, inside 
Living my life’s not hard enough 
Take everything away 
Return to me 
Leave me no one 
Turn to me 
Return to me 
Cast aside 
You’ve made me turn away 
Living just isn’t hard enough 
Burn me alive, inside 
Living my life’s not hard enough 
Take everything away

I’ve been here before
Should I proceed?
I won’t hurt
Although

I know it will
I need to try

It doesn’t matter

It’s a matter of faith
it’s a matter of procrastination
It’s a matter of pride

yes
I don’t know
Thats the problem
I’ve lost sight
of the point
and the desire
I need to recommit
before I have my peace
So
I will
set this path before me
Not to fail
Not to succeed
Just to attempt
and
perhaps
maybe
enjoy myself
and learn
A constant state of learn
This could be fun
So
I prepare to
purge within
let loose every sin
I know I can never win
Shall I begin?

this
dry sensation
in my mouth

I’d like
to take this time
to admit
to some things
that I honestly like
that I hardly mention
in fear
of scaryesque looks
I like Godzilla
I like Wrestling
I liked the power rangers
I like not liking reality tv
I like Pee Wee’s Playhouse
I like Chumbawumba
I like being a tree-hugger
I like spearmint flavoured gum
I like opera
I like chewing gum for hours
I like to sit in the bathroom and do nothing
I like to forget where I was going with this
I swear..

this
with
a degree
of seperation
I don’t want
to get drained
I don’t want to burn
out

I can do this

my ideals
Now
I just need to
figure
what my standards
and ideals
are exactly.

I once had
a dream
that I was king of the world
I rule
with a gentle heart
and a nursing fist
Everyone was happy
everyone was healthy
and The world was clean
and thriving
But then
I got greedy
and ended it all
Let loose my monster
and let loose my rage
I flung it all out to sea
and let my faith die
with them
It’s just no fun
being king
sometimes

catches up to me

I’m lost
And alone in my journey
and my task

I’ve chewed on this gum
an hour too long

the moments
slow down
Or speed up
I can never tell
My head is
filled
with politcal bullshit
and my mouth
is touched
with hints

that I tried to forget
But I failed
my hands are greased
and my mind is fattened
But Hell
that never stopped me before

of ice
In my mouth
is a wonderful sensation

One part wet
So much better than
gum

down my dried throat
after each crunch

arm
taps impatiently

yellow gold
aspects of light

of you
Your condenscending
glare

Do they?

I wanted
the stuff around me
to be the best
and
I used to think that too
I thought that
the Orland Mall was the biggest mall
in the world
That the Lockport Bridge was the longest
bridge
And
the Sears Tower
was the tallest building
in the world
~and still is damnit~
I’m not too concerned about that stuff
anymore
But
I miss the mall
the bridge
and the downtown skyline
every day
Somethings
are just tough
to let go of

~from my black book of crazy~
water drips
off the pavement
with delicate
deliberance
Washing down 
the streets
down my heart
facing my pain
and my angst
It drives through
Shattering 
my will
leaving me
a mere shell
to be broken
apart in the
still wind
And as my resolve
crumbles and
floats away
Rain lightly
showers down
Marking the
passing
"

~from my black book of crazy~
The fly struggles
agaisnt the invisible
wall
Unsure of how it
arrived here
Not comprehending
how to leave
The sky is there
the trees
This should not be
What is holding me back
I slip into my
resolve
I let the fly go..
I’m still here
No escape
I can see the glass

smoke in my face
thoughts
in my head
These things
were prolly for the best
…
~It irks me
that I cannot spell
probably
and use prolly instead~
But
It doesn’t make it right
or wrong
or anything
Morale truthes
are relative
most things
are

was my last cutural
anthropology
class
And I am saddened

throughly

my desire
to be something

two directions

neither give me a destination

where I am going

where I am

Well
here I am
la la la
exciting..isn’t it?
No?
ok..
The miles passed
by
in some lucid
dis
awakening state
The minutes pass
like this now
Watching the road
Watching the phone
watching this screen
It all goes on
It always does
Life does have teeth
But that doesn’t mean
it bites
It’s busy
consuming
it’s own tail
if you get chewed with it
Thats up to you
endure
enjoy
I am so weary now
Of this
of that
I just
want
to disappear
for a short while
Good thing I am
But
there are things to
be attended to
Before I go
People to see…
hints to lay forth
And composure to gain
~and now
for my six thousandth noter,
Mel, you are the shiznit
heh..entry 2001 shall be all yours
but you’re going to have to wait
til I get back
k?
k
maybe..prolly..I should make 
those shirts?~

two grand in the bag
And this bag
is getting
awfully heavy
Wouldn’t it be great

go a dollar for every entry?

well…it seems
I find myself writing this
a wee bit earlier
than I intended
No..I’m not back yet
I’m in a lovely little
cabin of a library
in Cable
Wisconsin
On a
cold
wet
day.
But enough of
that
there is a task at hand
Mel
My meeting of mel is a result
of ODS
most of the good things
in my life are a side effect of ODS
which I am grateful for
I can’t remember exactly
~forgive me~
But she must have been a result of
my note-whoring
Somehow
we started exchanging notes
and then instant messages
and
it’s just been grand since
Mel is a fun person
and I think she knows it sometimes
and sometimes she doesn’t
She was the first to introduce me
to “huzzah”
and I still haven’t a clue
to what that means
I introduced her to Damn skippy
she showed me damn diggety
together
we formed damn skiggety 
~tshirts…yes..I know~
We both appreciate
the fine cinematic perfomances
of One
Bruce Campbell
And I severely enjoy
flaunting
my evil dead references
that she lacks
in front of her
~bad J~
But
Mel has had it rough
from guys
to work
to family
and back again
It hasn’t been easy for her
But she has her cats
and she has her wits
She’s amazingly strong like that
In a similar situation
I would have crumpled
and faded away
Not Mel
no
Mel is the shiznit
~chuckle~
All in all
I feel honoured to know her
and even more so
to call her a friend
Damn Skiggety
Mel!

~my wife just got done reading some of your entries 
and these are her words “my oh my, if this is what you really want people to read, you seem to be sacrificing quality for quantity. very disappointing. I’ll return when there are fewer entries.” ~
I hate to “waste”
entries
but this bothers me
Obviously
this gentleman~i assume~
and his wife
haven’t truly read anything
of mine
Last I checked
Nothing
of mine
is quality
And even more so
This is
above all
A diary
and no matter
How badly
I do want people
to read
this
I do
Do remind you
that it is mine
and I’ll see
fit to waste it
however I like it
Along those lines
I truly believe
that these past hundred or 
so entries
were
Me
not some manufactured
appliance of words
made to sound
cool
or be
“poetic”
Just me
This has never been
quality
or quantity
just me
and I appreciate
your
criticism
~although that really wasn’t criticism.~
but
please
next time
leave your name
or…atleast
have your wife
leave her own messages.

this is me
going away
from where I want to
be
this is me
just wanting to be in the arms
that just felt so right
this is me
barely awake
and not fully prepared for
this drive
I must take
this is me
who’s arm slightly burns
and paid too much for his new
tattoo
This is me
wishing we had more time
and more chances to be together
This is me
dreading going back
already feeling this wave of sadness
pressing down
This is me
who is in  a constant
state of missing you
this is me
planning when to come up next
This Is Me
waiting for time
to see you
again

So
this has reared 
itself
in my life again
I haven’t been thinking
about it
Even
when I was up there
I didn’t worry about it
This issue
this problem
you have with my mother
It needs not involve
me
You don’t need
to have the last word
When I haven’t said a word
Send me an email
telling me
I am now blocked
It doesn’t work
if I never email you
You say you did
it
to make sure
your sister doesn’t drag me
into it
So you do it for her?
I’m trying
really hard
not to just lose it all
in
some fiery ball
of rage
But I know better
I just wish you never sent
that email
I almost had forgotten
it all

feelings
of neglect
wash over me
I’m suddenly very alone
and noone
is here to comfort me
But thats ok
I’m just being selfish
and on the outside
I can pretend it doesn’t matter
But when the night comes
and
I find myself
in a cold lonesome 
On the inside
It matters

~There comes a point when you have to put the books down, turn off the teachers, and ignore the noise of the external world so you can expand the world inside yourself. There are some who believe we are born knowing everything already, and that life is simply a process of remembering. There are times when you find yourself sharing this opinion, usually when you are not trying to learn something, but it comes in anyway, unannounced and clumsy with its lessons. These moments of awareness are often so profound, you actually distrust learning which happens any other way.
Your lesson in this life is to take a little time getting to know these uninvited truths better before you give them the best seat in the house. Use books and teachers as a beginning for your explorations instead of as a substitute for them. Trust your own eyes more. Believe your own heart more.
Your task in this life is to get used to that often uncomfortable feeling inside you that is waiting for something to fill it. Realize there is no hurry to do this, that everything comes in its own time, and at its own pace. And while you are waiting, there is much to inspire you and prepare the way. Read everything and believe nothing until it touches you personally. Only then will you know its truth is compatible with the furnishings of your soul.~

For you 
I had forgotten
these simple times
simple frames of mind
Complex thoughts
that come out
easy
Take a step back
Everything is
brand new
Like this beat in
my head
overanalyzed
and misconstrued
Can something 
be something
when
the process
to be something
amounts to nothing
For you
I had remembered
every moment
to this moment
Each tear
Each laugh
all the hate
all the love
It all matters
in the here and now
Then and where
Nothing is pointless
none to be shamed
For you
I realized
that it all doesn’t matter
and for that reason
It does matter
For you
for me
for everyone
everywhere
Your body crumbled away
You heart lay unaltered
Altared away
a beacon
of truth
For you
yeah
this is for you

will fall down

Look, if you had one shot or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment 
Would you capture it or just let it slip?
Yo, his palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy 
There is vomit on his sweater already 
Moms forgettin’ he’s nervous 
But on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drops bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth but the words won’t come out
He’s choking, how? Everybody’s jokin’ now
The clock’s run out, time’s up, over BLOW! 
Snap back to reality, oh there goes gravity
Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked, he’s so mad
But he won’t give up that easy, no he won’t have it
He knows his whole back’s to these ropes
It don’t matter, he’s dope, he knows that 
But he’s broke, he’s so sad that he knows
When he goes back to this mobile home 
That’s when it’s back to the lab again, yo 
This whole rhapsody, better go capture this moment
And hope it don’t collapse on him 
You better lose yourself in the music 
The moment you own it you better never let it go, oh
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
Cuz opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo 
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment you own it you better never let it go, oh
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow 
Cuz opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo 
Soul’s escapin’ through this hole’s that is gaping
This world is mines for the taking 
Make me king as we move toward a new world order
A normal life is boring 
But superstardom’s close to post mortem
It only grows harder, homie grows hotter
He blows us all over, these hoes is all on him 
Coast to coast shows, he’s known as the Globetrotter
Lonely roads got him 
He knows he’s grown farther from home, he’s no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter 
But hold ya nose cuz here goes the cold water 
These hoes don’t want him no mo’, he’s cold prada
They moved on to the next shmo who flows
Who nose dove and sold nada 
And so the so proper 
His toll, it unfolds and I suppose it’s old, partner
But the beat goes on 
Duh duh doe, duh doe, dah dah dah dah
You better lose yourself in the music 
The moment you own it you better never let it go, oh
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
Cuz opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo 
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment you own it you better never let it go, oh
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow 
Cuz opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo 
No more games, I’ma change for due called rage
Tear this muthafuckin’ roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin’ in the beginnin’, the mood all changed 
I’ve been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin’ and stepped writin’ the next cipher
Best believe somebody’s payin’ the pied piper 
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can’t get by with my nine to five
And I can’t provide the right type of life for my family
Cuz, man, these goddamn food stamps don’t buy diapers
And there’s no movie, there’s no Mekhi Pfifer 
This is my life and these times are so hard 
And it’s gettin’ even harder tryin’ to feed and water
My seed plus teeter-totter 
Caught up between bein’ a father and a pre-madonna
Baby momma drama, screamin’ on her
Too much for me to wanna stay in one spot 
Another damn or not has gotten me to the point
I’m like a snail, I’ve got to formulate a plot 
Or end up in jail or shot 
Success is my only muthafuckin’ option, failure’s not
Momma love you but this trailer’s got to go
I cannot grow old in Salem’s Lot 
So here I go, it’s my shot
Feet fail me not
Cuz maybe the only opportunity that I got 
You better lose yourself in the music 
The moment you own it you better never let it go, oh
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
Cuz opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo 
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment you own it you better never let it go, oh
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow 
Cuz opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo 
Duh doo 
You can do anything you set your mind to, man

I heard somewhere
that selfish writing
tends to be
the best
and that the more
selfless sort
leaves something to be desired
Okay
I lied
I just made that
up
But
I think it stands true
I always wanted to think
or tried to believe
that my perspective
should be avoided
at all costs
I should be more universal
in my outlook
I mean
I have to keep the readers
in mind
Unfortunetly
This just creates
stale
boring words
disenchantedly arrainged
to resemble
some coherent crap
…
But there are choices
to be made
Big choices
Decisive ones
Ones that affect
everything
And it all can come
down
to some
tiny
little
insignificant
instance
Where thoughts
are racing
and hearts are pounding
and dreams hang
dangerously
over oblivion
This is the time
for action
Or inaction
Left or right
Up
or
down
The time is now
the moment has arrived
The fate of everything to
come
rest
in your
steady
hand of thought
Decide
…
Inspiration
is a funny thing
It will lay back
in the back of your mind
waiting
for the precise moment
to explode
in an
ephianic
light
Blinding you
to all else
except
to one
sole
and souless drive
One goal
One destination

I left a few hours
later than I had
wanted to
But there was still
plenty of day left
to accomplish my goal
So 
I hopped into my car
rolled down my windows
and turned up the radio
And whistled down 70
to the bank
and then McDonalds
for a late lunch
Then
I jumped onto 40
and headed east
towards my destiny
You see
when I first moved down here
This idea was planted in my head
…
I don’t think I was
obsessed yet….just curious
I heard it was down here..
somewhere
But I didn’t seriously believe
I would find it
Then one day..
I found it while cruising the internet
Only an hour away…
I was hooked
obsessed
And almost
anything I would need to quell 
this newfound obsession
could be found via
online shopping
everything
except
the location..
So I headed east down 40
past Oak Ridge
past Knoxville
all the way to exit 394
to 11E
or..to the locals
aj highway
As I continued my trek east
Scenes played out
in my head
Helped the time pass
still
Anxiously
I sped all the way
Until I arrived at
Panther Creek Road
from there
I moved north
through a needlessly complicated
maze of roads
that mapblast had provided me
I hate mapblast
Anywho..
I eventually found my way
to Kidwell Ridge Road
and from there
Inman Bend
Only three quarters of a mile
from utopia..
I could hardly breathe
I drove slow
annoyingly slow
I didn’t want to miss
I would die if I missed it
And I didn’t
it was
exactly where it should have 
been
Just past Quail Hollow
a little trail 
barred off from
the world
by a single line
of barbed wire
I passed it
once
twice
Just to make sure
then
I pulled over
about 50 yards down
gathered my camera
exited my car
and trodded up towards the entrace
Hyperventilating in excitement…of course
I ducked under the barbed wire 
and got caught..cutting myself
But I didnt’ care
Not at all
I was so close
nothing could stop me
from reaching my nirvana
Except..perhaps
the law..
A few steps
past into the trail
This seed of a thought
planted itself in my brain
I was tresspassing
My car was parked on private property
and I was invading
a seperate
batch of property
I was tresspassing twice over
I almost
Almost
left
but no
Not even the law could stop me
Something like this
Something as wonderful as this
might be above the law
Hell
It is above the law.
So Onward I went
to history
to the now
to the future
The trail became a road
with grass grown over it’s
surface
and fallen trees
blocking it’s usefullness
It was quiet
It was perfect
Then
I turned a corner
and there it was
I could close my eyes
and see the “classic”
pulling down this
very road
and beholding
shangrila
Of course
The it burned down
all that is left
is the fireplace
and scrap metal
But
I didn’t care
I still don’t
It was here
Here
It was here
where Sam would daily
beat the living shit out of Bruce
It was here
where Ellie got raped by trees
It was here
Here
I was in heaven
But
I didn’t dare stay long
My fear of the law
had grown to a point
where I feared my car
wouldn’t be there
when I got back
So
I hurriedly
composed myself
…yes…my eyes
were a bit wet..
and snapped a few pictures
and rushed back towards my car
which was thankfully
still there
A year
A Lifetime wait
was over in fifteen minutes
I had found it
and I had walked it’s sacred grounds
I got into my car
and drove past one last time
As I stared off into
it’s woody confines
A thought passed into my mind
I would be back
Oh yes
I’ll be back
So
I stared my lonely trek west
My heart filled with wonder and sadness
my mind filled with joy and sorrow
I
went
to
the 
Evil
Dead
Cabin

or a hell
To find yourself
wasted away
in monetary grandeur
while your world around
you crumbles
green paper can’t heal
the cracks and fissures
in the foundation 
that it is taken from
The final result
the only result
is devastation
So take the easy way?
Let hate and rage
fuel this fire
of common sensesque
idiocy
Or bite the bullet
and admit you were wrong
to let anger dictate
what is right 
and what is wrong
destroys the concept itself
This is but
a strange
and trying life
Much easier to resent in denial
than to repent in absoloution
There is no weakness in caring
and maturity has no bearing on rage
If so
I never plan on growing up

Worn out places, worn out faces
Bright and early for their daily races
Going nowhere, going nowhere
And their tears are filling up their glasses
No expression, no expression
Hide my head I want to drown my sorrow
No tommorow, no tommorow
And I find it kind of funny
I find it kind of sad
The dreams in which I’m dying

~Every creature on this earth dies alone~
Second time
around
I still don’t get
the sounds
the images
the words
It just passes me by
Leaving only fragments
of understanding

even false understanding
~I promise one day everything will be better for you~
But maybe that just adds
to it
The lack of comprehension
It makes it all the more
appealing
~why do you wear that stupid man suit?~
Things are as they are
and stuff is just stuff
You can be as vague as you want
but it’ll still be relative

But it won’t stop me
from trying
I have too much time
not to try

fill this dismal morning
with shocking chords
of fear
Like a black rainbow of horror
I believe he said
Filtering past
our sensible senses
to prey upon
our more primitve
and basic reactions
And exciting others
Open mouthed
close eyed
your intake 
of air
choked to a stop
at the base of your throat
What you are seeing can’t be real
But the reality is that it 
can be
And then all
the darkness
All the wrongness

Sealing you inside your darkest place
and watching time snuff you out
There is no light switch
no curtain call
This is forever
this is now
It will never end
while you still live
and then some
Or
atleast til the tape

OuroborusEvent: er..no
OuroborusEvent: thats you
OxymoronicKittyn: nope. yer wrong.
OuroborusEvent: nope..you are
OxymoronicKittyn: nope. you are. let me see here..i said “N’sync” then you said crap and you quit. so there.
OuroborusEvent: I did not!
OxymoronicKittyn: you did so!!
OuroborusEvent: crap was my response
OxymoronicKittyn: it’s right up there in black and white!  yes, but then i said indeed.

OxymoronicKittyn: and indeed is like crap

OxymoronicKittyn: and it was over!
OxymoronicKittyn: you messed it up!
OxymoronicKittyn: you quit!
OxymoronicKittyn: I WIN!
OuroborusEvent: No
OuroborusEvent: Heh relates to indeed
OxymoronicKittyn: Yes
OxymoronicKittyn: no it doesn’t.
OuroborusEvent: sure it does
OxymoronicKittyn: i have the rule book right here.
OxymoronicKittyn: *looks it up*
OuroborusEvent: heh always follows indeed
OuroborusEvent: you know I’m right
OxymoronicKittyn: nope..not according to the rulebook
OxymoronicKittyn: fraid yer shit outta luck, duck.
OuroborusEvent: I’m not a duck
OxymoronicKittyn: sure you are
OuroborusEvent: nope
OuroborusEvent: and I still won
OxymoronicKittyn: you sure as hell didn’t.
OxymoronicKittyn: i did.
OuroborusEvent: I did
OxymoronicKittyn: and besides, i came up with better words anyway.
OuroborusEvent: you quit
OxymoronicKittyn: nope, i didn’t. you did.
OuroborusEvent: I woooooon
OxymoronicKittyn: no, I diiiiiiiiid
OuroborusEvent: I did…and I think you should save this..post it…and let people decide who won
OxymoronicKittyn: um…alright you got it. i will.
OxymoronicKittyn: you do the same.
OuroborusEvent: yes ma’am
~
now you can see the problem
I insist that the game ended after mel failed to respond to my “heh” 
which…btw is a standard follow up to indeed
when mel and I converse..so
I felt it was a logical trangression from indeed
While mel seems to think it ended after n’sync
where I used crap..where..again..I think 
is an appropiate response.
So
I turn to you..the reader..to decide who infact
should claim victory in this epic
battle of word association

Last night…
Last night
I pseudo
broke
a cardnial
law of mine
This law
is my highest law
next to
my anti-coffee law
One that has been brewing for the past few years
and perculating in the last year
I might have been drunk
or just plain crazy
But personally
I think it was the lack of quality television
last night
I blame Comcast
Comcast is the devil
So when it came on
My senses were numb
and my inhibitions were down
For I resisted the urge 
to destroy the tv
I merely deposited myself
on the couch
And nearly lost my soul
I’m lucky though
for I fell asleep
An alcoholic blessing in disguise
so I feel asleep
and shortly after I retired
after sleeping through
a good part
of the wicked
evil
show
So I feel
like
my soul is safe
But dirty
so very dirty
I need a cleansing bath
to make my heart
less heavy
and my mind
less regretful
And now
I don’t know what to do
I’m scared to turn on 
the television
That too
might be a blessing in disguise
Oh look
it’s cold and rainy outside
I’ll go play outdoors
It’s safer there.

I understand now
Well
I always understood
But now
It seems real
No
thats not right
It’s still a dream
a distant dream
a lonely boy’s dream
If I remember right
walking down the halls
of an awkward school
Alone in a crowed room
silently crying out for help
in his rapid-eyed stares
The dream involved the end
Maybe self-induced
maybe not
But an end all the same
Things didn’t end there
Endings are never the end.
The boys dream
was to be able to see
beyond his end
See the people he knew
the people he loved
the people he wished loved him
See the hole
in the scheme of things
where he fit 
And see that in his absence
he was finally noticed
and finally cared for
But it was deeper than that
less selfish than that
He wanted to see them happy
Happy to remember him
Happy now to care for him
Just
happy
and thats all he ever wanted
People deserve to be happy
The dream had been forgotten
and time passed on
And today 
just now
It was remembered
But it is just a memory
because the boy has something
that he always wanted then
and it’s better than he ever could imagine
Sure
he’s still lonely
but somewhere in the hints of time
thats ok
Things change
and 
For once
He can truly say
that he is happy.

moistened

some
blackberry flavoured malt cooler
I should have been disappointed by
this
But for some reason
I wasn’t
A meal is a meal
and self-cooked meal is even more

in the eyes of the consumer
and upon the tongue
of the devourer

tonight
I cooked
a fine meal
to stave off boredom

Roberta Ann Sparrow
October, 1944 
-The Tangent Universe-
The Primary Universe is fraught with great peril. War, plague, famine and natural disaster are common. Death comes to us all.
The Fourth Dimension of Time is a stable construct, though it is not impenetrable.
Incidents when the fabric of the fourth dimension becomes corrupted are incredibly rare.
If a Tangent Universe occurs, it will be highly unstable, sustaining itself for no longer than several weeks.
Eventually it will collapse upon itself, forming a black hole within the Primary Universe capable of destroying all existence.
-Water and Metal-
Water and Metal are the elements of Time Travel.
Water is the barrier element for the construction of Time Portals used as gateways between Universes at the Tangent Vortex.
Metal is the transitional element for the construction of Artifact Vessels.
-The Artifact and the Living-
When a Tangent Universe occurs, those living nearest to the Vortex will find themselves at the epicenter of a dangerous new world.
Artifacts provide the first sign that a Tangent Universe has occured.
If an Artifact occurs, the Living will retrieve it with great interest and curiosity. Artifacts are formed from metal, such as an Arrowhead from an Ancient Mayan civilization, or a Metal Sword from Medieval Europe.
Artifacts returned to the Primary Universe are often linked to religious iconography, as their appearance on Earth seems to defy logical explanation.
Divine intervention is deemed the only logical conclusion for the appearance of the Artifact.
-The Living Receiver-
The Living Receiver is chosen to guide the Artifact into position for its journey back to the Primary Universe.
No one knows how or why a Receiver will be chosen.
The Living Receiver is often blessed with Fourth Dimensional Powers. These include increased strength, telekinesis, mind control, and the ability to conjure fire and water.
The Living Receiver is often tormented by terrifying dreams, visions and auditory hallucinations during his time within the Tangent Universe.
Those surrounding the Living Receiver, known as the Manipulated, will fear him and try to destroy him.
-The Manipulated Living-
The Manipulated Living are often the close friends and neighbours of the Living Receiver.
They are prone to irrational, bizarre, and often violent behaviour. This is the unfortunate result of their task, which is to assist the Living Receiver in returning the Artifact to the Primary Universe.
The Manipulated Living will do anything to save themselves from Oblivion.
-The Manipulated Dead-
The Manipulated Dead are more powerful than the Living Receiver. If a person dies within the Tangent Dimension, they are able to contact the Living Receiver through the Fourth Dimensional Construct.
The Fourth Dimensional Construct is made of Water.
The Manipulated Dead will manipulate the Living Receiver using the Fourth Dimensional Construct (see Appendices A and B).
The Manipulated Dead will often set an Ensurance Trap for the Living Receiver to ensure the Artifact is returned safely to the Primary Universe.
If the Ensurance Trap is successful, the Living Receiver is left with no choice but to use his Fourth Dimensional Powers to send the Artifact back in time into the Primary Universe before the Black Hole collapses upon itself.
-Dreams-
When the Manipulated awaken from their journey into the Tangent Universe, they are often haunted by the experience in their dreams.
Many of them will not remember.
Those who do remember the Journey are often overcome with profound remorse for the regretful actions buried within their Dreams, the only physical evidence buried within the Artifact itself, all that remains from the lost world.
Ancient myth tells us the Mayan Warrior killed by an Arrowhead that had fallen from a cliff, where there was no Army, no enemy to be found.
We are told of the Medieval Knight mysteriously impaled by the sword he had not yet built.
We are told that these things occur for a reason.

You remember…don’t you?
I do.
We were in your room
with your friends
doing something very
different for us
in college
We were getting drunk
No…you were getting drunk
I remember you called her up
to come over
She didn’t want to
You handed the phone to me
Knowing
that I could get her over
You knew before I did
how nicely we got along
You knew
and looking back
I can’t believe
you didn’t plan that night..
So I get her to come over
and you pour her a drink
and another
and
another
and you begun your game
of kisses
and whispers
I won’t divulge
the little
girl on girl
lesbian exploration
you had on her drunken state
Oops..I guess I just did
Then we went outside
and look who started smoking when she did
As far as I knew, you didn’t smoke
Atleast you had the curtesy to ask me if I minded
All the while, knowing my answer, even though I wouldn’t say it
So we wander the campus
Drunk Drunk and Buzzed
until a topic arises
of my faithfulness
and my lack of experiences
with anyone
except my current at the time
From there followed a series of humiliating
discussions
going anywhere from
my sleeping habits
to the fine details of my penis
Of course
I was silent
simmering deep down inside
to upset to speak
to upset to think
I just zoned out
and stared at the sky
When I came to
the conversation had
suddenly arrived
at a climax
to which
If she had kissed her friend
I have to kiss her friend
And here is the thing
In that moment
I realized
I wanted to
badly
but
I shrugged it off
Knowing it wasn’t “right”
Knowing that no matter how much
she urged it
Ultimately
the manipulator
of the evening
would be upset
and Looking back
That was the point
She knew
deep down inside
that I really like her friend
and she knew
deep down inside(or maybe not)
that her friend liked me
so
she brought us together
and made the conditions right
and eventually
convinced us to embrace.
So we did
Twice in fact
and it was magic
it was wonderful
and it was exactly what she wanted
When we stopped
and we saw her running away crying
we both went after her
to calm her..and to apologize
and blah blah
blah
needless to say
I never saw the friend again
She promised to stay away from me
never to talk to me
and she did
Guilt is a powerful thing.
As for me
guilt only kept me closer
to the manipulator
I was in a constant state
of making amends
To her, I never did make up for it
A few weeks later
she broke up with me
only to have me take her back the next day
Only to break up with me a month later
for some guy she met online
only to come back and say 
that she did it as a test
I passed
She failed
I saw her one last time
in the fall
just to tell her goodbye
for one last time
She didn’t take the hint
I never answered her phonecalls
and I was never home
when she visited
I haven’t seen her since
I’m glad for that
But I miss that brief moment
in May
Despite it’s intentions
that night was a wonderful night for me
It gave me the strength
to get out.

I don’t know 
how to feel about this
you two stupid fucks
You could have drank all
you wanted here
Spent the night
called the cab
passed out in the rain
It all could have worked
But no
you had to find
“the hot spots”
I wonder if you did
I told you Knoxville didn’t have
any
but I suppose
you found something
you stupid fucks
brothers on the road
twin brothers on the road
drunk twin brothers on the road
When I woke up this morning
and I saw everyone in your wife’s room
I knew what happened
I just didn’t know the circumstances
And now
I don’t know how to feel
It’s easy to be angry
and it is really easy to feel bad
for the single stupid fuck who is left
Who has to deal with the fact
that he has killed his brother
and now
What is your wife supposed to do
your daughter?
There is no way to feel
I’m quite dead inside
Maybe I’ll feel more later
Right now, I’ve got to comfort
my sister.
Oh
Happy New Years.

I understand
infinite sadness now
It just comes in
and consumes you
locking you in
so all that there is
is you
and the sadness
This sadness becomes your jailer
and your companion
a love-hate realtionship
in which everyday
it is all you know
Each moment
is graced
and cursed
with the knowledge of comfort
and with the
fear of reprieve
Soon
it will seem
that existence
isn’t possible
without the sadness

I have a plentitude
of thoughts
wandering through my head
I sat down last night/
early this morning
and just looked
out my window
at the night sky
I watched the stars
twinkle with their ancient light
I watched the clouds
flow gently in
and snuff out the starry sky
I saw the moon
and it’s borrowed shine
linger
rather indifferently
throughout it all
And I watched the sun
briefly rise
and then quickly disappear beneath
a new set
of hazy
grey
clouds
No sleep
No t.v.
no reading
just looking out
at the sky
and thinking
I haven’t sit and thought
for a long time
well..in a long time
In my own special
ego-centrist way
my thoughts seemed
to center on me
I don’t know who I am
I don’t know what my strengths are
what my weakness is
I don’t know what I want out
of life
I don’t know what life wants out of me
Happiness just seems
like a word to me
something you read about
and understand what it is
but cannot comprehend it in reality
I’ve only recently come to understand sadness
There are millions of other words
that I think I know
yet
might not understand
There are some things though
that deep down inside
I do want
I want more than anything
I am convinced
that these things
are the key to
“happiness”
I believe
from happiness
understanding it all
should cascade down
in some grand
dominoesque effect
But I dare not mention these things
or even dwell upon them too much
Such is the sinner among the blessed
Because
also
deep down inside
I don’t think I deserve them
like a lingering “but..”
I’m scared that what I want
might just be what I get
and then I might find out
what I got
really wasn’t what I needed
It all comes down to that really
Fear
I am so used to failure
I’m not sure if I can survive without it
How terrifying would it be
if I got everything I ever wanted?
There is almost a comfort
in my constant failure
I wonder sometimes
if I sabotage myself
in order to be where I am most comfortable
In shame..
I pondered a lot of things last night
I am still pondering now
I think I should go
and try to be happy
I’m just not sure
how to go about it.

I hate when reality
crashes my little
delusional existence of grandeur
Due to recent events
I have been posed a question
and a request
to let my family know
what I want
in case
of my untimely death
Now
normally 
I wouldn’t really think about
But thanks to New Years
Life seems sometimes too easily cut short
and if plans aren’t laid out
the ones who pass away
won’t get what they wanted.
But this is an interesting challenge
because
honestly
I don’t know what I want
buried
cremated
I am clueless
I mean
to me
I beleive death is pretty much
nothing
so it won’t matter much from
my perspective
but funerals and what not
are pretty much for those
who are left
so I have to be considerate
don’t I?
So
first off
No wake.
I hate wakes
I despise wakes
They do nothing by tarnish
the memory.
I don’t think I’d want to be buried
so cremation sounds ok
But
I like the concept of somesort of physical marker
but, whatever
In the most ideal situation
I think I’d want a good ole’ viking funeral
Looking beyond the fact that I have
little to no viking blood in me
I like the idea of sailing away in a burning boat
But
I suppose affordability should be considered.
So
what shall be done?
I don’t know
I really don’t.
Dying is really more complicated
than it should be.

I have a problem that I cannot explain,
I have no reason why it should have been so plain,
Have no questions but I sure have excuse,
I lack the reason why I should be so confused,
I know, how I feel when I’m around you,
I don’t know, how I feel when I’m around you,
Around you,
Left a message but it ain’t a bit of use,
I have the pictures, the wild might be the deuce,
Today you called, you saw me, you explained,
Playing the show and running down the plane,
I know, how I feel when I’m around you,
I don’t know, how I feel when I’m around you,

Seventy six trombones led the big parade
With a hundred and ten cornets close at hand.
They were followed by rows and rows of the finest virtuosos,
the cream of ev’ry famous band. 
Seventy six trombones caught the morning sun, 
With a hundred and ten cornets right behind. 
There were more than a thousand reeds springing up like weeds, 
There were horns of every shape and kind. 
There were copper bottom tympani in horse platoons, 
Thundering, thundering, all along the way. 
Double bell EUPHONIUMS and big bassoons, 
Each bassoon having his big fat say. 
There were fifty mounted cannon in the battery, 
Thundering, thundering, louder than before.
Clarinets of every size and trumpeters who’d improvise 
A full octave higher than the score. 
Seventy six trombones hit the counter point, 
While a hundred and ten cornets played the air. 
To the rhythm of “HARCH, HARCH, HARCH”
All the kids began to march
And they’re marching still, right today!

How to handle a woman?
There’s a way, said the wise old man
A way known by every woman
Since the whole rigamarole began
“Do I flatter her?”, I begged him answer
“Do I threaten or cajole or plead?”
“Do I brood or play the gay romancer?”
Said he, smiling, “No indeed”
“How to handle a woman?
Mark me well, I will tell you, sir
The way to handle a woman
Is to love her
Simply love her
Merely love her, love her, love her”

and onwards out of control

You can’t hate what you don’t know

it’s killing you

Spring is here, a-suh-puh-ring is here.
Life is skittles and life is beer.
I think the loveliest time of the year is the spring.
I do, don’t you?  ‘Course you do.
But there’s one thing that makes spring complete for me,
And makes every Sunday a treat for me.

Such a lovely day
such a lovely waste
stuck in my cement prison
of unfufilled goals
and glutton desires
All the world seems in tune
On a spring afternoon,
When we’re poisoning pigeons in the park.
Every Sunday you’ll see
My sweetheart and me,
As we poison the pigeons in the park.

But it’s ok
really
It’s ok
I know what I’m missing
and today
I’ll take knowledge
over chance
When they see us coming, the birdies all try an’ hide,
But they still go for peanuts when coated with cyanide.
The sun’s shining bright,
Everything seems all right,
When we’re poisoning pigeons in the park.

I can hear the daffodils 
play outside
while the children bloom
I’m perfectly ok
don’t worry about me
We’ve gained notoriety,
And caused much anxiety
In the Audubon Society
With our games.
They call it impiety
And lack of propriety,
And quite a variety
Of unpleasant names.
But it’s not against any religion
To want to dispose of a pigeon.

the sweet sweet scent
of flowers and propane
waft ever so gently unto my 
probiscus
and I can close my eyes
and imagine the beautiful day
that I’m not experiencing
and I’m ok with that
everything is fine
So if Sunday you’re free,
Why don’t you come with me,
And we’ll poison the pigeons in the park.
And maybe we’ll do
In a squirrel or two,
While we’re poisoning pigeons in the park.

I have my digital torture
amidst my mental anguish
fuck the sun
fuck the day
I don’t need it anyway
and now I’m rhyming 
can’t you hear those bells a chiming
everything must be fine
I promise
I’m ok
We’ll murder them all amid laughter and merriment,
Except for the few we take home to experiment.
My pulse will be quickenin’
With each drop of strych’nine
We feed to a pigeon.
(It just takes a smidgin!)
To poison a pigeon in the park.

I’m so happy 
I’m crying
everything is so fine
everything is so ok
in my little big cement prison
where my fears are reality
and my pain is all too 
truely in my head
and it’s beautiful outside

Dear Roberta Sparrow, 
I have reached the end of your book 
and there are so many questions that I 
need to ask you. 
Sometimes I am afraid of what you 
might tell me. Sometimes I am afraid this 
is not a work of fiction. I can only hope 
that the answer will come to me in my 
sleep. 
I hope that when the world comes to an end, 
I can breathe a sigh of relief, because there  
will be so much to look forward to.

When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the Powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature’s God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation. 
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness

I think
sometimes
We forget.

playground school bell rings again
rain clouds come to play again
has no one told you she’s not breathing?
hello i’m your mind giving you someone to talk to
hello

these things start out
in the beginning
and never quite seem
to end
the latent fear
and the joyous innocence
like to play here
no need for goodbye
if i smile and don’t believe
soon i know i’ll wake from this dream
don’t try to fix me i’m not broken
hello i’m the lie living for you so you can hide
don’t cry

We claim things
that aren’t ours
to be claimed
label this
label that
It all falls down
when the music stops
and the tears begin
nothing is forever
not even goodbye
suddenly i know i’m not sleeping
hello i’m still here 
all that’s left of yesterday

And it seems I cannot escape
the way things
are
and the ways things should have been
I’m haunted by 
my failures
and I’m teased by the future
Trapped in today
obessed with last night
last week
I can’t escape myself
and I cannot see
how things
cannot change
Life is dynamic
there is no such
thing
as goodbye.
hello

I wanna be a hero
I want what is right
I want to stand up
I want to be known
yet
unknown
I can be a super hero
I can be that
guy
I wanna save the day
I wanna excel
I wanna rise
I want to get the girl
in the end
I want to bleed
Blood is the passage way
to justice
and manhood
and love
It all pinnacles there
I wanna be your hero.

All the blood and sweat
goes for naught
at times
these words
those prissy
painted
words
just linger
and sit
and eventually fester
at times
The liquid mass
that compells
the smith
to form
such arrangments
eventually goes cold
and dies
Everything dies
eventually
These things
don’t matter to anyone 
else
They can’t
acts like these
are selfish ones
Only the one
who initiates it
looks for pleasure in it
All too often
Only pain is found
and grief
But the persistent
persist
and the foolish
hope to become wise
in their folly

I haven’t written
about me
in here
for awhile.
I try to build
myself up
But for what?
for who?
Noone cares
noone should
I’m just me
and that will never
be good enough
for anyone
I have this
lovely idea
in my
head
about what
I want
who 
I want
All these delightful
little tidbits
that would be
just the closest
thing to perfection.
It kills me
to know
that I’ll never have
this
or that
or any of it.
It destroys me to know
that if anyone chooses
me
it won’t because they
are choosing me
It will because they are settling for me
I’m noone’s dream
I’m noone’s desire
I’m just someones last chance
How can I love
under that circumstance
How can I be loved?
How can I endure 
whan that pretty little
songbird in my head
would never
in a million years 
even consider me?
This is my lament.

Restless tonight
Cause I wasted the light
Between both these times
I drew a really thin line
Its nothing I planned
And not that I can
But you should be mine
Across that line
If I traded it all
If I gave it all away for one thing
Just for one thing
If I sorted it out
If I knew all about this one thing
Wouldnt that be something
I promise I might
Not walk on by
Maybe next time
But not this time
Even though I know
I dont want to know
Yeah I guess I know
I just hate how it sounds

Your nipples
My tongue
Grazing over them

More

I think I
saw you again
last night
while
I slept
I still don’t
know who you
are
I’m not really sure I
ever will

around

you really aren’t

road

or as it were
these things
just scatter
reform
and play
the game all over again

that bliss isn’t achieved through
grandeur

I used to want more
need more
to do
and to have
I wanted to spread out
to the point

flabby self
is thin

I wanted to reach for more
It was implied to me
that this was the way
this is the way
there are no choices
there are always choices
No
I will be content
with this
my spattering of
words
here and there
This is my lot
this is my craft
breathing
existing
Why ask for anything more?
Sure
there is more to be had
I desire
that picture in my head
of a hand in mine
and the notion
that there is something more
to what I have to give
than what I have already given
But these things come in time
So I will continue
to wander further into the dark
Very cold
and very alone
Waiting
searching
for someone to take my hand
and guide me out
of this prescribed
fable
of all things
that matter

I remember a conversation 
I once had with a friend
about snow
well
actually
I vaguely recall a conversation
you really can’t call
it a 
conversation
it was more of
a two statements
that had some bearing on the
other
I miss the person
that I had
this exchange of ideas
with
but thats the way things
go sometimes
Lives and interests and needs follow
individual paths
each to their own
I hope she’s well
But back to snow
I had said something
along the lines
about how
I could never write
about snow
It was
is
something beyond
me
She corrected me on that statement
but despite that
it still stands true
There is something sinisterly
innocent about snow
A lovely indifference in a snowfall
that acts as a powerful medium
to transfer our inner
most feelings
from the depths of ourselves
unto the tip of our tongues
and in our tears
There is so much
pain
and love
in the absence that the white
fluff creates
Winter is like that
hiding in the death
and sleep
is the promise of return
of rebirth
Winter is hardly what it should be
here
and snow is a rare thing
I miss the cold
and beautiful absolution
that snow offers
It makes me yearn for home
but distance and time
has unmade it for me
I’m no longer sure of a home
Home is where the heart is
but I’ve given mine away too often
it’s yet to come back to me
you can’t be love and not be loved
I’m not loved here
or there
I’m no longer sure
of where I am
who I am
or what this all means
But I can always close
my eyes
and see the soft
white dots
drifting downwards in a lazy fashion
Onto my face
my hair
my tongue
I can taste the sweet cold
and I can smell the comfort
that only in my
imagination
I am afforded 
"
2469,https://www.opendiary.com/m/sadmeatcart/12-30-03-9-4262279/,2003-12-29,12/30/03,"
I can try and forget about
misplace the notion
but it’s always there
I suppose it’s inevitable
but I can’t escape the
notion
of now
and then
Tomorrow is just
a faint glimmer
of possibilites
that are too
painful to consider
Each time I’ve gone
it’s been told to me
that this might be the last
and that I should say goodbye
But how can I say goodbye
if I don’t mean it now
or then
this may be the end
or it might be a continuing fatigue
of my senses
I know the need for goodbye
will come
It clings to my life
and I cling back
neither willing to let go
How can I say it
feel it
if it’s not real
I’m still here
it’s still there
I could
in theory
still go there
be there
So how can I still goodbye
but even more so
can I ever say goodbye?

mind I can see
the frigid
solitude.
I imagine the water

lingering over it all

to know

loving threads

To my husband Charles with all my love, June
Those are the words
my grandmother wrote
to my grandfather
in a book
an ancient book
with yellowed pages
her rigid
but flowing cursive
seems to fit right in
the book is tattered 
and the pages run smoothly
across my fingers
It is a delightful sensation
I can almost
imagine a scent of burgundy
But I know better
it’s just some 
incense
buring
ever so softly
a few feet away
Powered by my green candle
I find myself
contemplating
her words
her life
their life
These are things
I cannot remember
or simply do not
know
There is so much now
that I have forgotten
and there is so much more
that I never did learn
I read the hateful
rants
that spew and
dance between their children
I don’t really know
what to believe now
or if I should even try
I want to sit back
and hold this book
and imagine this
perfect life
and a perfect love
where both left
this world 
fufilled and content
I want that for them
for me
But I can’t escape the hate
the reality
I need to create
this imaginary life for me
for my children
for my grandchildren
I want stories to tell
I want that love story
But right now
it’s just a selfish desire 
It will only bring discontent
Perhaps
maybe
One day…I’ll find my story
and if I’m lucky
that story book 
love

contrived
I’m not some artsy-smartsy wannabe
I don’t believe I’m even
artsy-smartsy
I don’t judge people on
their demeanor anymore
or how or why they do things
I just accept
and move on
And this is supposed to be about me
Why do I keep on getting off track?
I do this to feel
I do this to let things go
that I really cannot accurately explain
my mind is always in a mad rush
shipping things out in
some crazy fervor
slapping labels 
and names and
words on random concepts
and thoughts
and sending them out
through my fingers
unto you
Half the time
I don’t know what I’m doing
I don’t actually care most
of
the time
I hate it that I come off
as some typical e-poet who has no talent and just uses big words
Newsflash: 
Big words or not, I still have
no talent
I fully admit that
infact I might even embrace that
I don’t put
much effort into this
I do hit the enter key
sometimes 
just
for
the
sake
of
doing
it

to do something

freedom

page
staring at me
and I find it difficult to 
return
the gaze
My mind is elsewhere
and I long
to be where ever it is
but I am here
avoiding the glance
of
a fucking computer

and wait
for hours here
but even this
is too much
All is dimmed in
the brightness
The night isn’t enough
For you
for her
them
I don’t remember anymore
I can’t
it all blurs
and mixes together
into some ooze
of intentions beyond me
faint reflections
on the what if
dances on the surface of what
never should have been
And it all comes to bear
within the now
and the distance
from here to the place
where it just doesn’t really matter anymore
Cracked and shattered
are the dreams of last night
feeble and weak
are the desires
of tomorrow
Only the million pinpricks
of ancient light 
really give a damn
and they’re all running
late

to understanding
Racing to a point
where things makes sense

late to
apply it
to anything

as I pull drive up
the ascending road
I hope that noone is there
so I will be alone in my thoughts
secretly 
though
I hope someone is
there
Such is the way with some things
sometimes.
Coming up
and over the final
hill
I see the the random
heads and helmets
of a caravan
of ATV driving type people
and I decide in that instance that I
do
infact
long for solitude
I pull off
and park to the side
of the small bit
of pavement
available
and decide to wait it
them
out on the interior of my car
Believing that this
wait
might be quite
a substantial one
I search my car for something
to combat the upcoming passage of time
I stumble upon a notebook filled
with papers
It seems to be a notebook from a class
and I hope the papers it holds are
the assortment of William Blake poem’s I had gathered
His particular vernacular
appeals to me
at this point in time
But
alas
the words I seek aren’t to be found
so I decide upon writing my own
I turn a blank page within the notebook
and proceed to look for a 
writing utensil
A red pen was all I could find
A red pen.
red
pen
if there ever was a bane of my writing experience
a red pen 
it would be
Nothing but
dissatisfaction
and blank minds
result in red pens
and this was no exception
Thankfully, my atv accessorized companions chose this moment to depart
so I was free to exit my automobile shaped cage 
and explore the world about me
With me
I had my camera
I didn’t wait long to snap a picture
for some odd reason
I set
the camera to black and white
Maybe because I didn’t feel the colour
would digitize well…
I soon noticed the battery was dying
or
more accurately
I noticed my camera died
after taking that picture
I suppose I had it
too close to the red pen in
the car
Dissatisfied and mentally blank
I decided to get back into my car
and head home
My exodus from the house
was done
for today.

I am nothing more than a little boy inside
These feelings of self
help
and self
loathing
keep on exchanging
blows
on the floor mat of my soul
I know what I need
want
feel
but things
just seem
to stay muddled
and confused
What do Katie think now, Jimmy?
did your love
your hate 
bring anything back but more of the same?
What changed?
She’s still dead
I’m cold on the out
and I’m sick on the in
The mirror stings me
and I don’t like to look down
but I can’t bear to keep
my head up
the things
I do
and the things
that 
I just don’t know anymore
so I speak to you in riddles, because my words get in the way
I
you
us
forget all the things I should have said
There is nothing there
noone there
except for a notion
a thought
perhaps a memory
I still don’t know
This isn’t about
what you think it is
I’m sure it’s nothing
but right now
it is something
There
just beyond
reach
or sight
or some other unattainable
I’m here
it’s there
el fin, no?
Words and phrases just
ramble
and wonder through my head
occasionally sticking to
me
and repeating several times
Trying to adhere to my life
have some purpose
I just can’t work that way
It’s dark now
but I can still see
barely
but I like to think I can’t
or that there is something
there
that isn’t
just beyond
Away.
Understanding this
or that
I’m not sure if 
it matters
and all the assholes
on top
have forgotten
the right things
and noone will stand
we all will fall
fail
And I don’t know anymore
Words can’t meet
my expectations
I’ll stay silent
I’ll stay bitter
I’ll just stay here.

since
I remember the typing
I remember hitting enter
a
lot

my memories
aren’t really there
My head is currently
pounding
and
something is hiding in my throat
causing me discomfort
when I swallow
and occasionally
enticing a coughing fit
I dislike the 
Tennessee Valley winters.
Going from cold to warm back to cold
all in a day
It can’t be healthy
I don’t know how the locals stand it
I’d happily settle for the below zero temperatures
that I grew up on
At least it’s consistent
Today strikes me
as a lonely day
I have no reasons or facts to back this up
I’m just declaring it
Deal.
At least I have some cough drops
I know they love me

the window

There you are
and then there is faith
or whatever it is
that is lacking
I don’t know
how this
difference in
belief is paramount
but it is
I can’t cross it
and I don’t believe you
can either
So 
I’ll sit back
and watch you for
awhile
and admire the view
you put forth
but that is all
There is no more
or no less than that
It’s all we’re allotted 
blame your god.
And I’ll just laugh.

with the world
We were connected
we belonged
I have never in my life
felt
so safe
and at ease
When we finally left
the watery crib
We felt refreshed
and renewed
I could have done anything.
I can almost
remember completely how it felt
But it’s just a memory
There are countless memories
like this one
that I have
that will sting
painfully
in the end.

light
painting
just beyond the morning’s

no picture

in time
It will never happen like
this again
a change in
perspective
and it is
all new again
and the previous
vantage point
is gone
not forgotten
but not entirely intact
a thousand
thoughts and feelings
piled and shuffled upon
a view
Everything makes sense from a distance
but up close
or inside
It is chaos
and theres is fear
and there is hate
and there is a notion
of perfection
the storm strives for it
but it can never know
when it achieves what it seeks
that is how it works.
The sun is rising.

was take out

Clam Lake lies in northern Wisconsin about midway on the blacktop highway that runs east and west through wide stretches of the Chequamegon National Forest between the towns of Glidden and Hayward. County roads branching off in the vicinity of Clam Lake lead northwest to the resort area of Namekagon and northeast to the lumber-mill town of Mellen.All these points on the map are set deep in the north-woods country, dominated by forests of pine, birch, oak, and maple, which throw into cool shade the ferny paths along which the deer, porcupine, fox, woodchuck, racoon, skunk, and an occasional rambling black bear make their way.In late spring, clusters of flowers in the sparse sections of the forest and along the margins of the many lakes and clearings show where by late August or early September a harvest of wild berries can be gathered. Fat blackberries sprout from spikey branches, and, closer to the ground, one can find their plumper, juicier cousins, the dewberries. Growing in sandier slants of earth, where they can be exposed to much of the day’s sun, are the red raspberries, whiskery and benign, ready when ripe to fall into the hand at the gentlest nudging. Along the shoeline of the blue lakes or near the spongy clumpls of muskeg in the marshes, the pale blueberries grow.In between are the ripening days of the short Clam Lake summer. Hot sun and muld, benevolent air alternate with sudden driving thunderstorms that soak the woods and fill the low-lying marshfields. Moods of summer ease and leisure fill the long days before the deep forest green turns orange in the sun’s departing light and the night moisture begins to rise to the nightly chorus of insects and the punctuating croak of frogs.

where dreams
had wandered the night before
and plans
had plotted
earlier

right here
just now
Mine
I claim it
I set forth
and let my name
spew and leak
all over it
Me

now

off
to let you
and the world
see
what I have taken
and what I shall
give back

of ego
subsides

swelter

to take
stats

on a rigid
but captivating chord
Hello there reason
hello there god
Your dictation
your law
of two
plus two
dancing around in our heads
for love
for hate
for me
for you
You don’t exist
so nor do I
we cancel eachother out
we balance the equation
This math isn’t here by 
your hand
but by ours
we created you
for balance

fanciful dreams
of joy
of happiness
and of sorrow

There are/were dreams

some light-filled peak

not here
Maybe in some other
avenue
some other
exploit

nitty gritty

Dead.

life does move in
circles
well, an ellipsis
and when we come
to the end

conscious dwelling within it

to reflect
and share what we have learned
But what 
is wonderous about this
is that we can go back
to anyplace
we want
any time
anyone 
We can move around
our memories
to shape them
into lessons
about the nature of things
and the cause and
effect

sometimes ill
judgement

we can’t control our life
while we are living it

in the telling
of it

things

yourself

it all

is this

“Every single being, even those who are hostile to us, is just as afraid of suffering as we are, and seeks happiness in the same way as we do.  Every person has the same right as we do to be happy and not to suffer.  So let’s take care of others wholeheartedly, of both out friends and our enemies.  This is the basis for true compassion.”

sitting here
looking at a calender
at the dates
I purposely left blank
On a whim
on a chance
that things will
follow through
like it was said
I thought about it
I remembered
but now it seems
that I wasn’t remembered
or just
not noted
I don’t blame you
and I shouldn’t blame me
There are so many things
that make
me understand
I do
I get it
but it doesn’t make me
feel better
Now
I have a hole
in my schedule
and I really don’t want to fill it
I want to wallow
in my self-pity
and rot in my disinterest
I won’t guilt anyone
They don’t deserve it
I made my choice long ago
and now
I’m reaping the
fruits
of that decision
No matter how
rotten
they are

parade of blows
to my feelings

As I sat
I rose
beyond myself
and above my body
arising
to this point
This insignificant
point
of light
in the night sky
Entranced
and enthralled
by this
tiny
gem
I felt the cold
and I heard the silence
as I left
my life behind
and embraced the dark
Through clouds
and misery
past joy
Dancing in the void
suddenly
I was the insignificant one
upon the ballroom
of this
delightfully painful
nothing
"

In youth
this doesn’t seem so hard
or difficult
or even odd
All this
just falls down
and beyond care
And is promptly disregarded and
forgotten
We
as time
goes on
aren’t as fortunate.
But we can 
choose
we can take the
path
into the sky
and past the heavens
to a place
where we can
play
and 
live
and love
without
all the annoying details

fog
and frozen light
I have come
to a land
of heat and moisture
where things
don’t make sense
Footfalls are weak
as are my knees
Now
I can only sit in my cage
and wait
for my release

I don’t think you understand
anymore
I’m not really sure
if you 
ever did
There was a point
where I thought I was sure
you did
But you do not
you can not
you are too empowered
by your resentment
of her
of your past
The decency is gone
killed by your hand
or hers
or his
I really don’t know
and it really doesn’t matter
the path to peace
lies within your own heart
The things you do
affect the way you feel
You have an oppurtunity
to take this
in your hand
and walk
happily to joy
Don’t let this
latent feelings
of disrespect
diminish
the stature
of your own
self

The most deppressing thing
about this place
lately
is the moths
In the morning
this earth isn’t ours
it’s theirs
They are everywhere
Big
small
plain
exotic
When I have time
I like to just stare at them
take in their intricate
patterns
their likeness
Their regal presence
It makes you feel good 
inside
But
every morning
The oldest begin to die
You see them on the ground
They have lost the strength to cling to the walls
so you find them
at your feet
flapping
Trying to get in the air
into safety
I don’t know much
of what moths
think
but I really wonder what is going through
their minds
at this time
Is it just
instinct that tells them to take
flight
This knowledge that
ground equals death?
Or do they know that
they’re dying
and that time is fleeting
And that they try
to fight back
agaisnt the inevitable
A candle in the malestrom
I prefer latter at times
Eventually
the sit still on the pavement
resolved to their fate
I imagine that
they pass sometime around noon
while the sun is at it’s peak
roasting them
drying them out
By the time I leave this place
they are usually gone
dried out to a point
where they
break apart
in the wind
So when the next morning
arises
when I look at the moths
I can’t help
but to notice
the
beautiful
regal
moth
pieces
scattered
in the gravel.

did call this morning
because what was said
is what I would have said
And now
I’m not really sure what
I should say
now

it’s hard to look
back
and see the effort
that was lacking
in this
deal
of beauty that
I so loved
The moments I didn’t
take to heart
will most certainly haunt me
as much
as the moments
that I had planned 
in the future
when I had a family
of my own
It’s the end
of a fantasy
and the death
of the last place
I felt safe
from this cruel
indifferent world

suffering be avoided?
or should it?
I can’t escape this
feeling of dread inside

I won’t be like
you
I won’t let
them
us
be like that
There aren’t
many things
that are more
important
than the bond
between
and
within
family
That which
destroys you
isn’t one of them

I thought I 
was strong enough to endure this
But as it sits now
I am quaking on the inside
All these negative feelings
of rage
and sadness
are shattering my barriers 
my strength
won’t survive
Soon
I’ll be a mass of
quivering broken
on the dusty floor
and I’m not sure
if this
isn’t what
I really want

what to put here anymore
I’m so weary of this
and that
That
I do not have anything to put here
but cold words
that lack feeling
and reeks of plain
tones
that seem to dominate my lucid moments
Normally
I spent those moments here
trying to work my
way through feelings
and thoughts
but now
There is either
too much
or not much at all
lingering
I sometimes think I need
to just
write
regardless of the content
or desire
Other times I
feel like
I’m cheating myself
by forcing it

I sometimes forget
how green it is
here
So very green
But that doesn’t conquer this resentment
I tend to have
These birds I hear
I don’t know them
almost four years of my life cannot contend
with almost
twenty
I still feel like
a tourist
down here
everything is still foreign
I can’t file it all away
into my
comfortable file
in my head
But I’d be a fool
to assume
that if I went back home
that everything would be ok
Home..
that’s kind of funny
That’s not my home anymore
It’s just as different to me
as here
now
There was
one place
where I knew
I could call home
but that is gone from me now
and I am destitude
but
maybe
there is another place for me
Only time
can tell.

can one wander down
in the explanation
of death
And what is it like
in the moment

sometimes
aren’t really
a mean

just a whimsical
play
on the unknown

I don’t know
much or enough about
where I am now
I don’t know what bird I hear
what flowering tree 
I see
there are words
on a printed page
that I understand
but I don’t know
history
rattles off in my mind
and
stories
ignite
from a notion
But it is a mere
harbinger
A moment’s notice
and then disregarded
 
"
2725,https://www.opendiary.com/m/sadmeatcart/empty-tank-4262535/,2004-09-13,Empty Tank,"
In the end
it never seems
like
it was
enough
The time
the 
memories
the pain
Just not
enough was there
to endure
the emptiness
In the end
I tried my best
to negate
what I did
in the past
In the end
you just
crept away
full of something
that wasn’t you
Not alive
not dead
just
breathing
In your eyes
I never saw
quit
or defeat
disappointment
Yes
that was there.
I’ve failed you
so many times
over
and in the end
I failed to save you
Now
here
I believe
I’ve done
you right
in the end
there isn’t enough
to fill your glass house
but 
in the beginning
You’ve left just
enough
to start.

beauty and grace
falling side by side
the earth is our grave
the earth is our home
soon we’ll be one
in our messy breakdown
There are no
counter-melodies here
Just a pretty discant

I’m never sure who has the lead
I’m never sure who is listening

dead on the ground

regrets
Only sweet fall

By now I am
sure
you know
who I am
or who you are
I’m never clear
on
the line
between us
am I your
eyelids
inside out
or is it I
who made you
within
my closed sight
your touch
and your taste is unknown to me
but there’s no way
to know if
you’ve had a
bit of me
to nibble on
Sometimes I hear laughter
or sobs
or nothing
And all in all
I find life bearable
when I ponder this
I’ve gone
somewhere I did
not 
intend
I don’t intend to find my
way back
I just want to dwell
and swoon in
this thought
of me and
you
and the things we don’t share
and the words we won’t speak
This isn’t about you
it’s certainly not
about me
Just this
now.

mess

grey
and orange
bad weather
is most likely
when it looks
like this
it’s a
bittersweet potrait
of the day
I remember leaving
to a white pony
and
into and through
a sweet little town
Gas and several
officers later
it was into the woods
where there
was a hill
with a bench
and it was quiet
and I kissed your lips
and I was for
a moment
happy
frustration burns
and pulsates
beneath this
dull
vacant face
Rage
so much 
a moment quelled
a moment lost
no relief for
the forlorn
the day began
in ruins
I found this place
this situation
out of my hands
out of my control
so much pain for what I could not help
not knowing was bad
not hearing was worse
clueless minds were not
available
for sympathy or help
words on a screen do little
all I could do
was feel
when I finally heard
all I heard was laughter
at my regards
leading me to believe
that I should be ashamed for caring
everything felt like a big joke
and I was the fool
the trees are barren in some
places
and ridden with the dead
in others
earthly tones
melt and blend into
a perfect counter
to the sky
a portrait for a new day
it was the rain
the clinched it
that made it real
I was convinced
that I would wake up
in your bed
and I would see your form
and I would hear you sleep
the wet cold
was too real
not to be
it felt like
a wasted two weeks
as it washed down my face
so much was still there
to be done
and known
I was confident
that there would be another time
another chance
how else could it be any
other
way?
There was promise
in the kiss
besides
the remorse and regret
imagine
my suprise
that it was a promise
to the last

that less travelled path
does it seem
worth the while
Do you know

I find myself in the room that I promised

I promised I would not sleep in

Maybe not forever

regret and shame

strong suit

like I have been
for a long while now
Unsure of which direction to 
go
Taking a few steps
in one direction
and then quickly
running back
to what I know
All I’m
usually left with
is uncertainity
and the knowledge
that this is not
a game

reset button
My unhappiness is the pressure
that I yearn

this anxiety inside

with a silent 
regard

my desperation
I find the resolve
to remember and
to type the names
into the
little white box
and then I must find
a bit more
to hit enter
most of what comes back
is useless to
me
unless a name 
alone
can ease
what it is that I seek
but with each submission
I find
little bits
of pertinent
information
teases to make
me quest 
further slowly replacing
my blood with more shame
Every step is a memory first
and a logical jump towards
fantasy
the next
curiosity is
the prime force
but it becomes
primal when
what if comes to play
With each name
face
memory
I find myself lost
in thought and
sometimes regret
and always shame
These are lives
that I am not a part of
and I’m not invited 
to be a 
part of

had the fortitude

and her

around
a concept
that
makes
everything
bearable
and understandable
But it
helps
to remember
that it is
just
a construct
we formed with our head
It’s not real
to the touch
but one could
spin around
again
and affirm
it does
exist
There are universes
in our imagination
that our
paths
may never intersect
But we are still
the
point
from which they manifest
And they swing wildly
and unknowingly
from our
birth
All while
we aimlessly
float
in this lake
of being

One day
I’m 
going
to tie you
down
and
fuck you
until
your face
drops
the less
and your name
will
be intermitten
with your
passion

these moments 
this 
time
now
the fingers
aren’t cold
but the feet
think they
should reconsider
plastic flavoured water
sits
still
while
frozen breakfast awaits
the next step on it’s journey
the mind
is a vast
something and the eyes
itch
and the heart
just
does it
thing
"

weekly
bullshit to end

I had a moment of clarity
which was
soon followed by
a moment of peace
that ended one
moment
too soon
heretic thoughts 
in hand
I inhaled
the slightly
pungent air
and noticed
a crow
and then the sun
and another crow
In that instant
my mind traveled
back
to the dead vulture
presented to me
last night
And suddenly I was back
to the now
at the summons
of a woodpecker
far off
yet not too 
far
My sight traveled
towards the sun again
Rare are the occasions that
we can
fully appreciate it’s form
without having to imagine it
Rich orange hues
are it’s nature
on the mornings like this
I then take 
notice
to the
vapor trails
of three airliners
and the eventual
triangle
shape
these growing
lines
will make
I spy
a fourth trail
a few degrees to the left
content
with it’s line
and piece
of the blue canvas
But
the sounds
of combustion meeting loose gravel
shatter the
ambience
and banish
these five seconds
of calm
forever

I find myself
in
this
situation
quite often
I let myself
feel
special
thinking
I’m cared for
in the way
that I want
and all that
has really changed
was
some words
and plans
and when
these feelings
are
replied
in actions
and comments
and words
I feel betrayed and shunned
all over again

that lack of the look

I’ve written a lot
about
love
and maybe once or
twice
about love
But you never really know
You can’t
It’s not there
you are looking in the wrong place
I know
there is lust
and I know
there is a affection
and caring

sure
on love
I don’t believe
in hate

why should I
humour

But I honestly
don’t know
where I stand

deny that
Is this a sort
of love?

The life
of
a teddy bear
is a chaste
life
For when their owners
grow
before
those button eyes
love is replaced by an unrequited lust

the bear might be

and unintentional
striptease
it is ultimately
destined
to get
a furry face 
full
of the boyfriend’s
derriere
as he pounds away
at the bear’s object of affection.

and the memory
of being
downstairs
for no good reason
asleep in a chair or
a sofa bed
or whatever
with a bat

in reach
fearful and longing
It was the best and worst time of my life
Only now
do I
really wonder
why
But the wonder
only goes
so
far before

I think it’s because I know she’s just putting up an act….that she’s trying…in her fucked up way…to teach me to be harder or something.   I don’t know Sara.  I try so very hard to be over her, but all I want to do is to take care of her sometimes.  And I don’t know how she feels about anything because she rarely tells me.  And when she does…I fear she’s just telling me what I want to hear.
subliminal_pj : Have you said any of this to her?
euphonic_awakenings: A bit, but I haven’t had a serious conversation with her in awhile.   Most of this gets turned around or lost.   We’ve really only had some serious dialouge once or twice since we broke up.  The rest has just been…..iunno….filler.
subliminal_pj : Sounds to me like she’s not wanting to work on this at all…
euphonic_awakenings: I know.
euphonic_awakenings: Which is fine….if I knew that is what she wanted.
subliminal_pj : Usually I would advise against assuming, but I’m not sure if that wouldn’t be the right thing in this situation…
euphonic_awakenings: Right now….she seems to be starting things with a new guy, but I think something happened in that a few days ago.   But she won’t tell me.   I know she’s concentrating on other things….but…I just don’t get why she has to shut me out.  I know how she works.  When she decides on something…she purges herself of everyone that reminds her of things.   I don’t want to be purged.  She owes me more than that.
euphonic_awakenings: I can live without being with her.  But I don’t want to be completely kicked out of her life.
euphonic_awakenings: This would be so much easier if I was just pissed off at her and said “fuck it”
euphonic_awakenings: any normal person would have satisfied with that.  But nooo, I have to still care and try to understand her.
subliminal_pj : there’s nothing wrong with caring
subliminal_pj : just makes you human
subliminal_pj : whichever way you come out of this, you’ll be a stronger person.  It’s situations like these that force us to learn more about ourselves.

It is
tough
to start
something
with just a title
and
a slight premise
of what it should
imply
The guts
and meat will
be percieved as secondary
by the author
or
at least
not as important
The tragedy is that
we tend
to think in
titles
We can condense
a lifetime
of feelings
and meanings
and emotions
into a single word
or a short phrase
Doing this
is all fine
and dandy
if the feelings
meanings
emotions
are remembered 
but too often
they are forgotten
and all
that is left
is some letters that
really
don’t represent
what
they were intended for
So with this
in mind
it should easy
in life
to just have a title
It could
be artsy
or direct
Abstract or picturesque
existence is all that is really needed
The rest
is of no consequence
Or so we should hope
It’s a lot like
the beginning
and the end
It’s beaten into our heads
that it is what
is between the two that matter
but noone is fooled
We begin to end
everything else is the crap between
Perhaps it is
just crap all together
Or perhaps it all
matters
The beginning
the end
the title
the guts

Almost at 
once
the road
became a picture book
with the pages
flipping rapidly
Displaying a story
of my past
adventures
with the
fairer sex
My triumphs
or more frequent failures
The
faces
the words
the passion
or lack
of
Part of me
deep down
the part that
thinks
silly things
and says stupid things
wonders if
I might
ever
be there 
again
Be where I feel
so alive
in her
or her
or her
affection
and love
the smile
that I would flop down
on this
rushing earth
and be torn apart
if it was asked
But then
I turn west

of Illinois
brings new thoughts

are a rich red
The store calls it
Tibet Red which
works for me since
I find myself imaging saffron robes
in a misty hall
of incense
and culture
One wall
is just planked wood
Untreated and uncured
It’s not what I planned on
but I find myself
contemplating
my future 
emotions
regarding it
One wall is a deep
blue
The paint is textured
and up close
it
is speckled with
grains
of black
gray
and a different sort
of blue
Taking a few steps
back
the wall changes
into
a vertical
watery abyss

deepest pools
can create that shade of blue

against this wall

we walked out
to the back
of the house
and sat
in the swing
simply because it was
something
that
we haven’t done
together
yet
It was nice
in a simple way
We were both
still in our
pajamas
and it was still
early
enough in the spring
for us
to not
really concern ourselves
with what
else may join
us
on our
moment
of swing delivered
simple
Almost immediately
we were aware of the birds
They were always there
but
it wasn’t until
we took a moment
to settle
ourselves
when we
actually
noticed them
They were 
deaf-
ening
we listened for a spell
while
we
enjoyed eachother’s
touch and subsequent company
and
then
I dared
to speak
over them
I mentioned
that
despite living
here for few years
these
bird conversations
are still very
very
foreign to me
and how
the sparrows up north
tend
to dominate
the conversation
with their
pips and squeaks
and that occasionally a robin
or a finch might
interupt and
how poignant the shrill call
of the redwing bla-
-I was going to remark aloud
on how poignant the shrill call
of the red-wing blackbird can be
but
I could tell
that even though this was the
first time
she had heard this
commentary
it is something
that I have
repeated often
and she was either bored with it
disinterested
or both
So I cut myself short
and let the birds
weave themselves
back
into the ambience
After a bit
the bird produced
chorus moved on elsewhere
and she
and I
found ourselves
in a world
filled with car tires
on gravel/pavement
and
motors
on our very ears
We tried
to regain
whatever peace
we found
on that swing
but
the moment
had
passed

on my long journey
to this place
It’s sort

that it went exactly
as I expected it to
It’s even funnier
that I’m
shocked that it did
What happens now
is anyone’s guess

out

to rekindle

to be in a

treaded the broken

it happened
when she
broke it

place
We were not
even there
for a minute
before she
did something
so offensive
and wrong that
I cannot even remember what it was

it sent me stumbling towards the woods
where I knew
she would not dare
She knew the stories
but I was the one who told her
of the voices
and of the lights
and of stolen shirt
lying tattered high
in a tree
my apprehension
was great
her’s was unsurmountable
The shadows embraced be
as I could hear her calls
on the perimeter

the years of fear
we have installed of the woods

we evolved into bipedal
savannah traveling apes

that I could not
explain

healed whatever travesty she had

I think about going there a lot. 
But, as with everything, I think about it too much.
Let’s say I make it up there to Clam Lake and turn off on White Bass.  What then?  Do I follow go the length to Pohl *ahem* Buffalo Lake Road?  Then what?  Go to the end and go down that short gravel road to the cabin?  I’d be trespassing by that point.  Is it worth it to walk around this big elaborate thing that barely resembles the place I grew up with?  Walk down to the lake and sit and try to recapture something…anything?  Will Meditation Point still be effective…are the signs still there?
I could go in through the Girls Camp.  I’m positive that I could find my way.  It isn’t hard.  It’s state owned, so I’d run less of a chance of being caught.  Would coming in on the other side quell this thing?
Or do I just avoid it all and continue to dream about it nightly?

You lose that.  The freedom, the joy.  It goes away.  Sure, there are other things.  But it goes away.
And then she talked about me and how I don’t really smile.  I told her I’m saving them.

I realized this as I drove home this grey morning.  Some joke was said on the radio and it became a springboard for my mind to stumble across and ultimately fall into the vast pool of my misgivings.
It’s always been like this for me.  Since that day/night in her basement when we first took that step.  My fear was real, perhaps unfounded, but real.  When she took it even farther, my fear turned to anti-interest.
I was always interested, but when the moment came there was fear.  And it happens consistently since.

It was surreal seeing my tackle box being loaded into the old man’s truck.  I had stored so many years within it’s blue-grey plastic walls.  So many thoughts.  So many notions.  There is blood and tears.  There is is triumph and there is failure.  And I let it sit unopened for nearly a decade.
Everything has been locked away for so long, I don’t know how to function.  Living is relative, this is something else.
 
Tiamat’s tank must of sold last night.  There was a name written on some packing tape.  It was taped to the glass.  A Tim something, I think.  It was full of lights, sand, and other herptological things.  Her name was still on the tank.  
Tiamat
Egyptian Uromastyx
Uromastyx aegyptius
I killed her.  And I buried her.  And I tossed her tank in the basement and didn’t think about her again for four years.
 
Everything there that I had some sort of emotional value to was already sold.  Maybe my life has some worth, after all.  To someone, at least.

it’s when I
wake up
that I can
feel the weight of everything
pressing down on me
molding my mood into a sharp stick
of pointless
I think
maybe
it’s the light of the day
that has passed on and by
during my sleep
that haunts me
or if it’s merely just me being
unhappy
We talk about weddings
but not how the way it will be
it’s just a thing right now that isn’t pressing or required.
Someday. Maybe in October
It’s a vague, unassuming thing
eventual
I find myself more absorbed in the process than I might let on
I’m fond of
Ladies and Gentelmen, we are floating in Space
but I am alone in that
and this
And maybe that’s the problem
I’m finding myself examining
Blake’s proverbs
and wondering when I may become wise
because I am still persisting

 it’s all beams and bunches
when I sleep
and the pit becomes real
and painfully
tangible
all the bodies bruise and fall down it’s harsh wall
bouncing into each
other
for a meaningful
period
before the fall
ends the solitude
in those moments
of interaction
life exists and is reflected
it’s a long
cold fall
it’s nice
not to be alone
then the bruises
and the scrapes
and the broken bones
and the pain
don’t seem as bad
The bloody end
is just that
but the juices must flow somewhere

it wanders
too much
too far
my mind burns itself with existential
bullshit
and hope
The sleeping moments
are just
schisms of sanity
against the plate
of slated and slotted
madness
Desires and loves and hates and back
down to desire
it all jumbles
and jives in the thicket
where it is safe
and unknown
to all
but me
I choke on my secrets

to a precise edge

meaning

is finally free from
predjudice
and the solo
can be heard
for what it intends to be
not
what was intended for

our notes
and measures
following that lead
to ends unknown
until the end
is known
Then only the echos remain
and in the car
with the windows open
and my mind free
They last forever

I am feeling guilty about beating her.
But
I cannot
regret
it
Part of me
wishes that
the speak-easy
comments and
deflected truths I
showered upon her were true
That part of me
wanted me to lose
by more
than a modest margin
It would be easier
softer
lighter
less pain for her
to reflect on me
All her work
and her confidence
I built it up
assured and massaged it
to a pinnacle
of certainty
but I beat her
twice

of myself for myself
that I am
capable

say I’m not

tumbling down
and to the side
down and to the side
down
and to
the
side
It’s a fair clip but
a partial clip
loudly and ludely
daunting
but there is a box
that folds
and tears
and is
when it isn’t
but all the while
it’s still
down and to the side
of things
Hidden jewels and gems
line the jaw
to the teeth

dies
In the

stops the thunder.

wake up, darling
There was more to it before the beginning.  There was love and joy and all those things that hurt when they are lost.  And they were lost.  Taken.  Smashed and broken.  Snapped.  She was gone and he was alone.  In a tent. In the woods.
But he was sure of it.  A man certain of his place in this world of greys and mist and hushed sounds. 
wake
He didn’t go to the funeral.  There was no closure there.  It’s closed.  Smashed and closed.  Dead. 
up
Sometimes, alone in his tent, he heard things.  Whispers and screams.  He felt sharp, but brief pains in his extremities.  He hoped it was death, coming back to collect him. 
my love
""How long has it been?  The days and the moments, they just float by"", he sang softly to himself in his restless sleep.  The pains are less frequent now, but the whispers are constant.  And it’s getting darker.   The hole in the sky, which appeared in place of the sun, seemed to suck up all things tangible.  Now the world is hypothetical and distant.
come back
He would if he could, go back to the day.  Say something different.  Look at something else.  Take her/him away.  End it early?  Together?
don’t leave me
""I didn’t leave!  The world left me!""  He cried out in pain and in redemption.  The funeral he couldn’t attend.  The hospital he can’t remember.  His wife’s face, flush with concern, filling his vision before the black.  And they greys came.
don’t fade aw…
And his eyes openend.
""Welcome back.""

and happiness-wasting
minutes
awake
and the tepid
shy
and reserved lifetime
spent sleeping
When things are as
they are
and it is
as it is
I find myself
wishing
Shel was still around
to set everyone(but especially me)
straight
or
as I’m sure
he’d prefer

and well.

I like
to think
of the woods
this time of year
and of the things that it hides
My mind wanders to a short story by Hawthorne
I think
I don’t really remember much about it
but my mind
is filled with a vision of the sky
opening up
in a horrific
but
awesome moment
I have to catch my heart
and my mouth
lately
and I’m still
the one
who is stuck
saying sorry
I’m sorry.

I threw out
Scenes from A Napkin

and they weren’t even on napkins anymore
Just my
hubris getting in the way
if it really mattered
and I was
really emotionally vested
I would
have left
them in the cafe

as sure
as I am of the consequences
of my actions
Innocent or not
words can be
and often are
misconstrued
and emotions are
deliberate
Real.
The sky(night) is lit up towards the northwest
I know it’s the lab
but I allow myself
to wonder just the same
It’s above the clouds
how can that be?
I don’t think I can stop
but maybe
I can
tone it down

My posture is wrong and dreadful
and this prose
is a
thing
to behold in horror
my eyes are shut to things

at my insecurities
I tell myself that it is all

I can hardly
keep
my mind
open
These eyes
are dried and finite
and this terminal
just glows
it’s glow

everyone around
me that I am
truly alone

communication is the key

the door isn’t even there
No one is one
to talk

is away

what I’m looking
for
when I’m looking for it
But I am at
a loss
of people
She told me once about growing old and now
she’s just flickering away
and she’s off to wherever
and whenever
and whoever
and I’m left wondering if I
did something wrong
I don’t appreciate
my ego-centricities
when I’m suddenly
muse
less
and barren
it’s not this or
what we think

everyone
all the time

indecisive

They’re
all gone now

to their own things
and stuff

that no longer need to be shared or
endured
I’m happy for them

I miss it all
just the same

it turns around
and spins
my heart
on someone else’s axis

I can’t see straight

Just in
and out
and repeat
Feelings just hurt
and pain is lonely

at night
thinking
that actions are

and the strains
they do not
need
or ask for actions
just the possibility
and dreams
I am betrayed in my sleep

the two dance
in to
an
earthen hole which collapses upon them
trapping the two
in the one
with nothing but love
Same story
different locale
one falls in
one doesn’t
one and one doesn’t make a hole
and one climbs out
Mud and debris
and blood
It’s the alone
part
that hurts the most
But two and one
on a day never-coming
might
just have
that day
or
that moment
and it’s still
what it is
and still what it was
many years later

which ever
and when ever

with his back turned
and the shame
flowing out of
me like
blood and shit

in the actions

specifically
inactions of the night

advice from family
and the internet
But nothing is
what I
want
to hear
I close my eyes and see straight lines and right angles
but my heart is pounding
in my racing mind
I’m not good at anything to do
what I’m good at
and the horizon
in my mind
is fading
Night is here

the hurt
lingers
long after I tell myself
to ignore it
Everything simmers
but it might still be hot to the touch
I’m not angry anymore
but I’m empty.
and all I have is pain
and the promise
that it will
all happen again

I have to admit
first
off
that I’m delighted
that I’ve been
able
to tickle
my sense
enough
to question the shadows
to ponder
the sounds
and creaks
when I sleep
and to let
my imagination
put something just
outside
my vision
that wasn’t there
But I
have to wonder
why I
am
enthralled
with the paranoia
and lust
over the brief
moments
of fear
I feel
real
and tangible
even
when
these thoughts
aren’t
I think.

of
isolation
or redemption

probably neither

will not stop
will not

is endured

are forming in the shadows

not always lead to more questions

stands there

realized

the dull
rerun

ineptitude

there is a middle path

It burns sometimes
when I think
too hard about it
And it’s been
awfully warm
lately
but I’ll soothe
this with
a salve
of another obsession
The cool winds
and gentle/harsh tones
of a summer night
in Northern Wisconsin
This is what I see
when I close my eyes
education be damned.
I’ll never grow up

the life
of echoes
should diminish
with time
and distance
But the mind transcends
these things
in it’s own
personal
abstract

memories

a slave
to the will
of whimsy
and fancy
Sleeping in the day

changes

a tricky
prospect

it’s the little adjustments
that add up

It’s the write
of rights
But is it the last?
My mind is occupied with finality
on

there was a sparrow in
the rafters
at the Cookeville Walmart
It was singing softly

at least
it wasn’t a sing-songy song
it didn’t even
really sound natural
it was
desperate
I found
and I find
myself wondering
how long it had been in the store
and if it even knew
how to get it out
and then
now
I wonder if
there will be a cleanup
for when it falls
These sorts of things
stick with me
and stab me
and pain my mind until I’m at a point
where I
find a
lonely place
and scream
I’m not going to be that bird

Black and Gass
to Garfunkel and Simon

humble
waking life

stupid work

back towards this

my life is the distance
my blood is
forfeit to the void
and my sweat funnels down
in between the two
points of my life
the advantage of
splitting myself
is that both
aspects are less real
and more tolerable
and the downside
is the same
there are times where I enjoy
this solitude
too much
Too much time to feel time to be
and not enough everything and everyone else
I am dead
when I’m not
and that’s good
and acceptable
there is peace in the reservation of what is proper
and right
It’s real and we’re real.
I can only
fuck up reality a little.

of this:  
I am having too much trouble looking above or within things to make the things around me bearable.  His intentions aren’t this.  And she didn’t actually mean that.  BUT THAT’S OKAY.  I torment myself with fancy flights of fictional formats, but what is real is real.  I’m not living this life properly.  And now that I’ve let myself sink down into my own hole of regret, the bitterness of everything else stands to the front.  I’m not even sure what makes me happy anymore.  
I am a part of the machine.  And I don’t have the imagination to pretend I’m not.  That is the tragedy here.

Before I start, I know where I went wrong.  You shouldn’t put so much into such a meaningless thing.  I cannot help myself sometimes.
An exercise in patience.  That was the inline intention here.  Sit down.  Dedicate your time to accomplish something tangible.  And then bathe in the pointlessness of assembling a 35mm camera.  
These are the sort of things people do.  I masquerade as a person.  I can do it.
And I did.  Two hours went by and I had a camera.  I had my normal hiccups on the way.  The kind that would usually cause me to let it go.  I wear failure all the time.  I’m used to the smell.
But, despite myself, I held a camera in my hand.  
I placed the film in and then embraced a brief moment of relief as I clicked away
And then I removed the film.  The unwound film.  At somepoint, I must have set a sprocket off course.  It would hardly turn, certainly not easily enough to guide and move film.
I attempted to disassemble the camera.  The screws were too warped to move.  My pointless camera seems to have a point.   
From over my shoulder, my wife wonders aloud why even bothered with a kit.   I could have just purchased a complete(working) camera.  I don’t have an adequate response to this.  
Just
another
thing I do

there was a girl who was in love with a boy. She followed him everywhere, adoring his every move. She humored his foolishness and she bore his hate. She laughed at his folly and she cared for him in nearly every way.
But the boy, in the fashion of most boys, had no idea.
 
But that’s not really true.
 
Of course he knew. But why ruin the perfect relationship with a relationship.
 
It was here where I entered the story, visiting the boy after a long while and meeting the girl who had always been there, but never of notice until her involvement with the boy.
 
It was a the day I was leaving again when she confided her love with me. It was plain to see, but I took it in, just the same.
And, in an act of foolishness, I promised her that one day he’ll see.
 
And I left.
 
It was awhile again before I returned, and things were as they were.  But there was a crack in girl’s love. This time, she decided that if he would not have her, she’ll have the next best thing. Me.
 
In the land of fools, I am just another one…and this instance was a moment of poor choices.  I, the champion of true love, pushed her back into his figurative arms, never once thinking that this could work.
And then I left, again with the same promise.
And when I came back, nothing was the same.  She was sick, he was alone.  The roles had reversed it seemed.  I prodded him as much as I could, but it was all static stasis upon my departure.
The last time I saw the two of them together, they were apart.  She was with another boy. One who had been there when she was sick.  One that followed her liked she followed him.  Poetic, I think.  And the boy?  He’s been alone ever since.
 
That was years ago and I hadn’t really thought about it much until this morning.
She’s a mother now, a few times over.  Married to a different, unknown boy.  But she seems happy in pictures.  That’s all anyone can really ask for.
Him?  Still alone, I think.  
 
The thing is, the promise I made her was really a promise for him.  I want him to be happy.  It’s all I ever wanted.
 
It’s all I still want.

was there as well
She said something
smart

Like she always does
and then looked directly at me
spoke directly to me
and then stood up
shed her clothes
and disappeared.

It was a pretty big deal to me at the time.
Today, I think I’m still in the three thousands…but it doesn’t really matter to me.
I’m appreciative of where I’ve been in my life and where I’ve been in here.

A passing word to a coworker
A sleepy notion to my wife.
 
But this is where I show my work.  This is where I can write the words down and it doesn’t matter if it makes sense.
It doesn’t matter how many times I hit enter
And it certainly doesn’t matter how it looks
I felt it.  I wrote it. And then I can move on knowing it’s there for someone else to read.  These days, that someone might be somebody just chancing across my diary.  It could be a consistent voice that has been there for me here and there and /here/ for a little bit now. 
or, it could be no one.
 
But it’s there.    I have boxes of notebooks that are just by me and for me.  This was always for you.
 
 
And the thought of starting a new seems dreary.  I’d much rather be on-the-nose-me then hit-enter-a-lot-me.  But I really shouldn’t be either.
I suppose there is a middle ground. 
Or maybe I just have to finally learn to let it all go and just exhale
The answers are not in here.  But like I said, this was just me showing

A quiet notion
a quiet intent
a quiet hope
a quiet consequence
knowledge breeds guilt when the fool does it anyway

For all the inconsequential mysteries I like to pretend I’m capable of solving, the one my subconscious gives me in my sleep is tearing my health apart.
Why does it feel so good? Why do I want it?
Who is she?
And I don’t want this answer. Or that
or that.
but
I want
that content.
I am angry all the time

Maybe it’s just me.

it’s just feeling it out. Stretching and pulling
pain
Looking for nostalgia but also making new and different. I’m the only one listening to what I’m thinking. What a shame you can’t hear me.
What a shame I won’t share.
It is what it was after all

What does it mean to be a disappointment?
As I am to you and
you
and you
I wanted so much and here we are
All that I am is a disappointed and disappoint is what I do.
there is a ball in my chest where only pain and rage lives. And pride manifests just to be hurt.
I know what i
bring
to the table
I’m the only one there.

There’s a dull
floor of of hurt
and discomfort inside
It’s best to treat it as an absolute while being mindful that it is porous and unsteady
to be aware of it’s fragile nature is important when forcing yourself
to stay above it
to stay away from the depths it contains
but a mind drifts in time
where you know you deserve these feelings and you know this pain is earned and
when
you combine
it with
the thought of
the last time
any affection
or
attraction
was received
a determination degrades
a bit
I have no intention of going down
but I can see through it all lately

I don’t think it’s a matter of what I deserve. If it was, then I’m pretty lucky. I deserve much worse.
If it’s a matter of a consequences of my actions then I’m not reaping what I’ve sowed.
If it’s a matter that I’m not actually the problem then I need to be better to help fix it.
If it’s a matter of me being a victim
well
I am not
going to
accept that I don’t deserve it.
I’d walk myself into the sea if it wasn’t just another pathetic attempt by myself to matter.
I’m going to bed.
