So I had to make another Open Diary account because apparently I either got locked out of my other account or someone hacked it…. Back to what I was trying to post earlier my soon to be ex-husband Dewayne got out of jail according to his guardian ad litem…. Now I have to go Monday and file for a personal safety order to protect me and my children…. I am ready to flee the state once my divorce is finalized in March…. I am ready to go back to Tennessee where I know that I belong and be married to William…. I am going to ask my boss for some more hours so I can save up the money to move to Tennessee to be with William…. I am can’t wait to have my maiden name back so I can officially have my freedom from Dewayne…. I can’t wait to be married to William after 15 long years and I am going to be the perfect wife to William….

So I worked today in Charleston at Ulta…. I am really hoping that my boss Nikki puts me on the job for Saturday because I could really use the extra hours and the extra money…. As soon as my divorce is finalized I am taking off for awhile so me and William can get reacquainted and sit down and talk about everything before moving forward in our relationship because we have to come to a mutual agreement on everything…. I am so ready to flee the state of West Virginia and be in Tennessee already because there is nothing left for me here in West Virginia…. I am ready to take that next step in my life and be married to William and finish raising my kids in Tennessee…. As a matter of fact me and William are texting right now and that is what makes my day because I like hearing about his day and I let him vent to me because I know that it makes him feel better because he has someone there to listen to him about his problems…. I am head over heels in love with William and I just can’t help myself….

I laid around the house today because I am exhausted from work yesterday and I go back to work on Saturday…. I am going to confirm the job for Saturday tomorrow as soon as Nikki puts me on the job…. I am glad that I am actually getting hours because I really need the extra money so I can start saving money so I can move to Tennessee to be with William…. I finally told my sister Ashley that me and William are back together and she is happy for me…. I am so ready to take that next step in my life especially after my divorce is finalized…. Tomorrow I have a couple of errands to run including to getting white car back on the road…. There is not going to be any school here in Raleigh County tomorrow it’s going to be remote learning because of the ice and snow that is moving towards West Virginia tonight…. I am ready to get out of West Virginia for good and never look back.

So I have another day of relaxation so tomorrow I am going to have to buckle down and get this house cleaned…. I work on Saturday and it’s supposed to be an 8 hour shift and I sure hope so because I could really use the extra money…. I officially have a mod box vape now and I am absolutely in love with it…. I am slowly giving up those cigarettes 🚬 because I really don’t want all those extra chemicals…. I am excited that I am actually strarting to get the extra hours because I can really use the money that I am going have coming in every two weeks…. I have plans for my money I am going to save my money so I can move to Tennessee sooner than I expected because I can’t take being in West Virginia much longer…. I am ready to get the hell out of this state and move on with the next chapter of my life….

I really think that William might just be leading me on but I am not to sure…. One of my coworkers Jeremy Young has a crush on me and he revealed his feelings for me last night and we talked till about 4 this morning…. I am the only one that is going from Beckley to work in the morning in Huntington…. The other two people who was supposed to be going decided to tell me in RConnect that they wasn’t going so it is only going to be me driving the company car…. It’s okay because that just means more hours for me and it’s their loss because we really need all the people at the event in the morning…. I have to wash a few clothes and a few dishes…. I have to be ready to go in the morning and I still have to cook super this evening…. I thin that I am going to make bbq chicken, mashed potatoes, mac-n-cheese, and green beans…. <- Yum…. I have Sunday off so that is a day of rest for me and then it is back to work for me on Monday…. I am glad that payday is coming this week because I can really use the money right now….

I worked this morning and we actually got done at a decent time…. I have tomorrow off then back to work for me on Monday evening…. I can’t wait to go back to work on Monday because I get to work with my new favorite person and that is Jeremy….😈😈😈😈 William was just leading me on and I finally figured it out so I am not going to be moving to Tennessee after all because of the stunt that William pulled…. I am going to keep my butt right here in West Virginia and keep working my job and maybe try to establish a relationship with Jeremy…. Me and Jeremey not work together but we are friends outside of work…. I have more logical and meaningful conversations with Jeremy more than I did with William…. Jeremy has got me feeling something that I have never felt before…. I am dying to see Jeremy again and unfortunately I have to wait till Monday to see Jeremy…. I am going to go crazy because I am not able to see Jeremy until Monday…. I would love for Jeremy to give me that mind blowing kiss that he had mentioned in one of our conversations…. 😈😈😈😈 I never dreamed that I would have a crush on one of my coworkers so I am just going to go for it and Jeremy is going along with it…. We are making plans to hang out outside of work and honestly I can’t wait to hang out with Jeremy…. According to him that I might not be “able” to control myself once we are alone together…. 😈😈😈😈 We’ll just see how that goes because honestly I have been attracted to Jeremy since the first time that I seen him in person and the way that he cares just proves to me that he is a real man…. So I am going to continue chasing after Jeremy and dropping hints that I want him…. ❤❤❤❤

I had been on a trip for work in Ohio and I was singled out about something’s that supposedly went down…. I cleared my name and I am NOT about to lose my job over some stupid shit that clearly didn’t happen. So I cleared my name with my boss…. The zone manager that is over that zone in Ohio where I was working at for 4 days tried accusing me of some petty childish bullshit…. <- I am clearly not going to stand for that and I even informed my boss Nikki telling her that it’s wrong with what happened. I will NOT go back and ever help that zone and I have already told my boss don’t ever send me back to that zone because of the way that I was treated….

So last Wednesday I actually a face-to-face counseling session with my counselor Michelle Shrewsberry and it actually went good…. I had another face-to-face session with Michelle and once again it went good…. Work is finally picking up for me and I am actually glad because I can really use the hours…. I have been divorced a month now and I am enjoying my last name…. All I have to do is change my last name at the DMV here in Beckley…. I am trying to get my pampered chef back up and running…. I am just trying to make some extra money on the side…. Me and Jeremy are getting ready to celebrate our 2 month anniversary of being a couple here in 8 days and I can’t wait to spend that day with him…. He is the sweetest most caring man that I have ever had been with…. Honestly he finds new ways of having me fall in love with him every day…. The relationship with Jeremy is completely different on so many levels…. We have been spending together and actually we have a lot of things in common and honestly the more that I get to know Jeremy the more that I want to spend the rest of my life with him…. Jeremy is completely different on so many levels…. He is my number one supporter and I am his number one supporter and together we make one hell of a team….

I have started studying for my GED the only thing that I can do is book work until August gets here and then I can get registered as a student again…. For two days now I have been studying and I am going to go by a set schedule so I don’t overwhelm myself…. I am going to call tomorrow and ask Shannon at the Adult Learning Center to ask for more book work because I want to be prepared for the TABE test in August…. So much to do to prepare for this TABE test in August…. This is the second time that I have had to reset my password for my Instagram account because some asshole keeps trying to hack my account…. <- I ended up having to sign into my very first icloud account in order to retrieve my Instagram account and change my password…. <- That is just plain stupid and ignorant of someone trying to hack any of my social media accounts…. If I find out who it is then they will have to answer me because this has done pissed me off…. I have some pictures on my Instagram account that can’t be replaced…. I guess that I am going to have to keep changing my passwords on all of my social media accounts…. I just want to get through this rough patch at work and get the good paychecks coming in…. So Spring Cleanup is here in the City of Beckley so I decided to clean out some stuff that I didn’t need to make room for some new stuff…. I got a brand new looking solid oak coffee table from Spring Cleanup and yes I cleaned and disinfected it before even bringing into my house…. Back earlier this spring I decided to finally rearrange my bedroom and it actually looks a lot better than before…. Tomorrow I got a little bit of housework to do but mainly getting the laundry caught up especially washing up the rest of the blankets and sewing the end of my white quilt so it can be washed and dried properly…. Hopefully it will be warm enough and not raining tomorrow to actually hang the blankets out and let them dry…. I am trying to limit to using my dryer as much as possible this summer because I want to save as much money on my power bill this year…. I am going to work as much as I can this summer so come August I can step back to one to two days a week again at work because I really want to focus on my GED….

A week ago me and Jeremy celebrated our 2 month anniversary of being a couple…. Jeremy is simply the most amazing boyfriend ever…. The longer that we are together the more I find that we have in common…. I work on Monday evening and I am hoping that the company vehicle is sitting back at the MacArthur Walmart because I am already sick of using my personal vehicle…. I really hate it when Buddy (the assistant manager) doesn’t answer the phone because he is manager on duty for the week because Nikki is on vacation…. If a company is going to be ran properly then the damn managers needs to learn to answer the phone for their employees and stop ignoring the employees…. I am really getting frustrated with the company that I work for because the main manager and the assistant manager never wants to give the employees who has been there for awhile any hours but they don’t have a problem the new employees all the hours and I am so sick of it…. I am ready to tell the manager and the assistant manager both that they need to start giving the employees who has been there 6 months or longer more hours instead of giving all the hours to the new employees ONLY…. I have kept my cool with the company until back in February when a bunch of stuff went down in Ohio and I started getting accused of things that I clearly didn’t do…. I am hoping that we get a new manager soon because the current manager that we have now is completely unprofessional in several ways and I actually have the emails proving how she is being unprofessional and always begging the Beckley Crew for help and trying to bribe us by saying that she is going to reward us…. I am to the point that I am ready to call for another meeting with HR and bring up the whole unprofessionalism with the zone manager because it’s starting to get old…. I am so sick of her always putting the Beckley Crew down all because our supervisor for the Beckley Crew got an email from the regional manager telling her that the Beckley Crew is doing a great job and we actually do a better job than the Barboursville Crew…. I am going to tell the zone manager that she needs to learn be professional and stop bribing employees by saying that she is going to reward them…. She also needs to cut the Beckley Crew a break because she is just angry that we actually got a good compliment from the regional manager…. Maybe if the Barboursville Crew would actually do their jobs the right way the first time then maybe they would get a compliment from the regional manager…. I am going to be blunt with her from now on and I am not going to bow down and kiss her ass…. I go do my job get it done and go home…. Another thing that pisses me off about the company is that when the Beckley Crew is helping at an event outside of Beckley we always get sent home when a store is at 95% done because they want the Barboursville team to stay and finish up the last 5 % of the store…. <- According to the company handbook all employees are to stay until the end of the event including finding missing tags and make sure that all of the areas are complete and transmitted to the AP…. There is several things that I plan on bringing up in the meeting with HR when I finally get another meeting with HR…. I have everything together for a meeting with HR and I know that I am going to piss my zone manager off but I don’t care anymore I am NOT going to be silent about any of this anymore because enough is enough and it’s about time that HR knows everything that has been going on for the past two months…. I am going to lay it all out on the table and tell HR that “some” employees, supervisors and  managers aren’t going by the company handbook…. <- Let’s see how far the zone manager, the assistant manager, and some of the supervisors gets at the company because I am getting ready to bust their chops big time and honestly I don’t care anymore…. I will eventually move onto a better job because I am finishing my GED and then I am going to get a degree to be a PTA or a PA…. I am ready to finish my GED and move on with a better job and I know that once I have my GED diploma in my hand there is going to be plenty of jobs for me because I will be finished with school for a couple of years….

Yesterday I worked in Dunbar at Ollie’s and we got done at a decent time…. I don’t have to go back to work until Monday morning…. I am so glad that I am getting to work with my boyfriend Jeremy again and I work with him 3 days this week coming…. I am glad that I was able to get back into one of my accounts for my GED preparation come mid-August…. I just ordered two books from Amazon to help me further my studying…. I am going to take the rest of this evening to study for my GED…. I am going to go the Adult Learning Center in mid-August and show them that I have been studying and I am ready to go take the actual test for my GED diploma…. I am going to be glad whenever I finish my GED…. I have been studying online since about 3 o’clock this afternoon…. I am still studying because I am determined to get as much studying that I can get done before mid-August gets here…. I am ready to get my GED done so I can move onto a better future…. I just now finished studying for the night and I am going to be studying again tomorrow and I might get started a little bit earlier than today…. I am so glad that I was able to get back into my Edgenuity account so I can study online instead of just working out of the books because book work can tend to get boring and all start running together after awhile…. I am going to be excited whenever my GED books gets here so I can get started on them and get them knocked out…. I have to find me a calculator because I don’t know what exactly happened to mine that I had for about 3 years…. I have a little bit of housework to do tomorrow either before or after I study online….

So I go back to work on Monday morning at Khol’s in Charleston and that’s an 8 hour job…. I also work Tuesday night and Thursday night…. I have to wait till this Saturday coming to find out my next schedule looks like and I can’t wait…. Hopefully that I will have more hours coming than what I have had in the past two weeks…. I have been decorating my living room and cleaning my bedroom…. I am going to be cleaning all of the carpets tomorrow because they desperately need to be cleaned…. I am loving the fact that I am finding new ways to decorate my house because I am always wanting to change the way that my house looks from time to time…. I am trying to come up with themes for each room of my house that still needs to be decorated…. So my dryer is down again and this time I don’t know exactly what’s wrong with it…. Now if I have to dry the laundry on a rainy day I have to drive to a laundromat to dry my clothes until I can figure out what’s wrong with my dryer…. I plan on trying to get as much housework done as I can before I have to go back to work on Monday morning…. I still have to wash the rest of my work clothes…. Hopefully it doesn’t rain tomorrow so I can hang the laundry out to dry…. I have officially got one of my air conditioners in and the other one is going in the living room some time tomorrow…. I have been studying a little bit today and I plan on get some more studying done tomorrow because I really want to be prepared for the GED prep test come mid-August…. I am going to be doing a lot of rearranging tomorrow because I want a fresh look for my living room and I just giving my bedroom a makeover and it looks a lot better…. So apparently I have to have a meeting with Michelle Shrewsberry because her supervisor says that would be the best thing for me right now because otherwise then she is going to talk to Nicole Farrah about finding me another counselor…. I would prefer to have a different counselor other than Michelle Shrewsberry because I am not going to ever let her belittle me the way she did again…. <- I am the type of person who doesn’t like to be belittled and the person who belittled me thinks that they are going to get away with it because I will get something done about it even if I have to go to the administrator over the problem that has occurred…. All of my bills paid for this month…. I am really needing more hours at work because now that summer is coming I plan on taking a couple of vacations before fall gets here and before I go back to school in mid-August…. This weekend I definitely have to clean out my closet in my bedroom and go through the clothes that I don’t wear or what doesn’t fit me so I can give them away to someone who actually may need them…. I am too excited I got my swing up and now I can sit outside on pretty days and enjoy the sun, I even have a glider that I can sit on and enjoy the sun…. I can’t wait to get my front porch cleaned off so I can put my grill on one end of my porch, have a couple of chairs on the porch, and put my glider on the other end of my front porch…. I am so happy that I am able to actually be putting outside furniture on my front porch…. Spring Cleanup in the City of Beckley was a great success and I got a few nice things out of it…. Tomorrow I am going to start in the kitchen and see what I can move around and clean the kitchen real good, clean the stove, the refrigerator and freezer is going to get cleaned out, and I am going to disinfect everything tomorrow so that means that my schedule for the is completely filled up…. I am just trying to keep myself busy when I am not working, trying to balance being a parent, and trying to balance a relationship, and so far I think that I am doing pretty good…. I am going to keep striving and keep reaching for all of my goals that I have set for myself….

So today makes 2 years that I officially moved into the house that I live in now…. I have been renting off of the same landlord for the past 3 years…. I found out Monday night whenever I worked at the Ollie’s in Dunbar that my last name still hasn’t changed in the RGIS’ system so I guess that I am going to email HR and ask them why my name hasn’t changed in the system. I just sent RGIS HR an email explaining to them that I submitted my paperwork for my name change, I also told them that they need to fix my phone number, and email address on RConnect…. <- Hopefully I will hear something back from RGIS HR tomorrow or maybe even a phone call…. There is some things that needs to be fixed and I am going to make sure that they are fixed…. <- My name on my badge has changed but it still needs to be fixed in the system and on RConnect…. I have some housework to get done tomorrow and I have to figure out whether it’s going to rain or not tomorrow because if it’s not raining I am going to be hanging the laundry to dry…. I am not really wanting to spend money to dry my clothes at the laundromat….

So I worked last night at Ollie’s in Barboursville…. I actually hit my specialist numbers so I think that it’s time that I got a promotion…. Anyway the supervisor who was running the event Buddy Lynch was being his “typical” self again…. So I tried talking to my boss Nikki about Buddy smarting me off she told me to ignore him…. <- Whatever Nikki I ended up just giving Buddy one star because I was not able to complete the feedback for the store…. <- Every event that I have worked with Buddy so far this year I have only given him one star because he is all the time smarting me off if I could not give any stars at all would be even better because he doesn’t deserve any stars from me…. Tomorrow the new schedule comes out for work and I can’t wait to see what the new schedule holds for me because honestly I need all the hours that I can get right now because I am wanting to start saving for a nice vacation…. I am ready to move out of the City of Beckley because honestly I am getting sick of the neighbors across the street and all the drugs…. The City of Beckley is NO place to be raising children so I see myself moving out of this house and finding somewhere else to live because I am sick of living in the middle of Beckley…. I am beginning to hate living in this house because honestly there is always something going on…. Time for me to find another place to live maybe an apartment so on Monday I am going to call my landlord and ask her if there is any apartments for rent within my price range….

First of all Happy Mother’s Day to all…. I actually had an ok Mother’s Day could’ve been better…. I got to see my baby Jeremy today and meet the rest of the dogs…. I am glad that I actually got to see my baby Jeremy today because it made my day…. I only have one day at work this week and I have two days next week…. I am going to be glad to see my paycheck this week because I need that money…. Maybe the following week I will have more hours because I really need the hours…. I am taking all of the hours that I can get right now but I can always use more hours at work…. I am ready for a long overdue vacation away from this house…. I am going to have to save money if I want to take that vacation before the end of the summer…. I have been thinking about where I want me and Jeremy to go for our little getaway vacation but haven’t made a final decision. My mother is back to being her typical self again…. <- What have I done wrong now because my mother is once again blowing me off like I don’t exist…. I always swore to myself that I was going to be a better mother to my kids than my mother was ever to me…. My mother doesn’t know what she is missing out on and she is starting to blow my kids off too just the way she did to me when I was growing up…. I am glad to have Jeremy in my life because he has been there for me even before we started dating…. We may of started out as co-workers/friends but it blossomed into an amazing relationship…. We are coming up on our 3 month anniversary of being a couple and we have already planned out our future…. <- He is the sweetest man ever…. I know that I am going to be marrying into a wonderful family one day…. August 17th will make 6 months of me and Jeremy being a couple…. Every day he finds new ways of having me fall even more in love with him….      
What can I say I love that man and he makes me very very happy…. One day I am going to be his wife and until that day I am going to continue patiently waiting for him to pop the question…. He is the only man that I want to make wonderful memories with….

Wednesday was a rough day for me at work because Crystal the supervisor who was running the event didn’t have a clue how to run Rose’s in Bluefield, WV…. Also Monica was trying to push my buttons the wrong way and I told her to shut up that she wasn’t my boss and for her to leave me alone because I was actually working unlike her…. <- Monica gets on my nerves and she has finally figured out that she can’t push my buttons because I fire back at her…. I have been trying to catch up on my housework today and I have more housework to do tomorrow…. I have a doctors appointment on Monday with my regular doctor and then on Tuesday I have an appointment with the neurologist Dr. Richards and then I have a counseling appointment with Michelle at 2:30 then I work in Bluefield, VA at Ollie’s that night…. I have only 2 days this week and tomorrow the new schedule comes out tomorrow and I can’t wait to see what the new work schedule holds for me…. I have mentioned to my boss Nikki that I need all the hours that I can get because I am really trying to save for a vacation…. Hopefully work will be picking up soon because work has been really slow for the past month or so…. I have been studying for my GED as much as possible but I have a feeling that I am not going to get much studying done come June because I have a feeling that work is going to be picking up….

I got my first dose of the COVID-19 shot the Pfizer brand on Friday the 21st…. I only have day this week and that is in the morning at Shoe Carnival in the mall…. I have 2 days next week and that’s it…. I can’t wait for the hours to start really picking up soon because I really need the money and the hours…. It is sad that RGIS’ biggest competitor bought RGIS out WIS International and now the two companies are slowly becoming one company…. WIS International is the company that I used to work for and I got away from them and actually went to a better company which RGIS…. So now RGIS and WIS International will be one big company…. <- Yawn because now I have to deal with the idiots that I worked with at WIS International…. <- That means that the whole RGIS company will have to go through retraining for WIS International…. <- I am definitely going to be a supervisor for RGIS sooner than I thought…. <- Yay me because I actually deserve to be a supervisor I have proved to RGIS many times that I have what it takes to be a supervisor….

I am back with Bobby Gray and I honestly couldn’t be happier because I was strung along for 6 long months by Jeremy…. I am way better off with Bobby because NOT only does he have a job but he doesn’t live with his parents and he doesn’t make empty promises that he can’t keep…. After loving someone like Bobby for 3 years I can’t simply start a new life with a complete stranger…. Me and Bobby has decided to get married next year on 5-14-2022…. <- NO JUDGING ME!!!! I am allowed to be happy and I have found my happiness with Bobby Gray…. Bobby is the ONLY one who has ever made me truly happy and he actually accepted me for me and NOT some phony-baloney fake person that others in my past expected me to be…. Also back on Tuesday 8-31-2021 I officially quit my job at RGIS after an 8 and 1/2 hour shift counting Rural King because I had had enough of being belittled and being accused of things that I was NOT doing…. <- Bobby supported my decision especially after I told him what had happened and he said that I NEVER have to work again if I don’t want too…. What can I say I have a wonderful fiance’ Bobby Gray…. I am just happy to finally be marrying Bobby Gray…. He has stability, he has so much love for me, he has accepted the fact that I have 3 kids, and he has accepted that I am FAR from ever being PERFECT…. I am going to be his wife in 8 months and 12 days and I can’t wait to be Mrs. Gray…. Bobby has really helped me through some really tough times and he is my #1 supporter no matter what I decide…. I love the fact that he works, he is 16 and 1/2 years older than me (but who cares because age is just a number when you truly truly love someone), he NEVER judges my appearance (now I mostly lounge around in sweatpants or yoga pants and he doesn’t care), and loves me NO matter what…. I am ready to be married to Bobby because he is the ONE I am going to be settling down with and I will be spending the rest of my life with…. Bobby comes home to a clean house, a hot meal, clean laundry, and clean work clothes for work….

Yesterday I really didn’t do any housework because I was mainly focused on getting everything that needs to be done for the wedding…. I have got more wedding planning to do but tomorrow I am going to take a break so I can go to Naoma and spend time with Bobby and his dad Big Bobby…. Plus I want to take pictures of the church where me and Bobby are getting married so I have a better idea of what I am working with when it comes to decorating the church for the wedding next year…. I am so excited to be getting married next year…. I still have so much to do before the big day gets here…. I am ready for my wedding planning book to be delivered sometime today…. <- It’s apparently on it’s way to be delivered to my house…. <- I sure hope so because I need to start working in that wedding planning book so I can get it out of the way…. I am ready to all of this wedding planning done so I can sit back and relax and then work on getting someone to take engagement photos…. I am going to start my long search of finding a photographer to take engagement photos for me and Bobby so that will be out of the way…. I have talked to FedEx on several occasions and they told me that I won’t be receiving my package until Tuesday because my package is still sitting in Grove City, OH…. <- Oh what joy because I was really needing that package today so I could begin working on my wedding planning book…. I am ready to get married but I know that I have to wait till next year in May…. I am just now getting around to making dinner because I just finished making a presentation for mine and Bobby’s wedding and I still have to get baby pictures of me and Bobby so I can do a power point at our wedding….

Even though today is Labor Day I am cleaning house…. I have to get this house back in order and organized the way that it needs to be…. I have a lot of work to get this house back order and I am going to clean this house 2 rooms at a time so I won’t have so much to do when it comes to cleaning this house…. I got my bedroom halfway cleaned today before leaving to go Bobby’s dads house to have a cookout and spend time with his dad…. Today was a good day for me and I am glad that everything went smoothly with the cookout…. The holiday weekend is over and it’s back to reality tomorrow…. <- UGH!!!! That means back to house cleaning for me tomorrow and getting the laundry caught up…. I have noticed that there has been a lot of memories made over the past 3 years especially in the house where we are living now…. I have to start posting pictures of the house that me, Bobby and the kids lives in…. It’s almost time to start decorating for Halloween 🎃🎃 and I can’t wait because I have some new ideas on how I want to decorate the house this year…. Tomorrow I think that I am going to finish cleaning my bedroom then start in Amber’s (my daughter) room and then I am going to finish cleaning my bathroom…. Wednesday I am going to finish the living room, then start on the kitchen get everything wiped down and sanitized, wash the dishes, and clean then clean the other bathroom (the boy’s bathroom)…. Thursday I am going to mop all the floors, vacuum the carpet, shampoo all of the carpets, and wipe everything down and sanitize everything else in the house…. I can’t take a chance on any of us getting sick this year and that’s why I am wiping everything down and sanitizing everything in the house…. Hopefully tomorrow FedEx will have some answers to where my package is at because clearly they don’t know how to deliver a package on time or when they say that they are going to deliver such package….

I have been busy today cleaning and sanitizing the Gray household…. More cleaning to do tomorrow while my man/husband-to-be is at work…. I also got to get the laundry caught up it’s going to take me a few days or even maybe a week to get the laundry caught up…. Tomorrow I am going to clean the kitchen and the bathroom by the back door…. One room at a time so I don’t overwhelm myself on the housework that needs to be done…. Eventually I am going to have to start studying for my GED so I will be ready to take the test in November sometime…. The laundry is like the never ending story but it’s never ending laundry…. <- Lol…. It won’t be long until it will be time to take the air conditioners out for the winter because fall has set in early here in WV…. I have managed to get 3 rooms cleaned today and I have more to do tomorrow…. More shampooing the carpets for me tomorrow…. Now that I am a stay at mom/wife-to-be my life now consists of keeping the house clean for my family and making sure that everyone has clean clothes…. This mom/wife-to-be is beyond exhausted this evening…. Time for some R&R and back at it tomorrow morning…. Tomorrow I am going to clean the kitchen, wash the dishes, and clean the bathroom back the back door….

I have officially started back to finishing my GED and I am now enrolled in Fayette County Adult Basic Education Center…. I have been working on the computer because I am doing what they called social distancing learning because most of the counties in WV are in the red…. It only took Mr. Jackson two days to get me started officially in Fayette County…. I got sick of Tammy Toney at the Raleigh County Adult Basic Education Center always pushing me further and further back…. <- So I took a stand and called the state board of education and told them what Tammy Toney was doing to me…. Let’s just put it this way Tammy Toney is in some serious trouble for pushing students further and further back from completing their education….                                              
 I am still thinking about what Jon asked me on Sunday because right now I am clearly NOT ready to go back into another marriage even though I would be re-marrying Jon for the 2nd time…. <- My divorce was just finalized from my second ex-husband Dewayne back in March of this year…. Don’t get me wrong I love Jon but I am just NOT ready to be married again…. Jon just asked me to move me and the kids in again…. What do I say because I haven’t really had time to think about it because he just asked me on Sunday on the way to the flea market in Pence Springs…. I mean that I am beyond ready to be back with Jon but right now I just need time to think things through before I make a serious decision like that…. I have got serious thinking to do before I make any serious decisions that can be life changing…. I know that my kids needs a dad in their lives and I know that I need a man that is going to love me for me….  
I know that I have a lot to think about and I am going to do some serious thinking before I make any decisions…. Right now I just want to have my freedom before I decide to ever get married again…. I have ONLY been divorced from Dewayne for 6 months and that means that I am clearly NOT ready for another marriage right now…. Am I really ready to be back with my first ex-husband just yet???? I honestly just want to have my maiden name for awhile before I ever decide to get married again because I want to enjoy having my maiden name back…. I need time to think and I need time to myself before I make any serious decisions that is going to change mine and my kids lives…. I just don’t know what to do right now…. I have my own home for me and my kids and I really don’t want to be tied down to another marriage at this very moment…. 
I am just going to have think about all of this and I have to have time to process everything before I make any decisions…. I am going to let him know what I am going to do and hopefully he will respect me more for that and if not then I will know what he really thinks about me…. Advice is greatly appreciated but NO judging me please….

I had to get another extension for my cable and internet because I don’t get my check till Monday…. Suddenlink is really starting to test my nerves here lately…. I am getting tired of paying the outrageous prices for my bundle which includes cable, internet, and home phone when I don’t have access to my home phone…. <- Suddenlink keeps telling me that there is an outage for the home phone services when clearly the light on my WiFi/phone box is NOT even lit up…. Clearly they are giving me the runaround about my home phone services…. <- They have tested my nerves for the last time and I am going to tell them tomorrow that my home phone needs to be working because I am paying to have that service and it’s NOT working and that I am beyond fed up with them giving me the runaround about my home phone service that they need to fix the problem…. They are going to fix it or I am going to get angry and tell them where to shove their services and go somewhere else to get my cable, internet and home phone services…. I am one of the many customers that is fed up with Suddenlink…. For two days in a row I busted my butt trying to get this house clean and keep it clean…. I am NOT going to be doing any house work this weekend because I have schoolwork to get done especially if I want to graduate this year….

I am so disappointed with Jon because come to find out he is just using me for revenge on his soon to be ex-wife…. <- Such a let down and such a disappointment…. He is NOT going to use me like that then toss me to the side like a blanket…. I have decided to stay single for awhile because I am tired of always getting hurt or used…. I am going to set my standards high and not settle for anything less because I know my worth…. I know that my special someone is out there somewhere but hasn’t found his way to me yet…. <- Where is my Romeo???? I figured since my divorce was finalized back in March and after Jeremy broke up with me and after I kicked Bobby out I would have the guys trying to knock down my door but it’s not happening….

I have been washing laundry all day and I still have more to do but it is mainly bed linens…. I have officially fallen for a man who is a little bit older than me…. I am NOT going to reveal his name just yet because I want to keep y’all in suspense…. Let’s put it this way that he is a true gentleman and he gives me all the attention that I want and then some…. I can’t wait to see him again and when I do see him again I am going to run and jump in his arms and NEVER let him go…. He texts me every morning, throughout the day, and he texts me good night…. He loves the way that I look and I most definitely love the way that he looks especially when he wears his ball cap backwards and when he wears his cowboy hat…. I am definitely looking forward to seeing him again so we can go riding around in his truck…. He is so beyond perfect in my eyes and NO one else’s opinion matters…. He is all mine and I am going to lock that down one of these days…. We have so much in common and I think that it is romantic…. He is just a simple country boy….

PLEASE DON’T JUDGE ME & NO NEGATIVE COMMENTS!!!! I am officially married to Bobby Gray and it took place yesterday at the Raleigh County Courthouse @ 4 PM…. His dad was there to witness us getting married and to record our wedding ceremony so our families could see us get married and it is on Facebook…. I am glad to be married to Bobby because he is amazing husband…. If there is ONE thing that I have came to realize is that Bobby loves me like NO other man in my past has tried to love me…. After 3 and 1/2 years I am married to my sweetheart and I am officially Mrs. Gray and I like that name GRAY…. We was married by judge H.L. Kirkpatrick, III and he is my favorite person…. Next year me and Bobby will be having our wedding reception because it is already too late in the year to have a wedding reception because it is starting to get cold outside…. We are having a nice spring wedding reception and it is going to be close to Bobby’s birthday…. We are also planning our honeymoon but we haven’t quite decided to take our honeymoon…. I have been working on our wedding scrapbook and I still have more to add to it and it is going to look nice whenever I am finished with our scrapbook….

Yesterday me and Bobby had our first argument as husband and wife all because I didn’t want his help with trying to find what I did with my Pokemon Go app on my phone…. I simply told him to leave me alone and let me figure it out on my own…. <- He persisted on helping me after I told him to leave me alone…. <- Which that pissed me off so I told him off…. It is what it is because he needs to learn when I say leave me alone then that means go away and let me calm down and NOT to keep aggravating me because that ONLY pisses me off even more…. Tomorrow I have some housework to do and try to finish up the laundry including the bed linens…. My husband made supper for us spaghetti with garlic bread and it was delicious in my opinion…. I also have to run to the grocery store tomorrow while my husband is at work…. I think that I am going to make homemade chili and cornbread for tomorrow’s supper since fall is finally sitting in here in southern WV…. <- My husband loves when I make my homemade chili and cornbread…. I have been cooking for my husband for 3 1/2 years now and I have NEVER had a complaint from him yet…. <- What can I say my husband loves my cooking…. I don’t know what I am going to do about our male cat Claws because even though he is “neutered” he still has a tendency to grab my 4 month old female cat Sassy by the back of her neck so he can try to rape her…. I have spoken to the vet where he was “neutered” and they told me that it is normal for male cats to do that…. <- I told them that they better pray that my female cat Sassy doesn’t end up pregnant by my male cat Claws because otherwise they will have a lawsuit on there hands because me and Bobby paid for 3 of our male cats to be neutered back last year Claws, Oreo, and Patches was “neutered” and Claws is the ONLY one acting like that…. I even told them that I had my other male cat Trigger “neutered” this year and he doesn’t act like Claws is acting….

I will be able to have all of my games that I used to play on Bobby’s old computer on my MacBook…. What can I say I have finally stepped up my computer world and everything else in the Apple world…. I am very very pleased with MacBook and everything else that Apple has made so far…. I now feel like that I can accomplish anything that includes finishing my education…. I still have to do a factory reset on the Chromebook before turning it over to Bobby…. Now I can hook my Magic Mouse to my MacBook…. I am now set with the new computer in my Apple collection….

I am just having a rough day…. It started out good and then when I called Suddenlink to check on why my house phone wasn’t working the representative told me that my house phone had to be reactivated and I told the representative to reactivate my house phone and he said that it was going to take 2 or so for it to come back on…. <- My house phone is still NOT on and now I am beyond angry with Suddenlink and now they will have top answer to me whenever I call them tomorrow because I know good and well that I paid that bill for Suddenlink…. I am beyond sick of dealing with Suddenlink and the way that they are treating the Suddenlink customers…. Suddenlink representatives needs to learn how to treat Suddenlink customers better than they do now because they are about to lose a lot of customers here in WV…. <- Their prices are way too high to begin with and after ONLY one month they jack the prices up higher than what they advertise…. I have even went as far as talking to my husband about possibly switching to Frontier for our internet and phone services and switching to Direct TV for our cable service because I am fed up with paying outrageous cable bills every month just to have services through Suddenlink….

My husband decided he wanted to be a brat earlier today and I exposed his bratty-a$$ on Facebook…. He got mad and threw a pop bottle against the wall in our bedroom and I called him out for his bratty behavior and that just pissed him off even more that’s when he proceeded to curse me even more…. I honestly don’t see this marriage lasting much longer with him behaving the way he has been here lately…. I am ready to call our marriage quits or find a marriage counselor because honestly his behavior is NOT husband material…. I am still in pain from that car accident back on October 7th….

Today makes one month since the car accident and I am NOT really any better…. I am still having problems with my left shoulder, my left arm and left hand goes numb from time to time…. Tomorrow I go to my doctor for a month follow up since the accident…. I have a sick hubby on my hands and he has been sick since Thursday so that means that he has to go to the doctor in the morning because he missed work Friday and he has to miss work in the morning…. <- We didn’t even go to his dad’s on Saturday because he is sick and I caught whatever he has because I woke up sick Saturday morning…. My husband keeps saying that he may have COVID-19…. <- I sure hope he doesn’t have COVID-19 because that means that we both have to be quarantined for 14 days and knowing my luck I will end up in the hospital…. I just got finished running my Roomba iRobot for the night and tomorrow I have to run the Roomba iRobot again in the kitchen, my bedroom, and the kids rooms…. <- Having the Roomba iRobot makes my life much easier and I am thinking about getting another Roomba iRobot so I can have two running at the same time so I know that the house will get clean a lot faster than just running one Roomba iRobot…. <- Maybe my hubby will buy me another one for Christmas…. I know that me and my hubby is in for many many bumps in our marriage but once I mention that I want to marriage counseling maybe he will straighten up…. <- I really don’t want to go through a 3rd divorce because of another failed marriage all because my husband doesn’t want to try to make the marriage work…. He keeps hollering that he is the “boss” when clearly the marriage is supposed to be 50/50…. He swore to me that he was different than my first 2 husbands that he was going to treat me better…. <- Is it me or does a man change once he gets married…. I understand that my husband is 16 years older than me but that shouldn’t matter we should be equals in the marriage…. He works and I am a stay at home wife and mom….

I just want to sleep and try to rest as much as possible so my body can try to fight this off…. I am to the point that I am ready to cut my phone off and then try to get much needed rest….

Today makes 8 years since I have made my driver’s license…. I went to my grandmother’s house like I do every year the day after Christmas and she informed me that she didn’t get me a Christmas gift but she also mentioned to me that she bought everyone else in the family a Christmas gift except for me…. Like I have always said I have been the black sheep on my birth mother’s side of the family because they have a tendency to show favoritism towards everyone else except for me…. I found a game that I played back in the day whenever internet was so expensive that I played on the computer called Space Pinball 3D…. <- It is still the same game that I remember playing…. My cat Socks keeps having seizures and I am going to have to get him to the vet so they can give him Kitty Keppra for his seizures…. <- I had already talked to a veterinarian about my Keppra and they told me that human Keppra and Kitty Keppra has two completely different formulas…. There is a really good possibility that we will be moving out of this rental house because there is a really good possibility that we are buying a house a lot closer to my father-in-law’s house in Naoma and I can’t wait…. <- Because I am honestly sick of living here at this rental property because if it ain’t ONE thing going wrong with this house it’s ANOTHER and the landlord won’t get the repairman out here to fix the problems with this stupid rental house…. <- We have lived in this stupid house for almost 3 years NOW and ever since the original landlord’s son and granddaughter has taken over the rental property where we live NOTHING and I mean NOTHING is getting fixed and it states in the rental agreement that THE LANDLORD IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL REPAIRS TO BE MADE TO THE RENTAL PROPERTY…. <- Honestly I can’t wait for the day that we move out of this rental property because I am going to tell the landlord’s granddaughter where she can shove this house because she NEVER wants to get the repairman out here to fix anything that goes wrong with this house and then I am going to turn around and call the health department and code enforcement on her because there is several things that I can and will get her in trouble for on a lot of these rental properties…. <- So she doesn’t want to push me too far because I will push right back and I am NOT the one person she wants to be messing with because there is so many things that I can and will get her in trouble for….

This morning I threw my back out by lifting a 22 pound bag of cat food up at the Family Dollar by the house…. So I had to go to the doctor and come to find out that my doctor had ordered 11 x-ray’s and 8 tubes of bloodwork for me back in October/November…. I am still in severe pain and there is really NO helping me until the results comes back tomorrow…. I had to see a different provider and she was NOT very nice to me…. Tomorrow I have a follow up appointment with my provider Chris Thompson and I can’t wait to tell him exactly how that other provider treated me today and it was sad that I had to have the office manager in there with me because the provider that I had to see today doesn’t know anything about my medical history…. Sometime this week I have to have the A1-C bloodwork done to be checked for diabetes…. <- I have to be fasting for that bloodwork…. <- Good luck for that with me because I can’t go without anything to drink throughout the night because I stay extremely thirsty especially in the middle of the night…. I am on bed rest until my back gets better because it’s the provider that I seen today orders which means that I am NOT allowed to be doing any housework and that is going to suck because I have so much to do and unfortunately some of my housework includes lifting and pulling the laundry basket…. I just want this pain to go away so I can get back to somewhat normal and get back on top of keeping this house cleaned…. I am so beyond fed up with living in this house because the landlord’s son and granddaughter both will NOT give me any answers to getting my bathroom floor fixed because it is has been falling in for awhile now and the repairman has NOT came to fix the floor yet…. <- I am about to make that phone call to the health department and to code enforcement and let them know about this house and that the landlord’s son and granddaughter has NOT done anything to get the bathroom floor or anything else in this house fixed like it has been stated in the rental agreement…. This house is clearly falling apart and the landlord’s son and granddaughter doesn’t care that this house is falling in….

Today is the last day of 2021 and I really have NO New Year’s resolution’s for 2022…. Maybe Bobby will start treating me better and maybe just maybe he will STOP throwing divorce up in my face…. <- As it looks right now Bobby is NOT going to change and I am just sitting myself up for heartache and trouble in 2022…. I am NOT going to get my heat broke by Bobby Gray this year coming…. I am NOT going to be with someone who doesn’t want to be with me and I am NOT going to be with someone who keeps throwing divorce up in my face…. I am ready to give Bobby what he really wants and that’s a divorce since he keeps throwing it up in my face…. He keeps telling me that he is going to leave me and that he is going to take everything away from me…. I have had enough of his b/s and I am NOT going to stay with him especially if he doesn’t want anything to do with me…. Nobody really knows how he is behind closed doors and he puts on a front in front of everyone like he is the perfect husband but ONCE we get to ourselves then he is a complete ass to me and honestly I am beyond fed up with him…. I am NO longer going to be his wife especially since he is acting like a compete ass towards me….

It is the New Year and the day has been NOTHING but a bad day for me…. As I was going out the door to go get my coffee Bobby was coming out the door behind me yelling at me so I finally turned around and said what the f**k do you want now Bobby…. <- He looked at and said “you’ll pay for what you just said to me b***h” I turned around and walked back in the house and asked him what he meant by that and he said you know what I mean b***h…. As the whole time I was gone to get my coffee and breakfast for us I was thinking how I was going to make him pay…. When I got back and walked in the house he looked at me and asked me what my problem was and I looked directly at him and said you my f***ing problem…. <- I am fed up with the way that he treats me…. My stepmom has checked on me all day because I have been physically sick at my stomach because of the fighting and arguing that has been going on for sometime now between me and Bobby and my body finally said forget you I am going to make you sick to your stomach…. <- This is NO way to start a New Year and this is NO way for a woman to live…. I have done NOTHING but take care of his lazy ass for the past 3 1/2 years and he does NOTHING but sit on his ass all weekend from Friday evening whenever he gets off of work until sometime Sunday night when goes to bed for work…. <- He does NOTHING to help me around the house and then expects me to set my alarm on my phone for him to get up for work Monday thru Friday…. Things NEEDS to change or he will be out on his ass and living back down at his dad’s house in Naoma…. Another bad year for me and it is ONLY going to get worse unless I make some drastic changes and I am going to start by getting rid of Bobby’s lazy ass because I don’t NEED a man who is going to break me down even more mentally and I definitely don’t NEED a man who doesn’t want to be with me in any way…. Monday I guess it is back to me cleaning this house and trying to get the laundry caught back up all by myself because my kids goes back to school Monday morning…. The license plate sticker is dead on my Ford Fusion and I can’t get it renewed until the end of January…. My back is slowly healing up and I am still limited to what I can do with my back being injured…. I am really ready to move on with my life and finish raising my 3 kids by myself…. <- I don’t want a man who is going to break me down mentally worse than what I am already and I don’t want a man who doesn’t want to help around the house…. Bobby has been b****ing at me since last week because I haven’t really been able to do any of my regular housework and he is b****ing because he NEEDS his work clothes to be washed right then and there…. <- I finally told him the other day that it ain’t going to kill him to get off his ass and load the washer and dryer so he can have work clothes…. I have also told him that he NEEDS to learn to help keep the house clean that it ain’t going to kill him to help me…. <- How dare he b***h at me for NOT jumping up every single time that he wants me to do something for him…. I took my wedding bands off earlier today and I seriously doubt that I am ever going to put them back on as long as I am married to Bobby Gray…. Bobby is about to realize that is getting ready to lose a good woman who has taken care of him for the past 3 1/2 years and made sure that he has held down his job at Beckley Public Works – Street Department…. If it wasn’t me he would have already gotten fired the first time that he got wrote up for something that he could’ve completely avoided doing….

Hopefully tomorrow I can get my car back on the road and then go get some groceries for the house…. I went to Kroger’s in Beaver I couldn’t even get in the parking lot because it was so full and then I decided to go to the other Kroger’s over at the Crossing Shopping Center here in Beckley because I needed to get some drinks and a couple of other things to hold us over till I can get groceries tomorrow sometime…. Bobby is still being an ass towards me and I am really getting fed up with him and I am about ready to tell him to go back to Naoma that I don’t want him at this house anymore…. The national weather service is calling for 4-7 inches of snow starting tonight and it doesn’t look like it is going to cut WV a break until sometime next week…. I wanted snow for my birthday on Friday…. <- I will be turning 34 this year…. <- Yay me it’s going to be another bad birthday for me….

Today has been a crappy birthday for me because Bobby has done NOTHING but b***hed at me about getting this house cleaned…. So I am working on getting the 3rd load of laundry washed and the 2nd load dried…. <- That means that I am NOT really going to be able to get some sleep tonight because I have to get the laundry done otherwise Bobby is going to b****h at me some more until I get the laundry done and the house cleaned…. <- I can’t take much more of him b****hing at me over getting the laundry done and cleaning this house…. It’s NOT going to kill him to put a load of laundry in the washer and it’s NOT going to kill him to help me clean this house…. I have had enough and I am going to tell him just how I feel and if he doesn’t like it then he knows where the door is he can use to leave this house and NEVER come back because I am done….

Wait for the divorce court hearing to come in the mail then show up to the court hearing and then tell the judge that I want my divorce from Bobby Gray because he NEVER wanted to be married to me in the first place that he was just using me…. I am going to move back to Virginia where I know me and my kids are going to finally be happy for once in our lives…. I found out today that Bobby has been cheating on me for awhile now because he hasn’t been happy with being married to me…. <- So guess what I am definitely going to leave Bobby now because I am NOT going to be with a man who is cheating on me and I am NOT going to be with someone who doesn’t want to be with me….

I was watching the news this morning and they’re is another snow storm on it’s way starting tonight into tomorrow sometime…. Unfortunately Bobby is home today because he is claiming that he “food poisoning” so he could stay home…. <- I really wish that he would’ve went to work so he would stay out of my hair and out of my way…. He decided to start on me while I was video chat with my stepmom this morning and that caused her to hang up because she didn’t want to hear him starting on me like he always does…. My regular doctor prescribed me Zofran for my nausea/vomiting…. The divorce packet came in the mail today and I am going to get started on them tomorrow morning…. There is NO school for Raleigh County again due to the bad weather and the secondary roads being in horrible shape…. <- That means that my kids will be on Remote Learning for tomorrow…. I have some housework to do tomorrow no matter how bad I feel while the kids are on Remote Learning…. I have to get my house back in order and cleaned the way that I want it to be because I can’t stand it the way it looks right now…. I am finally getting an EEG and it is for 7 days/168 hours because that is what my neurologist ordered I will be allowed to shower twice while wearing the EEG and the technician has to be here to take the 23 leads off go my head both times then on the last day the technician will unhook me from the EEG then I will have to wait for my neurologist to get the results so he can finally pin point what type of seizures that I am having…. <- I feel like that my privacy is going to be getting invaded because the way that the lady was explaining to me is that the technician will be setting up cameras where I sleep and where I spend most of my time…. <- Invasion of my privacy right there but I have to abide in order for my neurologist to get what he is needing in order to properly diagnose me and what type of seizures I am having…. I was also informed that I am not allowed to be do anything that is going to make me sweat…. That EEG is going to drive me crazy because I am not going to be able to do anything with my hair and I may be stripped of my seizure medication during the duration of the EEG….

Yesterday I got my bedroom halfway clean and today I have to finish cleaning my bedroom…. I have more housework to do today and get the laundry caught up…. I have a busy week ahead of me and this is only day 2 of trying get this house cleaned and organized…. <- I am the ONLY one that cleans this house and I can only do so much in one day…. I am going to do my best to get this housework done this week so then I can rearrange my bedroom like I had it last year and then rearrange my living completely different than it looked whenever I first moved into this house…. I have already folded 2 loads of laundry and the 3rd load of laundry is in the dryer then the 4th load of laundry is in the washer…. I am going to get the laundry knocked out today if it is the ONLY thing that I get done today and I am going to finish my bedroom…. My bedroom is going to look really good after I rearrange it to the way that I want it to be…. My daughter is home sick from school and I have already took her to the doctor and she has a severe upper respiratory infection her doctor told me to keep her home from school the rest of this week…. <- So now I have my daughter home for the rest of the week that means that I am going to try to get this house clean while she sleeps through out the day…. <- Praying that my baby girl gets better soon because I can’t stand to see one of my kids sick because it hurts me to know that my babies are sick…. 
I got my living room rearranged back to the way that it almost looked when I first moved into this house…. I am getting a lot accomplished today and I am very proud of myself…. Now it’s time for me to finish cleaning my bedroom…. <-  I am seriously thinking about rearranging my bedroom but I would have to wait till tomorrow…. I have been busy trying to get the laundry done and I am finally getting the laundry caught up so I won’t have to do any more laundry this week and I will be able to focus on getting the rest of this house cleaned and organized like it is supposed to be…. I am beyond exhausted from just washing, dying, and folding the laundry and I have more to do tomorrow…. <- Yay me…. <- Not really….

As some of y’all may know but Jeremy and I are seeing each other again…. <- I am actually happy that Jeremy and I are seeing each other again…. I now have a job at Taco Bell and I got hired yesterday…. <- All I am waiting for is the manager to call me with my schedule…. I am still working towards finishing my GED…. Now that I have a job I will be able to start doing things that I want to do other than staying at home on nice days…. June 4th I have a birthday party to go to in Madison my kids are excited to be going to their cousin’s birthday party…. I am looking forward to being able to get back into the work field…. My kids will be going to the scout’s again this year and they are excited…. Hopefully tomorrow I will get to see Jeremy…. Honestly I miss dating Jeremy and right now I think that we are testing the waters to see if we can be a couple again…. <- I sure hope that we can be a couple again because I miss him so much…. I am ready for us to be a couple again…. It has been a month since we have started talking and seeing each other again and that was back on April 18th and April 20th is when we seen each other again for the first time in about 7 months…. 
 
Honestly I don’t know if I should tell Jeremy that I still love him or would it be too soon or even worse would I scare him away…. If we do decide to go back into a relationship I know one thing and that is we take things slower this time, more communication, no more of this lack of communication, and be honest about everything no matter what…. I know that one is for sure is that I still love Jeremy and I have NEVER stopped loving him and I have NEVER stopped caring for Jeremy…. He stays on my mind 24/7 and he has NEVER left my mind even though we have been broken up for a while now…. Yes he broke my heart but I NEVER once had any hatred toward him…. <- He explained his reason why he ended our relationship and he asked me to forgive him and I did…. Right now Jeremy and I both are in unfortunate situations and we are working to get out of those situations…. 
PLEASE NO NEGATIVE COMMENTS!!!! THANK YOU!

So today I had a virtual appointment with my main doctor Chris Thompson…. <- He told me that I need to stay on the vitamin D for a while longer but he suggested to take the pill once every other week then come in for bloodwork after a month…. I went to get on my computer to do my schoolwork and I had noticed that one of my cats had vomited on the lid of my computer I quickly cleaned it up so I could get started on my schoolwork…. I am still waiting for my boss from Taco Bell to call me to let me know when I can start work…. <- Yawn I am starting to get agitated because my boss was supposed to call me yesterday but she never did…. I am beyond ready to go back to work…. 
I haven’t got to see my babe for a few days because of him working and being sick…. I am hoping that I will get to see my babe soon…. 
I really don’t have too much to say today…. I just want to see my babe because I am missing my babe so much….

I finally got a phone call from my boss Brandi letting me know when I finally get to go start work and that is Thursday morning at 10 AM for training and watching videos…. Today was the last day of school for the kids here in Raleigh County and I didn’t even bother sending my kids to school this morning because it was a 3 hour early dismissal…. Even though that I am starting work I will have a babysitter until my kids goes to the scout’s jamboree again this year…. 
I am glad that I get to message my babe every day because his message is the first thing that I look for whenever I wake up of the mornings and he is the last person that I think about before I go to sleep at night…. I honestly think that I am falling in love with Jeremy again or my love for Jeremy is growing stronger for him since we dated last year…. I can’t wait for my babe to meet my kids because I think that my kids are going to adore him and my middle child Jonathan will have a Nerf war with Jeremy…. <- That would be hilarious and fun at the same time…. <- Of course I would be videoing and taking pictures of my babe and my kids interacting with each other…. 
I managed to get a couple hours of schoolwork done today even after running to the pharmacy, the doctor’s office to get samples of my migraine medication, and going to my stepmom’s house so she help me put a string back in my board shorts that I wear when I am at the lake or pool…. I am making some progress on trying to finish my GED if it is only one step at a time…. Bring on the summer because I am actually ready to enjoy the summer for once when I am not working…. 
I am hoping to get see my babe some time this weekend because I am missing my babe so much and we have so much to talk about…. Hopefully we can take some much needed updated pictures because all of the pictures that I have are from last year and most of the pictures that I have is when we were in our RGIS uniforms…. <- Maybe we can even plan a fishing trip or a small adventure as long as we both ain’t working…. I definitely want to go on some adventures and fishing trips with my babe…. I am going to go back through my Free Prints app and reorder the pictures that I had taken of me and Jeremy last year so I can have them in a photo album and maybe even make a memory book for him including some new pictures…. 
My babe brings me so much joy and happiness and I just want to tell him already just to see how he reacts or is it too soon…. 😘😘😘😘 He has sent me some selfies of himself and I absolutely love them…. I am glad that I am able to be myself around Jeremy because honestly I have always been able to be myself around him…. Jeremy makes me feel so special, he is so sweet, and he is always checking on me throughout the day unless he has gone to bed so he can get up to go to work then I send him a sweet message saying, “goodnight babe sweet dreams. hope you have a great day at work tomorrow morning”…. We have so much more communication now and we haven’t even started dating again…. We both are broken in the love department because of some unfortunate situations but we keep telling each other that we don’t know what the future holds or we can’t wait to see what the future holds for us….  <- Here is the most recent selfie of my babe Jeremy 🥰🥰🥰🥰

 I am so excited that I will get to see my babe tomorrow…. We have been communicating a lot more…. Back on Monday we started discussing of having a baby/babies…. OMG I have amazing news my babe finally expressed his feelings to me and he even told me that he loves me….

Yesterday was a perfect day for me and my babe…. Even though it was a little adventure to Fayetteville and to the mall and his best friend was with us…. <- It didn’t bother me because I enjoy hanging out with his best friend too because his best friend is a cool person…. I had a couple good conversations with my babe’s best friend and the second conversation I broke down explaining to my babe’s best friend how much that I care for and love my babe Jeremy…. My babe’s best friend is a great advice giver…. After we dropped his best friend at home we talked on the way back to where my car was parked at…. We talked about our future and what the future holds for us…. Honestly I am actually looking forward to seeing what the future holds for me and my babe…. Today my babe came to my house to give me cuddles and watch movies with me all because I have my monthly visitor…. My babe is the best and the sweetest man on this earth…. I really truly love my babe….

I got to see my babe on Tuesday and Wednesday…. I am hoping that I get to see my babe today because I miss him so much…. We text each other throughout the day…. My cousin Krystle is trying to get me to go to work where she and my babe works at and I don’t want too because I am looking for something completely different job wise…. I have been trying to catch up on my housework and laundry…. Me and my babe have been talking about getting married sometime in the near future…. Maybe today we can discuss marriage and go over everything before we decide to finally set a date…. He keeps saying that he wants me to be his wife and he keeps calling me his wife to be and his future baby momma….

I got to see my babe yesterday and we spent time talking about getting married…. We are ready to take that next step in our relationship but honestly we still need to take our time of getting reacquainted with each other before we get married…. Don’t get me wrong I want to marry my babe but right now I just want us to take things slower than last year…. I applied for a job at FedEx because my babe convinced me that it is a better job than RGIS…. <- I am just waiting to hear from the boss which should either be tomorrow or Monday…. I never dreamed that I would be possibly working with my babe again…. Right now I am desperate for a job and I am willing to put my body through h*** just so I can make sure that my bills gets paid…. I got my first credit card from Capital One through Walmart…. I have some more housework to get caught up on and I am going to be rearranging my living room and my bedroom because it is beyond time for a new look…. I am thinking about rearranging my kitchen but I don’t much options because I have my dishwasher sitting beside of my washer because the both of them share the same drain pipe…. I have a few new pictures of me and my babe but I promised my babe that I wouldn’t post them anywhere because right now his mom and dad doesn’t know that we are back together…. <- I am going to respect his wishes…. I have to order some more pictures of me and my babe but I can’t do that until I get my free prints back to 85 free pictures and that won’t be until the 1st of July…. I am going to give my house a good cleaning and disinfect every room in my house as I am rearranging it….

I have been at FedEx for almost 2 months now and I am loving my job…. I now work 5 days a week and I love the fact that I get paid every week because that really helps out with the bills that comes in throughout the month…. Back on July 4th me and my cousin Krystle got into it because I refused to take her back and forth to work…. I plainly told her that her husband can take her back and forth to work because she lives on the other side of Harper Road and I live only 12 minutes from work and that I am NOT about to be getting up any earlier than what I already do just to drive to her house to get her for work then drive her all the way back…. <- That would’ve been completely crazy…. I’m glad that I get to work with my babe it makes sort goes by much faster….

Today is the first day of school for my kids…. They have enjoyed their summer vacation but I know that they are not ready to go back to school…. My baby Amber is starting her first year of middle school, my middle child is in his second year of middle school, and my first born is going to be in his last year of high school and he will be only 16 when he graduates next year…. Where has the time gone too???? My kids have grown up so fast…. I can’t believe that my newest nephew from my brother Joey and his wife Lexi is already a week old as of yesterday….

Me and my babe have been talking about getting a place together and starting a little family even though I already have 3 kids….

I know that it has been awhile since I have posted on here but I have been dealing with a lot at work…. I have been dealing with a smart-ass OPS manager being stupid when it comes to my seizures saying, “people who have seizures are fake and seizures are a sickness”…. <- I tried to correct the OPS manager that seizures is NOT a sickness that seizures is a disability according to ADA…. I had been fighting off a seizure since Thursday at work and finally my body just couldn’t fight off the seizure anymore and I had a very bad seizure back on Sunday. The seizure was so bad that my sister Talena called an ambulance for me to get checked out…. The EMS lady told me that they couldn’t take me to the hospital to get evaluated because both hospitals where I live in Beckley were on Red Alert and they have been for 3-4 months now and there was no hospital beds for me to get checked out by an ER doctor…. Having a seizure is NOT the way that I wanted to start off the New Year…. My boyfriend Jeremy has been checking on me everyday and I got to see him earlier today and I was very glad that I got to see my babe…. We have been making some wonderful memories together and been taking pictures of us every chance that I get…. He is planning a romantic weekend getaway for us after my birthday and I am happy with that…. I am too excited to know what my boyfriend has in store for our romantic weekend getaway…. We just celebrated our first Christmas together and I loved it…. We are talking more and more about getting married and having babies together…. His family loves me and I love his family…. I have already introduced him to some of my family members and they adore him and I can’t wait for the day that he gets to meet my kids because I know that my kids are going to adore him as much as I adore him….  This is me and my babe Jeremy….

I went back to work this morning and today was not a good day for me…. Hopefully tomorrow will be a better day for me because during sort I was started showing symptoms of another seizure but I managed to push through the symptoms after “getting” fresh air like one of my managers told me to do…. It seems like that the symptoms of the seizures are ONLY getting worse for me…. I have got new pics of me and my babe today….

I have officially started back to school so I can finally finish my GED and get my diploma…. Unfortunately I have to retake everything because the governor where I live passed a law if a person doesn’t have their GED completed by a certain time last year that in 2023 they will have to take everything all over again…. So now I am stuck taking everything all over again but it’s ok because I know that I can do it…. It is going to take me some time to get my GED because everything has changed and hopefully the passing scores hasn’t changed so I can hurry up and pass the hard tests and then focus on the math and then I will finally have my diploma…. I’m hating having all of this science and math homework and today is only my first day back in school….

A girl that I worked with at FedEx posted an inappropriate picture of herself on Facebook and I told Jeremy about it saying that I wanted to protect my kids from things like that on Facebook…. I don’t agree with this woman doing that because she has young kids herself…. Now this all makes sense to me about this woman because she mysteriously found me one Facebook out of the blue and tagged in me one of her weird Snapchat stories…. <- She is really weird and I don’t like that about her…. I am so glad that I don’t associate with her anymore but I feel that I need to confront her about a lot of stuff like for one trying to interfere with my relationship starting back in December, she was always wanting to know what me and Jeremy was doing when we made plans, she was always wanting pictures of me and Jeremy, and she really pissed me off by getting into the vehicle with Jeremy while I was standing outside talking with another female coworker…. <- She just laughed in my face like she had done NOTHING wrong and then played it off at work the next day….

Me and Jeremy just came back from a 2 day romantic getaway in Ohio and we didn’t get back home till almost 11 Tuesday night…. We had such an amazing time together in Ohio together and explored a few different places and a restaurant called Raising Cane’s…. I took a lot of pictures and on the way back Tuesday we stumbled upon another arcade called Launch in Jeffersonville, Ohio…. Honestly I can’t wait for me and Jeremy to go away on another romantic getaway because it is just us time and no one bothers us and we really have time to focus on each other…. I have been trying to focus on my GED and Jeremy has been trying to focus on his job at Lowe’s…. <- I know that we both have different schedules and that we don’t live together right now but we always manage to make time for each other no matter what…. Come September me and Jeremy will be together a year and I’m excited to be celebrating our one year anniversary and I hope that he has something special planned for us like another romantic getaway maybe to Gatlinburg, Tennessee for 3 days and 2 nights in a cabin with a hot tub…. <- I have been working on a picture/scrapbook for mine and Jeremy’s one year anniversary so every chance that I get I want us take pictures together so I can have them for the book and plus I want them on my phone so we will have something to look back over the years to come…. 
I was working at Lowe’s myself then the head cashier Ross told me that even though I have seizures that I would still have to drive myself to work, even when I was having signs of a seizure I would have to go into work, that he didn’t have to follow the ADA rules, and that even though I had already put in for 2 days off so I could go to Huntington to see the specialist for my seizures he was going to schedule me to work and if I was not to show up to work that he was going to fire me that there was nothing that I could do…. <- So I showed him I turned around and told him that I quit because my health was more important than any job like Lowe’s…. Then he called me a worthless person in front of a customer while I was standing there trying to talk to him about finishing out my two weeks then I turned around and got my revenge on him by calling him a jerk and telling him that he is a worthless head cashier and that I have never been called a worthless person by a manager and that karma will get him right front of that same customer…. <- He got what he deserved that day because of what he said to me in front of that customer and I will NEVER work at Lowe’s again, I would rather work at FedEx again and that is saying a lot because that girl works there who shows off in just her bra on Facebook…. 
I have been back in school trying to finish my GED lately and I am so close to finishing I am ONLY one test away and that’s the math…. <- Something that I have been stuck on for awhile…. I am hoping that I will be able to pass the math and graduate from the GED class this year so I can go to college and finally make something of myself…. It costs me about $20 a day to drive from my house in Beckley to Fayette County to go to class so I can try to complete my GED and the DHHR for WV offers a gas voucher but I am having problems trying to get ahold of someone so I can get that gas voucher so I won’t have to worry about putting gas in my vehicle out of my pocket….

My poor babe Jeremy is having such a rough time at work because no one wants to listen to his instructions that he leaves for the red vests for when he has a day off…. He was telling me earlier today that he has about had enough of that job because when he has a day off for him to rest and when he goes back to work everything is a disaster because no one has done anything that was left on the instructions that he left…. He is the team leader for the MST Green Team outdoor lawn and garden at Lowe’s…. I understand his frustration and I know that his job is draining him mentally and physically…. That job is consuming most of his time because he is having to stay past the time that he is supposed to get off so he can try to get his work done because he can’t get his work done during his shift because he has to do the job of 4 other red vests…. <- The red vests that are outside in the lawn and garden with my babe don’t do their jobs properly and I have seen 2 red vests ONLY do the watering of the plants and they make sure that it is the ONLY thing they do for their whole shift when clearly there is OTHER things that needs to be done in the outdoor lawn and garden…. I went up there last Saturday to help my babe because he didn’t have any help and I make what plants needed to be covered with the frost cloths and what plants needed to be brought into the store for the night…. <- It is sad that I had to go help because those red vests are l-a-z-y and they don’t want to do anything but play on their phones and socialize and ONLY water the plants…. <- Even I have had enough of them treating my man bad and them NOT their assigned jobs that I really want to go up to Lowe’s and tell those lazy red vests to do their jobs so my man can do his job and get out of there on time and on his days off he shouldn’t have to be worrying what the outdoor lawn and garden is going to look like when he comes back to work…. Jeremy goes in super early everyday that he works and stays super late just to try to make the outdoor lawn and garden look nice and whenever he is not there its a disaster…. Jeremy is putting his mental and physical health on the line everyday that he works because he also has epilepsy like I do and when he has signs of a seizure or he has a seizure that is when Lowe’s themselves threatens his job…. Lowe’s is a dirty company to work for especially if you have seizures/epilepsy….

Me and my babe Jeremy had lunch today and it was another perfect day for us…. It’s the littlest things that matters to me that he does for our relationship…. <- He is the most perfect boyfriend ever and I would take the little things over the big things any day…. We have been talking more and more about having a baby and more and more about getting married and living together…. <- Honestly I can’t wait for the day that me and Jeremy get to live together, we get married, and we have a baby…. But for right now everything in our relationship is perfect the way it is for now…. Don’t get me wrong I want to be married to Jeremy and have a baby with him but for right now we both have a lot going on that would interfere with us having trying to have a baby and I’m not quite ready to get married again…. <- I know that he will make a perfect husband and dad one day but right now I know that he wants to finish his pharmacist test and then become a pharmacist before we get married and have a baby…. He has also said that he wants to get me pregnant by the end of this year and honestly I just want to stay on my bc shot until the time is right for me to come of the bc shot…. I still have to finish my GED and try to get into college so I can get a degree and I haven’t decided what I want to do yet…. I have all of these mixed feelings of getting pregnant by the end of this year because honestly I’m just not ready for another baby yet…. I love Jeremy with all of my heart but what is he thinking wanting to get me pregnant by the end of this year…. NO NEGATIVE COMMENTS PLEASE!!!! I’m just dealing with a lot here lately….

Yesterday me and Jeremy had a lunch date at Chili’s and it was a nice little lunch date…. I even took a couple of pictures of us together and I snapped some pictures of him without him knowing…. <- Lol…. I feel really bad for Jeremy because of everything that he has been going through lately at his parents house and at work…. <- It got really bad the day before yesterday especially when his mom started on him saying that she was going to put shock collars on 2 of his 3 dogs because all they do is bark and whine…. Honestly I am really upset with his mom because she ended up putting the shock collars on 2 of his dogs and ended up putting his 3 dogs outside because she needs to be able to “sleep” when clearly it’s her dogs is the ones who always whines and barks all the time…. It is just getting worse for him at his parents house and he has been sending me some of the conversations between him and his mom and I am sitting here in disbelief because I didn’t think that she could be like that to her son especially over his dogs Spartan, Ryder, and Sakari…. <-She even told him “don’t threaten me” and all he said is that he would leave…. <- Now how is that threatening her???? <- That is NOT threatening that is telling her that he is fed up and that he is NOT going to put up with her bs anymore especially over his dogs…. He is getting treated like a dog at his work too and he is fed up with that place too and I can’t blame him…. I am working on going back to FedEx because it is a steady job for me and I know that I am promised hours there…. I really worry about Jeremy and him being there at his parents house and him having to deal with everything at his work…. I am hoping that he can get some money saved up soon so he can get moved into his own place because there has been some unforeseen circumstances that has stopped him over the past few years from him getting his own place…. Honestly I think that his parents doesn’t want him to move out because then they won’t have anyone to take their dogs when Jeremy moves out…. He will have more freedom when he gets his own place and I will be able to open even more time with him and I will be able to spend the night with him whenever I want too…. Jeremy just informed me that he threw his vest at his boss and told him that he is done because no one wanted to listen to Jeremy about pulling the partial sun and partial shade plants back inside and when the manager from the Fayetteville store told them to pull the partial sun and partial shade plants in the red vests listened to that store manager and did as they were told…. <- Why couldn’t they listen to Jeremy because he is their green team leader and they are supposed to listen to him…. Then Lowe’s wonders why they are losing so much product when it comes to the outdoor lawn and garden its because the red vests puts plants in the sun that doesn’t belong and when its cold they don’t bring in plants that is supposed to be brought in…. My babe is going through so much and I wish that I could help him but he won’t let me because he said that I don’t need to worry and that I just need to have faith….

Back on Saturday my babe Jeremy messaged telling me that he had quit his job because he finally had enough of no one listening and him being the ONLY one that ever did anything for the outdoor lawn and garden…. I have been struggling a lot here lately with paying my bills so my mom is finally stepping in to help me by putting the power in her name and then she is going to continue to keep the power bill in her name because apparently the power company wanted to rip me off in the worst possible way and I couldn’t even get any assistance from the local DHHR, Salvation Army, or any other charities around the area that I live in…. My life is so out of control anymore because apparently I can’t even keep up with my own bills even though I do my best to pay all of my bills by myself….

My mom has been a big help to me especially here lately…. Thanks to my mom I have power back on in my house and now I no longer have to worry about whether the power company is going to cut my power off again…. I’m worried about my babe Jeremy because I think that he is going into a depression from not working right now…. <- I wish that I could help him but I don’t know how right now…. I have to figure out to get caught up on the rest of my bills like the water, sewer, and the cable bills…. Tomorrow I have several things to get done housework wise including getting the laundry caught up…. Maybe I can figure out how to help my babe Jeremy and I have to call FedEx to find out when there is going to be a class so I can go back to work…. I am trying to get my life back on track and I am trying to go back to work even though I have epilepsy and I draw SSI for my seizures and other mental disabilities that I have…. <- I still try to work because I know that monthly check doesn’t cover all of my bills that I have coming in and my oldest son’s check doesn’t cover all of the bills coming in every month…. NO NEGATIVE COMMENTS PLEASE….

I have had enough of today…. Me and Jeremy got into a little scuff earlier today and currently I am pissed off at him…. He said to me “WTH did you post on TikTok” and I responded to him by saying “Huh” because I didn’t have a clue what he was talking about…. <- Then he turned around and snapped back and said “There’s something on TikTok that’s been brought to my attention and I can’t see it because your account is private” so I snap back and say to him “I was talking about the power company being dirty and how they were threatening me” and I also said to him “I like to know how what I supposedly put on TikTok that was bad”…. Then that’s we got into a little scuff because he was trying to say that I didn’t tell him that my mom was helping me by getting the power in her name and that she has a completely different account number…. Anyways I turned and snapped back and told him that I removed the video’s of me talking about the power company being dirty and threatening me down from TikTok…. <- So apparently that wasn’t good enough for him because he ended up typing out this long message telling me that he is quite bothered by this and I turn around and type out a really long message back to him then I hit ignore messages from him for the rest of the day…. I have every right to be pissed off at him because I even told him that my mom doesn’t wanting everyone knowing that she has to help her 35 year old daughter by getting the power in her name because my mom is very private person and he hasn’t even read my message yet…. All of this comes to blow 4 days before our 8 month anniversary all because someone and I don’t even know who is on my TikTok that he knows…. NO NEGATIVE COMMENTS PLEASE!!!!

Me and Jeremy have been talking a little bit throughout the day today but I haven’t fully forgiven him over the little scuff that we got into yesterday…. We haven’t talked about the little scuff that we got into yesterday because honestly I just don’t want to hear it again today…. Sunday is our 8 month anniversary and I am looking forward to spending the day with him doing something like a picnic at one of our local parks like Little Beaver or maybe even Grandview State Park either way us just enjoying being outdoors and taking pictures together…. I love him with all of my heart but sometimes we just need to take a step back and think about what’s being said go cool down then come back and talk like civilized adults…. I still had him on ignore until later this evening when I thought that he had learned his lesson about snapping at me yesterday…. <- I have told him several times NOT to snap at me,  yell at me or even raise his voice at me in any way including in a text because I will get pissed and snap back then ignore his messages…. <- That is exactly what I did for 24 hours after I snapped back at him and I am still waiting for him to apologize to me…. When I took the rent money down to my landlord’s niece this evening she straight up asked me if I was pregnant and I told her no…. <- Rude and inconsiderate of her to ask that question *rolls eyes*…. NO NEGATIVE COMMENTS PLEASE!!!!

Back on Tuesday me and my babe Jeremy had a movie date and we seen Fast 10 and I have a new picture of us…. For 2 days now we have been to his Mawmaw’s house and I really enjoy going to see his mawmaw because not only do I keep her company but we can talk about anything and everything…. Yesterday we helped her by planting 2 trees in her yard for her and this morning when we got there Jeremy weedeated her yard for her and I helped her move flowers back where they went and put the cute little fences back around the flowers she wanted…. After me and Jeremy left her house we went to DQ to get ice cream…. Shocker Jeremy finally apologized to me and I apologized too and we made up…. Jeremy has been trying to cheer me up since Tuesday evening when my kitten who I had been taking care of since he was born almost 3 weeks ago suddenly passed away and I was the one who found him and of course I text Jeremy crying because I was and still lost without my little Maxamillion (Max) because I babied him, bottle fed him, pottied him myself using a wet cloth, and wrapped him in one of my blankets until he went to sleep in my arms, and I would get him every time he would cry because he was my fur baby and he will always be my fur baby…. Jeremy is so amazing even though we did have a little scuff the other day and I completely ignored him for 24 hours…. <- Maybe he learned his lesson who knows…. NO NEGATIVE COMMENTS PLEASE!!!!
