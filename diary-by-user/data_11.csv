So, it’s been a little over a year since my marriage ended. To this day I have been at a total loss of why it did. I have had all the conversations that say, ” it doesn’t matter why, it just happened.” Yes, it just happens, but why to me? I have been a it just happens person from the time I was a teenager. I am tired of it just happens. It just happens has made me bald, alone, sad, and almost suicidal.
Maybe I am being somewhat narcissistic, but I just don’t see it just happens to my friends or others all the time. In fact, I have one friend who it seems, shits out lucky breaks more than actual shit. Am I bitter? Yes!!
I grew up in church, the youngest of my family. I had the advantage of my parents being middle class and comfortable after 10 years of struggles put behind them whereas the siblings had made the tough journey with them. I never wanted for stuff, but I never begged for it either. I helped them both around the house and also the neighbors and relatives. I made moral choices, where other kids didn’t. I didn’t throw caution to the wind. This eventually led to my 1st “failed” marriage. I got her pregnant and I did the right thing by marrying her. I was actually happy. I loved her and my daughter. I did all I could for them. I left friends and family behind. I gave up habits and hobbies she hated. I lived with the berating insults and quietly accepted the demands. I excused the infidelities and gracefully walked away when she asked…. It didn’t matter why, it just happened..
I went on to other life gutting relationships allowing more destruction of the person I thought I was.. It didn’t matter why, it just happened. Then I met her. She came with no strings, wanting to live life and apparently with me. We never had harsh words or even dreaded each other’s company. We took the insults and comments people threw at us with stride, nothing would keep us apart. We moved on and away, bought a home, made a family, all the while never allowing strife in. Together we moved in with my mother, who was losing her mind to dementia and cared for her through the battle, never fighting each other. I always show her my appreciation for being there, although I had siblings that should have. My wife was there when I lost my daughter from my first marriage, lost my Father, and lost my Mother.
Then…. In the matter of hours last January, she went from loving wife to stranger. I left for work hugging and kissing a woman I knew for 20 years, my support, my rock and came home 8 hours later to a stranger. For a week I cried, begged, and pleaded to save us without ever being told what went wrong. I left to giver her the “space” she needed and she immediately move a man in and proceeded to erase me from her life. My (our) pictures together, memories of my childhood my Mother gave her, and any reference of me in the home. I was literally replaced like Darrens on Bewitched and no one seemed to care. Not friends. Not family. No one.  IT DIDN’T MATTER WHY, IT JUST HAPPENED.

It’s been over 1 year, 365+ days since we separated. She has probably never missed a night’s sleep, whereas I sit up every one of the nights until my body physically gives out. Booze, pills, guided meditation, nothing works to quiet my head and soothe my soul so I can sleep. What sleep I get is fitful and uncomfortable. Every night is thoughts in darkness and every morning it feels as though I was beaten in my sleep.
YouTube has lost it’s usefulness as a distraction. Netflix doesn’t make enough shows to hold what little interest I can muster. Type 2 diabetes has made me blind enough that reading has lost it fun and replaced it with mind numbing headaches.

How does he love you any different than I did to make you love him more than you did me. We had 20 years of history. Four lovely children and family. I was there to reunite you with your Grandmother and to hold you when she passed. I walked your sister down the aisle because you had no Father. I drove your Mom to appointments and never said a bad word although I was constantly mocked. I gave you a house, treated you as an equal, never asked of you for anything.  My family folded you into their arms, hearts, and soul from day one. I only ever wanted more for you and the kids.
Yet, you pushed me out and brought him in. You have never said why. You have never acknowledged my pain of essentially losing everything. I wasn’t abusive or addicted.  I accepted what you did and didn’t do. You gave a man who raised a family and lived his life mine and haven’t so much as said sorry.
One day is all it took. I hear people as they say things about how “she had been planning this,” yet you showed no signs of unhappiness or discontent. Meer hours before you “pushed” you were hugging and kissing me only to switch off that afternoon.
Then you moved him into my place when I finally believed you needed time to think. This man who is 20 years older, not all that attractive, comes with legal issues, and supposedly “born again” just steps into my/our life and again I ask, how does he love you more than I have?

I am really starting to understand the “stand up comic” way of life. Now i’m sure not all of them, but you hear all the stories about how some of the funniest one’s were also the most depressed.  Now it hard and weird to say that i’m a funny person, but I think I can hold my own in a room of strangers and friends. I have always been the “dancing monkey” in my circle of friends and family, which s probably half the reason this new emotional wrecked person I am has been somewhat ignored.
As much as everyone I want me time, but unlike at a lot, I just can’t handle it. Especially now. My mind drifts to the stuff I want to do, then to the reasons not to, then to how I enjoyed time with the wife and kids, followed with the things we never got to or did, and then the darkness…. I carry a guilt in me about how I won’t make these happen anymore for my family, my complete family..
Am I one of the only ones that still thinks the vows for marriage should be followed and not like a vehicle? When it runs rough or doesn’t look as nice, just dump it for a new one…

Ok. I’m going to use an example that may hit a nerve, but it’s how I have felt for the last year.
Say you get cancer, something that could possibly be cured but still it’s fucking cancer.
Now, as you sit there with you diagnoses and everyone knows, but first the Doctors say “sorry nothing we can do” and your tight knit group of family and friends just through up their hands and say ” well that’s that” and they move on with their lives without a word of concern or encouragement.
Wouldn’t you be pissed? Depressed? Alone?
That’s what this separation has been for me. From day one no one has came around or stood up for me or stood by me. Everything I cared for, loved, collected, and owned along with dreams, Hope’s, and plans were gone in a 5 minute conversation.

I feel so small.
I have lost almost everything over the last year. My wife, my family, friends and possessions.  I have been on the edge of suicidal thoughts. I sat in ERs with panic and anxiety attacks. I have broke down in front of my kids and strangers.  Seen more counselors and doctors than I count. All the while just withdrawing into a shell of depression and hopelessness.
An ex of mine daughter has fought stage 4 cancer at the ripe old age of 23. Children go missing only to be found dead. I listen to podcasts about refugees who walk through hell. I sit quietly in a divorce support group listening to women who have been abused physically.
I have health. I am not bruised. I have freedom.
I feel so small

Ryan or Rian, that was her name. Just a causal neighbor intro while getting mail. First person in this apartment complex I have actually met. Most others shuffle by, heads down. I did the quick 5 second look over, no ring, not under-aged (i think). I even allowed myself to say something dumb like ” well maybe we can be coffee buddies when the weather improves.” and allowed her answer to be heard in my brain as serious, when I know it was just what is said to “humor” a kind of chubby, dorky guy.
But…….. Was it?
I was with my wife so long and have been hurt so bad, that I don’t even remember how we got together. I haven’t had to make a move or start a conversation with intentions of a date in years.
First thought.. I would write a very innocent letter. Not to rambling, not to creepy (i hope), asking her if she would like to go out for dinner sometime. But how is not weird and creepy.  No matter where i leave it, in her mailbox or her door, it will come off as odd.
Second.. Go old school, send her flowers. I never was a flower guy, but I know not to hit her with a dozen roses right off the bat, but how would that be received? This short, guy I just exchanged pleasantries with sent me a flower arrangement.. I know to keep the note short and sweet, asking if she would like to go out. Maybe too direct and by chance there is a boyfriend, dangerous to my well being.Maybe, ” It was nice to meet you, thanks for making me feel welcome”.  Hmm, that kind of sounds nice, not expecting something in return, while leaving the door open and also innocent enough just in case.
Third.. Be a total spaz and constantly try to happen to bump into again..
I do like 2, but somehow I see me doing 3 and totally fucking chances up. I know I am not ready to date and there is a great chance that this will blow up in my face or in the least be something that may not fulfill her, but I just can’t keep going on day after day being alone. I can not turn to friends and family, they have proven over the last year, that they just don’t care…

7,https://www.opendiary.com/m/newt316/self-hate-5-5579023/,2020-02-16,Self hate,"
Well I once again jumped the gun yesterday (refer to my earlier post) that’s more than likely going no where and cost money I should have just lit on fire.
There has been one truth I hold to after 40+ years. I hate myself. Yes, I truly hate myself. I am my biggest bully, critic, and hater. I have constantly caused my own unhappiness and despair. I have unknowingly ruined relationships with family and friends. I have given in to unhealthy habits that have stolen my looks and what so called confidence I may have had. It’s no wonder I am alone…
Instead of grieving the loss of my marriage, I should be happy I was given all the years. I should be happy that Patty found happiness after the 20 years of dealing with me.  Deep down I regret that my kids have me as a father.
I don’t know what evil curiosity keeps me from suicide, but I am having a real hard time coming up with reasons to stay around.  I don’t get swayed by the argument that my kids need me. I loved both my parents but, their presence never influenced my choices. By the way this separation has been I seriously doubt mine does to my kids either.
Every little ” selfish ” thing I do for myself comes with a big price.  The little satisfaction is so not worth it.
My counselor calls my way of thinking catastrophic, that may be so, but 99% of my life has some how gone to shit without me lifting a single finger. Maybe tonight I can stop the curiosity..

8,https://www.opendiary.com/m/newt316/rambles-252-5580055/,2020-02-18,Rambles,"
I haven’t counted the days (386 if I did) since it all went to hell. I want out of the dark lonely friendless hole I am in. I realize the work I need to put in to get out of it. I am angry at the world and God because of the position I am in. Never thought the close people I held so dear all these years would leave me and the distant ones would try to be there.
As anyone can guess I am lonely. Some people live for what I have, but I never wanted this. I know I am not a great father, but I tried. I gave my all trying to make her fell special and the kids were an extension of her, my love of her. Long after the boys had gone with families of their own, she was going to still be there. Now she isn’t. She is someone else’s future plan and I am left wondering, even more so, that I will be alone until I die.
I figure because of my distance to them, my kids will put me in a home at the first sign of difficulty. I will relive the pain of being alone in a crowd again and die with the regrets of not “ending” it back when at least there would have been some impact to the deed.
I hear all the time about “what the future holds” and “it gets better” but, I am a realist and I have lived in this body 48 years. I have watched it fall apart and tried to repair it so many times and there is only so much left. The hard parts that don’t break easy, but they’re the ugly parts no one wants. People are shallow. The whole lie about personality gets relationships is BS. If a troll came to you with beautiful gifts and flowery words you would see a troll. Who wants to be with a troll?

I’m not actively searching for a new relationship. What my wife has put me through has all but killed my faith in them. I still don’t understand how someone can do what she did and not have a tinge of guilt or remorse, but life is a game, play or lose, cheat or lose, participate or be run over. I guess there are just those types that can stomp a kitten and watch it suffer.
This wasn’t meant to be a FU to my ex, don’t worry though those will be coming, but it is about some women’s BS since I have somewhat re-entered the dating world. What is wrong with some women nowadays? It used to be a compliment or a nice flower arrangement was a welcomed thing. Now it apparently means that “you will be raped and murdered at the first opportunity”
A few months back I introduced myself to a lady who manages the Dollar General across from my work. All good. After several visits I asked her to coffee and offered my number, which with a smile and s thank you was accepted. Then….  Well I don’t know. I am avoided and ignored as if I somehow I came up from behind her and pulled a Biden.
Another one was actually a woman I had history with. We always had a flirty type of relationship, but never matched up in life until now. Got together a couple times, had drinks, had dinner, and watched movies. I got the ” i’m not looking for a relationship” talk, I countered with the, ” I could just use a friend.”  All good, that is until 2 days later when we had planned to get together for dinner and she fell off the radar. Turns out she did want a relationship, but not with me. (Yes I was again reliving my separation within my separation)
If you have been torturing yourselves reading my entries you know that I sent someone a nice little non threatening flower arrangement earlier this week. I made sure that in no way it asked, expected, or insisted anything and that is exactly what I got…. Nothing. I can’t be mad, but would a thank you post it be to much?
I know I have a long way to go to fix me and I know that it is the worst thing in the world to get into a relationship now, but come on world, why do you keep insisting on making me feel as though I am a troll???

I spent the first 15+ years being a weekend Dad to my daughter and failed miserably. I never wanted to go through this again. Yet here I am again. This time 4 boys and failing miserably.
All I ever wanted was my family around me. I lost interest in friend get togethers and bar leagues. I lived for puttering around the house fixing things and suprising my wife. I guess she better at the suprises though.
The worst time of the week, Sunday afternoons. For the next several hours I will be thrust into that day last year when it all went sideways.  I will spend hours calling and texting people who will not reply or answer and I will slowly build up and want to text her. Nothing will change, she wont reply and I’ll cry myself to sleep.

I am sitting here in my car waiting on my coworker to show and open the gate and I am crying like a fool. Crying about a life lost and a uncertain future. Every day for the last year I’ve cried. It’s a wonder I’m not dried up like a prune.
For years I told myself this wouldn’t happen again and here I am yet again knowing I did everything right this time all the while my looks feel apart and my health went to shit. Now banished to the land of misfit toys.

So yes, I am considering getting a hair piece.. Not one of those dead rats on your head, but one of the very well made, styled human hair ones. Been looking into them alot and well it couldn’t hurt. We live in a time where girls are boys and cats are dogs. Nothing seems true anymore so screw it, fake hair.. Plus with the fake hair I can always fall back on the round head that ol’ Mom Newton made. Also I have seen the aftermath of surgical hair replacement and I rather not have thousands of pox marked scars on the back of my head if it fails…

My birthday was yesterday. Sorry I didn’t make an entry. I turned 49, by myself.  I got the usual greetings from my boys, it was nice, but not like it used to be.
I got mad at her.
I guilted an acknowledgement from her. I shouldn’t have. For some reason in my head I believe she still holds something for me.
I’m stupid that way.
I think my empathy is what will eventually lead to me being a lonely man for the rest of my life.

14,https://www.opendiary.com/m/newt316/the-papers-3-5584741/,2020-02-29,The papers,"
Well she went and really did it. I got the divorce papers. I knew it was coming to this, but it didn’t stop the overwhelming hurt and like how it’s been since day 1, I am alone and no one wants to talk or visit. I mean I told my two “best friends ” ( btw they haven’t been there for me at all) and well they went out on a couples date. Would have been nice if empathy won out and maybe come and cheer me up, but….
So, back to the divorce papers. I’m not sure just how to take it. She isn’t raking me over the coals what so ever. It’s even wrote in a way that won’t bite me in the ass later. My thoughts immediately go to the fact that she wants out so bad that she gave up typical things you would expect in a divorce degree.
I’m left still confused about why the marriage ended, what I did or didn’t do, why does she prefer this guy who is no prize and also 20+years older and never ever allowed me a chance to fix things or talk.
"
15,https://www.opendiary.com/m/newt316/fatherhood-5-5585709/,2020-03-04,Fatherhood,"
Most people will not agree with my views on being a father. My own sister will fight tooth and nail about her idea of how my own father was. She’s right, as far as how he treated her. Oh, she uses a heavy amount of “sugar coating” to her memories and comparisons. I to had a daughter once and I am sure she would be the same towards me. I could really use the kind of unconditional love a father gets from a daughter right now. 
Sorry, I went off track somewhat. What I was saying is my father loved me and my brothers but, he was tough on us. He had little patience with us. He did when it was needed though. He wasn’t a homework helping Dad, although the man was smart. He wasn’t a sporty coach Dad, but he played the big 2 (football, baseball) when he was younger. He didn’t sit in the stands, but his presence was felt. My father lived a pretty full life before having kids and never shared all of it with us. 
I have “fun” memories as a kid, but I didn’t really feel close to him until I was older and out of my teen years and I will say that my brothers felt the same. When my father could finally let lose and be a man with his men. I think a lot of it was because my Dad was raised with 3 much older sisters and took the brunt of the boy vs girl upbringing. OH STOP WITH YOUR PC TRANSGENDER MILLENNIAL STUFF. There is a difference.
This brings me to now. A wife who left me for another unimpressive older man, who lost her father at 10yrs old and never had a male in her life and a sister who only view’s hers with rainbow colored glasses, both telling me how to be a father. Never happy with what I do or don’t do. Constantly guilting me for failing the boys, even though I literally watched as my world crumbled in for no other reasons then my wife’s selfish unknown needs..
Here is the way I see it and going forward, the only way…. I was present at all my children’s births. I was the first to hold each one. I cut their cords. They were and are my blood. I will die for them, defend them, and always come running if needed.  That said, they are still young and need their mom and what a woman (for the most part) does for her children… My distance (physical) from them hurts, but like I was with my Dad, they don’t want to learn sports (I learned through my friends) they could careless about bikes (i self taught to be with friends in a time when there was no cell phones, computers, or weekday cartoons. Not even Atari)
We talk when we get together. I assure them that they did nothing wrong, which is more than the “guilters” do, they have never even mentioned what and why things happened. So I am the wrong one who was blindsided and heartbroken and left so my wife could “have time to think”. But she insists on telling me how to be a father, when she thrusted a new man into the boy’s lives hours after I left without so much as any explanations, yet my “breakdown” and absence is detrimental to my boys.
I have always wanted a family. When boys were spitting and throwing dirt at girls, I wanted to have a wife and play house. When I was a teen and guys were thinking of joining the service or going on adventures and partying, I wanted a wife and family. I have been given 2 chances at it and lost both without even understanding why. I know I did my fair share of coexisting.  I never ask for what I would not give. I know God and have lived a moral life, yet I am left, cheated on, and once again rebuilding me. And yes, everyone tells me how and they all critique and call out failings constantly, but no one helps.

I am fully aware that I live in a head that is broken. It has been beaten down over the years by ex’s and old employers and primarily me. I am the type of person who would let a sad lion out of a cage only to be attacked.
The divorce papers were signed and sent off today. My soon to be decided to text me and as I suspected all those months ago, is now poisoned by people. We had the typical marriage money issues that most people have. You hear it constantly about how hard a family has it and we were one. Some weeks it came down to feeding the boys or gas in the car for work. Well that must have been her reason for grabing on to a near 60yr old man and ending things. As she so colorfully put it ” you suck and all the money problems I had to fix were your fault”
Last I knew it at the old household we owed taxes, which were paid by tax return (as we planned) and after I was “dumped” for Grandpa, I paid all the utilities and cable for 2 months after.
I can’t stop feeling bad about myself though. She cheated, lied, and blew shit up, but I have been made the bad guy in all of this by everyone because I paid bills late?

I follow the therapist’s suggestions. I do the guided meditations. I have immersed myself into PS4 games.
It’s been a year and then some, the papers are signed, the kids are alright, she obviously has no regrets, no one but me gives a shit, but……
I am so depressed.
I woke today with all the weight of the world on me. I fight back tears for something that even a magic wand won’t fix. What’s wrong with me? Why do I think any other 49yr old man who has just walked away from a divorce free and clear and only paying minimum amounts of money, no one to answer to, and all the time in the world, would just dance in the streets.
Not me. I justify been hurt, even if I can not understand what it was I did. Why does she have so much resentment? She never mentioned things for 18+ years. She hugged, kissed, and said she loved me the morning of the day she ended us.
I am trying to make sence of living “Twilight Zone” episode I find myself in, but I just can’t.

It has taken 35+ years, 2 failed marriages, countless lost jobs, several broken friendships, and a SHIT TON of self abuse, but I finally have learned why I am the mess I am.. It won’t bring back my daughter, win back my relations, or return my youth and at 49 it almost seems to be more hurt than help.
I have been diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder. It all fits. Years upon years of not understanding, being constantly bitter, sad, angry, worried.  Of course, with me people will now say I am making excuses. It doesn’t change the past or allow me to go back to my family. I informed my “friends” and “relatives” of what a year being ignored and avoided, along with the last 2 months of 3 days a week therapist and psych visits had determined. I received one heartfelt “that’s interesting” from my Sister.
So, where to now?? If what I am told is true, I have a lot of work to do for my well being and can only hope others will be understanding. Well, at least I know I will do the work.
It sucks. My thoughts all go to the “what if’s”. Was the BPD what made her fall out of love with me? Did she do this despite of the BPD? Now that she knows, is there a flicker of love and understanding that makes her feel a tinge of guilt and longing? Would I even have the understanding if her betrayal wasn’t the “final straw” that broke me totally?
Do I want to be a well adjusted lonely old man or a mental mess surrounded by people???

I don’t remember ever being this lonely in my life. I used to look forward to the occasional “me” time, now I would give almost anything to be annoyed by the occasional neighbor. Now with the whole BPD diagnosis, it just seems to have gotten worse. I suppose that is my fault. I put it out there to everyone thinking that finally here’s  what was wrong  with me all these years and people would maybe come around or call, but no. If anything I think they all see me as a big attention whore.  I feel like the person who gets cancer and all everyone says is, ” well he should have quit smoking”

So little did I know that even though she cheated and left me. Moved a man into my house the same day I gave her the space she needed. Lied and forced this man into my kids lives and immediately played the high school game of calling herself by his last name where she could.
I should do everything in my power to make it easy for her when it comes to the kids.
She saw fit that the oldest watches his brothers while she was going out on the town with her new guy or going camping. Now with this whole Corona I make the mistake to suggest that maybe it’s best the kids just stay put for a few weeks, and well I just got unloaded on.
I should look past the fact that

I effectively made myself homeless, because she said all she needed was space.
I “gave” her my inheritance, my family’s home for the boys.. No mortgage owed, free and clear… I now pay rent.
Besides rent, I pay car payments (she has none), car insurance, utilities… Me.. Not ME and ?? Like Her and Him, 2 incomes
I have been diagnosed with a serious condition that effects everything I do and have done for years.

But, I should just continue to give her everything for the boys, because that’s what a father does…  So as my boys Father I should teach them that no matter what, you should degrade yourself, allow yourself to be fucked over and stepped on, never speak up, and live in a box so that their Mother can have a comfortable life with a man she just thrust into your life, only to find something EVERY TIME to guilt you with even when you have nothing to give.
I never wanted to be this person I am being forced to become.

I can’t help but to think that there is a fair chance of getting the Corona and dying alone without ever getting to see my kids again, because my ex dumped me because of the same money issues all marriages face.  She has refused to discuss her reasons for the last year and I have made peace with why, but the thought still lingers. If this is God’s plan, I wonder what I have done to piss him off????

I was once again awoke by the dread of my life. I have lost my marriage, been diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder, and now the world is falling apart and I’m alone.
I was actually happy when I was diagnosed.  I thought now people would understand, now they would care, now they would help. None of this happened. No one has taken the time to understand what I go through, let alone consider my feelings in how they talk or not talk to me. Now the Corona pandemic, no one can come over, self quarantine. Understandable, right up until you hear how they got together here or there after they couldn’t come to visit.
So I am in my apartment alone, with BPD, in the pandemic, with a family I can’t see for the foreseeable future, who along with “friends” don’t care to see me.
They say it’s selfish to commit suicide because of the ones you leave behind, but what if they just really don’t give a fuck?

What god of fate did I piss off to be sitting here alone. Yes, it’s been over a year. Yes, I been seeing a therapist and psychologist regularly.  Yes, I walked away pretty unscathed in the divorce.
But, these were all choices forced on me. I came home one day last January and the woman I love, the woman who never showed any problems or told me of any issues, never, looked me in the eyes and told me it was over. She has never looked back, never discussed it, immediately “moved on” with a new man, immediately rewrote our history, family, and life.
Over the course of my “break down” from all of this, I learned that I have been dealing with a major mental illness all these years. Every choice I have made since childhood has flooded into my head, all my decisions seem suspect, all my actions, were they wrong? How does someone who had your children, was welcomed into your family and treated better than she ever was in hers, just go and end things in this way?
So here I sit. I have lost everything and still have no clue why. My marriage is over, my friends and family won’t talk to me because my illness shut me down and I didn’t put up the fight they expected me to. They all view my BPD as the “excuse of the week” and show absolutely no caring or understanding.  The world has shutdown with the Corona mess. I can’t make a friend other than faceless people on the net, I love you all and that is not meant as a bad thing, I just do not have anyone around me here.
There is no social stuff to do. No bars to go to. No church. No movies or restaurants.  No calls of concern. No calls to BS.  No work. And here I sit with Borderline Personality Disorder all alone, trying to “fix” me, fix 30+ years of shit. Trying to be a 49 year old copy of my father and failing miserably, failing miserably to be an adult, and a man

I have to say for me, this couldn’t have came at a worse time. I have fought to get to a place where my divorce has become grudgingly acceptable through throwing myself into my job. A job that is considered non-essential. A case of the sniffles has kept me from taking my children for visitation due to the fact that I can’t take the chance.
I have been thrust into my own prison of thoughts that have kept me on the edge of sanity and the only “friends” are you few here and the very occasional “how are you?” from a couple of acquaintances from years past that have finally noticed I left FaceBook several months ago. I don’t expect the kids to call or text, they are kids. I haven’t heard from family, but then again, they haven’t been there for me the whole year of the separation and mental breakdown either.
I am doing ok, even with the circumstances. I have a pretty kick ass base in Fallout 76 and have become a Candy Crush monster. I burnt through Ozark’s new season way to fast and Tiger King has inspired me to allow my freak out.
My therapist says I am doing great, although I don’t exactly feel it and I have somehow “turned on” every single ugly, age-lying, hill mutant on Zoosk. There was one lady though, but… well it was probably that dating site bot that “hooks” you in so you keep paying the $30 a month so you can hate yourself even more. I used to be have to beat girls off with sticks years ago, and now I feel like they want to beat me with sticks… “SIGH”
 
So lonely…

I have a rant. I can not say this around my “friends” and “family” here, but I have to get it out..
I was a great husband and father. I have learned that I have been dealing with a mental condition for a number of years that affected a lot of judgements and decisions, but never my feelings. I spent every day wondering how I could make a person happy and lived in quiet guilt when I thought of myself. I built and improved a home for her (and them) and laid awake at night worried about the tomorrows of them all. Over the last year and months I have come to learn that they never cared. My marriage ended on a whim, in a day, and no one cared. The small village where everyone knows everyone sat back and watched in accepting silence as my wife immediately paraded her new “boyfriend” around even before I moved out. My family never said anything to her when she immediately moved him into our home, THE SAME DAY I LEFT, to give her the “space” and time she so desperately needed. My sister discussed lawyers with her. I have no clue why.. 
There is a part of me that wishes I didn’t suppress the anger and temper I was so prone to in my earlier days. At least that would make it understandable. There is a part of me that wishes I would have cheated when the opportunities arouse. At least that would make it understandable. I wish I would have been fat, lazy, do-nothing alcoholic and drug user. Would have made sense. 
What EVIL intentions did she harbor for years that would make her play the loving game right up until that morning? What kind of person could look at their 4 boys and just stick a dagger in their Father’s soul? She knows in her heart I would fold because of my love for her and she walked me right into the oven. I sit here as the world falls apart, alone while someone else is there with my family. A man that by all accounts does not deserve what he has been given, which is everything. I spent 20+ years building a life, accumulating stuff for a man, who by all accounts, pissed all of his away to take all of mine in a day and not one person stood up for me.
More care and love is given to drug addicts and illegals then what was given to me. Me, who was raised in the church, who never went out of my way to hurt a fly, who lived with other’s actions as my own guilt. I am treated as some mutant, some troll who people now pull away from as if I was some sort of horrific thing and no one will tell me why. 
I had to get that out. I know who I am. I know I am a good person, who doesn’t deserve what I have been handed. I realize that somethings just don’t have answers. I know I have a sense of fairness in a world full of unfair people and things and that only the good die young.

So, I decided to take a break from my usual whiney posts. Here are some things that annoy me:

When a car is turning left into a drive, and someone is coming from the other way, why do they feel the need not to slow down?
Turning signals, use them.
My local Tim Hortons asking for tips by hanging signs one day and then not another. Love these kids, but I’m out of work and not getting a paycheck.  Sorry you have to work.
The News, the News stations that have political and personal spins.
Government and spin. 
I’m not a Trump fan, but I am an adult who has lived 49 years and I think I have a good understanding about how to understand reading between the lines. Just because he talks before he thinks doesn’t mean he isn’t trying to do his best.
I truly believe, if anything, that this Corona thing is a wake up call for all parties, states, countries to rethink how things are done. Whether it’s health or wealth or living.

I just picked up the boys some Easter candy and will mail it Monday, but something caught my eye. My ex was one of those “Family,  Love, and Happiness ” collectors,  funny how she didn’t practice what she preached, anyway I bought her something too.
Now I know I’ll never get a thank you and such, but this is who I am. I used to buy her odd little gifts all the time and it was all I needed to be happy to see her happy.
I guess that is what all of this comes down to. Her happiness.

I have allowed myself to exhale the last few days. I snuck out and sent the kids and the ex some stuff for Easter. Have yet to hear a thank you. I have kept quiet about my sadness to people. More or less, I’ve stayed off the phone. I haven’t heard word I ne from anyone. Wow, was I that big of an asshole that no one even cares? Through this whole pandemic thing. Just one person has contacted me. No family, no closer friends, just 1 who lives states away.

So there is soon to be a new woman in my life. One I hope cares enough to stay. One that will not turn selfish enough to disregard vows, family, history, and 4 little boys and utterly destroy me for in what she says is financial security.
Maybe this new woman will appreciate what I do for her and sometimes understand when I just need a cuddle. Maybe, the next time I have a health issue that effects me, the initial instinct isn’t to run to another man.
Hopefully she doesn’t guilt me when I am trying to do the right thing only to blame me when I finally cave and the results aren’t what she expected. Hopefully she doesn’t constantly berate me for not being what she considers who someone should be.
Maybe she will be the friend who actually comes to me as much as I am expected to come to her. I won’t be a chair filler on game night and included to dinner night. Maybe she will be concerned to check on me, atleast once, maybe?

My mind is racing. I’m not suicidal,  but I want to give up. I been taught tricks and things to work to beat my depression and BPD, but none of them are working tonight. Today was rough, no one in my family called or texted about Easter. I wound up calling my oldest to see if they received my gifts. I don’t think my kids truly miss me. I think they feel my absence,  but it just doesn’t matter that I am not there anymore.  
Is it wrong that I feel neglected and let down by everyone. I have a problem.  It wasn’t a drug issue, or drinking, or abuse. It was/is a mental health problem.  My ex destroyed me like I deserved it, but I never gave her a reason to. Yet, now after counseling,  that everyone told me I needed, based on my total breakdown,  I have an answer to why and what is wrong with me and these same people could care less. 
I received Easter greetings from strangers, people I have met here, but nothing from my family and friends, you would have thought cared. If I happen to mention my feelings or needs, right away I get the “need to be strong for the kid’s “, but my kids seem so unaffected. Matter of fact, everyone but me are unaffected.  I’ve been wrote out of existence and wiped from history. Why? 
I swear to all of you who read these words, I’m not asshole. I wasn’t an alcoholic or hooked on drugs nor did I ever lift a finger towards her. I gave her total trust, never a jealous moment. I treated her the same the last day as the first. I was a great father and a loving friend and brother. I lost more than just her that afternoon. I lost everyone. 
One year, 3 months, and days ago. The pain is still fresh, the nights still suck, and this “gets better” has yet to happen..

I am at a point where something inside me wants to move forward.  I have the “Jacob Marley” of a past with all the heavy chains dragging on me though.
Along with my boys, I sent the ex a gift for Easter. Never got a thank you. Woke up from a nap to have a text about cashing a check I sent her before the whole shut down.
Where is the person I gave 20 years to? Ok, in the moment she got lost. A new person, nice comments, life’s trials that marriages have. It’s all understandable why she cheated. What isn’t is the person she became. There’s a hate there that I could understand if I was an abusive, meth addicted, alcoholic gambler, but as I have learned i am a Borderline Personality suffer who had some issues that maybe caused some impulsive spending or some unexpected sadness. She hates me and that bothers me. Even my 1st ex never hated me. I mean, I walked. I gave her the house, my childhood house that was left to me by my dying Mother. All my possessions left. Her new man walked into the perfect guy’s life. Tools, grills, computers,  big screen TV and the list goes on.. and I am hated.
Do I want her back? No I want the life I had back. My kids there in a comfortable life, not a 2 room appartment with nothing. Memories i could share about the old pear tree or the painted pictures on the basement walls.
I never had any personal dreams and the only things I ever wanted to do are for a younger man. I have lost my looks, health, and time. I am now alone in a world where people won’t approach you and staying away is now the thing to do. I only talk to people who have someone about loneliness and they can’t begin to understand and conversations never resolve the pain. I am on dating sites where no one replies, even just to say “eww no” or some idiot is cat fishing you into a porn site or to hack your bank account.
I have so much to offer and it’s all just fading away.

So I’m back in the funk. Sad, lonely,  angry,  yada yada… My brain is so f@#$ed by all of this. Don’t get me wrong,  I totally love the people I’ve come to know on this site, but I have absolutely no support in my “circle”. All I want to do is sit with my ex and talk, like we used to. I don’t even care if she stays with him, I just need to talk to the friend I had for 20 years. I’m really starting to think that if my friends and family saw me drowning,  they would just keep walking and that is the one thing that is keeping me from going on.

So I’m not sure what or how to write this with it being  group thing,  but here it goes..
So its April and its freezing here in WNY, so here’s a get soup recipe:
Hot sausage ( if you can get it unlinked, I know that is a made up word, good cooking doesn’t mean being literate, 😜 If it is in links, cut off the skin
Kale cut the leaves off stalks, most know this, but just in case… Chop it up, nothing worse than burning your lip on a big old piece of soup kale 😳
Diced onion and Minced Garlic so unless you like to do the work, buy them that way.
Diced Potatoes Another cheat, frozen southern style hash browns. You can do it by hand too, if wanted..
1/2 Pint Heavy Cream and 6 cups Chicken Broth
Ok Let’s put it together

Get you favorite soup pan or whatever you call it. Use about 1 or 2 tablespoon olive oil and brown the loose sausage. (Personally you got to have the hot sausage,  it just adds to this soup, but I’m sure mild will work)
Add Diced onion, 1 onion is enough and 1 tablespoon mince Garlic. Let them just mix together. People in your house will love the smell..
When sausage is brown, add the 6 cups of broth. Stir and cover. When it comes to boil or close, add Kale.
After about 5 – 10 minutes, add the cream and potatoes.
OK, it’s soup. Turn the heat lower and stir occasionally and in about 30 minutes its done

That’s it.. Easy peasy, Try topping it with grated parm cheese.. Its also easy enough to experiment with. Just remember taste first and then add, its hard to take stuff out of soup once added 🤣

There was a time, very long ago, when I had confidence and I had looks on my side. Now, I’m just a washed up, over weight, bald man who couldn’t even keep the woman in my life for 20 years happy enough to stay with me.

Boy I certainly hitched my wagon to the wrong horses when it comes to friends all these years. I appreciate the out pouring of friends I have found on this site and I wish I could come and meet each and every one of you, maybe move there also… The people I have known for years and have always believed would be there for me as I would them have totally sucked at it.
Now I can’t tell you what a mental breakdown is, but I can definitely say I have had one. I have been to the edge and looked in the dark and had “the thoughts”. Suicide to me though is just one more way that God could mess with me. I know that if I attempted it I would come out of it dead from the neck down and spend the next 30 years in a state of clear mentality so I could be constantly reminded. That thought keeps me from doing it. Except for my kids and now a few of you, I don’t think anyone would care. It would be one those slow builds where several years from now someone would be saying, “He’s dead? Oh”
So, whats been happening in my life that has me once again cursing life? Well, somehow I have been branded a creepy old man. My “best friend” has a sister in law who is younger, but like 30’s younger than my 49yr old self and not like i’m cruising the high school young. Any hoo, she has moved back this way and I had always liked her and well I seem to find myself single.. So a conversation started over FaceBook ( told you I should have stayed off) that by all accounts made it seem perfectly ok to ask if she would like to meet for coffee. She agreed, so i assumed that we would. Being an old school guy and the fact she had moved back probably with all the shut down job loss crap, I ordered her a bouquet of flowers. Not a dozen roses, a nice spring assortment, with a note saying, “it’s nice you’re back”.
I have learn a couple things that I should have already learned at my age, but apparently if  you look like Brad Pitt at my age flowers are a sweet gesture, but if you look like Uncle Fester with glasses then they are akin to a rape van and lost puppies. Also, I learned the man who I had no problem with dating my ex girlfriend the same day I broke up with her when we were kids, the guy who i sat with and held a cold wet wash cloth on his head as he heaved his guts out from drinking to much, the “best friend” who I made a god parent, just sat there and let her go off without saying a word in my defense. Shouldn’t have expected more based on the fact that he hasn’t cared to see how I’ve been since all this divorce/ quarantine shit has gone on and has more or less given me the most helpful pep talks one in the middle of a break down needs like “be a man” “grow some hair on your nuts”
I have said this before and it almost sounds appropriate again, but I literally think my friends and family around here would see me drowning in a pool and would standing there yelling at me and calling me stupid for falling in.

Oh Boy. This is gonna be a rant. Loyalty not even sure what that means anymore. Besides my parents,  I don’t think I have ever been showed it.
My “friend” for 40+ years decided to read me the riot act about my attitude.  He totally glossed over the fact I have been dealing with a legitimate mental issue for years and have finally learned about it. “Get over it ” is what I get. Ok, let’s list my things to get over:

My wife suddenly left me, no one called her out on it and a certain friend’s wife has liked all the photos of the wife and her boyfriend a week afterwards on Facebook.
Said friend back in high-school spent the year I dated a girl, bitching about ” bros before hoes” and hooked up with the girl the same day I broke up with. Eventually marrying her.
She left him for our other friend, who I totally disowned because of my loyalty to this friend.
Back in our 20s I was with another girl, who guess what, he got with too.
His girl at the time came to me and asked what was up, I lied for him and he lost his shit because I talked to his girlfriend.
Finally, recently I had asked his sister in law to coffee, although she said nothing to me, she told him and I was read the riot act as if he was with her.

So, you ask why am I friends with this guy. I don’t know anymore. I am loyal to my friends, like I am loyal to my family and it may be the BPD talking, but I have constantly been fucked over.
“Why are you so needy? Why can’t you just let shit slide?” Hmmm.
I would love to post this on Facebook,  but as I said, this will all go against me.

I may be wrong, but if everything I’ve heard about Covid is that it’s a natural thing that got out of hand. It used to be this was called an act of God. Yes, the same God that you can say is behind beautiful sunsets and fields of breath taking flowers. The same God behind horrible tornadoes and terrible hurricanes. It’s not something that Republicans or Democrats did or Liberals or Conservatives did.
Who did we blame for polio? Spanish flu? The plague?
I’m not down playing the horrific effects of covid, but I am sick of all the blaming.  How could have Trump stop it or China or Governors or anyone? Can we stop a tornado or an earthquake?
Acts of God happen. Believe or don’t.  Acts of nature if you’re an atheist,  whatever. Our world, this Earth is still full of mystery and no amount of “victim blaming” or screaming  or even protesting will make sense of it. If I have to, as so many people say, put my faith in God, then this to is God’s will.
Faith in God states,  according to the Bible, is there is no stopping a flood that will wipe out humanity unless he/she directly tells you to build an ark. This virus has not spared a race, sex, or creed. What it has done, at least to my opinion, is shown the pure selfishness of people. Now, before I get a bunch of pissed off nurses, mailmen, and delivery drivers, I am not talking about you who chose your professions. I’m talking to the people who horded more than they will use toilet paper, meat, rice, yada yada. I’m talking about the people who think this is because of a man or woman in charge or a government that is made up off all us stupid humans.
People want the right to say they are a unicorn, not a man or a woman, but those same (people?) blame Trump or Obama or Bush or Clinton on acts of God (Nature).
I am in no way saying not to take precautions, but to do so with the knowledge that fate is fate. You can’t live in a bubble thinking there’s no sharp edges in the world. A pebble won’t hurt you, but a pebble dropped from the top of a skyscraper will kill you and to live a life full of worry is in my opinion is no life.

She is still not potty trained, but i have done all i have learned and been told for 25 days straight. She just looks at me now and goes on the floor. Hundreds of toys, but chews everything but.
I have just as much, if not more, anxiety with her, than as I went through my breakdown after my separation.

So I finally came to the realization that I am going to be alone for the rest of my life. Yes I can fill the time with a dog, friends on line (the ones around me have no time for me) and my boys, well until the time they don’t wish to come around.
Several times I have attempted to meet someone new, several times they have found reason not to. From my habits to their “diagnosed ” belief that I need to find me. Which is the nice ways to say, not interested because you look bad or have baggage.
Why do people go on dating sites and not even make an attempt? What happened to not judging a book by its cover? For 2 years now I have been both nicely and terribly broken down by friends and strangers who won’t even attempt to know me.

I don’t think I have ever gone this long without a new friend or relationship.  I’m not talking about the friends I made on here or Facebook, I mean a stop over for a drink, play a game, or have a date friend.
I’m lonely, even with a puppy, I’m lonely. The focus is on the puppy now. Everyone notices her and through that is forced to talk to me. They get their fill of petting and playing and never talk to me again.
With all that has gone on with the divorce, I have been shuffled to the dark recess of the cellar and forgotten about. My ex lives a life that although she is surrounded by evidence of a life with me, she has completely blocked out the last 20 years and people who knew me (us) have too.
I am a stranger in my hometown now and a stranget in the place I call home now. I have a neighbor who barely spoke 2 words to me the first 5 months, who now makes it a point to correct everything I do with my dog.
I have entertained the thought of re-homing Nanee. Maybe a happier family would be best for her. I have never been suicidal, but a part of me has died and it’s dragging the other with it.
I have never felt so ugly, worthless, and avoidable as I have over the last year and a half, and try as I might, it’s not improving.

2 in one day..
I hate me, I have for years. I have a vision of what I want to be and I strive to be that, but keep running into walls.
I work in a retail type of industry and I have learned to fake happiness.  I pleasantly greet people with all the fake I can muster. I see some people with a life it seems like I deserve, but can’t have.
All I ever wanted was to be my father. Quiet, reserved, but home every night surrounded by his wife and children.  Never needing friends and family, although he had plenty, because all he needed and wanted was right there in his life.
I have been given this twice and both times it has been ripped away by no fault of my own. Both of my ex’s just wanted someone who wasn’t me. I wonder if they have both looked at the children we had with regret, but then I remember how they both allowed a new man to instantly step into the role of father and even with my active role, constantly made me feel as though I am never good enough at it.
I dated a woman in between my ex’s who had a child and never did she even remotely allow me to take on a fatherly role with her child. Maybe I am crazy? Maybe in my head I don’t see what I am really doing. I think I am hugging my children, but I am actually strangling them? Maybe I think I am praising them, when I am actually yelling?
Maybe all of it is because of me?

When is it ever enough? Cain killed Able, should we hate brothers? Adam and Eve populated the world, are we all a bunch of insest people? Noah only allowed his family on the ark, are we all antisocial asshats? Should the Indian and African tribes that killed other tribes give back the lands? Should we give up all possessions because someone else made them from resources stolen from someone else?
Do I need to keep listening to someone who preaches this from their den in a house built on land that is not rightfully theirs? Should I just leave everything and leave my door open because essentially all my possessions are someone else’s?
In a world where children starve and die daily, we are bickering about past hurts that will never be fixed no matter we say, do, or how we live. Your ancestors were hurt, well so were mine. Your people were displaced, so were mine. I am tild daily to “get over ” the pains I have with broken relationships and unfair situations,  yet I am suppose to embrace a movement that is asking the same things I feel personally. There is no solution but to live and move on. We are painting all people with one wide brush instead of looking at an individual. To be proud of yourself means you have to be not proud.

I am starting to realize the only way through the rest of my days is to harden my heart and soul.
I have been a loving and caring person all these years and it’s gotten me nothing and nowhere.
Two marriages, with kids, both gone. I gave them both all I could. My first, my high school sweetheart. I loved her so much and not a day went by I didn’t tell her. My second, was the love of my life. I gave her everything, including my family’s home. I showed her my love everyday for the 20 years we were together.
Neither of them even so much as act like we had something.  I don’t even hear the phrase “our kids” when I do hear from them.
I have never been so lonely and betrayed as I have been with this divorce.  My friends, family, and even my kids, all act as this just was meant to be. No one misses me, no one sides with me. I don’t deserve this and now I shut myself off from it all.
My kids will know me as the quiet, mean, but fair man that brought them into this world. They won’t have the relationship I had with my Dad, or the one I had dreamt about when we were all under one roof as a family.
People I meet will no longer see the loving side of me. People I work with will no longer like me, but will respect me. I am done with being the lovable loser in this world even if it means I will no longer enjoy love, friendship, or peace.

When I was a kid I had a paper route. One of my customers was Mr. Bifaro.
I had never met a more angry man in my life. It wasn’t an act, it was his reaction to everything and everyone.
“Get off my grass” and ” Why are you so late” were 2 of the things he would shout. A permanent scowl was what his face was. I think he only had two different outfits and his outside patio chair had a permanent shape of his body from him sitting in it for years.
All I wanted was to see him happy one day, but it never happened.
I have come to understand him now. Lonely, pissed at life and people for going on without him. Family and friends leaving him. Stranger’s attitudes not wanting to understand him or give him a chance, day in and day out.
I have become him. I have spent over a month trying to repair broken relationships I believe I didn’t break. Waiting for calls or messages that never come. Putting myself out there, only to be disappointed.

What has become of common sense and thinking over the last several years? How is it the actions of a few people out of the millions of citizens caused such an unneeded response? Cities, businesses, and culture are burning. Large groups of young people who haven’t even lived life are protesting and asking for change based on a history they either never learned or chosen not to understand with an open mind. A sickness that is made to sound like a Biblical cleansing, but is about as terrible as all the others that came before, is being used to force changes in personal freedoms, that personal responsibilities are all that is needed.
We are being told to reject and rewrite a history that was sometimes unfortunate and sometimes inspirational due to a poor understanding of it. I personally do not care for how the little girl and boy treated me in kindergarten in 1976 or how I was cut on the monkey bars in 1978. I felt it was unfair that 3 of my Grandparents were ripped from my life in 1978 or how I was treated by the neighbor in 1982. In 1983 I was called a horrible name by a person I never knew and still do not after all these years. 1987 I was publically broke-up with and lost what was my group of friends, when they all stayed with my other friend who immediately dated my ex. Should I find him today and demand an apology? Look up the kindergarten kids and ask for reparations? Through You Tube videos and FaceBook postings I am learning a whole generation of people are changing the history their Grandparents lived to suit there “idea” on what really happened. Words are now being banned because they are misconstrued into something else. Great men and women from the past, who after all were only “human”, are having their actions and deeds replaced by the most biased trivial things someone may or may not have dug up about them.
“If I was alive then……..” What a fucking stupid thing to say. You weren’t and you never will be. The past is just that, past. Fire has always burned, but since it’s discovery we have learned how to use it, what to look out for to keep it from going out of control, but momentary lapses happen and it does burn again. Do we just decide that there has not been any advances with fire and just totally forget it and stop using it entirely?
“If I was alive then…..” If the Bible is to be believed, Cain killed Able for reasons that were his own. Tribes invaded other tribes again and again. Countries and Empires expanded and fell. Victors gained and losers lost. All of recorded history was such. Terrible things happened to all people no matter what race, religion, or sex. Terrible things were done to all people no matter what race, religion, or sex. It was how it was. You are not going to be reborn in 200 BC, look around with the acquired thousands of years knowledge and tell the nomads how they should share with others because someone’s feelings might get hurt.
I don’t know, maybe I was day-dreaming when History was taught. Especially on American History. You see I am what they call a “Generation X” kid. Personally I believe the last generation that learned values, morals, and common sense by older generations that had learned and slowly came to understand the rights and wrongs of history. We took our lessons with the free thinking abilities of any sane person. We realized the injustices to the Native Americans and Slaves and to this day we hold in a hearts a shame of what ancestors did. We also learned that other people were also wronged, the pilgrims in Europe, the Irish indentured servants, the Jews, Christians in the Spanish Inquisitions, Muslims in the Crusades, almost everyone with the Mongols..
America was formed, just as imperfect as anyone person, to be a country that will learn from it’s mistakes and constantly strive to get better, but as with you and me, there are bumps in the road from time to time, “those without guilt, cast the first stone…..”
The Institutions of the past that single-handedly caused race, religious, and sexist damage have been replaced, removed, and re-educated to be better and more encompassing to it’s citizens. Now though it’s the voices of a few groups or individuals that a 24 hour News channel highlights that besmirch all the gains and improvements our country has made. Because of one or two persons stupidity, a whole race of people are labelled racist no matter what they have done or the acceptance of others.
Whole injustices are being committed that are being ignored because it doesn’t cause a reaction to push an agenda.. Black on black crime, white on white crime, fuck, crime in general. The need to change the past, given reparations, or even for people to bow and scrape for a forgiveness that they have not done anything to have too ask for, is just patently stupid.  Just as stupid as looking at someone and assuming they will just do something in the future and should be punished now.
COMMON SENSE, We all have it and we all also have free thought. We all, no matter what race, color or creed, all make assumptions based on what we see, read, or don’t understand.. As a Generation X kid, I grew up with Archie Bunker and George Jefferson, two TV guys with racist views that were told their errors and learned from them. They didn’t go out of their way to push agendas or hurt people and their stupid thoughts were called out, no reparations, no groveling for forgiveness over things, just a basic human understanding that people make mistakes in thoughts and deeds and we all have the capacity to learn and change.
The same media and news today that nightly wants to guilt people also puts out the stuff that causes a person to have thoughts and views about another. Constantly showing a certain race, color or creed as what people see as their prejudice, like drug gang dramas and gangster rap, biker gangs and bad cops, constant focus on one story about one person’s stupidity and turning it into everyone’s stupidity. Making issues where there are none, glorifying people who don’t deserve it, focusing on mistakes made in speech or actions than the whole story. Pig headily not allowing other points of view and making others into villains because they do not fit what someone else believes. We now live in a world where only one side’s opinions matter and no matter what facts or truths the other side presents, they are always wrong.

So, maybe I ruffled some feathers yesterday, so here we go again…
White privilege, police, and racial inequality… Really? Do you really think whites all hate blacks? Do blacks hate whites? Is it right to judge a whole group? Is it right to judge one person on the sins of their ancestors?
There is no one on this Earth, who if given the time to think, who can not say they as a race, creed, or religion haven’t been hurt, oppressed, or silenced.
With all the shit I have been through the year and a half I have gone through after the end of my marriage, I could personally find hundreds of people, things, and events that I can say held me down, made me depressed, and cause me to give up. Do you know what people say to me? “Get over it” or “it gets better” or “the only way to overcome it, is to overcome it. No one can do it for you..” But isn’t funny that when it’s a group of people, a whole race of people, that the sentiments of the one or two people, takes on a different answer. We can’t move past it. It has not ever gotten better. Overcome it? We shouldn’t have to, we should just be handed it….
Have you ever noticed that the people who have “put in” the work to “rise up” and become more, do not share the victim mentality? They do not ask to be overlooked for their actions, whether good or bad. The accept the highs and lows, praise and punishment, and don’t sit and use the mistakes of people in the past as an excuse to cover their failings.
“I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character.”
If you truly believe that in today’s world that this is still a problem, then it’s you who has a problem. A few sound bites, over played and over analyzed on 24 hour news channels beating all of us about the same story or cherry picking a story that suits the narrative they push. Yes I blame CNN just as much as FOX.  A political party so hell-bent on hating the other has totally damaged what government is supposed to do. A culture where gangs are glorified in music, television, and movies. Why do you think some people have misconstrued feelings and fears of others.  I’m sorry, but if you were raised in a small town, where you know your neighbors, no matter what they look like, and you find yourself in the “big city” in a sketchy area and you are approached, the first thing you will think won’t be ” hey look, they are selling cookies”. It’s human nature, it’s what everyone’s parent’s have installed them since childhood, “don’t talk to strangers, don’t trust strangers…” Yet, it has become such a convenient way to call someone a racist.
White privilege.  Not sure what this is? I have been ticketed for speeding. I was held accountable for stealing. I have been called out for my negative actions. Here again, we never hear of the thousands of interactions that go normal and nice, but the few that go sideways are beaten into our heads and hearts over and over again and made out to sound like they’re the only ones that happen. Did you ever stop to wonder what may or may not have happened in the “videos” if polite understanding and self control replaced the driver seat lawyers? How should a person think when they have put in the work, hundreds of hours studying and learning, but not get the employment because a quota needs filling? Now, to some I proved the point, but did I? Is there actual proof that this as systematic as we are lead to believe? Maybe there are only a few people of color in a organization, because they deserved to be there? Stay with me here, over the last several years award shows have been constantly accused of not including, but are they supposed to include because something was award worthy or just because?
Here’s where you are really going to lose your shit. Why is it that all other races, colors, and creeds can have heritage days, festivals, and organizations, but… “white” pride is automatically labeled RACIST, whether or not it is?
Let’s touch on the police issue.. Maybe all the people losing their minds and lumping every single policeman and policewoman, no matter what color, into one whole racist group, should take a class, or ride-along with an officer. I remember watching a video on You Tube of a very vocal anti police reporter who was invited to train some with officers. He was placed into a situation that wasn’t so clear cut as the news or BLM would have you believe. Guess what happened? He fired first as the “subject”, while resisting and driver seat lawyering went for something in his trunk. No one, NO ONE has justified what happened to Mr. Floyd, that man, the officer, totally deserves all the punishment that is thrown at him, but on the same day at the same time, there was probably hundreds of officers saving someone, investigating tragic accidents, keeping people safe, and protecting sensitive property. Maybe they were clearing the road for a funeral or calming a domestic argument as another comforts a child effected. The next day, all these good officers were being pelleted with insults, objects, and just plain lies.

So, to get this out and not make personal life even harder, I am ranting here..

You promised shared joint custody…. You Lied
You promised you wouldn’t bring the “new” boyfriend around to soon, so the boys could cope…. You Lied
You said you would give me a fair share of the house, which was my family’s home, gifted to me before the dementia took over my Mom, the same one who accepted you as a daughter…  You Lied
You agreed to counseling… You Lied
You agreed to occasional “family” dinners with the kids… You Lied

Twenty years together and in one day you became this lying stranger. A person that for all that time disgusted you. Hours spent listening to how disappointed you were over your mother and sister acting just the exact way you have.
Then you send me legal stuff on the day that would have been out 15th anniversary and insist I get it done and back to you today.

I walked away from open diary a few months back. I thought I finally found someone or someones to actually talk to in the “real world”. I didn’t.
Once again, just like the 4 other times since my divorce, I thought I found someone who wanted to be with me. Just as before, I got the “don’t want to be with someone, want to be alone” talk. They wouldn’t be honest, tell me they weren’t interested,  I wasn’t someone they wanted. Within days, they all started dating.
I have relived my heartbreak of losing my wife 4 more times since she immediately jumped into a new one.
I have come to be ok with myself. I don’t enjoy it, but I live with it, but the hurt is all around like a shadow. I got a dog, she much like the ex, relies on my help to eat and have a place to sleep and fill her basic needs, but she would rather be with the neighbor and strangers.  She is more excited by people passing by the door than greeting me after a long day. I sit on the couch, she sits in the chair. She moves away from one or the other when I sit. I call her to lay in the bed with me and she slinks away to stay on the hard floor.
Since I last wrote, I have made every effort to mend fences. Apologizing for things and actions indifferent people did to me all because I missed my friends and family. Nothing changed. No one answered.
Some people want a life all their own, no one to involve themselves with. I don’t, I need people in mine. I was totally happy with my little family. I made every effort for my ex and my kids. She left me and immediately brought in her new man and I was replaced like that. Yeah, I get my kids, who are totally unaffected by this. No one, friends or family, questioned her or her actions.  I spent the first year hearing from strangers and distant friends about how people don’t know what to stay and the bulk of this one being told how I am a whining bitch and shit happens. At no time did I ever get a supportive hug or visit. To this day, the only people who have checked in are a few people I met through here and the therapist I pay weekly to do it.

The one piece of advice I’ve been given, or should I say pushed down my throat, is put out positivity and it will come back.
Still waiting on that.
I have been the guy who buys the person behind me order at the drive through. I bought a lady’s groceries. Donated to every cause that gets thrown in my face in, at, and around every store I go in.

Another early morning after another lonely weekend. It’s become apparent that maybe it’s me.
All my friends and family have just fallen out of my life and I now I realize, that it’s me. They don’t answer when I call or write. No visits or concerned check ins. I haven’t heard from any of them now for several months, even though I have made efforts to contact them all.
Maybe if I cheated or beat my ex wife, it could explain why everyone left me. Maybe if I lied constantly and just sycked the life from everyone.  Maybe if I showed no sense of concern, that would explain it all.
They are all right, it is me. I have had over a year and a half to become some one new, some one better and I’m a no one. I’m just a reminder of everything that was wrong for all of them back then.

59,https://www.opendiary.com/m/newt316/not-suicide-but-suicidal-5918318/,2020-10-26,"Not suicide, but suicidal","
I have really been thinking of ending it all.  My relationship with my kids is just a one way thing. I send gifts, make calls, and send messages. They don’t reciprocate. The ex is now remarried, having waited a total 2 weeks after the divorce was finalized.
I have never been told why? I am confused how a 20 year relationship ends in a day for someone and there is no regrets or second thoughts. She starts every day in my childhood home, surrounded by our 4 boys, pictures of my parents, and possessions that have been in the family longer than our time, yet acts as though we never were.
The silence of life long friends and family has been constant salt on my wounds. I have cried daily for 22 months straight because of the unfairness of all of this, while it seems everyone else accepted it from day one.  I wonder, if I was drowning and calling for help, would all these people stand on the shore just watching, and like now, yelling at me to stop screaming, because they don’t want to hear it? Never once did they help or give support, but now I am suppose to deal.
I have questioned every day I can remember over the past 44 years of my life. What I did or said wrong to everyone to get this reaction at the lowest point of my life. Even the pastor who sat with me, arm around my 48yr old shoulders as I sobbed about my loss, has turned from me. He married her, knowing full well how this came about. I’m sitting here learning that God’s love and plan is good, but other’s sins are don’t matter. I feel constantly punished for good or bad, yet…
So, why the title? I’m to weak willed to do it.   I don’t own a gun, nor can I get one. There is nothing sturdy enough around me to hold my weight to hang myself and honestly the pills I take would leave me with a headache. I don’t think I could drink myself to death and sticking my head into an electric oven also won’t cut it. So, I am metaphorically doing it. Killing me to everyone else. No more answering calls, messages, or knocks on the doors. No more sending out messages apologizing for being wronged and hurt. Like a ghost I will go to work and come home, wrap up in my blanket and sleep. Maybe sometimes to be treated to happy dreams, but more than likely the punishing ones to I have had day in and day out since.

I have always thought the expression “hit me like a ton of bricks” was funny. How could you not see something in your life failing so bad that you can’t see it coming?
And then I lived it for the last 22 months.
I can’t say that there hasn’t been some “up’s” over this time. I’ve made some new friends, cyber friends is what the kids call them, I have brought a dog, which has been a wonderful thing for my neighbor, literally my dog just eats and sleeps at my home, but prefers every waking moment over next door. Some old friends have come back into my life, and left just as quick.
But, my life is not better. I have yet seen the “plan” that the almighty has laid down for me, unless it’s all about the suffering. I lost my childhood home, possessions, the only love I truly cared for, my family. The friends I held close to my heart have all but left me for dead. No check in calls, no invites, no responses to me apologizing that my “ton of bricks” inconvenienced their lives. My sister has took all of this as a personal affront, how dare my “ton of bricks” make her life hard. Why am I not the father she would be in my place? Why am I letting a little thing like my ex destroying my “everything” make me not be what she wants me to be?
To many dark, silent, and lonely nights have lead me to look into online dating. I am currently giving a nice young woman, I have seen twice, money for sudden expenses.   I know, you don’t have to say it, but although my ex, friends, and sister would make it seam I am the world’s biggest asshole, I generally care about people, whether they care for me. Besides, I have some extra cash and I don’t do anything but go home, feed “the neighbor’s dog”, and sleep until the next shitty day starts.

Two years, that’s almost how long it’s been. I live the conversation over and over in my head everyday since. You on the other hand, you immediately started a new life with a new man. The divorce is done, you’ve remarried and I am stuck in two years ago.
Actually, two years from today, we were still a family. The happiness from Christmas still in the air. The kids still playing with their presents like the day they opened them. You and I, still cuddled up watching them. Only now the memory is forever ruined by the fact another person was on your mind and you were just building up what I can only think was pure hate for me and how you were preparing how you would destroy me in the coming days.
I’ve hurt people in the past, but never crushed their souls and taking everything from them. No reason given. No consideration for our children or family. You can even honor what we decided in the divorce. I have to now legally fight for a pittance of 20 years of our relationship.
 
I exist like a ghost now. No one calls or visits. People in public ignore my greetings and attempts to be friendly. I spend my time trying to figure out what I did to you and others, just so I can understand why it is that I have become nothing more than a leper to everyone. Thing is, I would admit my faults, if they were so horrible to justify this all, but they weren’t. Even with knowing about my BPD, I never lashed out, only feeling sorry I couldn’t give people more and stressing about it. If that is why I have lost you, family, and friends, than I have no reason to be on this Earth.

I think the last time I wrote was in December. I’ve decided to come back. I need to gets some stuff off my mind…
P****,
These last few years have been very hard. I have been sick, depressed, and very lonely. For some reason, you are my measuring stick for a new relation. We saw how well that went. I still can’t believe you jumped right back into marriage with him. I mean the ink wasn’t even dry on the divorce papers.  I hear you guys are going out on trips, taking the boys on vacations, and that you have a whole group of new friends now. It hurts because I never stopped you from doing all those when we were together.
I think you owe me an apology. The cheating was one thing but, the lies and broken promises you told me so I would give you “space” to think. You never planned on doing counselling. You didn’t care that the boys were immediately thrust into your new relationship. Less than 4 hours I was gone. You lied when we discussed the divorce agreement, you never were going to give me my share of the house I was raised in. You took advantage of me being broken by all of this.
Who are you? Where is the woman I knew, loved and trusted for 20 years? The mother of my children. The woman my parents called daughter and my siblings called sister.  All I did was try to love you and respect you more than anyone. Yes, we had the hard times like all marriages do but, we faced them together. You never said anything about being unhappy. Now you’re some cruel, self-centered, and nasty person, the exact kind of person you had hated all our time together. You have thrown me under the bus to play a victim you never were so much so that even you have believed your own lies.
How can a person do that? How do you look at our children and live in my family’s home and make it ok with you? What turns a caring, compassionate, and lovely person into what you have become? I’m told it was money. He offered you a shallow excuse of love. I see the new stuff and I hear about the trips and the useless babbles you have. I never thought I would meet, let alone be involved with someone willing to give up so much for money. I understand, women want security. You sold me out for money. You took your children’s father away and changed their lives forever, for money. Did we have tough financial issues? Yes, but we had a plan. I have heard you tell people that I put you in debt, but you did what we planned and you weren’t. I was though.
I left with nothing. I left with a promise I could get established. It took you 4 hours to go with your new man to close accounts and squirrel the money for yourself, leaving me stuck in a shitty apartment I had to beg to get and now didn’t have the money. I laid in an emergency room several times because of panic attacks and anxiety attacks and thoughts of suicide. Alone. Did you know, when you left so did my friends and family? My sister made it all about herself. She wanted to see the boys, knowing full well she wouldn’t keep them from you. So you stopped taking my calls and messages. Not a hug or an ounce of support from the only other woman left in my life. My friends, well I don’t know what happened, they just stopped caring. I thought, hoped, that they would help me rise above my pain and loss like I did them when they lost their first girlfriend and their first wives. They didn’t. Even the Pastor who sat and listened and quoted the Bible about the horrible sin of what you did, he betrayed me by marrying you two.
Its been exactly 2 years, 7 months and 25 days since you broke me. I still don’t know why. I still haven’t been able to be financially secure. I am missing so much of the boy’s lives and cannot do anymore than what I can. I’m still alone. I’m still broken.
 
Just an apology.

Ok, I realize my post yesterday was saw as a cry for help or something, but it really wasn’t. I just had to get it out. You see, it’s been just me for a while now. Can’t sit with my kids and unload this on them. Yes I’m not ashamed to say I have a therapist. One the reasons I am here to depress you all with my entries… LOL
I am ok. I’ve lost a bunch of weight, started to be a regular at the gym, and I’m probably the healthiest I have been since high school. I’m so ready to move on from things but, it seems that life isn’t ready for me to. That’s why when I constantly hear “you need to be good with you before you will be for anyone else” I want to scream. What do I have to do to show the world I’m ready?
Another fun phrase, ” if you want something, go out and get it.” Apparently though, for me I’m not what people consider ready.
Ok this one is getting dark too..
I guess what I am trying to say is, I think of myself as “the guy” a lot of women say they can’t find but, look over because of one thing or another. “Not ready”
” We’re at different places in our life”
” I’m not looking to date (although you’re on a dating site????)”
I guess I appreciate the let you down easy approach, it is nicer than the truth..

It’s been almost 3 years since the day my ex told me she wanted to separate. I’ve since lived that day over and over daily. I wasn’t allowed to fight for her. She wanted nothing to do with me other than support for the kids. A 20 year relationship was over in a manner of hours. We never had problems, not like one’s that would make a normal couple think of divorce anyway. To this day, I have no idea why?
She had her new man immediately move in and get involved with all my children’s lives. I had a mental break having buried the death of my daughter and mother, along with every bad thought and emotion. My mind couldn’t comprehend what was happening. I had no support. My siblings chose to stay quiet or make it about themselves choosing to side with the ex so they could see the kids, never once a hug or a kind word to her brother who was on the edge of suicide. Friends, life long friends, were no better. I had been there for births, deaths, and the lost of their relationships offering a shoulder, a place to crash, or an ear to bend. I have been truly alone in the “real world” since.
I am glad for my Facebook friends, but a computer won’t hug or dry tears or even listen as you fumble over typing and crying at the same time.
My ex was engaged 3 months after our separation. By my estimates, she only knew this man a couple months before our separation and they were engaged before a divorce paper was even a thought. While I spent every moment trying not to kill myself or in the hospital because panic attacks. When the divorce was finalized she remarried weeks later. From the day we separated she acts as if there was never anything between us. Why?
I eventually got a therapist and a psychologist.  I don’t want to kill myself and the several pills a day keep the “voices” at bay, but I still cry everyday about the loss of her, my little family, the only way of life I knew, and loss of the “supporters” I thought I had. I fucking hate this new life. I hate being alone, but can’t seem to have another relationship whether friend or romantic. I guess since I was a kid, all I wanted was a family like I grew up in. Both parents raising their children. Divorce was just something terrible people did because they were selfish.
"
65,https://www.opendiary.com/m/newt316/obligation-19-6063766/,2021-11-05,Obligation,"
The one thing my divorce has given me is time. Time to think, time to hurt, time to sit in depressed silence. Last night was one of those thinking nights. I think my ex stayed with me out of some kind of weird obligation. I think our whole relationship was that also. The more I try to remember my relationship with her the more clearer it becomes that she may have never really loved me in the way a couple should. Sure, we have kids. Things happen, contraceptives fail. I remember asking her to marry me when our fist child was conceived and how she said there was no rush, only to agree with me when she was pregnant with our second, because it may get weird for the kids. Nothing special, judge did it. No pictures and no recorded memories other than a piece of paper.
I can’t remember ever being comforted by her when things took a shit for me. I honestly don’t remember if she ever initiated any sex.
When the end came, I guess you can say when it came for her, there was no crying from her about how our 20 relationship was ending or how are family was ending. Stone faced, she kept saying to be civil. She immediately made it public by going out with her “new man” that same night. Mind you this happened in a day and no, there was no signs, no tells, she pulled the greatest blindside in the histories of blindsides. Whatever obligation she ever felt ended that afternoon. I fell for the lies of counselling and space to think. The lies that the boys would not be introduced to the new guy until they could process what was happening…
That got me out of the house, got me to give her “space”. Her lies lasted about one hour. He was moved in that night, never to leave, boy’s feelings be damned. Family be damned. Immediately there was an undeserved bitterness projected on me from her. No reasons were given. No apologies. Definitely no second thoughts. She was engaged within a couple months and was married before the ink dried on the divorce papers.
Before you think that this man is some dashing white knight, he isn’t. He was 20 years older than her. The kind of guy who has longer hair on the sides and bald on the top, but assumes he still has hair. A man who walked from his first family. A man who 2 years prior was arrested for some drug and weapon stuff. Oh, he was “born again” or whatever phrase those Christians that do that call it. I guess I was sold out for money. He came with money. I have saw the new furniture, vehicle, outside garden stuff. I have heard about the night trips, the camping, the bingo and the new friends. All things I tried to do, asked to do and encouraged her to do, but has been told to everyone that I kept her from.
I invested everything into her and my family. Three years and I can’t accept this life. I can not enjoy the free time and “freedom” I guess unlike her, I take my obligations seriously.

66,https://www.opendiary.com/m/newt316/ive-become-one-of-those-guys-6064401/,2021-11-08,I’ve become one of those guys…,"
Due to the overwhelming loneliness of being the left in the divorce, I’ve dabbled in the online dating sites a few times now. I did meet a few ladies, but they’ve all decided that I wasn’t worth the effort. IDK, maybe something else, but that’s how it feels anyway.
That’s not what this is about though, the women I’ve met, this about the several I haven’t. Apparently I must have that “look” that the scammers look for in their search for victims. Several times on different dating sites like Facebook, POF, Match, and even a Christian dating site I’ve been targeted. Thing is, I don’t think that much of my self to fall for the seriously over attractive interests of the women who live just close enough to sound possible.  I mean there is obvious BS like when one used porn star, Bree Olson’s pics she has on her twitter.
Then there’s the ones that actually look legit. Have to say these guys have been getting better with trying then a few years ago. They always slip up though. Basic English grammar, not knowing the first thing about where they say they live or what they do, and the anger when you call them out on it. I just never thought of the typical “target” though. In my mind I selfishly think of the unattractive guy with a sob story background post who is just old enough to be in that well off stage of life. You see, I stupidly listen to the compliments I get from people who know there is absolutely no way they would ever be in a relationship with me. Sort of like every child is wonderful to their mother shit. Truth is, I’ve become one of those. Maybe that’s why the wife left and why I typically get “likes” from women who realize they’re just as much of a mess as I am.
I was raised in the church by parents that taught me about right and wrong, how to treat everyone, and not judge a book by it’s cover. That said, I’m sure that these typical women who send me like are probably nice and caring people. Just as lonely as I am, but in my mind, the last several relationships I have had over the first 50 years of my life were with women I found attractive. Yes, where did that get me?
Maybe then it’s fate or karma why I’m now alone, unloved, and friendless. Now I’m just one of those guys. You have all seen them. The one who quietly goes out for work and groceries, but never leaves his apartment or that guy on the end of the lunch counter who is so desperate for a friend he annoyingly bothers all the other people and wait staff. This is where I am destined to suffer the rest of my days.

She never cried.
Almost 20 years together, almost problem free, 4 children and one of the best extended families a person could ask for and she never shed a tear to me, for me.
No reason was ever given why she was no longer in love with me or why our marriage had to end. Obviously I know now there was another guy, just don’t know why.
She destroyed me, mentally, financially, and spiritually. Friends and siblings gone. Why? I never lifted my hand to her or called her anything out of disrespect. I shared an equal amount of cleaning, cooking and children raising. Yet, I have never been told why or seen her cry.
Can a person be that cruel, that heartless to do that to another, to a family, and to their children?

68,https://www.opendiary.com/m/newt316/and-there-it-is-12-6064678/,2021-11-10,And there it is…,"
I used to have 3 important women in my life. 3 unconditional loves. My daughter died in 2012. My mother in 2018. My wife, although still alive, died in 2019. I lost all three in a matter of hours.. Two were sudden and one was known. Two hurt me horribly and one destroyed me.
I have been left in a state of grief for almost 3 years. Not wanting to be alone, but not wanting to be with someone. Most of the time not by choice. I have this overwhelming empathy that two of them brought to life in me and overwhelming depression and hate the other caused me.
My wife died on January 20, 2019, sometime between 6am and 3pm. I had one last kiss, 1 last hug, and one last reciprocated ” I love you”. Something I did not get with my daughter or mother. There was a stranger in our home when I finished work for the day. This person remarried as soon as it was possible and these 2 strangers raise my children. For some reason I have been called names and bitterly talked to from her. She won’t tell me where she buried my wife or what even happened to her. This stranger has also turned friends and family against me to the point I am no longer welcome in the village I grew up in or invited to my own family functions at my sister’s home.
I greave the lost of my wife, daughter, and mother every day. I greave for my children’s loss of their normal family. For memories unfulfilled and dying dreams. I greave for the lost of myself, because on that day in January, I died too.
"
69,https://www.opendiary.com/m/newt316/i-cant-keep-doing-it-this-way-6064809/,2021-11-11,I can’t keep doing it this way,"
The end of my marriage came suddenly on a January day in 2019. I can only explain it like those stories of a pet who for years sits at the train station or bus stop and waits for someone who never returns.
Unlike the pet though, people aren’t and never were interested in helping the poor lump of a man sitting there lost. Not only did I lose “her”, I lost my little normal family. Sure weekend visits are super, but people that haven’t lost in a divorce have absolutely no understanding. Oh sure there are those mutual divorces, or so they say.
I realize I have no right to feel as bad as I do. Not in a world where children die of cancer, disfiguring accidents, or born with disabilities, but this is my pain. At 50, like a lot of 50 year old people, I had to deal with horrible losses. I lost my parents and a daughter and had other family members and friends die or deathly sick or worse.  Unlike a lot of people, I never had big dreams or fantasies, all I wanted was to raise a family like my father did. Sacrificing my own happiness for everyone else’s. Making a safe and secure home and life for my family.
I got to live that dream for almost 20 years, then some other man came along and convinced my wife that I was doing it wrong, too cheaply, and not exciting enough. She sat and picked at issues all marriage have and justified her betrayal. Then this person, my whole life and soul, decided the only way was total destruction.
I have heard so many takes on why women do what they do and how she did it to cover up her guilt and betrayal. That whole just rip off the Band-Aid kind of thinking. Of course, she was instantly in a new relationship, no chance for regrets and on the “sugar high” that it brings. As time went on, any chance of thinking it was a mistake disappeared.   The new people he brought her in contact with all wormed hateful thoughts of me into her mind and now some unjustified bitterness is all I get from her. I’ve become the bad one in all of this to her, my kids, my family members, and friends, so much so I have started to believe it.
I have lived these last few years lost, alone, and sad. I’ve been to therapist and psychologist and take the pills to prove it. It has, but really hasn’t helped. I don’t have actual support though. Facebook doesn’t count. It’s nice to hear from people, but a hug, a drink around a campfire, or just talking shit with a couple friends goes much further. I have gone without that since day one and I can’t keep doing it that way.

To my ex:
 
Patty,
You were and always will be my only true love. Whether or not it truly ended because of money issues, it just did. I did everything to make you happy and secure, but I must not have done enough. I’ve missed you everyday since. I cry in the morning when I wake and the minutes before bed, According to the love songs and sayings, my love for you should also mean that you’re happy and secure even with another, which now you are. You no longer have my name. I am no longer in your thought, other than the bitterness that I am not living up to what you consider a father should be after a divorce. I’m not like Bruce Willis is, I can’t be an old friend to you and just hang with you and your new husband. The way you left totally ended that chance.
I keep thinking there’s something in your heart for me. Four children and all the years together, there just has to be some emotion there.  Yet, you never allowed for a talk, second thought, counselling, or even a cry together leaving me to wonder if you ever were in love with me.  This was our first real test of our marriage and you completely wrote me off. You could have talked to me, I would have listened. I would have stopped the world from spinning for you.
Yes, I know that it’s almost been 3 years, and like you said, my problems now are mine, but this whole experience, hurt, and loss has fundamentally changed everything in me. My mind doesn’t work like it did, I can no longer hold any feelings in. My health has changed because of the deep depression I was and still am in. I physically hurt having and returning the boys on their visits from the loss of our family. I just wish you would give me sometime to just sit with me and offer an apology and try to release me from this guilt I feel for essentially you actions and choices.

71,https://www.opendiary.com/m/newt316/how-would-you-know-6065362/,2021-11-15,How would you know,"
I find it so funny that people, mostly women, do not understand or empathize with what the broken up with person is feeling. No, not the simple we’ve dated for a bit type of break. I’m saying the years long, marriage with kids and living a way of life break.
She says, “it’s been almost 3 years, any feelings or issues are yours and not my fault.” Yes, the same woman who secretly planned her leaving, had the next relationship in the chamber, and blew your head off in a day. She never missed a beat of life, still has the house, the kids, the stuff, and a new guy to fill your role. You’re left with bills and debts so she can have a fresh start after turning the blame on to you. She and his words telling everyone that used to be in your world, how you destroyed the marriage and deflecting the accusations of home breaker and home wrecker.
She has never been on the receiving end of a break up, but knows how long someone should grieve and exactly when the other is to stop being blamed.  Funny thing is you also notice other’s who never have never heard those words, “we’re through”, they also know the proper times too. Not only did they and she not support you or care that you had a mental break because this all came on the heals of your Mother’s death, after years of dementia, that unfortunately turned your memories of your past into the last few years of being physically, mentally, and emotionally destroyed by the one person who unconditionally loved you, but had no control over herself anymore. Also the senseless death of your daughter from a first marriage, that you faced alone because she just never got along with her.
I have learned to hate the saying, “walk a mile in their shoes”.  I am supposed to be happy for her because love dictates, that she should be happy with someone else then miserable with you. This whole time the only person who seemed to understand, is the one I pay every week to listen and then just in the 45 minutes I am given. I have been pulling myself out and sliding back into the dirty hole my life has become, all the while having people wonder as they just stand around it “Why I am so muddy and tired.”
"
72,https://www.opendiary.com/m/newt316/ive-reached-the-point-6066195/,2021-11-16,I’ve reached the point…,"
I over share on Facebook. For some reason I think someone will finally understand. They don’t or won’t or couldn’t give 2 shits.
You see, I’ve “humpty dumptied” myself. Since I turned 18 in 1989, I have, I must have, secretly sabotaged everything in my life. My relationships, my jobs, my self worth, everything. I have fallen so much off that wall, that there are missing pieces, important pieces, lost for good. I don’t understand why when my relationships end with lovers, friends and family, that they burn the forest down and salt the Earth between us, but it has to be me.
Let’s face it, you people who read this and all the faceless FB friends don’t know me and have no reason to believe me when I say I really do not believe I did anything irredeemable in all the losses. I never cheated, I never raised a hand to anyone, I did my part in each of the relationships and I never asked or demanded anything from any of them. Maybe that’s it? Maybe being the person that everyone says they want or needs is what I did wrong. My 2 ex wives, I couldn’t have loved them more, but they still immediately left me for another and never showed remorse. My friends, both of whom I sat with when life crashed around them, built up when the weight of the world was too much, and laughed and cried with, have been nowhere to be seen these last 3 years when I needed them the most. My brothers never ever gave a shit which I can respect the fact they stuck to it, but my sister, who I sat holding when she wept for her 1st husband who died from cancer and who I threw my, at the time, 5′ 9″ 130lb body at the 6′ 4″ 225lb dumbass guy who hurt her to defend her honor and feelings, never once said a thing, offered a hug or shoulder to cry on, and then threw me under the bus with my ex to get unlimited access to her nephews.
Why?
I’ve paid approximately over $5000 to therapists and psychologists for them not to give me answers, but to challenge me to understand the questions. Oh, I was told I have Borderline Personality Disorder, which when I have tried to explain that to anyone comes off as the lamest excuse in the world, so I guess 5 grand well spent?
I truly believe the people I have made my circle for the 50 years of my life, besides my parents God rest their souls, wouldn’t piss on me if I were on fire. In the exact 2 years, 9 months, and 21 days that my marriage came to an abrupt ending, I have received zero, zip, nada calls about how I feel, how I’m doing, or even an invite. Two Thanksgivings, Christmases, New Years, Birthdays, all alone, no cards, calls, or visits. My children are young, I don’t expect them too remember or even think about Dad on these days, obviously they are not encouraged to anyway.
Make new friends and relations you say? Well I have tried. I say hello to people who reply with a sour looks and silence. I tried to make friends with a neighbor, who became obsessed with my dog only to call me and tell anyone who will listen how I killed the dog when I rehomed her. I met a nice girl on a dating site, who has a terminal illness and could possibly die in her sleep at any time and she wants to take “time” to get to know me, so we haven’t met yet after 3 weeks of talking, texting, and video chatting.
I’ve spent a long time thinking of suicide. The how’s and why’s of just ending it, knowing that when I am eventually found it will be one of those news stories,
” Well, he was always quiet, but then I noticed a smell”.
 The ultimate reason I haven’t, I would screw it up. I would literally be dead from the neck down, with full brain activity, but not being able to talk. I would go on to live to well over 100 yrs old, just stuck in my head.
I’ve almost reached the point that it doesn’t sound half bad…

So, let’s just admit that I’ve been a wee bit “poor me” lately. I should have every reason to be filled with hate and venom, but it just wraps around and good times POP in.. Enuf of that!!!!  * Yes, I meant to spell it wrong spelling Nazis…. 😝
 
ANY HOO..  Dreams.
Last night I had one of the most vivid dreams I can remember having in a long time. Sure I have had the ones where you wake up and have that several second thought about way it did or didn’t suck, but nothing like this. So, I hope it doesn’t mean anything is going to happen to me, I’ve been through enough. * See I do know how to spell it
 
I was at my grandmother’s house, exactly how I remembered it right down to the smell of Newports and whatever Avon perfume she wore. It must have been around the time I was 10 or 11, she still had the little black and white on the creaky metal tv stand. Of course she was in the middle of crocheting something with said Newport hanging from her mouth with the longest ash on it that for some reason only women of a certain age, who smoke, could have. I swear, when I used to smoke the ashes would instantly be all over my shirt or flying into my eyes, but old woman could flail their arms and the damn ash never fell off..
My uncle Bob was there too. A man whose hair fashion I unfortunately inherited, yet he was a snowbird living in Arizona half the year and the constant tan the man had made the baldness all the better for him. Now he always smelt of Camels and Aqua Velva and sure enough I could smell that in the dream also. Honestly I remember that cigarettes didn’t really put off that horrible of smell then, maybe because they were the brand kind and not what passes as cigarettes, well affordable cigs, today.
My Nani, as my siblings and I called her, which I recently learned is what Indians, from India, call their maternal grandmother, so being that my Nani was totally of German decent, make me wonder how she was saddled with the name, had decorated for Christmas. The front sitting room of her house covered top to bottom with holiday cheer. She really knew how to decorate a tree.
Neither of them talked, but acknowledged me with smiles, as I stood in the living room. I made my way out through the dinning room/kitchen to go to the little side room, that was used as a bedroom for whoever was lucky enough to be able to spend the night, and laid down on the small single bed. The smell of the room, it was always pleasant and comforting. The feel of the crocheted top blanket underneath me and knowing that the quilt underneath was the most comfortable bedding you could ever have, made me wake to tears.
I’ve cried a lot, A LOT, over the last few years, but never from happiness. I thought by the afternoon, the dream would have faded from my mind and the memories of a much, much simpler time of my life would turn from the happiness I had waken with, to a sadness and longing to go back, but it didn’t. I want to hold onto this feeling, even though I know that the present will still be filled with more and more crap and the holidays will be spent alone.

Well my noodle’s full of dumb thoughts again. Need to get them out somehow…
 
Taylor Dayne’s “Love will lead you back” just played and I realized that the sentiment expressed in the song is, well, BULL SHIT. Well maybe just for me that is. I have 4 kids with my ex, who still lives in my family’s home that I grew up in, and is surrounded by pictures of my parents, but she acts as though she’s never knew me and we’ve never were married..
 
All I want now is to finally be understood. Is that asking for too much? Especially from the “best” friends I’ve known for 30+ years, my own sister, and yes even the ex. I don’t want them to help or even try to fix things anymore. They have all shown, from day one, they couldn’t give a flying f#$%. Just to hear them say, “I understand what you’ve gone through” and hopefully mean it. Yet, none of them care or even believe what I’ve been through. Yes, why even look to them to understand? Why should it matter? Because I need it…
I’ve heard, until I want to just beat my head with a hammer, “you need to be happy with you” and “you need to make peace with yourself” among several other fortune cookie sayings that people who, let’s be honest, care as much as people who say, “if you ever need something” at funerals do. Well, knowing myself, I know I need other’s understanding. Sorry, that’s been me ever since I was a 5 year old neurotic. I’ve been told, since my wife ended our marriage, that I shouldn’t feel this or that and I should do this or that, but never heard the words “I understand” come from any of them. Don’t get me wrong, I have heard it from others, but never from the one’s I held close to me. So when I lost her, I lost all of them too.
Well I do know me. I know I can’t function on my own as good as other’s can. I’ve always known that. I know I rely on other’s opinions, help. and presence. I know I have no interest in hobbies nor have I ever. I know my brain runs a mile a minute and I know I can’t calm it and I never could. These are just the tip of what I know of me. I’m sorry, I truly believe that some people can’t just change that easily, not on their own anyways. Yes, cyber friends are great. I have several dozen faceless and bodiless friends. They all send me the fortune cookie quotes and the inspirational pictures. They “like” my funny things and send hugs for my rants. Then when their little green dot disappears, they are gone and I realize that I am still alone, haven’t had any real world human contact other than my kids, every other weekend. I haven’t gone to a party, sat at a campfire, or even had dinner with another adult for almost 3 years, that is unless I would pay them to, which I haven’t, yet..
 
Apparently, I am Facebook good looking. Several women, all of whom attached and miles away, have told me so. It almost helps me to keep my head held high, as the ladies I greet in public all seem to get sour faced and oblivious to me. Also, it gives me a false sense of confidence that is completely broken by the absolute horror shows I get “likes” from on the dating sites. So, yeah, add that to the fact that my ex left me for a man 20 yrs older than her, who in my opinion, smokes like a chimney and kind of looks like the ash tray he uses, I’m left feeling a bit on the self hating band wagon. Of course, I’m learning that the more money you have and can give, the uglier and older you can be. So I guess I’m going to die alone. Hopefully sooner than later..

“Hello, my name is Colby, and I am an overdramatic idiot”
For three years I have looked, asked, and waited for answers to a question that really doesn’t have one. A question that is wrapped up in fate, karma, and the whims of God. I’m sure I am not the first person to have the question, nor will I be the last, but it has winded it’s way into almost every facet of my life.
It sabotages every happiness I managed to find and stops me looking for more.
It has made me hate myself and assume others do too.
It has caused me to hold grudges harder and deeper than ever before.
It makes me blind to what love is left in my life.
It exacerbates my depression and anxiety, when it was all but gone with therapy and medication.
It keeps me from sleeping and waking.
The question has made me alone, bitter, lost, and hopeless.  I am scared of the the answer, because it may be one of the ones I have made up in my mind and it will justify all the hate I have put on myself for years. I honestly cannot forgive myself for the things that I never did.

This will be the 3rd Thanksgiving I will spend alone. The kids will be at my sister’s for a “family” Thanksgiving that for some unknown reason, I’ve never been invited to. My guess? My ex and her new husband will also be there. Maybe I am right, maybe I am wrong, but I do know that either way, I am not wanted there.
“Have you asked why? Have you just showed up?”
Yes, I have asked and have never been answered. Why just show up and have a scene with my kids there. You see way back when this all started I was told to be civil. I was told not to bring the kids into things and not to “break down” in front of them. Both of which fell out the door as soon as I agreed to give my ex space to think. She immediately brought in the new guy and went to town telling anyone and everyone how I walked out on the family. Before I knew it, people didn’t want to hear or believe my side of things.
Oh, I’ve heard all the “explanations”, she is so guilty so she had to make you the bad guy. She got in over head so it was easier to keep it up than admit a mistake… Yada Yada…
It is what it is. Just preparing me for another Christmas alone too.

They say that if you experience and sense something enough you become numb to it. Violence in movies and country smell to farmers, even those that live by the railroad stop really hearing the trains pass. Well this is me and betrayal. I have been lied to, cheated on, and left so many times that it’s all seeming to be common place to me. Oh, I still question why about things, but I’m getting used to thinking it’s just my lot in life to have these things happen to me. I fully believe in the Gods and Clods argument. Some people are just going to come out winning no matter what and the others will suffer for them no matter what.
Both of my ex wives have moved on to “better” lives while leaving me picking up the pieces of the mess they both helped to create. Any pains they may have afterwards I share, any victories are thrown in my face as though I could never have given them to either one. Their problems are all because me, whether they’re financial, emotional, or even physical, they were caused by something I had or have done. Their new husbands and boyfriends can literally smack the shit out of them, some have, and they come no where near the terrible things I somehow did to them.
Maybe it is my fault. Maybe I am way out of my league with my ex’s. I still think of them as beautiful women, who could pick and choose any man they want.  Now I may not win the “Best Looking Man” award, but I definitely land in that higher average spot, in my mind anyway. I shower, I have my teeth that aren’t black or brown with cavities, and I make an effort in how I dress. Yet, based on the “likes” I receive on a number of dating sites, I am extremely attractive to meth heads, crack addicts, and women who have spent one to many years in the bottle. Never once approached by the pretty one’s who wax poetically about how it’s not about looks and where are the “good” guys, the honest ones, the loyal ones..
Guess I am a firmly entrenched Clod.

I have been debating all night about sending this to both my ex and sister, but it will only fall on deaf ears. That said I need to get it out of my brain.
 
I’m tired of trying. It has made me sick how you both have left me to suffer as I have. I can’t believe the woman I loved more than life itself has sold me and our family out for money, which because you have repeatedly refused to even talk to me since the separation, I have to assume is the only reason. I also can’t believe the only woman left in my life since day one has made my trauma about herself and her needs. When I needed a shoulder and reassurance you left in a ditch and reprimanded me about some totally made up advice about how I should have done things in my life up to now.
You both say it’s about the boys now. You’re right, but my wellbeing is tied to how I am to and for the boys. You have changed in the matter of hours and that left confused, alone, and broken. You both guilted me for feeling and hurting, neither of you were feeling that way so how dare I feel like that. You took my normal, my dreams, and essentially my past by acting and talking like it never happened. You both tell and guilt me about being a father when neither of you are one and you both contributed to my overall breakdown.
Now, because it’s been a couple of years and one of you are remarried and the other has “washed their hands of me”, treat me like I should be over something that has never made sense to me. It’s like you both watched me drown and when I have finally washed up on shore, you stand over me yelling at me for faking my death. You both play on my Borderline Personality Disorder with the guilt and the blame knowing that it’s a very hard thing to keep myself level about the realization that none of this is my fault. I wasn’t the lying, cheating, money whore nor was I the selfish, self-centered, know it all, but somehow you both have turned all of this on to me so you can move forward as if I was just a sleight annoyance to both of your lives.

I haven’t been able to get centered. I’ve tried all the learned exercises and even unconventional ones, but I can’t shake the overwhelming dread I have. Bills, money, loneliness, the holiday by myself, again. Three years ago was the last “family” Christmas before she and he took them away from me. The kids excitement, the family breakfast when everyone came over, holding the love of my life as we watched the kids run and play. Two years have come and gone alone. No celebrating, no decorations, and a visit with my kids who are going through Christmas burn out on the 26th. No calls or visits by friends or family, just a sad ride to and from my old home with my kids afterwards.
I know they say it takes more strength to not commit suicide than to do it, but I sit here with the twist thoughts of what tomorrow will bring and I just give in to the idea and live in the pain. Sure the therapy helps, while you are sitting across from the therapist. I want to enjoy the season, but it’s not set up to be one for a heartbroken depressed person. There are no reassuring songs or stories. Hell, even Scrooge has people trying to be supportive to him, something I can say without a doubt I don’t. I don’t want a pity invite either, that’s never been who I was. honestly the way these last few years have gone, I don’t really think I have any friends or family that would give me an invite anyway.
I sit around thinking of everyone from my ex to the sad old guy in the apartment way across the complex. I don’t think anyone spends a second on me.

* I figured me and those of you who read my endlessly depressing posts could use a break *
I have been playing around with Ancestry.com on and off for several years now. I’m obviously no expert and can never afford one, but I think I have done the best I could with other’s trees and advice. I’m a Newton and a Smith. The Newton part has been surprisingly easy. Interestingly enough the area I grew up is very tied to the Newton name, but these days you would never know that. My father’s direct bloodline was in the area essentially from the time they opened the WNY area for settlers and may have been one of the first families to be here.
Most of the Newton side settled in Massachusetts from the 1600’s. Now I don’t think they were mixed into the pilgrims on the Mayflower, but close. Richard Newton was an original settler of Sudbury Massachusetts, so about 1637 he arrived in the “New World”. Now his father Sir Robert Isaac Newton was the Grandfather of Isaac Newton, Yeah, that one…  Anyway, Richard eventually settled in what would become Marlborough Mass. He was obviously busy having fathered around 18 kids, one being my line’s John Newton. A couple more generations and shit ton of kids later my Great Great Great Grandpa Philo came to Hanover NY around 1820 and essentially littered the county and surrounding one’s with more Newtons. It was tricky, but my Grandfather somehow got his boy after having 3 girls and giving up for several years. Much as I did with 2 of mine, he must have been to cheap to buy my Grandma anything for Valentine’s day and 9 months later there was my Dad… I’m proud to say the line will live on for at least one more generation with my 4 boys..
The Newtons fought in the Revolution, Indian wars, and Civil Wars.. One even fought for the confederacy although he was northern, have to work on what that’s all about later.. I learned my great Uncle may have been somewhat of a two timer having kids with two separate women, but dates are a bit fuzzy.. Most of ol’ uncle Arthur’s Boys apparently stay away from the marriage raising kids thing, but after a certain year Ancestry doesn’t give out records and you have to hope some distant cousin is also doing the family tree stuff. Needless to say, my Dad’s 3 sisters weren’t too into the birthing babies stuff and short of 2 of their daughters there wasn’t any kids on that limb, just a couple cousins of which I know maybe 3 of.
The Smith side of Mom, well I got to my Great Grandfather and that’s it. Have you ever looked for a person named Smith before the 1900’s in the South?
Hmm. Maybe I will do a regular entry here and there about the generations of crazy that has made me the mess I am today. Also if you know of someone who does this as a living or a Newton that lives in the general vicinity of New England, send them my way and maybe we can work on my family bonsai…

81,https://www.opendiary.com/m/newt316/back-to-the-ol-grindstone-2-6073500/,2021-12-09,Back to the ol’ grindstone,"
Well I did it. I finally wrote the text to the ex and my sister.
A little back ground, my ex has been the worst, not about the kids or anything, but the total 180 she has done. Now before I get the usual ex stories, this is totally a personal thing. When you’re with a person throughout years of some very traumatic shit like we were (deaths, accidents, and such) to end things in a blindsided way without even an explanation is just fucked. My sister, well since day one has made this all about her and how it effects her life, no once offering a shoulder to cry on or a hug or a kind word or visit. I still remember how she once said that I was making my divorce “all about yourself.” OH, and how my brother in law literally threatening me to stop talking to her, because she didn’t need anymore grief then what she already had…
Well the few times I have been able to communicate with her was always meant with the “if it’s not about the kids, then don’t contact me or I will have you arrested for harassment.” I KNOW, really. I wasn’t texting and calling 24/7 every minute, but I had my low points where I thought the old her could be reasoned with, sue me..
Anyway, I was supposed to take my one son last weekend. I sent a text asking if there was anything going on, he’s the active one with clubs and such… No answer. I talked with my oldest and he told me their Aunt, my sister, had plans for him. A slight anger grew, but the boys always get spoiled so, I kind of let it go. Sunday rolls and around and I find out their Aunt never showed to Sunday afternoon, I would have him home by then, so whole wasted weekend where I sat around depressed and lonely wishing my marriage didn’t end and dwelling on another alone Christmas.
Needless to say this “snapped” my common sense so I drafted the text to end all text and sent it as a group message to them both so they would see the shit I go through because of the both of them and ask I expected, nothing. Not even a hate answer but, I know they both received it and I have a little less weight hanging on me. It’s not like I haven’t lost them in my life already….

We were supposed to be together forever. We lived that way, very few disagreements or fights, common interests, no jealousy, and four great kids and family. Why did it end?
I know most of my entries are the same thing, just wrote in different ways. I just can’t seem to find enough distractions to “stop the thoughts”. Covid has ruined the bar scene, groups now gather online (which doesn’t help without a decent webcam) and the general just going to the mall is now an annoying, mask wearing, dirty looks and asshole people experience.
I live in a 3 room apartment that I can’t do “projects” in or remodel. I used to have my own home, with my own workshop and my own tools. Now some other guy has all that. I had a kitchen with almost every gadget or gizmo you would need, now I have a couple pots and a microwave. I had 24 hour access to my sons, where now I see them essentially 1 1/2 days. I had a partner who I never ran out of things to talk to about and enjoyed every second of the day with and now I am painfully alone. My friends and close family have abandoned me, for reasons I have no answers for. Messages and letters go unanswered. Making new friends or dating in the “Covid” world, especially in a more liberal area, is not happening  and I’m way to bitter with it to join a church.
I know and have met a lot of people over the 3 years since the end who would trade places with me in a heartbeat. A new start, no strings, less responsibilities, and “freedom”…  I never wanted this and to me it has been shear torture. Although I think of suicide, I won’t, if for any other reason than knowing that some how I would screw it up. Being 50, bald, and slightly over-weight doesn’t help. I am working on the weight thing, but when you lose weight quickly at 50, it sometimes makes you look worse.. The “likes” I receive on dating sites are soul killing. Maybe I am narcissistic, but I always managed to get a fairly plain pretty girl most of my dating life. Couple that with the fact that my ex left me for a man I believe is worse looking, more out shape, and 20 years her senior, is a huge blow to what shred of confidence I have left.
99% of the people who assure me that the “right” one will come to me are either married or in a relationship. I used to be one of them too. Always telling the sad lost souls that there is someone for everyone as I held the hand of my wife. 99% of people who say, “learn to love yourself” have semi perfect lives, with friends, family, and comforts. I used to be one of them too. But you know what, 99% of people are there for me in just words on Facebook or places like this and become mysteriously unavailable offline when I ask to meet for coffee, drinks, dinner, or even to watch sports, none of which with any other thoughts than just hanging out. I do realize that all of you live throughout the world, it wasn’t a dig.
I feel worthless, less then, and unwanted. I’m middle aged, with a brain and temperament of a teenager. I believe I have failed at life, at being a father, brother, son, and husband. I have no real retirement, home anymore, possessions like I used to, and savings. A real catch for a single, bitter, and divorced woman my age, you think, nowhere near being a sugar-daddy for anyone younger, and nothing but an anchor to any older ladies.  Maybe I should just lower my standards if I don’t want to be alone and maybe I just used up all the luck, karma, or fate I had needlessly the last 50 years.

For most of my life Christmas has been about family. The first 18 the family I grew up with and the next 30 the family I made. Since 2019 I have had to do this on my own and I haven’t.  No tree, no decoration, no music. Sure my boys come over for a couple hours and I give them gifts, but it’s become just another day.
How does a person who has lost his faith, trust in people, and only real anchor to life move on? All the things that have made me who I am are gone from my life. My kids remain, but have shown me they can go on without me as a regular part of their lives. Does that sound cruel? IDK. All I know is they took to their Mom’s eventual new husband as quickly as she did. They never questioned or misbehaved. You must know he was thrust into their lives hours after I left her so she could have “time”
So here I am on Christmas day. Phone hasn’t rang, no texts, or Facebook messages. My crime? Loving and trusting too much. I want to find something to believe in, something that will make everything make sense. I’m done with religion. I have put my faith into it for all my life. My daughters dead, I’ve lost 2 marriages, I’ve never been able to properly raise my children, my last 3 years with the most important person in my life, my mother, was spent with her drowning in dementia and physically and mentally abusing me as I tried to help. I know it was her sickness, but when you’re dealing with BPD it takes a toll. One year later after her death my ex, out of nowhere, ends our marriage.
When I lost her, I lost somehow lost everything and almost everyone.  The few left keep me at a distance. New people don’t seem to accept me. I have never been this alone.
So today is Christmas again. I’ve watched out my window as neighbors in the complex receive visitors. I’ve heard the loving shouts of “Merry Christmas” several times like a knife to my soul.
I hate that I still care. I want to just shut the world out, but it won’t let me.
I hope all of yours Christmas day are filled with love and laughter and for others that fill as I do, we have to muddle through. Tomorrow is the 26th and the year long dream of not being alone may just be our Christmas future.

I’ve never been one to understand limits. I would literally lose my arm before I admit fire burns. That’s how I’ve taken my divorce. I can’t admit to myself it’s over with my ex. Hell, it was over for everyone but me a week after separating with her.
This past weekend was a rough time. For some reason rougher than the last few Christmas alone. Maybe I have come to the burnt nub stage of understanding.
I just don’t want to give up, but I’m fighting for the impossible.

I’m just putting thus out. I’m not in distress, not looking for help or even thinking of hurting myself.
I really have to laugh about the state of my depression. All over the TV, internet, and even tacked to local message boards in the store are the “if you feel sad or suicidal call or text someone” signs. I have in the past and you know what, no one helped. Not friends or family. I remember once in a particular low point I mentioned hurting myself to a family member, who decided not to make the 5 mile journey to my apartment to see me or talk to me, but to call for a welfare check by the police instead.
And that’s how my family and friends have dealt with my sadness and loss these last few years. No one willing to “dirty” their hands. There was a family Christmas on Saturday at my sister’s home, one that I was not invited to, but my ex and her new husband and my boys were. I was told that for the boy’s sake, she (my sister) wanted to keep the “family” aspect. This has been the case for the moment my ex left me 3 years ago. Oh, I did get a plate of cookies in the mail, so it’s all 👍
I know what those wrongfully accused people feel as they sit in jail. No one seems to want to believe them, just going on the story and not the facts. I’m the victim in this, I was cheated on, forced out, and broken, yet everyone treats me as if I wanted all this.
I can’t meet someone new, because they all think I haven’t moved on, but I have, it’s just to explain how I’ve come to this spot in my life the story has to be told and that’s the story. I personally think it’s a “nice” way of saying “eww, no way do I want anything more than a friendship with you” instead of just saying so.
I don’t think my confidence has ever been trashed like these 3 years ever in my life. Here’s a good example, I connected with a girl from my past who, at the time, was living overseas. We talked and flirted, she told me she always had feelings for me and would jump at a chance to date or more. Things happened in her life and she found that she was moving back this way. I haven’t heard dick from her since she came back to the states. No answers to messages or call backs.
So, if you read this and ever find yourself attempting to cheat a depressed friend or stranger up, don’t fucking lie. Don’t say stuff you don’t mean. We want truth, not something that we make a possibility or something to look forward to that goes tits up in an already disappointed time of our life.

Part of my divorce settlement was that I was to pay child support and my ex was supposed to give me 10k for my part of the home we had. Now my half would have been 35k, but being the push over I am, I agreed to walk away from the 25k for the kids needs and home fixing.
Needless to say, I have been working poor since day 1. I also took on our debts also. I left 20k in debt and she left with 2 incomes, a mortgage free home and a fresh start. So here is situation…
I haven’t been able to be consistent with the child support. There is qnd has been weeks where I just didn’t have money left. She has never made the effort to give me what she agreed on, which in all honesty would have given me a fresh start to build on and I could have been on top of everything.  Well in her “world” she doesn’t owe me anything because of the lack of support eventhough she kept over 25k that should have been given to me.
So, am I once again the bad guy? People have all sided with her saying the support is for the kids. Yet WTF is she doing with the money I left on the table, well besides the trips, vacations, new household items and her “wedding to the new guy”.
Yet again I sound like a victim, but really, I was the loser in all of this. My life was totally changed. 30 years of living, dreams, blood, sweat, and tears erased in less than a day. No, I can’t afford a lawyer, see above for the answer.

As my other entry today shows, I have been an easy mark for other’s transgressions.
SIMP
a word that everyone overuses w/out the correct definition. it means a guy that is overly desperate for women, especially if she is a bad person, or has expressed her disinterest in him whom which he continues to obsess over.
Except, In my life it’s not just women. It’s friends, family, and strangers. Kind of always been that way to. I’ve been runover so much in life I can be considered black top. As much as I try to change, it keeps coming back to it. I don’t know if I was raised in a way that my guilt is such that I can’t be selfish or if a youth spent in the church made me care more for others than myself. I find myself at age 50 with nothing to show for 50 years of living, well not entirely I have 4 boys who I love, but seem to have rolled with the punches and act as though I am just a special treat once in awhile. I have lost a child, 2 failed marriages, life-long friends who just left me dangling, both parents, and my siblings won’t talk to me. The divorce 3 years ago left me penniless, broken, homeless, and with just the clothes on my back.
And I took it like a Simp would.
Several attempts to meet someone or date someone have fallen apart as soon as they learned my lot in life. Don’t have the money to be a sugar daddy or the life that is together for anyone my age. I fall for stuff like this; I have a friend, a female friend from back in high school. At the time, not so long ago she was living overseas and also going through a divorce. Unlike me, she had me to talk to, cheer up, and lend a shoulder. She would tell me how she always had a crush on me and would jump at a chance of reconnecting. Well apparently that was said, because she obviously never thought she would step foot in the States again. Her divorce finalized and unfortunately she moved home. I haven’t heard from her since. You see, people care for me when they know they will never run into me. The online faceless people like Facebook or even Open diary, no offence, have always told me how important I am, how attractive I am, and how much they would love to sit down or go out with me. That is until the reality of it happens. Several times in the last 3 years of my “breakdown” I’ve heard those sentiments only to learn these people where nearby for one reason or another and made absolutely no effort to contact me, yet plastered all over their socials are them at the bar or a party with the other “concerned”  people.
So, how do I shut it off? The concern and caring I don’t receive in return. The few times in my life I was in the least bit selfish, I was called out in such a way that most people would bury their heads in the sand like an ostrich.  Yet, it’s always been totally fine to leave me standing with my d$%^ in my hand as they run me over. If I’m going to change to be “that” person, I better learn to be totally on my own from here on out…

I’ve learned that my faceless friends on the internet who have never met me are more friends to me than the ones that are actually down the road. I think the only Holiday greeting I received over the last couple weeks came from an older lady who was essentially cornered at the store by me and couldn’t get by me fast enough.
I’ve reached a point where I can no longer take people at their word. Not “friends” or family. I don’t remember how many times I heard the line “If I was there or closer, I would defiantly meet up for drinks or dinner” only to learn they were and they didn’t. I’m not stupid, I know their words are the same as the comforting words one gives at a funeral. “If you need anything, I mean anything, just call me”  No one really means it, everyone just says it.
Who am I to call them out? Their Facebooks and Instagram’s do it for them. There they stand with several friends at the local bar in my hometown commenting on how great it is seeing old friends and family, yet they tell me they were just so busy they never found a moments peace. I guess the fact they try to lie to save my feelings is something.  Between you and me though, I would rather have a harsh truth than a kind lie. Kind lies have ruined my life over the last 3 years.
“I won’t bring him around the kids”
“I just need some time”
“We can do counselling”
 “I want us to have joint custody”
“I’ll be there for you”
“I’ll call you when I get home”
“I love you”
So many kind lies…

I woke up today like most, thinking this a new year, a new opportunity. That lasted about 5 minutes. I checked my texts, nothing, my messages, nothing. The realization of the last 3 years decended on me. Two weeks from now would be the day, 3 years ago my ex broke me and everyone else sat by and gave zero f#$%s about it.
How long does grief last? Why isn’t all the things I’ve done not helping? Although I am writing this, I’m talked out. I never got answers and have come to the conclusion I never will. I am alone, that seems to be how it’s going to be for me. I’ve tried to meet people, but apperantly I’m not good enough, nice looking, or well off enough. I don’t want to be alone.
Why do women ask for a “good” guy, but apperantly all the years I have been the good man has left me here, no family, no friends, being hopelessly in love with a woman who wouldn’t piss on me if I was on fire and has never told me why, eventhough there never seemed to be any problems for the 20+ years we were together.
You know what, fuck it, i’ll leave what i wrote because I spent time to, but this isn’t helping. I’ve never been anyone’s love or hero. Everyone has shown me I don’t matter in their lives. I don’t matter in mine either. Sorry guys, but I give up.

It’s been a battle with my grief, depression, and loss about my failed marriage(s) and families. To those of you who have followed my rants since the beginning and the newer people, I was first married way back in 1989 right out of high school. I was raised in the church, Lutheran, and when I got my girlfriend pregnant, I thought I was doing the right moral thing by marrying her. It was the best 5 months, until it wasn’t. We had a beautiful daughter, Kayla, and I was everything I thought I should be. A version of the man who raised me, but that wasn’t enough to keep my ex happy. Boy, she did a number on my confidence and my self worth. I was young though and the “bounce back” wasn’t too hard. I was still in shape, had a full head of hair (finally found the best haircut) and the support I had was awesome.
Ten years later I met Patty, my 2nd wife. OMG, she was short, curves in all the right places, exotic beauty (she is half Thai), dark hair, and brown eyes that melted my soul. I was smitten from day one. There was a slight age difference, she was 10 years younger, 18, but because of how she was raised well mature than most her age. We flourished and even with the tons of outside objections and difficulties that her friends would cause, we had no problems what so ever. We eventually bought a house and the kids started “popping” up. We married in 2006, having been together 7 years. It wasn’t a big thing. Justice of the peace, a couple people, no pictures, no honeymoon just a very nice dinner at Hideaway Bay restaurant, but that was us. There wasn’t money for rings, but we didn’t need them. There years went on, essentially problem free, other than the typical marriage with kids stuff. Getting slightly behind on bills, losing a job or two due to unforeseen circumstances, and having to let a car be repo’d. It was that or let our kids starve and be homeless. We took it all in stride. In 2015, my mother was slowly falling into dementia and asked us to move in with her, she would gift the house I grew up in. This would also be a great time for our children to really get to know her before to late. Still no problems. We never fought, we approached our relationship as two separate people making one life and not two people trying to be one person. She didn’t need to be up my ass about my friends and I wasn’t up hers.
Maybe I should have been.
She had worked at a local hardware store since we moved into our first house in 2001, for a majority of that time she worked with the same several people, until 2018 when they remodeled and hired new people. I don’t know if all the years of the flirting had finally caught up to her or all the years of men’s rotten habits of “sweet nothings” and “promises” that they would give her a so much better life than I did had finally took her love of me away. I’m sure there are several hundred things that could have happened.. She was so young when we got together, she never really had any other relationships, love fades, yada yada. I have had 3 very lonely years to think of each and every one so if you comment, please keep your theories to yourself. 2018, her new husband, was hired towards the end of October. She ended our marriage in January 2019. Less than 3 moths, she gave up a 20 year relationship that included 4 children, a family that from day one took her in as their daughter and sister, for a man 20years older than her, who had a few extra bucks, a shit past, and God knows what. He was brought into “our” life, our home, my childhood home, and my kids lives, hours after I grudgingly agreed to “give her space” with the promises of counselling and  answers. I guess I got some of those “answers”, but nothing else. I was told that they were engaged in March 2019 and the divorce was started in August, our anniversary month. She broke every promise she had ever made to me about the separation and she did everything that I had told her all the other girls did that hurt me over the years before her that she said she could never do to me. She remarried about 2 weeks after the divorce was final. She talks as though she never knew me, even when it comes down to memories of the kids. Four of the greatest few times of my life was being there watching my boys being born and mentioning them brings answers that sound as though we just bought them at Walmart.
So that was a long way for me to get at the title of this entry. For 3 years I have struggled to move past and on, yet in a blink of an eye I am gripped with grief of the loss of her and the “family” life I will probably never know again. Two times I have lost the one thing I always knew I wanted. Yes, I know that I still have children and I know the whole “what makes a family” thing, please also don’t say that in comments. 
The overwhelming loneliness comes out of nowhere and the heavy depression just weighs me down. It just hits from out of nowhere no matter what I have done over the last few years. I have a day where the present and future sun comes out from the clouds, but then in a blink I am pulled back down.

91,https://www.opendiary.com/m/newt316/me-too-old-6079981/,2022-01-07,ME?? Too old???,"
So, as I languish in dating app Hell, I “liked” a rather cute 39yr old lady. She was, according to her profile, rather short, had strikingly dark eyes(my weakness) and dark hair(yet another weakness). Reading through what she wrote, she was widowed and had a couple children. No issues what so ever for me. I crafted, what I thought was, a beautiful introduction message. I complimented her looks, without being weird or creepy. I acknowledged how it must have been hard being widowed and how strong she is getting through it. I told her I had no issues with her having children. I closed it with, “I would like to get to know more about you, if you would like to, over coffee, dinner, or even chatting on the app.” 
Well, I got an answer: “That was very sweet, thank you, but I am not interested.” 
I have to say that after close to a year that I have bumbled around on these sites and apps, I never got a reply from someone I wanted to meet, until now. Yet here it sat, “not interested”
First thought, I’m ugly, no one will ever want me and that’s why my ex left me. I’m an ugly person inside and out. Second thought, I poured over my profile, the best pics, my intro wasn’t desperate or creepy. I don’t smoke, anymore, and have lost enough weight to fit into the “average” column. Why? So, I asked…
“You’re too old and have kids. I don’t want kids and I have some.”
Is 10 years older, old? Are kids, that already have a Mother and are essentially aged out of the needy point, a problem? HUH?
That was all I got from her. Immediately, my bruised and piecemeal ego went to the stupid logistical part of my brain and heart combination. My 37yr old ex-wife left me for a 58yr old schulb, who also had older children, an ex, and was just, ugh… I mean left “head over heals” for gramps. Maybe it’s the typical male thing to think one’s self looks better than another guy or think of themselves as better, IDK.
All, I know is, it is just one more nail in the coffin for my self confidence. It doesn’t matter how I know I can treat someone or how I would care enough to jump in front of a truck for someone I care about. Like most ugly, old, and bald men, I find myself “fantasizing” about a certain person being with me and you see it in real life. The “hit with the ugly stick” guy with a really beautiful girl. I am not a firm believer in the “confidence” thing. There’s no way Chunk from the Goonies is going to be with Cindy Crawford because he’s funny and has tons of confidence. Really?
There is someone I met through Open Diary. Now, I admit that we have only occasionally commented on each’s entries, but we are essentially both single. I would move Heaven and Earth if she would just notice me and take an interest, but I’m realistic. I’m old and ugly and she is truly the most beautiful woman I have ever seen. There would be nothing stopping me from moving to where she lives to get to know her, but I am sure she hears hundreds of “me” types saying the same thing to her, some even very creepy and weird. Unfortunately, because of the creepy weird one’s, guys like me will unwillingly be put in to same group as them.
Things like that just happen to people like me now. I’m too old.

So, begrudgingly I have to admit my Open Diary friend, OpposingSimplicity, is somewhat right (Don’t let it go to your head…LOL)  and I do still suffer from what now is apparently wasted love for my ex and the life I had.
I have spent the last 3 years with a belief that she did what she did, not because of a loss for love of me, but the so-called “need for security and finances” thing that a lot of women say they cheated or left their significant other for.  I allowed my thinking to go to the “she doesn’t really love him for LOVE” just for the things he can give her that I couldn’t. Although in reality, he lives in what was my house, uses the tools I had to leave behind, and essentially up until 7 months ago, was driving a car that was in my name that was a victim in the divorce along with being married
You see, Patty, my ex, came into my life at a point where I was low in life, that is until now. My 1st ex had all about destroyed what youthful confidence I had. Patty was all I ever wanted in a partner and was right up until she wasn’t. Yeah, shoot me, I was to blindly in love with her and our family to spot or see any “chinks” in the armor. I love to explain my feelings in odd examples, always have.
 So imagine you’re one of those wind turbine repair guys and you get up there, hundreds of feet above the Earth. You are doing everything you should, but then the only way down is gone in a “blink”. You call out on your radio for help, for answers and you get nothing. Eventually the batteries die and that radio is useless and you are still stuck in that situation all alone on top of that turbine.  After the initial shock of what’s happened, you “help yourself” or at least try to, and somehow get to place up there you can attempt to jump over to the rung of the ladder on the side of the tower. You make the leap and miss the first, second, third rungs and finally catch the forth. The way down, you feel the strain all over from the effort you are making climbing down. Your hands are bleeding from the metal spurs on the rungs. 
Now, you have made it back to the ground and see familiar faces. You look around to the one who said they would never leave you up there alone and they are nowhere in sight. You ask the ones that are, “Didn’t you hear my calls?” They say they did, but didn’t know what to say in return and honestly, they had problems of their own. “Well I made it down, but I’m hurting and could still use some help,”  you say, standing there beaten and bloodied from the climb down. “Why? You’re down now, and really it’s been so long, no one cares.”
But to you, it still hurts, you’re still scared as F$%^. The time getting down still in your mind and the fact that you know that they knew you need help, but chose to ignore you, even though when they were stuck up there, you had moved Heaven and Earth to help and rescue them. You sit down to catch your breath for a second. When you stand to go home, you look around and find that without a single “goodbye” they have all left you there alone again without any way of getting to where you need to be other than walking, broken, beaten, bloody, and just so tired. All you want to do is lay down and die, but you keep thinking, “I have to be there if someone needs me.” So you limp your way back, people in the passing cars and trucks, some you recognize from the past, either blow right by you or slow down enough to say “HI” and “you can do it,” but when ask them for a ride, they say, “Oh, gee, sorry there’s just no room in the car,” as they roll up their window in the empty vehicle and speed away….
That’s how I feel. Occasionally on the road I look up at the roadside ad signs(Open Diary, FaceBook groups) and see the inspirational sayings. They’re nice, but don’t do anything for the injuries that could use some assistance and the shoulder to hold yourself up for maybe, a couple miles on the road. Just me and my thoughts, on a pitch black night limping down a pot holed road, hoping that the next corner will be the one I need, but knowing it really isn’t.
So Yeah, I hold onto the past. It seams a lot more “brighter” than the dark road I’ve been forced to walk even though I never did anything, but do the work like I should.
*** Yes, I am that much of a mess, but not to be unappreciative, I really could use a real world flesh and blood friend. Something I haven’t had in close to 3 years, literally it’s been that way except for the kid’s visits that are awesome, but always end with me having to see “home” and being miles away from ever getting there.***

93,https://www.opendiary.com/m/newt316/rejection-120-6080498/,2022-01-10,Rejection,"
* ok, please don’t psychoanalyze me. No “you’re not ready” or anything. I just need to say this and put it out there and seeing that I literally have no real world people to talk to, I only have this outlet….
Yesterday I hit the tri-fecta, grand slam, het trick of rejection. I’m starting to think the only way I am going to get a “real world” friend or relationship is to kidnap someone and hope they get Stockholm Syndrome. Let’s work the list:

My wife of 20 years, essentially leaves me and “no longer” loves or even cares for me in less than a day.
My actual siblings and life long friends just stop talking to me and over the last few years of me asking, begging, and apologizing, for some reason, have just cut me out of their lives.
I have failed to make new “real world” friends (actual people you can touch, have drinks with. Not you guys, you’re awesome!!)
I have been rejected, “ghosted”, or given the “no compatibility” brush off text by thin women, fat women, older ladies, younger ladies, women of different races, colors, and creeds and even a woman who has a serious health condition and was actively looking for someone to spend time with if these may be here last days on earth..

So, yesterday I finally met my latest “kick in the balls” for coffee. We had spent 2 weeks chatting and texting on a daily balance. We met on FB dating, she liked me first before I even noticed her. So she knew what I looked like and essentially who I am at a glance. Divorced, 50yrs old, 4 kids, looking for friend or long time relationship.
I will be the first to admit that when I started to reach out, for a new lady or friend, I over-shared. I broke all the rules about first impressions and freely admit I was not ready or even over the ex or the loss of everything, but as time passed, I broke the habit and have became “comfortable” and surrendered to the fact that the past was the past.
Back to the coffee date. She was even prettier than her pictures. No, I did not say that to her in any form, at all.. We met at a place of her choosing, so as to not be creepy or weird to her. I also didn’t say that. We both said the stuff about family, kids, and how life brought us to where we are today. I didn’t take over the conversation, allowed her to talk without interruptions, and I definitely did not over-share. She explained she was “born again” and how God and the church saved her. I answered that I believed and had fallen out of regularly going to church, but I was actively looking and thinking of finding a new one. Now, I personally don’t think it was what I said next that made the bottom fall out and she didn’t seemed at the least bothered by it.” I said I was raised Lutheran, LCA if that makes any difference to you Lutheran readers, and I was used to a traditional type of service. I also said that the newer types of services with bands and contemporary Christian music kind of makes me uncomfortable because I just haven’t been to enough of them, but I am sure that I could like to enjoy them. Again, she was smiling and answered that are very enjoyable. She told me that she lived a rough life up until her late 30’s and then God found her and “BING” it all changed. She is Wesleyan, not that makes a difference to me at all, and she has given her life over to God. This has and never will be an issue to me, but I admit and said that I wasn’t sure what the difference between Lutheran and Wesleyan was. I assume God is God, but honestly it’s been nothing but changing and rediscovery for me over the last 3 years and I am totally open to everything. I said that it all sounded great and would be nice to go with her to her church and eventually “converting” to it.
A half hour went by and she looked at her phone and said she had go, she only had someone to watch her son for a little bit, but it was great to meet and talk. I didn’t see any implications that I did or said anything wrong, but then again my ex was cheating and planning to destroy me under my nose and I also didn’t see or do anything either. Smiles were shared, hugs were given, and with waves we left. About 10-15 minutes I sent a quick text about how nice it was nice to finally meet. Like I said we have been talking for almost 2 weeks, so I didn’t think it was too soon to say that.
Then it came. The answer I have become so used to. “I don’t think we are compatible” and that’s where it was. I politely asked if so could maybe tell me why or what. Nothing. I didn’t blow up her phone if that’s your first thought. I haven’t texted or said anything since.
I guess this all bothers me because for the last 50 years I have always been a person who needs to understand the whys, hows, and whats. There was a time before my 1st ex destroyed my confidence, where I could read the room. There was also a time where it seemed I could do wrong and made friends and girlfriends at a snap of the finger. So, this all kind of leaves me feeling confused, ugly, depressed and lonely.
"
94,https://www.opendiary.com/m/newt316/hmmm-1658-6081454/,2022-01-13,Hmmm,"
I deleted my Facebook and Messenger accounts last week and guess what, I don’t mind being ignored by everyone who have ignored me for most of the time I was on them. I gave out my number and email address to people I thought cared and as of yet, have not received any well wishes. So, I guess if I really wanted to I could pack a moving truck and go lose myself somewhere else in America and no one would notice.
Oh what dream. If I only had the experience and skills that could land me a decent paying job or the knowledge to be a hermit and live off the land and live out of my truck.
After the latest, “thanks but, no thanks” dating experience, I’ve come to the realization that my “committed” life is over and essentially after the next 12 years are over all I can hope for is holiday visits from my kids. As of now, it seems as though the 700+ year run of my Newton line will die with them, because they do not seem interested in having a family of their own. Not after watching their Mother selfishly destroy their Father, who never showed them or her one once of dishonesty or malice, and basically piss on the graves of their Grandparents and Sister for nothing more than money. Why would ever trust a woman or man after what see did. Yes, I know that sounds dramatic, but I beg you to understand that my “family” was raised on happiness, trust, and morals that apparently can be just “gone” in a blink of an eye without the slightest of reason or rhyme.
So that’s where I am at. Any dream, hope, and plan I may have made in the past is dead. Now all I dream, hope, and plan for is how to survive after I lost everything at this point of my life and how I’m going to survive after 20 years when I hit 70. Retirement saving are all but gone to a woman who will share it with another man who was essentially given my life I built for 30 years that doesn’t deserve it. The social security system will be destroyed by the government is about 5 years with the fucked up policies and “my dick is bigger than yours” actions by both parties. It’s really starting to look like I may have, at the most, 6 – 7 years left at this job before they close this place and where am I going to go without the skills the world needs.
It’s lovely to hear the stories about how people go back to school and get a new degree and find a new job at my age, but what’s not being explained is how they had savings to live on while they chased their “dream”. They have a wife or husband to support them through it all. No one in their “right mind” would just blindly walk into a student debt and an unsure future, giving up everything on a whim if they were dirt poor or extremely alone. That’s like taking advice about how to live alone from your attached friends or money advice from someone like Paris Hilton who could live without working a day in her life if she chose to.

*** Well, maybe not all of them are random to most of you who read my entries, but hey OD is the reason I do not have scars on my forehead from banging my head against the wall.***
 
I may have has an epiphany some time during the night. Not a “A-HA” one, more like a “well, I guess that’s it” one. To some this might sound like more of the usual “poor me” stuff I have been writing on OD since day one, but the whole insignificance I have to the world and people just calmly came over me. The only 4 people I matter to are my boys and that feels like they would just miss the random weekend getaway visits to Dad’s little hovel of an apartment. I used to believe I was loved, cherished, and mattered to a number of important people in my life. My 2 life-long friends who were more brothers to me than my actual brothers were. My sister who I was a constant shadow to for my first 10 years of my life and as close as a little brother big sister could ever be. My ex, who for the 20 years we were together appeared to love me as completely as I did her, unbreakable and faithful through sickness and the death of my parents and my daughter. Friends and acquaintances that I always met with cheerful and loving greetings and great memories. Random strangers in life that I could strike up conversations with. I don’t think I ever had hate from anyone.
Somehow that all ended almost exactly 3 years ago.
Thoughts of my marriage come to mind. How did I make her unhappy and lose her love for me? We lost our first home. Our first 2 boys were born and I was having difficulty keeping a job. I wasn’t lazy, I just worked jobs where free thinkers weren’t appreciated. I managed convenience stores and I fairly regularly “butted” heads with upper management  about my stores. You see, I spent 40 to 60 hours at my store. I learned who my customers were, their needs and wants, how they enjoyed being treated and so on. My employees were treated like family.I looked out for them and never asked of them anything I wasn’t willing to do myself. I even help a couple of them to overcome living on welfare and having a job and benefits. I worked with the venders on product deals and would reset my stores to be almost theft proof and profitable, taking money loosing locations and turning a profit within a years time. Unlike television show and movies though, results do not matter when you don’t follow the collage educated “business” people who have never worked in a C-store in their lives. If you don’t follow plan-o-grams or their “research” that says that widgets sell out in a city store so they should in the country. If you make them look bad to their bosses. I was fired twice because of I refused to sell, push products that essentially were like selling ice to eskimos, even though the locations were turning more than 25% more than budget profits and had regular awesome audits. I was forced out by being forced to take a demotion to a high crime store that should have been closed years ago and no it wasn’t a try to make it profitable opportunity, more like an invitation to be shot, robbed, or even stabbed like the last several clerks and managers thing. Between you and me, convenience stores are better run from the ground up then the top down and much like the armed forces, the Generals need to listen to the Sargents who fight in the trenches to better understand a battlefield.
Any way, we had some money issues, much like all relationships and marriages do in the beginning. We came through all that when the last 2 boys were born and at the time of the “end” of our marriage, we were living comfortable. She is still with her “new” husband, who walked into a life that was established while I lost everything I built, bleed, and busted my ass for over 20 years.  Then I lost the life long friends, because I didn’t just let it roll off me like dirt in a shower. My sister because it may have made her life difficult when it came to her time with her nephews. My acquaintances because the narrative was controlled by the ex and her “boyfriend” while I was still broken and completely out of my mind about it all.
SO, last night it finally all hit home that I am truly alone in this. The support I gave to all others, has and will never come to me and I can’t think that it will anymore. I have to live with the fact that I really don’t matter to people like other do. I left all social media, except for OD, a month ago. People have phone number, my email address, and even my physical address. I received no well wishes for Christmas or New Years. No sympathy messages on what would have been my daughter’s birthday in December and as of yet a simple “how are you” from anyone. I know at all a person has in this world is theirself and how you have to love yourself to be loved. All that stuff. I know my entries come off like I have absolutely no understanding or concepts of these things, but I do and I have worked to be at peace with both of them, yet the world keeps throwing crap at me like a pissed off monkey.
I’m not quite sure that last night I exhaled and made peace with my role in life and the lives of others, but I just feel like I no longer matter to anyone and I’m fine with it. I can live with the rejections of the women I have tried to date that never give things a chance and the past relationships that disappeared without  rhyme or reason. I can also live with the fact that when the time comes I will leave this world in a whimper and so silent that I will be a pile of ashes scattered to the wind for years before most will notice. There’s just those kinds of people and I am one of them and I have always been. I just was too naive to realize it for the last 50 years. I have 4 children who will have some great memories of the guy they call Father, but a lot more of the new man they call Dad and that’s how the world wants it.

96,https://www.opendiary.com/m/newt316/the-2-of-me-6082564/,2022-01-15,The 2 of me??,"
I don’t think I have ever been romantically loved. There has never been a person in my life that has sat around for years, pining away for me as I have for others. Neither has there ever been anyone that has fallen head over heals for me either. I’ve seen it happen though. I watched twice as my first and second wives fell totally in love with someone else and thought nothing of me or family.
I don’t think I have ever been cared for, worried over, or caused another anxiety in my relationships. I can’t recall in either marriages when one of them cried for me, comforted me, or just “out of the blue” did a selfless thing for me, like I had for the both of them.
When both relationships fell apart, neither one wasted time immediately telling and showing the world. The first wasn’t bad since we were together a couple of years and kind of stayed home, but my second, most of the village knew us as a couple and yet just took it in stride. No one cared enough to say or do anything.
 
I’ve been waiting for the “honeymoon” phase to end and for her to realize her mistake. You see, that was the only advice I was given from an old friend on  Facebook. ” You’ve been together a long time,” she said,” she’s just caught up in the new excitement of things and eventually she will come to realize your life together wasn’t terrible. She will rethink what she had done and look at the hurt she’s caused to your kids and family and out of the blue she’ll call you and want to talk.” Yeah, that didn’t happen. I did the “leave her alone” thing, the improve yourself thing, and the show her you don’t need her thing. She got engaged, filed for divorce, and promptly remarried before the ink dried.
 
So, I guess I am the only “common” factor in a life full of being left, hurt, and alone. I have never cheated on anyone I was involved with, yet I have not had one relationship where I wasn’t. They say men cheat for looks and women cheat for feelings. IDK, maybe I have schizophrenia, maybe I delude myself with thinking I do everything right. In my head I am loving, caring, kind, and unselfish, but in reality I am a bastard to friends, family, and relations. That would definitely answer the why I have sat alone for 3 years without any real contact from friends and family. I must be remembering it all wrong.. You see the first ex got out of Dodge before thing really went to shit with my schizophrenia, but sadly the second before she knew I had her in my demented clutches. I obviously forced myself on her at least 4 times, explains the kids. She had no choice but to be extremely covert about her “new” man and when everything was set up and assured, she heroically brook loose from my psychotic hold of her. For years, I must have lashed out on my siblings in horrific fashion, mentally and physically threatening them. They saw the strength my ex showed in breaking away from crazy brother and were inspired to do so also. Certainly explains why my sister is still very much friends with my ex and her new husband. My friends, the life long friends could take no more of my bullying and monstrous treatment, making our time together all about me. My rules, my wishes, and my plans. They both just had enough and also saw how everyone was finally breaking free from my psychotic schizophrenic personality. Even my children, I have obviously damaged over the course of their short lives needed to be free of me to enjoy life.
OR like it really seems, I’m no one to everyone.
I’m the “nice” guy at the trailer sales place. “What was his name? The bald guy. Ah, it doesn’t matter.” I’m the polite guy at the store saying “excuse me, pardon me” as I push past people in the isles. I seldom ever here a “that’s ok” or anything, instead I have to make due with a grunt, gasp, or silence. I’m the guy who follows the “rules of the road” and on a fairly regular basis gets rewarded with a middle finger or the endearing “you stupid fuck!!” I quietly take the insults and rejections and facelessly write them here with the hopes that strangers will take some pity on me and maybe think I am a better person then I apparently am. Although I would never go through with it, I think about the one pill, rope, or shot to make the pain stop for me and others. i’ve conditioned myself to live with the guilt my actions, both good or bad, selfish or selfless, have on everyone or anyone and I keep my head down in the world.
I’m not quite sure when I became worthless to most people in the world nor when those close to me stopped caring. I solider on, because that’s what you do in the eye’s of God. What do they say? Give yourself over to God and everything and anything is possible. I’m still waiting on that possible. I’ve been heart broken and damaged. I’ve lost a child and live with the what ifs and if onlys. I’ve been homeless and had to beg for things. I’ve been lied to, cheated on, and left.  When and where does this “possible” kick in?

I have always (unfortunately) been one who needs to know the who, what, why, and how about things. I never was one to go with the flow and let things roll over and off me.  I know that this has been the anchor to my ex. Oh, trust me, I know what she did and I know I never want to hurt this way. I know that things between us will never be right or how it used to be.
But, what is holding me back is the answers.
What did I do?
Why did she do it?
How did it happen without me noticing?
Where did everyone in my life for the last 50 years go?
I have tried and failed most of my life to not need the answers. To me though, it feels like the times I let it flow, things went south and I’ve lost all control.
There was a time right after the break when I was so so lost I wish I would have been committed. The psychologist and therapist have helped greatly, but it seems I need to have someone on call 24/7.

I think I’ve become my own worst enemy. The anchor to my own salvation.  I know I am not the only one who is going through this or the last, but I am going through it.
I have been sitting in my chair for the last 2 hours watch psych2go and improvement videos on YouTube, just hoping something will “click”. Somehow the help they are giving doesn’t seem to register to me. I don’t know. I just can’t make peace with myself after everything I have lost these 3 years.
I struggle with the fact that once again someone took everything I built, earned,  and busted my ass to have. Why is it that I did everything right right only to have to lose it all and made to do it all over?
I’m tired of writing these entries, but I don’t have anyone to talk to. I’m sorry, but to me therapists, priests, and psychologists haven’t really helped. Having my problems turned back onto me to figure out myself, giving my self over to God, and downing a drug cocktail every morning hasn’t fixed me.
You see, I understand the pure bull shit I just wrote. I also understand that if I sit here all “pig headed” about it, things will never change. I have fought this for 3 years on my own constantly reading and hearing other’s stories about the same thing, but in their’s there is always the support. “My family did this”, “my friends did that”, people came over and dragged me back into life. This one introduced me to someone or that one just sat and listened without criticism.  I know that you guys read these and give advice and I thank you from the bottom of my broken heart, but I just can’t stand being physically alone anymore and this Covid fucked up world is not helping. I was really improving in February 2020, then I was forced back into my hole that I can’t seem to crawl out of. I see the light, but I just can’t get a foot hold to climb up.

I must have definitely got up on the wrong side today. My thoughts have all just gone to a dark place all day.
It’s hard to be better, grow, and get over for me. I personally think I have done mostly all I can to, but I’m stuck. I can only describe the way I feel like this.
I was pushed off a cliff, but for some reason I had a rope tied to me. I hit bottom, hard, but I manage to get up. The rope tied to me runs up the cliff wall, but as I try to use it to climb, it just seems to unravel and although there seems to be more up top, it doesn’t seem to be secured enough for me to climb the rope. There’s some hand holds on the cliff wall and I begin a slow painful climb to get out of the hole. Halfway up I run out of places to grab, pull, and step. I’m just stuck and the only way I can move on is if someone will pull me the rest of the way or secure the rope and support me as I climb the rope. I have done all I can and now I really need other’s help, but the calls for help and notice just echo of the cliff.
So, yeah here I am. Tired and weak stuck somewhere in the middle of recovery and could use some help by the ones I thought would be there. I have personally pulled a few of them up when they were just hanging.
Many of you kind strangers have offered to talk both in texts and on the phone and I really appreciate it, but I need a familiar voice to hear and to listen. I want a little bit of normalcy after 3 years of nothing. But what is normal anymore?

I think I have forgotten how to be happy. Nothing really makes me happy anymore. Maybe that’s a bit drastic, my kids, for that brief day or two, brings me some if I can keep the thoughts away. Everything else. I don’t get excitement happy, taste happy, sad happy, happy happy, weather happy, bedtime happy or morning happy. The first cup of coffee happy, warm bath happy of finding money in my coat happy.
I see things that should turn the darkest hearts soft and all I do is acquaint it to my loss and sadness. The young couple shopping together, the old couple at the drug store and the mother or father with their toddler, it just reminds me of what I lost and/or will never have. How it was essentially ripped out of my arms and handed to another, who did nothing to deserve my happiness.
This has left me where I can’t enjoy music I like (Chicago, Jeffery Osborne, Barry Manilow are all now dead to me) or movies and TV (anything involving the slightest of love, family, or loss). 3 years have come and went and I’m still broken to the point that people holding hands, seeing “parties”, and any sort of sad thing makes me lose it. The other day, I was driving home from work and I saw a small stuffed animal in the road. It had been driven over so much that it was ripped and stuffing was hanging out. My mind went immediately to where I saw a small child, lost without their teddy bear, that someone, whether in anger or spite, threw it out the window of a car. All the child could do is watch the distance increase between and cry out for their happiness to the unfeeling people in the car.
I miss being numb to most feelings and “happenings”. It’s my own fault. I bottled up and boxed all the “bad” in the back dark place in my mind for years. Being told by the girl I had the biggest crush on reaction to me telling her that went horribly sideways. My first divorce. Deaths of my favorite Uncle, well my only Uncle, my beautiful cousin who finally found happiness only for it to waste away with cancer that could have been caught except for the “shitty” doctor, my Nanee’s death, the only Grand Parent I knew. I couple deaths of friends. My ex moving away with my daughter. My daughter’s life changing accident that left all her friends dead and her in a coma. My father’s passing and being forced to rehome my Akita. My 2nd wife’s first affair and the death of my daughter. The horrible treatment I received at her memorial from ex in laws, my mother’s decent into dementia and the horrible things she said and did and her eventual passing. All of this I pushed down inside of me, never once bawling my eye’s out. Never dealing with it. Then the day came, exactly 3 years ago this week where she broke me. Every wall built crumbled, every box sealed ripped open, and every bottle smashed. I have become incapable of compartmentalizing any emotion, loss, or happiness. I have tried everything a man can do to fix me and I have reached the point where I don’t think I can do anymore alone. I want someone in my life romanticly. I want friends again to hang out with. Unfortunately, it really seems as though, try as I have, it not going to happen anytime soon or at all…

Humpty Dumpty had a great fall;
All the King’s horses
And all the King’s men,

Yes, this is an “I give up” entry.
I’ve recently gone back to the old habits, smoking and eating like shit. Comforts that will likely send me to an early grave, but when I think on what life has been like for the last few years, would that be so bad? Oh I’ve made the efforts, instead of being a sick smoking glutton that’s unhappy, all I became was a bored alone healthy outcast that’s unhappy. I like to smoke. Marlboros are my choice of lung cancer. They do not put off a unpleasant stink like the Rez cigs like Senecas or Blacks(names of the cigarettes made on the reservations, not racist names) and what “stink” they do is gone from notice in a manner of minutes. Top’s markets make a frosted cream cheese cinnamon rolls that is like a religious experience and the Christmas season’s peppermint bark and cut out frosted cookies are like heroin. The fleeting small happiness is so much better than nothing.
I’ve accepted my role in the world. I fully believe in the Gods and Clods theory.  Have and have nots. Winners and losers. Good guys finish last. There honestly isn’t one rich person who hasn’t fucked someone over on their way there. I don’t care how generous they are now or what philanthropy they do, at some time they lied, cheated, or used another. The one’s born into it, they’re more likely to be worse never understanding what the “norms” live through and yet lecturing that everyone can be successful, especially if they have a rich parent to back them. Even at the level most live at people screw each other to get ahead and the empathetic caring ones, like I am, are used and discarded. To beat a dead horse, my ex. Not one consideration of the children or me, sold out to another who has bought her what she considers a better life. The trips, the big engagement and wedding ring, the wedding, the new furniture and appliances, and vehicle. Literally destroying a man who would walk through fire for her and busted his ass to get her a home, food, warmth in the cold and cool in the heat.
The Gods and Clods theory. People that have the “life” do it on the backs of others. There are Gods among us and Clods that take the shit for them. Yes, I believe there is a balance, but not like a scale, more like dimes in a dollar. If one has 1 dime and the other has 9 it’s still a dollar. I sit here alone and broke, giving someone 25% of my earnings and half of what retirement I may get, the home that was left to me by my mother, and all the debt, so she can have a new life, two incomes, and a fresh start. I honestly would accept this if I was or had been an abusive, drug or drink addict that never did anything but ate, shit, and lounged around expecting her to do everything, but I far from that guy. I was the clod who built a life for almost 20 years to just have to give it away to another.
At the risk of turning this into yet another “whiny, poor me” about her, I’ll move on to the other hard truths I have had shoved down my throat and up my a$$.
No one cares, at least about me. From the day it “happened” to this day, the only person who has even attempted to console me or even talk to me, I pay $70 a visit to. The reaching out, asking, begging and pleading to friends and family, who you thought would be there, has gone unheard and unacknowledged. That’s not to say I haven’t received a kind word or advice from nobody. The people here and some on other sites, have offered some great advice, thoughts, and well wishes. But as nice as that is, it’s like the crowd at the bottom of the building telling me not to fall as I stand on the ledge, where a life long friend or sibling could grab me and help me off it.
I’ve lost faith in religion. Not belief, just the supposed leaders in faith. Why? About a month after the separation and her immediately moving him in in days after I left to give her space, I went to talk to Pastor Mike. He was a different denomination then me, but a man of God just the same. He said all the things you would expect him to and by chance, the “new man” was part of his congregation. Oh, I heard how the Bible views this and frankly I grew up knowing it. Pastor Mike told me that he wasn’t going to shun the man, but his days of being a leader in his church would come to an end. I actually felt bad for him. Yes, I had empathy for a man who my wife left me for, who was a regular to Bible study and knew better, yet chose to sin and break God’s commandments and give exactly no “fucks” about it. I took Pastor Mike at his word about the two of them and their great sin in the eyes of God and felt some comfort that it seemed I had someone on my side of this. He married them a year and a half ago, in his church. Can sin be forgiven? Well I would be lying if I said no having been brought up Lutheran, but the total hypocrisy of this man of God. this leader in faith. A building is a building, I have no ill feelings for a church, but him, knowing how this sinful relationship began and knowing the “players” and the absolute soul crushing it did to me, married them. He could of excused himself for it and find another to do the ceremony, just for good measure and the promise made to me, that he was there if I needed. The one and only person, I wasn’t paying, to make that promise…
I have survived 3 years of utter depression and grief, that just won’t heal. Suicidal thoughts, wishing to not wake up and having to deal with life. Begging and pleading to those I believed would always be there for me, only to be left alone in the dark. Old friends who would listen and promise that if they ever came around “home” the first thing they would do it be there for me, only to totally ignore me when they did and showing their actual feelings when I asked why. Neighbors and strangers who avoid me or look at me in disgust as I try to greet them or attempt to make friends.
So, I quit. I’m done. I made the effort, put in the work. Made peace with me and me just agrees that we are just going to exist. No more friends. My siblings and relations are dead to me. My children will have my only “shits” I give, when I can give them. From now on I hold my place in line no matter what, no matter where. I’m in the ER with a tummy ache and you cut your wrist and blood’s everywhere, sorry I was here first. Oh, you’re seizing in the middle of the side walk, I guess this is where I cross the street. Car broken down on Murder Road, sucks to be you.  I mean it, this world and those people have beaten the care out of me. From now on my organs are mine, don’t care who it may save if I die. If anyone else but my children passes, don’t look for me signing the sympathy book or at the funeral. Harsh, yeah, but it was also harsh to be totally aware of a broken, suffering, suicidal, depressed, lonely and begging for company friend and brother and never once, ever just ask me how I am or if they could help.

You all have been great here, but this it for me here too. I’m just going to turn inward and live in my shell from now on. Thank you all for putting up with me….

Yeah. I kind of lost it yesterday. 😒 Sorry…

So, hard truths. I have clinical depression. Having discussed it with my Therapist and Psychologist for the past 2 years, I guess I’ve had it for a while now, even before the break-up. The relationship’s ending just put me into a downward spiral I was on, just way faster. I feel like I’m at a point, like an addict, where I understand I have a problem and want to fix me, but my “triggers” are all around me and I’m weak. I take the pills and do the therapy, when I can afford to. I have done the “tricks”, moved to a new town, changed my apartment around, several times, meditated, and even listened to hypnosis tapes. I should’ve been committed when I had my mental break after the separation. I know, be a man and suck it down, but I couldn’t. Close relations knew and saw what was happening to me and as I have said, in every single entry, did nothing. I guess you can say I survived by giving into the depression and like drinking a shot of anti-freeze a day, it damaged me to the point where some stuff ain’t repairable.
Why my title? The 5 stages of grief, denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance. I guess I’ve been stuck in depression so long that acceptance doesn’t want to happen. Actually I think I’m in a mutated form of the first 4 all jumbled up into 1.
More hard truths, I was raised a momma’s boy. I was cuddled, doted on, and over cared for. I wasn’t spoiled by any means, but I was mostly “bailed out” by my parents, of course by my mom’s insistance to my dad. That went on like that well into my 30’s, so yes even when I was married to the ex. Then dad died and mom got dementia and my “free ride” was over and life poured in hard. I turned to my ex and made her “the listener” and expected her to hug me when I was down, support me when life got away from me, and just be there. I was in no way just a lump waiting on her, I did my part. She never went a day without hearing me telling her she was gorgeous and how I loved her so much, when I was home before her I would clean everything so she wouldn’t have to and as the boy’s grew, I taught them to do that too. Most of time I would have dinner waiting for her and it might sound like a lie after what I just wrote, but I let her talk and bitch about her day and I did everything to cheer her up. Yet, the selfish, cuddled, and doted on little boy in me wanted, expected the same. I’ve learned that I was stupid to believe that 2 people can and will love the same way and I was stupid to believe that a person would “discuss” if there was an issue that would damage that love.  Maybe all those people from the older generations, like my parents and grand parents didn’t truly love each other and just stayed out of obligation, secretly hating each other. Maybe my grandfather died because he died and not because my grandmother died a couple days earlier and he was lost and broken hearted without her. I guess I am just dumb to think so.
4 out of 5 times, I give up and quit when things get hard. The piano and saxophone when I was young, JV football and regents courses in high school, jobs as an adult. I think I have answered every single question I have had about Patty leaving me why she did for a more consistent and less whiny older copy of me.
Yes, I have some pretty horrible thing happen to me. like the death of my daughter, but short of that I am the cause of all my grief, pain, and loss. 4 out of 5 times it was all me that damaged my life. I deserve to be where I am, who I am, and how I am.

I’ve said it before, I was raised cuddled and doted on, but my parent’s were old school. They had me in their late 30’s and both grew up in the 30’s and 40’s. My Father’s parents were both born in the 1800’s and were way into their late 40’s when be came around and you definitely could tell that Dad was raised as the only boy in a family of girls by strict parents. Anyway, the point is I wasn’t raised on the hoodoo voodoo new agey hippy thinking of the 60’s and 70’s. So, in my quest to fix me, there has always been the resistance in the back of my brain. Men suck down their feelings and soldier on. Words like depression, just didn’t fly. ” You’re not depressed, go out and get a hobby” my Mom would say. Obviously, that is kind of the “healing” method’s a therapist will tell you to do, but she never addressed all the other things that depression brought, well in a clinical way that is.
” What do mean you think you’re ugly. You’re very handsome, quit mopping around”
” Get out bed and get some fresh air, that will wake you up. Quit mopping around”
” Why are crying, you’re to young to dwell on that.”
“You like baseball, why did you quit”
” Stop being so angry and nervous, get a hobby, do something”
So yeah, typical Momisms most people 50 and over probably heard all the time. But I remember hating my looks, just losing interest in stuff and quitting, taking a slight from my friends to heart and leaving them without even saying goodbye, but in a moment be right back for more because I couldn’t be alone. Probably all the same things kids go through today without the safety off the non-internet world of today. It was a different easier time for kids whether or not they were depressed.
For anyone new reading this, i’ve lived with depression in one form or another seems like all my life. I understand I am depressed and realize I, because of it, have ruined relationships, given up on opportunities,  and flat out quit things, but my 2nd divorce just broke the thin ice I have been skating on for years.
Back story and build up over, so….
I recently have become aware of something called Radical Acceptance.
Radical acceptance is when you stop fighting reality, stop responding with impulsive or destructive behaviors when things aren’t going the way you want them to, and let go of bitterness that may be keeping you trapped in a cycle of suffering.
I was going down the YouTube rabbit hole and came upon a video. I watched most of it, but after the 4th commercial cut away in 4 minutes, I gave up and went back to fail videos. It stuck on me though, enough that I spent the next day at work, sssh don’t tell anyone, doing some web research. I bought a book that is supposedly one of the best non clinical ones, meaning it’s wrote for dummies and not PHD psychologists.  Also, an audio book on the subject, but so far it hasn’t really gone into the “how to” and mixes a lot of Buddhism teachings, which, ok, is kind of the same thing i’m told, but I really don’t want to be a Buddhist. Told you that Lutheran upbringing is deep in my bones..
I know what my problems are, I just don’t know how to deal with them and most advice i’ve been giving, which is great, hasn’t quite worked for me. Everyone one says I need to know myself and love myself, I believe I do, at least enough to understand why, what, and how I got to this point. I just don’t want to give up the things that cause so much pain, yet brings so much comfort to me. Like a meth addict, I know it’s killing me, I see what it’s doing to me, I know what it’s cost me, but that feeling when I do it is just so great and I want it so bad that I could care less about what it’s doing to me. I don’t like now. I don’t care to be alone and on my own. I don’t like thinking of myself, it makes me feel guilty and ashamed. I do everything most divorced Father’s do, pay support, call or text, send gifts, and take them every time I get the chance. They have all told me they aren’t sad or mad with me, that the are ok with how things are now, yet I can’t bring myself to believe it. It took me years to reach a point where I finally could understand that I couldn’t have done anything about Kayla’s accident even if I was still with my 1st wife and saw her everyday, because it was her decision to drive that car, without a license or the least bit of knowledge how to. It was her decision to go on the 101 in California with all that traffic. We had, the ex and me, both raised her on the rights and wrongs. The both of us grounded her, punished her, taught her and loved her, but this young person, who was as much as an individual like you and me, made a choice even with knowing right and wrong. I suffered with the guilt while she laid in a coma, when she came to only to be permanently damaged and had to learn everything again. I suffered when she came to live with me for a year, seeing the struggles and anger from her as she pushed too hard to be “normal”. All the hard days, all the good days, the fights she had with Patty and how Patty began to feel, all my fault. The ex in-law’s constant guilt of me about how I need to do this or that and how I wasn’t doing it “their” way. As she grew into a young woman and once again her actions and her eventual death. That day was the first time I had talked to her after being angry with her for 3 months, because of something she had done.
All I can think about is the time I lost instead of the good times we had for her short 22 years. Time lost due to the divorce, having to work almost 16 hour days to survive and child support, and the time lost just because I was just too burnt out from it all.
All this is known by Patty and my sister Wendy. It’s used as a weapon and used as insult, when it comes to the boys and how I have to live my life that I had to totally start over from nothing. I have to work on the holiday? You just don’t care about the boys. I literally have no money and enough gas to get back and forth to work until pay day. You don’t love your kids, you should want to be with them anytime you can. I’m not told of concerts, teacher’s conferences, or my autistic young one’s special ed meetings.  You don’t even show up. 
So GOD, please let this, Radical Acceptance, thing work for me because i’m at that point i’ve been at so many times in my life where I want to quit.

You know it’s hard not to care about not caring.  I don’t know what it is about Sundays, but when the afternoon runs around whether or not I have had the boys, I just get horribly blue.
I wrote Patty the “I give up” letter today. Not a sugary sweet thing, just the fact that I can’t do it anymore.  I will never understand what makes a person do what she did, how she did it, and why. I can come up with reasons why, but we were so far from that, I just don’t know.
I called my oldest to check in with him and his brothers. He was out shovelling, I couldn’t be more proud of him. My second youngest right there besides him helping. What are the 3 boys do when Jonathan goes to college? What will I do?
It’s harder than I thought this radical acceptance. Trying to live in the present, especially when my everything was tied to all of them.

105,https://www.opendiary.com/m/newt316/good-but-not-good-enough-2-6084528/,2022-01-24,"Good, but not good enough","
I don’t feel like I am important to anyone anymore. Having taken the high road in my divorce allowed her to control the narrative and my “mental and emotional break down” didn’t help things either. My kids love me, I know this, but thankfully they live as though my absence never effected them in the least. I know I would have been absolutely lost if I lost my father or mother at their age, especially if one or the other immediately shoved a new person into my life.
All this time I haven’t received a call, email, letter, or text asking how I am from anyone. I have been asked, but only after I made the effort to contact others, and even then it was more of a conversation, that never happens, end. Still waiting on the “good things happen to good people” thing I always have been told. The whole, “it get’s better” way of saying goodbye that people use to end the exchange with friends or acquaintances.  When exactly is that supposed to happen? 3 holiday seasons and birthdays have past with no well wishes, presents, or calls. Yes, I get the kids before or after these days and it is quite enjoyable, but always ends with slowly driving away from everything I knew.
I’ve pulled myself out of the bleak dark hole I was in for the first year to no fanfare, just out of the wet mud onto the dry dirt. I’ve heard from helpful strangers about their suffering and grief and I try to make it help me, knowing other’s have suffered as much or more then I have. It all keeps coming back to me and how I have to help myself. We all die alone. We all have ourselves to relay on. I know my past and present hurt is now completely my own. It’s been enough time now where I can only blame my current circumstances on myself. I’m tired of the same questions in my head, the same complaints.
I already know what will be said about what I right here. I know what needs to be done. I have made all the efforts. I selfishly want to internalize my pain and shut out the world. What’s done is done. I can’t fix my marriage, that became a nonfactor when she immediately remarried and I couldn’t live with the fact that I broke up someone else’s relationship so cavalier as he did mine. I know, if she didn’t want it, then she would still be here, but when you know that there is another person involved and children as well…. AH, what’s the use. Suddenly people who do such an immoral thing become moral. My ex won’t talk to me, because married women don’t talk to single men behind their “husband’s” back. Somehow all my relationships ended this way and all my ex’s somehow had an epiphany about love, trust, and morals.
The constant in every failed thing in my life has been me. I once asked my therapist and psychologist if I had ADHD, autism, or some sort of brain issue where I don’t see myself as other’s do. In my head I imagine or see myself as the complete gentleman being the best to friends, family, and lovers, yet in reality I am pissing in other’s cheerios. Maybe I am the monster that makes everyone run from me or hate me and I just can’t see it because I am some sort of narcissistic asshole. Everyone leaves me without a second thought and never gives me a second thought. 20 year relationship gone in a second. 40 year friendships up in smoke. No reconciliation. No apologies. No reasons why.
And here I am, writing the exact thing, day in day out, just in slightly different ways. Just not understanding the answer right in front of my face. I know what will help me, but it is the reason I can’t find the help. What’s the use, some things, some people, just outlive their usefulness.

I had a panic attack last night. A pretty good one. Haven’t had one like that since the first month of separation. Almost called 911. Not sure how I finally calmed down, I just kind of woke up in my chair and was able to breath again. Much like a tree falling in the woods, how do you know if you passed out if there’s no one there to see?
When I say I have nothing, I truly mean I have nothing. TRIGGER WARNING. I am that evil white male. Some would say I deserve to be in the hole I am. My so called “privilege” works for me like a cut cord works for a lamp. I make too much for governmental help, but not enough for a crap lifestyle at best. Currently I am enjoying no heat and frozen pipes at my apartment because I thought my “privilege” and the winter would keep them from actually turning off the gas, a situation where I am responsible for, but now the apartment owner’s are also fining me for. Don’t worry, hopefully by the end of today I should have services restored and I can once again fulfill my rental obligation of running my heater up and let my water run on hot so pipes don’t freeze, while once again running my gas bill up for the modest crappy apartment I live in that now costs me an additional $25 a month because the covid fanatics that also live here have chosen to pay rent since March 2020. I pay child support to a woman who at no time ever had just 1 income coming in. I know, it’s for the children. How does the line go? ” It takes two to make a kid” and well, I did it 4 times, so I am responsible. I’m owed money for my “share” of the house, I was given from by my dying Mother, but I haven’t received any, because my limp wristed well meaning guilt ridden attitude fell for the “it’s the kid’s home” excuse from a woman who wouldn’t piss on me to save me from burning alive and the sister of mine who fucked with the transfer of the house, because as she said, “Mom isn’t in her right mind and it should go into both your names” totally ruining any real stake in the home for me in the divorce. Why did you not have your lawyer keep that from happening? WELL, remember the part where I said I had no money what so ever? There you go! My so-called “white man privilege” card was lost in the wash and I couldn’t present it at the court.
So I guess as I sat bundled up in my cold apartment, eating ramen made in a microwave, using a stolen bottle of water from work, something snapped and the panic overcame me. Just like the several I endured and spent in the ER with back a couple years ago, no one cared. Yes, I made calls to voice mail that no one checks or responds to. Let see, it was about 5pm it hit me and I put out calls to maybe help talk me through and now it’s 8pm the next day and still nothing.
TIME TO SAY THE HARD TRUTHS SO NO ONE HAS TO….
All of this is my fault and my fault alone. I decided to play adult at 18 barely out of high school because I made the decision to have sex with a girlfriend that by all accounts, didn’t really love or want to be with me. I allowed myself to be walked over by her and never fought the narrative that everything bad that happened was my fault. My loss was her gain. Poor Vikki, “that Colby essentially raped her, got her pregnant, and forced her to marry him at such a young age. She is the victim and we all will help her to move on in life, while we do everything we can to make Colby answer for his crimes..” Yeah, poor me, I made my bed, lay in it.
I knowing lost countless jobs, never saved money, made debts I couldn’t pay back and promises I never intended to keep. I and  I alone ruined friendships, my marriages, and the relationships with family. What do they say? “The chickens are coming back to roost.” I wasted 32 years that I could have saved money, planned retirement, made something of myself, and have the family I always wanted. Yet, I am bum, and not even a good one at that. I’m not a homeless, drunken drug addict. No one has come to give me charity to make themselves feel better on the holidays and then ignore my plight the other 49 weeks of the year. 
I have maybe 15 years to have some sort of retirement so I don’t become a burden to my kids. What little plans I had were taken from me and given to another luckier bum. Thanks Patty. IDK, maybe in that time I can figure out the easiest painless way to end things. Say my peace to the kids. Spend that last Thanksgiving, Christmas, and birthdays with my boys and possibly a grandchild or two and then leave them with a happy memory. Being 50 years old isn’t a death sentence for most, but they have mostly lived a life that was full. I am among the few that haven’t. The few that pay so so much from the few moments of happiness that was afforded to me. 
Try as I might, I’m not one of those who can see the rose in the field of shit. I have spent too many years sacrificing, giving up, and handing over my happiness to others. I have to love the people who don’t love back, because, as they say, if you love something or someone, their happiness is all that matters. Everything I have done for myself in the last 30+ years, selfishly or not, has blown up in my face. Where others enjoy the spoils, I am filled with guilt and remorse for thinking only of myself. 
Yes, this is dark. It was meant to be. I don’t like me, even when do. I don’t like anything about myself and when I do try to change me, I somehow make bad even worse.  I have chosen to live for others, not myself. God save me if I inconvenience anyone anymore, even to the point where they begrudgingly feel like they have to help or notice me. I appealed to my therapist when I was going through my issue lat night and I just received the no helping help response one gets from a therapist, ” Colby, I’m sorry you are going through this.” How the fuck does help?  All that says is make another appointment and pay me to tell you to help yourself.
So yeah. There’s that………..

I have had a day, as I’m sure you can tell from my earlier verbal diarrhea. What got me thinking again was a group text from my ex. She groups me in with my Sister because 1 she knows I won’t go off about things and 2 she wants a witness to see that she does communicate with me..
Anyway, my 2nd oldest needs braces and today was the beginning stages of getting them. I immediately jumped to the constant pained thought of not being the, as a family, as 2 loving parents assuring him it will be ok. From there thoughts went on to, “there’s another man there filling my role. He will get the credit if yet one more important day or thing you’ll never have.” He took my first with my oldest when I asked to be the first person to take him driving when he got his permit. He took my first with 3rd born by building his boy scout derby car. Now this. I’ve already prepared myself for the inevitable “he’s been more a father to them than you”. Push a guy off a cliff and yell at him for jumping.
What goes through the minds of women like my ex? They bust up a good marriage so they can be with another man, run their exs off and leave them in a financial, emotional  hole and then turn around and say that their ex is never there for the daily raising of children. I’ve been put in a position where unless I get some sort of advance notice, I have to work. Not for fun, not for a career, but to survive. To survive having had everything taken away. My home, my savings,  my retirement,  my friends and family, but I’m not there 24/7 for the boys like the new guy.
Why, after 3 years, can’t I get it through my head that her opinion means dick? That her snide insults mean dick. That I can’t keep feeling guilty about stuff I never have the opportunity to do.
I so tired of being alone and friendless. Only talking through OD and Facebook to who ever will humor me instead of someone who would sit across from me having coffee or a drink. Maybe a hug or a pat on the back for reassurance. All I have is my own voice in the darkness and the stupid thoughts that it forms.

Here I am world. So beaten down the pain feels normal and the good foreign. The usual thoughts kept me up last night and the absolute body pains from doing things a healthy 20 something would think twice about doing at work yesterday are all but crippling me today. I really don’t want to take any medicine for them, I already take so much for everything.
I made it to work today. I don’t have the luxury of working at a place with several people that can pick up the slack or a place that can survive a day or two without me. Haven’t took a vacation from here since I started 3 years ago. It’s just the 3 of us here. I don’t want to burden anyone else like it seems I have everyone I have met in life.
I thought it would be a good idea to listen to “the Wall” as I sit here watching the passing cars and waiting for the phone to ring. I never realized how it seems to mirror the life I’ve lived so far.
That’s all I got.

What to say that I haven’t said already? Other than the size clothes I wear, I have been an open book, whether good or bad that is.
I watched a TED talk from a Dr. Brene Brown about Empathy and Sympathy last night.
 Sympathy is to see someone in a deep hole, but remaining on higher ground and talking to them from above. The sympathetic person may also try to simply put a silver lining on the other person’s situation instead of acknowledging the person’s pain. Conversely, empathy is feeling with the person, it’s climbing down the hole to sit beside them, making yourself vulnerable to sincerely connect with them. The empathetic person will recognize the person’s struggle without minimizing it.
I guess, according to this, I’ve had tons of sympathy, a lot of it without the “talking from above” stuff though. The empathy part, no so much. Which calls back to several interactions I had with people over the years I have been in said hole. I have tried to have a new relationship with a few nice women. I in no way made any impression that they needed to “save me”. Yet, I will admit the subject of my pain and situation came up and I was honest enough to tell the story of how I came to be single again. It’s hard not to tell this story without the facts and when I say facts, I mean length of marriage, how many children, and honestly how I was blindsided. No matter how many times I have been told, “she must have been planning it or she checked out a long time ago”, the fact remains I personally was hurt. It’s a scar, not quite healed, but I have worked through the pain of the gushing wound that caused the scar. I’m not looking for it, but I get the sympathy in the form of, “I don’t think you’re ready” or “we are at different points in our recovery” instead of “I feel your hurt too. I think we could grow together and build something better than we both had lost”
Ok, here’s a far fetched example that I am sure will be disagreed with, but 😝… I constantly see the “animal” video’s on Facebook and Youtube. There’s an emaciated skin and bones abbused dog. It’s afraid and scared and lashes out at anyone who comes near. Yet, a person does, probably fully knowing that the dog might bite, bark, or growl. I have yet to see one of those that the person tells the dog that it needs to help it’s self before they will or that they are healthy and the animal isn’t so they just can not help. Sure, I do understand the thought that someone doesn’t want deal with someone’s issues, but what of theirs? I began a relationship with my ex knowing full well she had a fucked up upbring. The fact that she never had a real family. She had the weight of the world thrown on to her by her Mother and Sister. I made it a point to show her another way to see life, to help her heal the wounds she had, and always gave her an ear to listen and a shoulder to cry on. Yes, in the end I helped her to be secure and independent enough to selfishly pursue what she wanted without considering that she may cause the same hurt she grew up with to our children and totally disregard the damage she inflicted on me. People do this to each other constantly, but in the “unequal” world we live in, what’s good for the goose…..
How does the male/female relationship view go? Women cheat and it’s mostly justified because obviously the man dropped the ball. Men cheat because they are horrible assholes. The woman gets empathy no matter what, at least that has been my experience with 2 divorces and several relationships. Men get sympathy, sometimes, but no real understanding. My 1st wife, much like the 2nd, cheated, forced me to leave, and immediately moved on with another. Not so much with my current divorce, but the 1st one, everyone blamed me, even when the facts were plain as the nose on their face. Even those one’s who knew me and knew I was far from being some horrific abusing cheater. I obviously didn’t do enough to make her happy, so I was the bum and the quitter that drove her to it.  I assume that people had that view about this time also, they just didn’t say it to me and were people I had grown up with and knew me years longer than us. I’m not saying that all men fall under this category, but we all are painted with the same brush.
The only person who truly knows “where I am in life and healing” is my highly paid therapist, who although she doesn’t say I am healed, says that I seemed to have made peace with a lot of it and moved forward. I believe that no one but a psychopathic narcissistic person, is truly happy with themselves. The Bible thumping, born again, ultra-religious person can’t truly say it, because we are all sinners in the eye of God. Everyone has at least one thing about themselves they don’t like, body, health, relationships, or financial status. I even believe even the most humble monk is frustrated with himself and their constant pursuit of Nirvana. I am keenly aware of the fact that everyone has preferences and fancies, I am quilty of that myself, but at least I don’t “cop out” on them by saying some silly excuse. I have told the morbidly obese lady that I was just not interested and they were not my type or the beat-up looking, rotten teeth woman that they were my type either. I agree with the inside outside argument and I am sure some of them are angels brought to Earth and 4 star chefs, but I have my issues. That being said, I’m no prize either, but I go out of my way to try. I don’t let my teeth, health, weight, or skin go to shit because, as they say you should do you and be comfortable in the skin you’re in. I’m sorry, but I believe there are just a few things that are out of your control when it comes to that. I am definitely digging myself in to a bigger hole here..  I’m saying I know me. I don’t shoot for the moon either.
Is it wrong to call someone plain looking? Those ladies in the majority that aren’t supermodel gorgeous, but are not Medusa ugly either. Yes there is a part of me that would love to get into a relationship with beautiful almost perfect woman that would cause my ex sleepless nights of jealousy, everyone in my position, man or woman, has the same fantasy too, don’t lie… Honestly, even with my “standards” I just want “my person” and want to be their person” . We don’t have to check all the same boxes, just enough to be the other’s completion. I have never thought of a relationship (friend, dating, and marriage or family) as two becoming one. I want someone with empathy enough they see when I am happy or sad, angry or defeated and I would do the same. Someone who enjoys being together, but also knows that we both can function apart. They have a life and I have a life and we also have a life together. I don’t ask for much. Recognition, understanding, trust, and truth(both ugly or good).
Well this entry has gone ALL OVER THE PLACE. IDK, I think I can be a great half to a whole. I guess that’s why I am so frustrated with my ex and our divorce, I put forth the effort.

I’m getting the feeling that people don’t like me because I’m a 50 year old man with a 20 year old maturity. I just do not feel as adult as I should. Maybe all those years ago when I thought I should pattern my life on Bruce Willis’ Moonlighting character David Addison was a bad mistake. Maybe it’s my way of dealing with life’s problems. Be the dancing monkey and no one will see the hurt.
Anyway, I just feel that no one has taken me seriously all my life and it’s too late for me to turn that around. Of course, this is just one of many reasons I kind of despise myself. Sure in my own little world I have fun, sometimes. I love to make people laugh, even though they might just always see me as that, a joking doofus. It sure explains why my Sister has never really viewed me as my children’s father, always chiding me about everything from how I play with them to how I reprimand them. Both of my ex’s seemed to have enjoyed my attitude until they left and now, of course, throw it in my face as if they never did. Maybe because I don’t have the looks to back up the attitude, I am seen as just a freak.
I’m sure it’s a huge combination of factors and traits that over shadow the loyal, moral, and genuine man I really am, but not remembered for. I am slowly accepting the fact that I will, more than likely, never develop a loving relationship with another woman my age. What was fun and cute 25 years ago has turned into old and creepy and honestly, I don’t know how to change. If 2 divorces, one of which broke me, losing a child, losing friends, my Father and spending the last years with my Mother, who was in the throes of dementia, hitting me, yelling at me, cursing my existence, didn’t change me, I don’t know what will.
I see men my age just being on a whole different level and have yet to meet another chuckle head like myself. Maybe I’m right about never being diagnosed with some mental problem. Maybe it’s because I never get allowed a chance to be them. Twice I’ve had to take a diminished role in my children’s life. Twice I wasn’t good enough to be a husband. I’ve worked several jobs where my opinions’ meant nothing or were talked down to constantly. I have held leadership roles, but never respected by my peers or upper management. In my mind, in my memories, I did the job correctly and did what was expected of a Husband and employee, but maybe in reality I was just a huge fuck up. It really is my fault, all the bad luck, bad breaks and stuff.

Writer’s block..
Oh, I could write the daily “woe is me” entry, but what good would that do?
Hmm, should I go off on my thoughts on the happenings in the world and my view’s on them? My thoughts on Government, and stuff? MAybe I will and then justify part 2 I wrote yesterday. Screw it, where did I put my soapbox?
I’m a moderate in my political views. I never cared for Trump as a person, but liked some of the things he did as President. I just never quite saw the “radical” things and “racist” stuff that people keep screaming about. Of course, I see how you can make anyone a racist or anything said into racism. When the phrases “white washing” or “black listing” are somehow racist, now you’re just talking out your ass. I’m sorry but, when a certain race is constantly portrayed and glorified as gang bangers or gangsters, in music, video, or even real life, and have been for years, it unfortunately sticks into the thinking of the general public, no matter the race. I see i’m digging a hole here, but let’s open or minds some and take an outside balanced view on things. Trump’s biggest problem is his mouth forms words before his head thinks of them. People take his words and think he is making a grand sweep of everyone in the race or nationality he is talking about, when he is actually singling out a certain element. I’m not defending him, but I am defending the basic idea he is trying yet failing to say. Some people just only hear themselves talking and in their brain it sounds as though they are saying it correctly, but it comes out all messed up. I mean, has everyone forgot the pompous dumbass jerk he was in the 80’s and 90’s?
So, what things did he do that have been totally taken way out of context? Immigration and building that damn wall..  OH BOY!!   This is going to twist people’s short hairs. Anyway, How many people own a home? How many of those people, who can afford to, have some type of fence? How many of those lock their doors? How many people would start locking their doors if they found out a stranger came into their homes unannounced? Finally, how many people would be ok with a stranger came on their property, fenced or not, and sat up a tent, hooked up a hose to the outside spigot, cut into and ran wires to their tent from their electric box, and dug up and hooked into the gas and they never actually help to pay for those utilities, but no matter what, the home owner has to? WOW!! What an extreme example, but….  There are illegal immigrants coming into the states. They are receiving social benefits. They are not paying into the taxes that support the social programs. YES, they may be running from horrible conditions. YES, they are mostly doing jobs we feel are below us. YES, there are children involved. It’s a cluster fuck all the way round…
Let’s break it down even more basic. You are a home or property owner. You have busted you ass to buy it, maintain it, and keep it. You do see yourself as a moral, ethical, and compassionate person, because for the most part, you are. You care. So now we will do the Goofus and Galant thing.. Would you be ok if one day you came home to my example in the paragraph above. There is a group of strangers camped out in your yard and using all your stuff. They never once introduced themselves or asked for help or permission, they are just there. Would you just shrug your shoulders and say,” Well I guess that’s just what happens” and let it go? Would you be so pissed and angry that they had the gall to just plop down and use your stuff without offering to buy, rent, or even thank you? I’m guessing most would run them off or call the police to. What if they were also in you home? They climbed through the open window and are now sitting in your kitchen raiding your fridge.
Same example, but the group came to your door, introduced themselves and their children, explained their plight, and asked for permission to stay on your property. They offer to help with yard work for some food and water. They offer to help fix your house, barn or shed to earn their keep. Which example would you say is the most productive, the most right and ethical?
The world is a horrible place that can only get better if people stand up to the nastiness. People get hurt, people get sick, people die. Is it fair? No Really nothing is. I guess what I am getting at is there is process in place at our borders, not a perfect one, that is like the paragraph above. You come, ask for the permission, and agree to earn admission. Unfortunately, like the person who owns the property, sometimes you may say sorry, I can’t help you. Like I said, the world is a horrible place. Compassion comes from the heart of an individual and shouldn’t be something forced on you.
Yes we should worry about immigrants from latin America due to the endless drug killings, gangs, and such. We should worry about Islamic immigrants because of the years of terrorist attacks here and abroad. I’m sorry, it’s human nature to be cautious after you have been hurt or threatened. It’s unfair yes, but it’s human nature. I’m sure if separate Canadian gangs or groups started up with “death to America” chants, kidnaping and beheading Americans, and terrorizing border towns, the US would start to cut down on Canadian visitors and immigrants wanting to come into the country.
I thought about deleting all of what I wrote here. I know full well I will take some shit about it. But I believe if it is read with an open mind you can see the logic in it. That’s the trouble, in my opinion, with America now days. People only react and not think on things. The first thought or impression becomes the be all end all of things.

I wake up in the dark. The cold air does nothing to the warmth of the bed shared by the two of us. I roll over to spoon Patty and bury my face in her sweet smelling hair to kiss her neck. I lay there for another minute, spooning her, enjoying the feel of her and enjoying how holding her makes my mind numb to everything else. I whisper “I love you”. She replies the same in a mumbled sleepy voice. My body has no aches and pains from sleeping on what I can only describe as a cloud. I quietly get dressed in the darkness and head down stairs.
I am greeted with excitement by Bruno, our Lab, and Oreo, our cat. Both jockeying for the first petting. I make my way to the kitchen. I grab my keys and start my car so it will warm up on this bitterly cold day. I start coffee pod brewing and let the animals out. The coffee finishes and I add some cream to it, put the cap on the travel mug, and sit down at the table. I little voice comes from the darkness of the living room. “Hi Daddy” my 3rd born son Ethan says as he steps into the light, rubbing his tired eyes and showing an ear to ear smile. I grab him up and kiss his forehead and chide him for being up so early. “I just wanted to tell you to have a good day” he says. We share I love you’s and I tell him to go up and get in bed with Mommy and protect her for me. There’s that grin again and the assurance that nothing will happen to her on his watch as he once again disappears into the dark.
The animals are waiting at the door, impatiently wanting to come back in to the warmth. Oreo meows a thank you as he runs to a warmer place inside. Bruno sits at my side waiting for the assuring ear rub he expects everyday for the last several years. He’s a old dog but just doesn’t know it. I close the door behind me and step out into the frigid air towards my, hopefully, warm car. I open the door and fall in. I close the door………………………..
The jolt of the dream car’s door closing wakes me up in my old uncomfortable bed. No one to roll over for. Body aching from the usual fitful crappy sleep. Both knees POP and CRACKLE as I place my feet on the cold unforgiving floor. I lose balance as I place my weight on my sore legs and catch myself on the wall. I open my bedroom door. There’s no greetings from Bruno, he was put to sleep due to age and sickness by Patty and her new husband. I wasn’t told until 3 weeks after. No Oreo, he was hit by a car and buried in the back yard of my, well, her house. I was supposed to have the kids this weekend, but they wanted to go to their Aunt’s house, my Sister who hasn’t talked to me since the initial separation from my ex. My Keurig is broke, my used truck has no remote start, and my boots are still wet from yesterday. The maintenance for the complex must have decided 8″ of snow isn’t enough to plow or clear, so my boots fill with snow and more wet as I make my way to my vehicle. By the time I finish clearing the snow from my vehicle, snow has made it’s way into my sleeves and more fills my boots. The door is completely frozen as I fight to open it. The truck protests against starting, but finally does. Even with the heater full blast I know it will never warm up until I pull into work 15 minutes away.
Just another day in my “new life”

So I yet again, I texted Patty. For some reason I can’t bring myself to believe the woman I spent 20 years with could actually be that different, that uncaring. I mean, people have done some nasty things to me, but I still have some caring for them. We have 4 kids. She lives in my parent’s home I was raised in surrounded by memories.
I didn’t beg for her love or reconnecting. I just want to have some understanding. To understand how feelings can just burn out and become bitterness when there simply no cause. All she ever said was to be civil when she asked for the separation and that was that. No reason other than assumptions. Did she want me to go and start a fight with him? Did she want me to kick her out? Want me to fight for custody, money, or to just make her life a miserable mess?
Yes, I will probably never get an answer, from her, but why can’t the world make me understand why I’ve been broken, bankrupt, and left by everyone when I didn’t do anything wrong and only lived for her and the kids. That’s why I’m having such a horrible time living for myself.

I got in a text spat on reddit durning the last few days about the Neal Young/Spotify/Joe Rogan stuff. My thought, who cares, but why do these self important “entertainers” take it upon themselves to assume we should follow their leads based on their beliefs, that according to them, are the be all end all. So Neal Young wants to pull his music from spotify, bye Neal. If you are a fanatic Neal Young fan buy his albums of Amazon. It’s his music and if he wants to take it off a channel or something because he takes issue with an opinion, go ahead, but why try to make it into a super important, be all end all, I’m right and you’re wrong thing? Well now I see the uber important Prince Harry and Megan are threatening Spotify. WTF? I have listened Rogan’s pod cast and I don’t remember him prescribing anything for Covid only saying what works for him or others. Remember when I said I’m moderate? I was vaccinated, but I also lived out there mask free from March 2020 until I was. Worked with someone who got Covid, he wasn’t vaxxed at the time, but got through it with mild symptoms. Who knows, I had sniffles, coughs, and the like, maybe I had it too? The thing is, shit happens. “Love thy neighbor” as a decent human being you shouldn’t go and spit and cough on someone if you have Covid, but this whole mandate, guilt, and “cancelling” is way to out of hand. The fear mongering is totally out of control, especially now when we have tons of information. I personally don’t understand the whole anti-vax crap myself, but I do know how it all probably started and so do you. The 2020 election. The “hate” for Trump. The world of “wokeness” that takes offense at any and all jokes, accidents, or misspoken words. The people who fervently attach their wagon to another and lose all of their common sense.
As the election rolled on and the “hatred” for Trump grew, the Democrats stroked the fear of a “Trump” Vaccine. That fear grew to both sides of the spectrum and “common sense” took a shit. Now, I believe in choice. You don’t want to take it, don’t. You want an abortion, get it. You want to stick your privates into a mouse trap, feel free. I know I won’t, but I won’t push you either way in what you decide.
Try this on for size.. This will make your brain sad. We vaxxed people have to wear masks, not to protect us, but to protect the unvaxxed, but the unvaxxed are being denied life saving surgeries because they aren’t vaxxed. SO we have to keep them healthy and Doctors, who are sworn to, don’t. everyone understands risks, unless you have some sort of disability. We have passed the flu and common cold to each other for hundreds of years, even after there’s been a flu vaccine, that by the way is totally voluntary.
People are dying and I’m not going to sit here and say it’s because they all had underlining conditions, because that would be stupid. Whether it naturally occured, which I personally don’t think it did, or was made in a lab, it happened. Like the spanish flu and the plague. Going to sound horrible, but some people are and were meant to die from it, some people are and were meant to be damaged by it, and some are and were able to slide on through unscathed. Polio, my Grandmother had it when she was young and became what they called at the time “a carrier” and both her siblings died from it, yet she came through. My Great Grandparents also. A vaccine was made and was not used as political folly and most everyone took it and to this day we take it. There are side effects, but to a small percentage. But you know what? In 1955 there wasn’t 24 hour news channels that had to have audiences and ratings. Old Mr. Smith, from Kansas, got the polio vax and became deathly ill because an allergic reaction. It was horrible, but it wasn’t constantly pushed, in your face and examined over and over as though the coming of the anti-christ, like now days. This is what happened to the Covid vaccine. Just imagine if the polio vaccine was just made today. You internet fanatics would start with how it makes the government track you. Politicians would use it against each other’s intentions both good or bad, FOX, CNN, and the others would spend hours and days about the good and bad and even interview the fanatics and finally find that one person who had a bad reaction and make it seam like every 1 in 3 people instantly drop dead from it. For views, likes, or just plain attention movie stars, singers, pod casters, and “self important” people will battle with each other about the good and bad. All the while people will die or be disabled or walk scot-free with no side effects, because that’s just how the world works.
No matter what people say or how many other’s they cancel. No matter if one believes in the vaccine or doesn’t. It’s your life, you know the risks, you know the benefits. At anytime a plane or a meteor can fall out of the sky on to you. Who knows? For those of you who are ultra religious, God could end us in a blink of an eye. So should we constantly live in fear of everything or live life knowing the risks and believing others do to? It’s all common sense and no one should be allowed to push another out of employment or house and home based on their beliefs. Actual actions? That’s a different story.

After my last 2 entries I bet everyone is missing the “woe is me” Colby.
Although this one won’t quite be as whiney as most, it will definitely fall into that category.
I’m jealous of others. I read the posts and see the pictures on Facebook of friends and I see their family pictures. Scott and his loving wife and two girls proudly, lovingly standing together. Charley and his wife’s vacation. Mike’s and his bride and their travels and dogs. Yes, there are a few that don’t have the perfect family like I have had to slowly admit mine is now. It goes beyond that though. There are several friends that have “rediscovered” the love of someone from their past or reconnected with the ex.
Ultimately, my “damaged” mind wanders to Patty and how completely cut me out of her life. How does someone do that? How is it possible when you share 4 children? How is it possible when you live in the other’s childhood home, surrounded by reminders, and finding the other’s memories, treasures, and momento’s of the past? I’m happy that most of the time it’s the boys that find them, but I hate that we haven’t together. Years have past, I know this, but it hurts to be treated and talked to as I am by her as thought I was a stranger or the choice from shelf 12 at the sperm bank. Once again I fall back to the thought, I never treated her in any horrendous way. Most women who kill to be treated like she was. She ultimately became the person she said for 20 years she would not be. Love = Money.
Lately I’ve been good. I had an awful panic attack last week, but have been numb about everything since. As people have read my “political” views they can see I am getting back to my load mouthed, uneducated views on things. Believe it or not, I have always felt that way about myself. I have always been awkward and immature. I am the prime example of the saying, ” Let people think of you as stupid instead of opening your mouth and proving it.”
SO, the new trend for me on Facebook dating is to get likes from people and then never talked to. It is nice to see that people have “like” me based on some pictures and a quick description, but the silence just makes me feel as though they had an “oops” moment as they scrolled through the countless faces.
Well, maybe something will happen in the world later or tomorrow and I can get back to soap box with my dunce cap on.

Once again the Universe has reminded me of my place in it. Once again I allowed my head to pop out from the hole I found myself in for 3 years now. Spent yet another day texting and chatting with someone. I allowed the warmth of feeling worthy and special to fill me, finally the bleak hard days may be over. Then like so many times before, I woke to the “text”.
I’m the mole in “whack a mole” game that is played by the grand champion. Never missing, they bring the mallet down everytime I pop up. The shit eating grin on my face gets knock back into the hole, over and over until the time runs out. It never was like this before. Sure, I had tough days, incredibly tough days, but the “walls” held and safely inside of them, I looked to the bright future with my family and friends around me every day. I never saw the “inside job” come. The walls were torn down from the inside out and the enemy rushed in.
I’m too old, to young, not religious enough, a smoker, a nonsmoker, my kids are too young. I’m not in the right place in life, not compatible, not financially stable, not a good enough Father, a Father. I’m too short, not healthy enough, don’t smile. I’ve heard and been “blown off” with almost every excuse other than how I smell.
I listened about how she really missed little kids running around and the energy they gave off. She wished for Grandchildren and couldn’t wait for her son and daughter and their partners to give her Grandbabies.. Yet, my kids are too young for her to be comfortable with. The mallet once again came down to “knock” me back into the hole.
I give up. I wasn’t good enough for the woman I had spent 20 years with and actually had kids with. She left me for a man 20 years her senior. A man who had a checkered past and a broken relationship of his own. A man who’s bad habits leave mine in the dust. How can I possibly think that anyone would truly want me if the one person who “loved” me left me for that? What does that say about me?
Sure, at first I tried too hard. I’ve learned from the mistakes. I have come to know me and like me, as people have constantly told me in that non-compassionate way people do. I’m afraid that I have become to comfortable with myself and that’s what scares me. I’m starting to want to shut the world out. It takes everything I have to come to work, to keep my job. I don’t want to leave my “jail cell” of an apartment. Not to shop, not to go out to eat, and slowly, not to get my kids. Don’t get me wrong, I want to see them and be with them, I love them, but I wish they could be brought to me and picked up when the visit is over. I used to be a friendly and talkative person. I never felt any issues about going up to a stranger and having a conversation or going to a crowded bar, restaurant, or event, but now I avoid them. For almost 2 years, when I got out of my breakdown, I have tried to talk to, meet, and date new people and every time, every “I’m sorry, but…..”, every unanswered call or text, has chipped away at what little “me” I used to be.
It’s nice that married women tell me I’m handsome and anyone would be lucky to be with me. Same with people who live states or countries away who never intend to ever meet me, that say the same thing. The obligated “oh your baby is so beautiful” thing you say when clearly it’s the ugliest thing you’ve ever seen. What really sealed the deal about the absolute fakeness of people’s compliments was when an old friend must have taken pity on me during the initial trama of my “mental” break from my marriage ending. For 2.5 years we talked about everything. We flirted and laughed. She told me of how she always had a crush on me and how if she didn’t live overseas she would jump at a chance to be with me. She was in a thin ice marriage and would say how when it ended she would be on the first plane back here. Apparently, it was all said to “cheer me up” and not ever planned to happen, until it did. She came home this past December. I have yet to hear from her. No visit or phone call. No answer to messages. Come to find out she started a relationship with someone else. So needless to say, I’ve given up on taking compliments. Between the empty one’s from the untouchable one’s and the “sorry but….” one’s, I’ve come to believe I am not worthy of anyone’s attention, friendship or love.
I couldn’t keep my own wife happy no matter what I did. I couldn’t keep my life long friends. I couldn’t keep the unconditional love of my siblings. The only people who will talk to me are online, no offense, or the professional one’s I pay to talk to me. I never thought I would be what it is that life seems to be making me, but all the efforts I’ve made, all the attempts, and all the begging pleas have done nothing to stop it. It may seem as though I am whining and feeling sorry about myself, maybe I am or maybe I unknowingly caused all this to myself because of actions and nonactions. I’m sorry to the few in this world who still care and I am sorry to my boys, but as of right now I quit.

Yesterday I started to write about Patty. A deep dive in the years of memories to attempt to see where, when, or even if she actually loved me or was trapped in our relationship. I know how I felt from the first day. I know how her slightest touch comforted me and helped quiet my mind. I didn’t write this to torture myself, rather I have been trying to do a process called Radical Acceptance. I had mentioned this a while back and the other day I finally got a book about it. Now I’ll be the first to admit I’m a little dense when it comes to reading and learning. I have always been what they call Kinesthetic.
Kinesthetic – Taking a physically active role, kinesthetic learners are hands-on and thrive when engaging all of their senses during course work. These learners tend to work well in scientific studies due to the hands-on lab component of the course. 
So needless to say, doing this on my own is kind of breaking my brain. The thing is, I have to embrace the pain and work out the cause of it all to come to grips with the why and what of it. I told you it makes my head sad. Who knows, maybe I am doing it all totally wrong, need to read on.
 A lot of people understand what I am going through but, for some reason I want those close to me to understand. I want my Sister to say she’s sorry and she’s here for me. My friend’s the same. They all have known me all my life and they know who I am and how things effect me. Yet for some reason a 20+ year relationship with a person, who you have 4 children with and made no secret about how you felt about her, your children, and them, doesn’t matter and I should have just brushed it off like dirt.

I just wrote a long Fuck You post on FaceBook. Found out one or more of my “friends” were running to Patty and telling her anything I may say about my feelings on the whole divorce for the past 3 years. I held nothing back, I don’t care anymore. Feelings for the village I grew up in and where I chose to raise my family in and how people knew us. Almost everyone in that village knew us, but chose to not say or inform me about her “affair”. I had know these people all my life. I went to church with them, school with them, ate beside them and they just chose to ignore it. I blasted her work. All the people who work there and knew us for years. They always a loving couple and children, but chose to “not get involved” and even encouraged her relationship with him. Even before the “break” they knew and all just stood there, with their fake ass smiles as they saw me and my kids when we stopped there for items or to pick her up. I called out the fakes who “had my back” yet were no where to be found when I needed them the most. The liars who said up and down how they would get together with me and have me over if they ever came home to Silver Creek, only to come home and totally ignore me like the rest. I yelled at the world.
Is this helpful? Should I have done it? I don’t care. For 3 years these “friends” have known what I was going through, how it was breaking me, and the dark places I found myself and they did nothing. Oh the occasional, “it gets better” was said. Yet the same one’s would tell me how they just didn’t do things because of covid, yet would post pictures of the party they had or the bar they went to. The same ones would say they weren’t looking to date, when all I wanted to do was go for coffee and talk, yet would find themselves in new relationships days later. And, of course the ones that would messenger me and would get me to tell them my feelings and then run right to Patty. Could we have reconciled?  Could we have gone to counselling? I guess not when people were filling her head with doubt and encouraging her affair.
I talk about it, obviously, but I have become numb. Over the course of the last few weeks, I have tried not to. I have wrote here and in men’s divorce groups to try to hold onto my feelings and empathy. I just don’t have it in me anymore and I want to not feel, anything.

I just went for a walk around my work. It’s snowing pretty hard here, but not biting cold. I tried to listen and clear my mind to “be in the moment”, I’m just not ready.
Why am I still grieving the end of my marriage and loss of my wife after 3 years? The things she has done and said. Her actions since. I still give her the benefit of the doubt and she is literally another man’s wife. Why did I have to be the one to lose everything? Why does everyone else get to stay in the life I made? Why won’t anyone just come and talk to me?
I don’t want to go home to the apartment today, but I have no money or gas to go anywhere else. I feel the triggers of my depression starting and I’m trying to change them. I’m not excited that I have a 2 day weekend when I should be. I don’t want another anxiety attack.
Listening to Dr. Phil’s podcast on Borderline Personality Disorder. I’ve been told I have it and I wish “my people” would listen and understand it instead of just shutting me out of their lives. If that’s what cost me my love and family, what am to think? Why haven’t I ever been giving a 2nd chance with people? Why won’t people just talk to me?
Should I get a therapist online? Mine moved to another area, not far, but not near. Should I get a life coach? Should I get a hooker? I’m tired of being scared of life without people. Actual human contact, not a zoom thing, not a virtual bar crawl or group.
This is going to be a horrible weekend.

Sitting here realizing I screwed up my life. I’ve no where to go and no one to see. The only person devastated by the divorce is me, no one else, even the boys. That sounds awful, but it’s true. Oh, they do miss from time to time, but life never missed a beat. Mom moved a man in the same day Dad left and she never talked to the boys about it, it was just the way it was.
How is it I mean so little to everyone? I have disorder. I’ve been told this. Borderline Personality Disorder. I’ve told this to people, my therapist has told this to people and all their reactions were the same. Nothing. No one looked into it or sat down with me. My sister talked to my therapist and essentially made it all seem as though all she ever did was help, yeah right. So everything is me.
I’ve thought about suicide, several times in the last few years. I won’t do it, physically that is. I think tonight I’m going to mentally kill the person I am. There won’t be any tears from people and no one will find out or even care.
First thing, I have sent my last text to anyone. Let’s see how long I can really go before someone reaches out. Second, I just won’t care anymore. I’m going to smoke, eat, drink what I want, when I want. I left social media, except for this and I can bet you, no one will or has noticed. So, time to pull the metaphysical trigger.. See you on the other side.

I’m sitting here in a Tim Horton’s parking lot, drinking my coffee and thinking about how my life has turned out so far. Trying desperately to remember the few “good” times that have happended along the way. I was there for all my children’s births, seeing their little faces. I try to remember their firsts. the steps, the words, their laughs. I’m not allowed to talk to their mothers anymore about any of it. Not in a loving way as two people who made a life. I try to remember the good times i had with their mothers, but all I can think of is how both of them dismiss old memories of us as if we never existed and that instantly makes the memory go dark. Those are my memories from the age of 17 to now. My kids and my pain.
All I wanted was to be a husband and Father. All I tried to do was be the best at both. Both times I was left for another who was only there for them, my ex’s. I had and have become the blame, the reason, and the cause for every bad thing that my children do or don’t do. Never for any good. After the “fire” I have never been told by either of them that I’m a good Father or anything. No Father’s day thank you for being their Dad. No apreciation for child support or things bought for their needs. Nothing. Yeah, I should do these things and I shouldn’t expect appreciation for supporting my own children. But, after a lifetime of not good enough, I would like some sort of compliment or acknowledgement.
I read and hear of these saved marriages and familys and all I can think of is how I was never given an opportunity to save mine. There was no regrets from my ex’s, no second thoughts, and no reasons given. One day I, all of a sudden, just became not good enough. Not worth anything. I could fall off the face of the Earth and nothing would stop and look back for me.
I can’t remember if it was Tom Sawyer or Huckleberry Finn who spied on their own funeral, but I would love to see how people would react to my “death”. Morbid, I know, but for all the cries for help and pleas for support that have fallen on the deaf ears of friends and family over the course of my divorce, I can’t help to think that it will be trouble enough to despose of my body. Frankly I’ve said it and I’ll say it again, I will be long dead and rotting before anyone will come looking. I will be the smell coming from apartment 8.
 
I don’t have money to just pack up and go, she saw to that. Where would I anyway?  The only family that knows of me is the family that doesn’t talk to me. No Aunts or Uncles anywhere. No Cousins that know me or that are close enough to offer me a place to stay until I get established. I certainly don’t want to play homeless in a warmer state. So here I am stuck in my nightmare.
 
DAY 2 of no texts or calls from the “people” in my life.

Sitting here looking at the pictures of my sons. From babies to little men. I’m so so proud of each one. Wishing I was more of a constant in their lives.
The common sense of the whole thing is right there staring me in the face. I love a woman who no longer or never loved me. How could a person do what she did for essentially money? I know it happens, you hear and read about it all the time. I hate that I have held such a naivety about how love and life works. I hate that I only see the good in people, when the bad hangs on them like a smell. I hate that I can’t live my life as selfishly as most do.
Yet, I want my boys to be like me in that sense, but I know this world and what it’s becoming will eat them up and spit them out. Maybe what she did is better for them. Maybe this hard lesson and truth will serve them so much more then watching their sad gullible empathic father fall apart.

I don’t like me.
Even when my life was put together, I didn’t particularly like me.
I’ve racked my brain to remember when it all took a shit inside me. The only thing I can think was my relationship with my first ex wife Vikki. We met in 1987 when she moved to my village to live with her Mom. Up until then I remember having a confidence that easily shook off issues, of course I had plenty of friends and interests that occupied my life. Vik was the typical 80’s girl. The big hair and looks. She always smelt intoxicating as she would pass me in the halls and I was totally smitten from the first time I saw her. Several attempts went unnoticed by her until one night we were walking around, me and her and her friend. She was casually bumping into me and lingering in front of me, looking into my eyes and rubbing up against me. Eventually, back at her house we wound up kissing and she instantly got me. The first few months were awesome, well as awesome as any teenage relationship can be, but then the bumps hit. Apparently I wasn’t the only one that had noticed her and well, she loved the attention. Several times she would start the “break up” talk and several times I lost my shit. Crying and begging her to stay. Believe it or not I was a bit more dramatic then I am now. She cheated on me a couple times and like a fool I begged for her forgiveness because I had obviously did something to cause her to. Also, at this time my “friends” weren’t really there for me like they were before. That was my fault too. I had chosen a girl over them and I was, what the kids say “pussy whipped”.
With age age comes wisdom, people say, and I realize that I should have just been done with it and thought of myself and my future, but….
We somehow would get to back together and then break up and then got back together. Eventually, I wound up getting her pregnant. Because I was raised the way I was and having gone to church every Sunday, I thought they since we were having a baby that we were going to be together forever, that she would love me forever.  It was good dream, fun wedding and great time until after Kayla was born and Vikki healed up. Then it all went to shit and my brain couldn’t handle it. Much like today, I had no friends to fall back to. I let every nasty thing she and her “new” guy said stick. I looked at this as my fault, and really no one was telling me different. The only saving grace was I was young. Barely in my 20’s and still had the youthful looks. I still had women interested in me for just that reason and I never really was alone. My parent’s were still alive and I had my old room to fall back to, but the cracks were there and damage was done as far as my self confidence and image went. The Borderline Personality Disorder started then I believe.
Then life really kicked in.

Day 5
 
I think I met someone. Of course, I’ve said that about 20 times in the last 2 years. So we’ll see.
Match refunded my money, NY state is good for somethings, apparently due to NY law I’m allowed a 3 day, no questions asked refund for pay sites.
Caught up on the show 1883 last night, DAMN that’s a good show. Oh and Ozark, I was a fan from the first on that one. So, yeah, I just bummed around yesterday afternoon. Was thinking of making soup but, I just don’t care to cook things anymore after all of this. I used to live for cooking for my family, now though it just doesn’t feel right anymore.
On the way to work today I heard a song that I haven’t heard in ages and WOW did it speak to me. Bluer Than Blue by Michael Johnson.

After you go, I can catch up on my reading
After you go, I’ll have a lot more time for sleeping
And when you’re gone, looks like things are gonna be a lot easier
Life will be a breeze, you know
I really should be glad
But I’m bluer than blue, sadder than sad
You’re the only light this empty room has ever had
And life without you is gonna be
Bluer than blue
After you go, I’ll have a lot more room in my closet
After you go, I’ll stay out all night long if I feel like it
And when you’re gone I can run through the house screaming
And no one will ever hear me
I really should be glad
But I’m bluer than blue, sadder than sad
You’re the only light this empty room has ever had
And life without you is gonna be
Bluer than blue
I don’t have to miss no TV show
I can start my whole life over
Change the numbers on my telephone
But the nights will sure be colder
And I’m bluer than blue, sadder than sad
You’re the only light this empty room has ever had
And life without you is gonna be
Bluer than blue

I also heard Re-Flex, The Politics of Dancing, too. So there’s that.

A customer just came into my work today and I got triggered. Not because of a mask thing, race thing, or any number of woke issues. I was triggered because he was an older gentleman with a young wife or girlfriend. The mind went right to my situation. My ex leaving me for a man 20 years older than her, 10 years older than me. This man just bought a trailer worth over $7000 with a pass of a credit card. So money is the key, has to be.
Maybe, once upon a time, love was all that mattered, but those days have come and gone in my opinion and my experience. What makes it so much worse for me is this guy, my ex’s new husband, from everything I have learned was just a bounce around loser, who at his lowest supposedly “found God”. That and he was left some property, which he sold and essentially “bought” my ex’s love with. I have ran the situation through my mind over and over if this never happened. We would have got the owed taxes paid, this is her big grievance with me, I hadn’t paid the house taxes and we owed X amount. As I had told her, weeks before the break, they would be paid up with the income tax refund we were going to receive and low and behold they were. I wasn’t there at the time and half of the return was mine, but they were paid. By then, he had moved in and sold his land and “BOOM” she had money. More than we were ever able to save, we were raising children and such, so in an instant, she had thousands of dollars. I’m not discounting the love this guy has for her, she was easy to love, but I fail to see what else besides his money she sees in him.
Three large stimulus payments and several months of child tax payments and 2 huge tax returns (4 kids) and she is sitting pretty. Money in savings, trips, new crap in the house. Like an idiot, I walked away from $25,000 of the $35,000 of my share of the house, my house, because I was guilted about how the boy’s needed this and that and how the house needed to be fixed up. To late now, papers have been written and signed. I still haven’t been given my 10k though.
Is it fair of me to make such a blanket statement of women? No, I do believe there are those who live through good and bad times together, but there are those who are just motivated by money. Maybe the writing was on the wall when her mother married a well off Native American man who had a very successful cigarette business. The new house she got, the modern appliances, and the furniture and new leased vehicle every year. Then one day, he got sick and put the business in his children’s name and I want to say it took all of a week for her to kick his ass out. I know, me and my brother in law had to come and change all the locks.
I just thought my ex was different. She would go for hours bitching about how my mother in law was. How ever since her father died, mom would just use people and how there was no love involved although it was said. How stupid I was, how stupid I am still.
I read in the news today about Shimon Hayut, who they call the Tinder Swindler. There’s a documentary on Netflix. He would, obviously, get these beautiful women to date him. He would, for a time, wine and dine them in fancy restaurants,  hotels, and vacations. They fell for it every time. He would tell them he was some type of diamond mogul. Then eventually he would get them to open up credit accounts or straight ask them for money, you know because they “loved” him for his heart, not his money. All told, he walked away with millions from them all. From what I can find, he’s pretty ordinary looking and definately, IMHO, way out their league, but he’s a diamond mogul and they are just the salt of the earth types of men all women want. Right?
I know, I am one of the million “plain looking” hard luck fellows that believe ourselves to be the “good guy” women always seem to say can’t be found. Yet, we are bad ones because we didn’t get born into money or the right family, weren’t smart enough to be lawyers or doctors, or good looking enough to be actors or models. Oh, and because some of us aren’t over attracted to certain types of women. So I think I just called out the hypocrisy of us types of guys. Maybe we deserve to be walked over and left for a richer ugly guy.
So yeah, I unfortunately judged this old guy and his young, out of his league lady, who spent thousands with out a blink of his eye and then got into his $50,000 Dodge truck and hitched up his trailer to tote around his 2 side by sides to take to his “vacation” home. Meanwhile, there’s a man out there, king of plain looking, who installs dry wall for a contractor, that would die for this girl, who one day left him for “greener” pastures.
Ok, I am still bitter…..

Day 6, I think. It’s all a blur..
I’m at a loss of words today. It was a fairly boring night. Went down the YouTube rabbit hole for a while, watching a wide variety of fail videos and meme reviews. I discovered a channel called Psych2Go and WOW it really opened my mind and eyes about a lot of things. Here’s a link to that if you ever wondered about something raddling your noodle like me : https://www.youtube.com/psych2go
I tried Binaural Beats when I went to bed. I have headphones that I bought a few months ago call Bed Phones that kind of fit comfortable enough to sleep with for people that sleep like I do. I guess you can say I am a side sleeper, IDK, I burrow like like a hamster in my pillow and blankets. Not the greatest sleep technique for older people with bad aches and pains. It usually takes me about a hour to get around the apartment without pain…LOL  I just have never been able to sleep on my back.
Anyhoo, supposedly listening to Binaural Beats is supposed to somehow program your brain and such. Look it up because I will do no justice to it by trying to explain it. Does or did it work? I really don’t know. I did have some nice dreams. Really nice dreams where it seemed everything was working great in whatever life I was dreaming about. Neither of my ex’s were in them. Maybe an old friend or two. I want to say a dalliance with an old female boss I had years ago. The typical dream that goes all over the place, but still seems connected for some reason. I guess I’ll have to keep at it and see how it goes.
I have to go grocery shopping tonight, which after the divorce has actually become a chore and not the pleasant thing it was back then. I used to love finding new things to make for Patty or making her favorites. The kids tell me that she has totally changed on what she used to like that I made. Not sure if I should take that as bad or good. Does she miss my cooking so much that she just chooses to eat different because no one can match it? Did she hate it this whole time? It took a long time to go shopping at first. My mind would constantly go to her as I went through the isles and saw all the things I used make and found new things I was sure she would love. I’ve all but stopped cooking in general instead I buy the same things week after week. Light cream (for coffee), Fairlife 2% milk, Fiber one cereal, Bob’s red mill oatmeal, Bananas (to make Fiber one palatable), Pears and Apples. Sometimes a salad mix. I used to make stews and soups, casseroles and pasta salads. Several types of sandwiches and various “New” recipes. I would experiment with all types of things but, now it’s cereal or oatmeal in the morning and salad or fruit at night. On the off chance I want to liven things up, I’ll order a pizza. No more pop (soda), juice, deserts (that’s what the fruit is for) . A sad meal plan for a sad man.
So, yep, that’s all I got today…

So my brain did it to me again. Once again I am thinking “what if’s” and “if only’s” about my ex and the life I had. It’s getting frustrating. This current headache? For some reason I was thinking about a 25th wedding anniversary. Yeah, how stupid is that. Even if we stayed together that wouldn’t happen until 2029, but for some reason that got me sad.
Damnit, the signs that she’s done with me and over it is as clear as water is wet, ice is cold, or I’m handsome..
 
I don’t know what is happening with the lady I met online. We have chatted and she has not said anything that makes it seem as though she’s not interested, but the answers come far and few between. I realize people have lives and don’t sit around waiting to instantly answer texts yet, I am chomping at the bit to hear from her and I am losing my s**t not to start writing the “did I do something wrong” and “what’s wrong” texts. I don’t remember trying to date being this hard on me ever. I am totally an over-sharer. That is something I am trying not to do either with her, but I just want to talk to her.. I want her to like me. I want her to want to meet me just as much. I’d be pulling my hair out if I had any….
Am I wrong to think that if someone really likes another they would move Heaven and Earth to meet them?

I guess I thought you’d be here forever
Another illusion I chose to create
You don’t know what you got until it’s gone
And I found out a little too late
I was acting as if you were lucky to have me
Doin’ you a favor, I hardly knew you were there
But then you were gone, and it all was wrong
Had no idea how much I cared
Now being without you takes a lot of getting used to
Should learn to live with it but I don’t want to
Being without you is all a big mistake
Instead of getting easier, it’s the hardest thing to take
I’m addicted to you babe, you’re a hard habit to break
You found someone else you had every reason
You know I can’t blame you for runnin’ to him
Two people together but livin’ alone
I was spreading my love too thin
After all of these years I’m still tryin’ to shake it
Doin’ much better, they say that it just takes time
But deep in the night, it’s an endless fight
I can’t get you out of my mind
Now being without you takes a lot of getting used to
Should learn to live with it but I don’t want to
Being without you is all a big mistake
Instead of getting any easier, it’s the hardest thing to take
I’m addicted to you babe, you’re a hard habit to break 
Now being without you takes a lot of getting used to   
Should learn to live with it but I don’t want to
Being without you is all a big mistake
Instead of getting any easier, it’s the hardest thing to take
I’m addicted to you



I finally got through that song today without tearing up. Not sure if it’s a sign that I’m finally healing or not, but I have been able to listen to 1979 – now Chicago again. I sang these songs in the car, at karaoke, and in the shower growing up blissfully thinking that they would mean nothing more than nice songs to sing.

Fact is, I haven’t listened to any type of sad song or love song in a long time for the same reason. I always thought I would never relate to any of them. Boy, was I wrong…LOL  I just listened to The Wall the other day and thought that Roger Walters and David Gilmour were prophets that knew of my pain why back in 1979 when they recorded it..

Our song, or I should say the song that I tried to show how I loved her, was The Luckiest by Ben Folds. I won’t copy and paste it here, but if you have never heard it, look it up, it’s a beautiful song. Well so much for that. Words and sentiments didn’t keep us together anyway.

I have my second youngest for the weekend. Came to work with me today. It’s hard with the younger ones not to get sentimental again of all I have lost and to a point they have lost too. All I ever want for them and me, was to grow up in a family like I had. I know that they all rolled with the punches that their Mom and I have thrown at them, I’m the only one still living in the past.
I am keeping the brave face on for them, but dying inside.

Day 9
I haven’t heard from anyone around me at all. No well wishes, no concerns, nothing. I guess it’s safe to say that nothing is going to happen with the lady I thought I met. Atleast I’m used to that. Seams everyone leaves me before even getting to know me. Maybe I stink.
There used to be a time when my boys liked me cutting their hair. That seemed to go the way of the marriage. My 3rd born is sobbing in the other room because he says I ruined his hair. Maybe I really don’t do anything right. It all just feels like I’m just not needed at all other than child support. I still suffer every day wondering why this all happened like it did.

Just sat down for a coffee and to check my phone. Once again I got the “thanks, but no thanks” message from yet another person.
I hear everyone when they say no to push the dating thing. I hear everyone when they say work on myself, love myself, and spoil myself, but I am not like that and have never been. I thrive on being part of something and with people. These last few years have made me spiral into a place I wouldn’t wish on anyone. I know I shouldn’t take the regections personally, but I do. I can’t help it after everything and how my marriage ended and everyone seemed to forget me.
Yes, I get the whole if they aren’t there for you, you don’t need them stuff, I really do, but even a prize fighter can only with stand so many punches until he goes down. It’s starting to feel I just took the last upper cut today when I read her words. I really don’t understand how my ex jumped directly into a new relationship or several of the women I have attempted to date that swore up and down that they weren’t ready, only to find out they too jumped into something days after saying such things to me.
It’s the same things I have wrote at least once a week for the last several months here. Mom used to say, “like a sick bird’s ass”, I write this same thing in just slightly different ways.
 
I have 3 more hours with my son today. I will do what I can to make him happy and to enjoy the visit, but once I drop him back home and hug and kiss the rest of my son’s, it will be a long ride home. I will once again attempt to clean around the apartment, but eventually I will just crawl under several blankets and sleep the day away, again….

Day 11
Valentine’s day has become the worst day for me. When I had just separated with Patty 3 years ago, I still had the ability to come and go at our home. Now this was about 3 weeks after I moved out and she moved the “new” guy in. So ofcourse the first thing I saw was the roses. Yuck.. What a lazy thing to do for Valentine’s day, give flowers that will die in less than a week. Then I saw the card….
I knew Patty’s handwriting right off the bat. The sentiment was one I don’t think I ever heard from her directed to me in our 20 years. Yes, she had told me she loved me now and then, but what she wrote him in this card broke me further then.
” I’m falling more and more in love with you every day. I never thought I could feel like this. I can’t wait to spend the rest of my life with you.”
It was only 3 weeks since I left to give her “space” . What did I do that was so bad that she push away any love for me and just say that to another. I never have recovered from that, as I am sure most know.  So needless the day of “love” is the day I had my heart torn to pieces and scattered to the winds. Just one of the several “holidays” I now spend alone and hear from no one.
On top of that, the IRS has sent me a nice Valentine’s gift. I did my taxes and had the double, triple checked and sent in January. I was due a refund that would finally help me to get ahead with at least one issue in my life, but no. Seems after they did their “magic” I now owe. I have no idea what type of voodoo math they used, but with all the stimulis stuff and well the Government changing stuff continuely, I have decided to fight it. I just really could have used the money, but as they say “If it wasn’t for bad luck…..”

**** Strawberry, I just saw your note on yesterday’s post. I had started to write this beforehand and I just can’t bring myself to erace it after all that typing….LOL

So I set up a FaceBook page for my work today and to do so I had to set up a personal account. I made one for my sales manager who could careless about it. Just like the asshat I am though I did a search for the ex wife’s page. Stupid.
Did you ever look at an open fire and think to yourself, “I wonder what will happen if I stick my hand in there?” and then do it, knowing full well you will get burnt? Yeah…Me..
Besides the pictures of her and them (she looked wonderful in her wedding dress. We didn’t have a formal one) it was the comments. The people I complain about not being there for me, my friends, have since a few weeks after our separation making comment about how good they look together and stuff. Yet I never got an answer what so ever from any of them. Well I guess you can say I did now.
I see she has the life she must have wanted all along, but never told me, as I saw the vacation pictures, the hiking pictures, and the like. She never wanted to do those things with me, I asked and begged to do those things.
 
I never thought I could feel worse, until today.
"
135,https://www.opendiary.com/m/newt316/hurt-511-6092922/,2022-02-14,Hurt,"
Some reason I’m stuck in a horrible rut today. I keep wanting something I just can’t have. Wishing to go back to a life that is no longer mine.
Every where look, every show I watch, I see a life I always wanted and probably won’t have again. Why is it some people have what they don’t want, while people like me can’t have what we want? I was raised in the church, Lutheran, what I like to call “Catholic light”. Almost interchangeable, but not the same. I have prayed and spoken to God over and over for years. I have faith, but I’ve never quite understood how the “plan” people speak of works. I’ve heard countless people say there’s a plan that God has for me. I’m starting to think it’s just what you say when you don’t want to have the conversation. Try as I may I just can’t seem to understand this plan. This plan has cost me two marriages, one child, losing everything, not being able to raise my children how I want them to be, rather having to make peace with the other man and hope he doesn’t fail. This plan has left me alone, hurt, worthless. It’s cost me friends and family.
I look for the good things, I do see them. My children are healthy, the woman I live more than life is happy. Yet, for me personally, I don’t see any good or happy and it’s not like I’m not trying. I put in work. I’m kind to strangers. I’m helpful to anyone who needs help. I meditate, I breathe, I been trying to get healthy. Why was I left by everyone? Why won’t some one help me? Why am I not allowed to have answers?

136,https://www.opendiary.com/m/newt316/2-15-2022-6092986/,2022-02-15,2/15/2022,"
I really don’t know what to write right now. I’m feeling useless, worthless, and just a lump of skin taking up space. I do try to look and see things I am gratefull for and say something positive each day, but not today. I just don’t have it in me.
So, I got a call last night, but I don’t think it goes towards my counter of days I have gone without hear from someone. This aquaintance I have known for years was obviously extremely drunk. She managed to mumble about how nice I am and how things will get better. It was nice to hear, but it took her getting that drunk to even call and honestly I don’t quite remember when I last talked to her sober.
The whole tax refund mess has turned me into an mess. I really do not know how I will get myself out of financial Hell any time soon. It’s nice that there is a place between poor and rich where nothing can come your way. Make to much for government help, do not make enough for a cosolidation loan.
This last “brush off” from the lady I met online has also hit me hard. I guess I’m good enough looking to be swiped right, but not good enough to actually meet.

This will sound like one of the hundred entries I have made here, but I miss my little family and the woman who was my best friend for years. I’m dense, but not stupid, I know things have changed, she has changed, and people have changed while I’ve been stuck in January 2019. I’ve been holding on to a frayed rope hoping it will hold me, but knowing it will break at anytime. Where will I fall to is unknown, but bad or good, I don’t want to fall. There just out of reach is the comfortable, caring, and safe life I knew for years. Family and friends are staring down at me hanging, but not doing anything to rescue me. I’m hoarse from calling for help and my arms are tired, but I continue to fight to hold on.
I’m afraid to let go. I’m afraid of the lonliness down there in the dark. I don’t want to die alone. I don’t want to change…
After my first divorce and all the fallout in the early 90’s I did all the work. I made the sacrifices and trials. I fought and clawed for the life I wanted and in a blink it was taken away from me and essentially given to another. Not just my wife and her love and friendship, but my children’s every day lives and actions. My home and my possesions. Yes, in the “grand scheme” I’m not defined by those things.
I’m tired of grieving, but I cannot seem to stop. I tired of feeling abadoned, but I was. I live in the grasp of all my failures, learning from them, but never escaping them.

I was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder by my psychologist and therapist. I don’t quite understand it, but all I have learned and heard about it does seemingly fit the person I feel I have been for years. Other than those two, everyone in my life thinks I am a whiney, poor-me bitch that always complains the world is giving me the shaft constantly.
Of course, when I let my loved ones and friends know of this “issue” they all immediately made the decision that I was once again becoming an “attention whore”. That’s how it’s been for 3 years now. Even though I was told and I felt I had this problem, it just became unmanageable after my “break” when the marriage failed. I have written about this several times, but I have the thoughts and I need to write them. The woman who said she loved me, would never leave me, built a family with me, and was my rock, just shut me out over the course of a day. When I say to shut me out, I mean there were no tears in her blank eyes when she told me she wanted a divorce, she would move away in disgust as I would try to hold her, and she would not discuss why things were finished, other than the initial saying we were done. I turned to my sister for comfort and support and she immediately made my hurt into her problem. “You better not keep the kids from me,” she screamed at me and then sped away. Countless texts and calls went unanswered as I quickly descended into my personal Hell. I turned to my friends and heard them call her a bitch and slut and told me to deal with it. Days later I was told they didn’t want to hear me bitch and moan about it and then they stopped answering too.
And for the last 3 years, that’s how things have been. Oh, I threw myself at their mercy, apologizing that “my” drama had caused them inconvenience, and asking, begging to be included again. The invites never came and neither did holiday well wishes. Nothing.
I have been suicidal. I have wound up in the ER with panic attacks. I have been homeless and broke. Yet at no time did these people ever acknowledge my pain or loss. No hugs or shoulders to cry on. No distractions or pep talks. No Merry Christmas, Happy Thanksgiving, Happy New Year, or Happy Birthday messages. It’s just been me alone except for the occasional visits with my sons, who I can’t talk to about my hurt and loss.
Would someone who found out they have cancer be treated like this? Someone whose home burnt to the ground, would they be told to stop crying about it? Every conversation I have tried to have with those close to me get turned into “get over it” or “man up”. As I just wrote when I tried to explain my mental issue, they have just laughed it off. Yet my sister alone has supported and comforted several of her in-laws who have gone through depression, sickness, loss, and divorce, but me, nothing.
I have always tried to be open about my feelings to others. I sat with my ex as she lost her grandmother and through all the dramas with her mother and sister. I spent weeks helping and supporting my sister when her 1st husband die of cancer. I stepped up to care for my mother when no one else would when she descended into dementia. I made it a priority to be there and cheer up my 2 best friends through their divorces and heartbreaks, even allowing one of them to stay with us rent-free for weeks until he got back on his feet. I have lent money when I couldn’t afford to.
So is this victim-blaming on their part or do I truly have a victim mentality? Maybe the writing was always on the wall and I was too blind to see it about how people around me acted. Maybe my ex dropped subtle clues I just ignored. Maybe when I sat with my broken, tubed up, and in a coma and daughter and then again at her death bed without so much of a hug from people I should have known or how my sister made it all about her pain that her niece died. Yes her niece, not my daughter, because you see according to all of them I have lived a charmed life and have never felt the horrors of the world as they have. Somehow they have always had support from others when I haven’t had so much as an apology.

My day started bad, but at least it was a nice warm morning, but my mood along with the weather has become cold and grey. It’s one of the days I have at least 3 to 4 times a month where I just can’t shake the hopelessness of my situation.
I’m sorry, but I just don’t see this as an opportunity as everyone tells me to. Maybe if I had lived a life of selfishness and been self-serving I would feel better about all this, but I lived for my family, my wife, and children. All the decisions were for them. From 18 years old until I was 48, it was keeping others happy, safe, and secure. When she gave up on me, on us, it took away everything from me. YES, I still have the boys and I do whatever I can for them and with them, but it will never be the same. I lost everything and in 3 years I haven’t even got close to being able to save any rainy day money. I still live in the debt part of a marriage and will be for a few more years as I pay off things I don’t even have. All the while she has remarried with a clean slate and all the things we worked for over 20 years. All of this hasn’t affected my kids at all. I think they see me sad, but they never have acknowledged it. They do their best when they come to slum it with me for a day or two.
Maybe I asked for this life. Maybe my actions or faults took me to this lonely existence. I honestly do not remember treating other people badly, but maybe I did and I was too narcissistic to realize it. Maybe I should have been more greedy of people’s affections than giving. Or, maybe I am just one of those people who are outside of everything that is never acknowledged and meaningless to others. Like a penny, I’m sometimes needed, but no one cares if they drop me.

So how do I feel today? My life and health can sum it up, shitty… Really shitty…
I woke up in pain. The kind of pain where you just don’t want to get out of bed, but it hurts too much to stay. The first step after I forced myself out of bed was incredibly unsteady. My knees didn’t want to support my body and I fell. My neck is a ball of tense pain and I can’t lift it to see straight without the piercing pain that travels down into my shoulders. When I do get back up, my back is so stiff I have to waddle hunched over, gingerly placing each step while steadying myself on the wall. I’m almost 51, but I feel well into my 90’s.
Needless to say, my emotions feel as bad as my body.  The body pain is like being hit by a semi and the mental anguish is like stepping in the road constantly on purpose.
It’s not like I enjoy this or that I even want this, it just seems to be what it is. Everything feels like it’s caving in on me. I can’t get ahead financially and the bills are piling up. I can’t get a consolidation loan because my credit was wrecked with the divorce. The IRS claims that my $2500 refund is now a $300 debt and even though they say an explanation was sent on the 14th it’s yet to arrive. I triple check everything, claimed everything and somehow their voodoo math screwed me. It wasn’t a lot of money, but it was the lifeline I needed, and that like everything else “blew up” in my face.
I still stress about people who have blatantly walked from my life without explanation and have never looked back. I still feel horrendous hurt and loss for these selfish, uncaring, lying ass-hats. They wouldn’t spit on me if I was on fire and yet I need their approval, apologies, and answers to feel whole for some reason.
I make it to what can be considered a kitchen in my way over-priced shit apartment and struggle to make coffee. I absentmindedly check my cell knowing nothing will be there. No calls or messages, no answers. I make the usual bland easy breakfast not wanting to stand anymore. I make it to my chair spilling a quarter of the coffee, as usual, on the floor. I eat and drink while the typical bull shit plays on the television news. It all fills me with more depressing thoughts that pile up on my already-mile-high mountain of emotional shit. I’ve gone past the point of caring to want to make the change. Although I am not suicidal, I don’t want to live anymore. I selfishly want someone to come and help me, not for the rest of my life or even like hospice care, just a little bit of time. Someone to cry with, someone who can just do for me a couple of days so I can be a lifeless lump, and someone who will finally acknowledge the hurt, pain, and damage the last 3 years have caused me.
A lot to ask for, I know. I am just in the grips of depression and tired of fighting my BPD feelings. I can’t afford my therapist right now, but honestly, I never felt as though it was helping me anyway. Why can’t I be that random person some philanthropist happens to help? Why can’t I have that story of when I helped the person with their groceries or cross a street, they are so appreciative they send me a gift or the waiter that gets a $1000 tip on a $50 check?
Money won’t buy happiness, but being out of debt would sure go a long way with helping me be focused on the other issues that plaque me.

When somebody loved me
Everything was beautiful
Every hour spent together
Lives within my heart
And when she was sad
I was there to dry her tears
And when was happy so was I
When she loved me

Through the summer and the fall
We had each other, that was all
Just she and I together
Like it was meant to be
And when she was lonely
I was there to comfort her
And I knew that she loved me

So the years went by
I stayed the same
But she began to drift away
I was left alone
Still I waited for the day
When she’d say, “I will always love you”
Lonely and forgotten

Never thought she’d look my way
And she smiled at me and held me
Just like she used to do
Like she loved me
When she loved me

When somebody loved me
Everything was beautiful
Every hour spent together
Lives within my heart
When she loved me

I kind of hate that I haven’t been able to listen to music or watch a movie or show without something ripping me apart.

Sunday morning. 6am. Another day off that I should enjoy, but won’t. Been up since 4:30, but laid in bed as the thoughts started to boil in my head. I got up and told my kid he could lay down in my bed so it would free up the couch and wouldn’t disturb him.
Oh, to be 15 again. I was fucking untouchable then. I hadn’t let people screw me over and everything went as smoothly as possible. Now, I sit here trying to see what I write through tears and fogged up glasses.
3 years and I still sob everyday. Every single day since. Who does that? 3 YEARS… I physically live in the now, but mentally can’t stop living in January 2019.
I have only myself to blame for 35 years of failure, hurt, and heartbreak. I wasn’t a good son or brother. I haven’t been a good man or husband. I’m shit as a Father. I’ve chosen the easy way all these years and blamed God and everyone for all the bad that’s come into my life. I’ve squandered every and any chance at happiness and fulfillment. I’ve pushed people so far away that when the leave me, they never ever look back.
I sit here in a freezing truck at Tim Hortons, drinking a coffee and smoking a cigarette Wishing that Patty would call and say please come home. That will never happen nor will she even talk to me and listen as she had in the past. I’m trying to hold on to the only things in my life that matter, which is 4 boys. I know they love me as I do them, but it kills me how readily they accepted everything.  In a matter of a day I left and he moved in and no one took offense to it.
I feel like I’m just a novelty to them. A weekend get away from the other 3 or 2 annoying brothers. The oldest 2 have cell phones, but never call or message me for nothing. Just like all the others my phone sits silently on the table beside me. If it wasn’t for Bill collectors and spam calls it would never ring.
Maybe I am narcissistic. I’m to blame for my and other’s unhappiness, but I’m too blind to see it. I pushed Patty into the arms of another. A man that doesn’t live thinking of past regrets and hurts. I just can’t understand how she could dump me after years together and act as if we never were. I never abused her physically or mentally. I stressed everyday about her happiness and my possible failure to make her happy, but never put forth the efforts needed. Maybe she did show signs or tried to tell me, but I was too stupid to see.
I know people would be sad if I left this world, but I also believe that they wouldn’t grieve for me as I have them. There wouldn’t be a funeral or remembrance. There wouldn’t be an obituary in the paper. There would still be people who have no idea for years. Who would even make the decision about what to do with my body? My kids are to young. Patty apparently hates me. My Sister would see it as how I once again burdened her life. My brothers would shrug their shoulders and do nothing. This is my legacy. To be forgotten and not talked about. A man who wanted nothing more than to have a family. A loving wife and children. Now I’m the sperm donor that a woman had the misfortune of being with. The Father of 4 boys who were raised by another man. The brother who was a burden. The needy friend. The bad neighbor.  The weirdo that sat in his truck for an hour at the Tim Hortons.  The oddball who would tell inappropriate jokes and uncomfortably flirt. The fat, bald, and ugly guy. The piss poor employee and coworker. The forgotten guy the graduated with us.
That’s who I am. If I’m lucky I might just be an after thought to someone.

I’m sitting here like I do every Sunday evening just hating myself. Hating who I was, who I am, and who I have to be. I’m writing this because I have absolutely no one to talk to. I haven’t been able to afford to see my therapist. That’s funny, it’s what anyone who actually does talk to me tells me to do, see a therapist. Then the conversation is over.
So, yeah I miss talking to people who mostly blow me off and frankly don’t care anymore. Sometimes I get so desperate I call the suicide hot line, just to hear a voice.
I’m not stupid, I do realize there are hundreds of men in this predicament. I read the same stories as mine on several different sites, hoping somehow there would be some trick, hack, or answer to my misery. Honestly I have seen the answers and things I need to do and I just don’t have it in me to do them.
It’s Hell when you are your own worst enemy. I don’t understand why I’m still grieving my lost marriage and family, when no one else has even shed a tear. I need help, but not therapy, not the several anti depression and anxiety pills. I need that sit around a backyard fire pit help. The ” I just thought I would stop by” help. The call to see how I am help. The included type of help. I even settle for the call from my kids help. None of this has happened for the 3 years since things ended. Yes I get the boys and I talk to them, if I call.
This is the same shit I write constantly here, I guess I can understand while people avoid me.

I’m angry with myself. I’m angry at life. I’m angry at people.
I’m angry with me
I hate that I can’t move past and move on from this. I’m tired of crying at least once every day for a life I lost and will never get back. I wrack my brain every day to understand why this all happened. Every day is just one long sigh. Plans made the day before taking a back seat to the worthless feelings that overwhelm me. I hate I can’t get the effects of my BPD under control as I should after spending close to thousands of dollars to learn how.
I’m angry at life
WTF!!! Why do the shittiest things keep happening to me? What has living a moral, ethical, and caring life brought me? Nothing. All my relationships have ended with no choices of looking back or reconciliation. When people are done with me there are no looking back, no smoothing things over, or no friendships. Patty locked me out of her life so completely, it was like we never met even though she lives in my family home and has 4 children with me. If this was all about finances, why the total hate? She rushed things so fast with this guy, there wasn’t even a chance for me to work things out. Every loss I have had is so final whether it was a death, a breakup, a fight, and even a mistake. How is it that some of the most terrible people in the world have seemingly great lives? How is it that he lived such a fucked up life, but now has my ex, my family, and most of my possessions?
I’m angry at people
Speaking of “him”, what kind of scumbag preys on another’s sadness? Knowing that she was married and sure, she was unhappy with things at home, but you decided to stoke the fire. Offer the things she says are the issues and convince her not to talk to her husband about them. What kind of scumbag comes over the same day 4 young boys have watched their Father have to drive away cry for their Mother. Yes, I can’t blame him for all of it, she had a huge hand in it too, come on… I am so sick of the world these days. I’m sick that I was born in a generation that started this whole selfish, it’s all about yourself, view of life. People take the easy way out and then shut themselves off instead of just talking it out. Patty literally pissed on 20 years of a very non-problematic relationship without even trying to explain her hurt to me. She let this man, who for all intents and purposes she knew for maybe 2 months into her life force me out. She has never talked to me or even the boys as to why. She has never been out of his sight for an hour to even think of what she has done to me. Or maybe she knows. Maybe she enjoys the fact that she destroyed a man because she can.
My Sister and friends essentially spit in my face when I needed them. Made me worst when I tried to explain how I feel and what the pain was doing to me. These people I have held when they lost things in their lives. I never uttered the words to any one of them “get over it”, “man up”, “we don’t want you around if you’re going to be like that” or the gem my Sister hit me with the day Patty said she wanted a divorce, “You better not keep the fucking boy’s from me”. There were no hugs, or “it will get better”. They just kept the hurt growing. I so wanted my Sister to help me process things I kept calling, begging, and texting her just so I could feel like my world didn’t blow up, but all I got was a threatening text from my Brother in Law warning me to stop bothering her or he would personally end me. Yeah, that’s what he said, end me.

I’m sorry. Every day it’s all the same shit, just creatively written in a different fashion here. I’ve thrown my “problems” into a world of children dying from disease and hunger. Wars and needless deaths. Real depression and mental issues. Horrible abuses and abusers. People who have never had a relationship or children. Orphans and widowers. I am the selfish generation I hate so much and I’m paying for my sins. I feel like I will be paying for them until my last breath.

They say be careful what you ask or wish for. This too, along with anger is on my mind. Somehow the subject of her new husband came up last night with my son Morgen. I wasn’t asking, he made a comment about something we were watching about him, which unfortunately I took as an invitation to ask the really stupid questions I never should have. Apparently, my boys all do things with him. You know, all the things I did or wanted to do as they age. On one of these “trips” with Morgen, he told him of how he “met” my ex. He supposedly fell instantly in love with her, as I am sure any man 20 years older than a woman would. He went on to say that once he learned she was married, he backed off, yeah right. When he found out she was unhappy though all bets were off. He actually told my son that he promised my ex that she would never want for anything unlike “your Father” has done to her for years. Oh, he assured my son that he thinks I am a good man, but that his mother needs more than I could give her.
 
And so, just one more person that has come into my life and has taken something or someone from me without thought or regrets. That’s been my story all my life, losing. In school, people would take credit for things I did or steal the girl I liked. I never had a “bro code” with my best friends and that was plain to see when Tony immediately hooked up with a girl I just broke things off with. I honestly was happy he got a girlfriend, but it turned into “I can’t hang out with you because she’s your ex” bull shit for the rest of high school and now like then the other 2 guys I considered friends all hitched their wagons to Tony and left me standing there alone. I guess I shouldn’t have put so much hope in them nowadays and how they have turned away from me.
I am pathetic. What a worthless waste of skin I have been for all my life. I have all the answers I have ever asked for right in front of me. It’s always been me. I’m reached for the moon when I had no business in the stars. No one pities me as much as I pity myself and no one cares that I have and constantly still get walked on and over by everyone. Two marriages, two wives have seen me as a no-good, worthless piece of shit and they ran at the first chance and never looked back, never even acknowledging I was in their lives. My friends and siblings, not one once of compassion, just frustration that I was bothering them. My own children, never questioning why mom made dad leave or who was the new guy who showed the exact same day and has never left. It’s as if the last 32 years of my life never happened. Like a twilight zone episode, I run to each and everyone who has been in my life the whole time, and not one of them remembers or knows who I am.
The only thing keeping me on this side of the dirt is my conscience. If I was to just leave and disappear I would constantly quilt myself for others’ troubles or sadness. The same people who won’t piss on me if I was on fire. I have to assure myself constantly that I am important to my children because if I don’t I don’t think I would ever hear from them. Also, I could never just leave, I have nothing and no one. No savings or retirement.  I realize I have a problem. I know I need mental help, but what can you do when you can’t afford all that? Where is my guarding angel to enter my life and show me I matter?  Where are my 3 ghosts who visit me and show me I matter?  Where is my Clarence on the cold, snow bridge I want to jump from? Like it or not, Patty has him, he swooped in with his money and saved her from the horrible man I was. My sister has her husband who threatened me away from her, my own sister. My friends, they have each other, and frankly, I wasn’t part of their lives since 1987 no matter what I have done for the both of them. I have never been able to count on either one of my brothers, ever. The only people who I knew would be there are now dead and gone. 
No matter how much I scrub and wash or change I wear this shit on me like a cloud of dust on Pigpen from Peanuts. I guess the only way I can make how I feel understandable is like this: A flower needs care, water, and sunshine to live and thrive. If it doesn’t it wilts and dies, but if someone notices it just before the end, they can nurse it back into health. I really believe I’m at that point. The point is I just can’t do it for myself and I need help, actual help, not questions by therapists to make me work out what I already know. I’m an indoor plant sitting on a ledge where I’ve been left all alone with nothing. All the people who I thought would be there, have left me to wilt, and frankly, no one wants a half-dead house plant.

I subscribed to Paramount plus. This is not an advertisement, but rather a better understanding of how things in life affect me or trigger me.
I’ve been watching the series Bull and this episode he and his ex wife/ girlfriend have their baby. It has torn me to pieces watching it. Four times, well actually 5, but 4 times me and Patty were right there like that. Me holding her hand an comforting her as she was in labor. Holding both her and each one of our boys. The last one, Caden, was born and there was a scare. Not him, but her. They couldn’t control the bleeding.  They took Caden to the nursery and told me I had to leave. The worry and hurt I felt for that 1/2 hour was unexplainable. She was my whole world and I prayed and prayed that she wouldn’t be taken from me.
Every one of our children’s births were incredibly special to me and I thought they were to her also. How could you turn away from a person you go through all that with. Four times. How do people not think of that and not realize the love that was there and not want to do everything to save that for each other and the kids?
I guess my problem is I am 50 years old and I am still totally naive about love and how the world works. As I have said over and over, we didn’t have an abusive relationship. We didn’t have petty fights and never went to bed angry. I did everything in my power to make her happy and comfortable. I didn’t realize I had Borderline Personality Disorder then, but I knew something wasn’t right with me. Yet I kept it from affecting her or at least I believe I did. I had my blue moments, my worthless feelings, my issues. I talked to her about things and why I was sad, mad, or just weird at different moments. She never said that I was bothering her with it. She saw what I went through when my daughter died and when my parents died. She was the calm in the storm of my mind and all I asked of her was to be there. I could have the most heart wrenching day filled with pain, sadness, anger, and loss and it would all melt away when I wrapped my arm around her in bed. The only thing that ever quieted my thoughts was that, holding her.
I have yet found a way to stop the thoughts and the bad since. I have taken most types of medications for my anxiety and depression and although initially they work, it never has gone away. I want it to go away. I want it all to go away.  I’m serious, I want to try Keritan or TMS. Right now I would even do shock therapy or a lobotomy to make the hurt stop. I would rather be a zombie and not think about her, then to continue like this.

They say it takes a year for every 5-7 years you were in a relationship to get over it. I’m in my 3rd and I am hard-pressed to see the light at the end of the tunnel. Grieving would be so much easier if someone grieved with me. Unlike death grief where multiple people feel the loss, relationship grief is a deep hole in darkness lonely grief. People have chosen to either ignore me or scold me about all of this. Maybe my anti-self is my worst enemy. He pulls and tugs me down with a hard grip on me where I just can’t move. Meanwhile, I see the shows, movies, and real-life stories of others’ recovery. That one friend, that one sibling, or the stranger who comforts and helps the other through their pain. Helping to build them up and change their views of life, or discovering that they are the right person in the other’s life and all ends beautifully as the man or woman sits with their friend, family, or new love as the sun rises on a new day. That’s not happening for me.
Oh, I have been given some sage advice from a lot of people, friends, and faceless strangers, but no actual contact. Nothing close to a sit-down over coffee or dinner. No family celebrations or get-togethers. Rather, I burden others or creep them out as I ask for some company.
I write these entries at least 2 times each week since I started OD. You would think they have helped me and the comments would inspire me, but they don’t. I guess I’m wired differently than most people. The stark dropped me several times before my delivery.  Maybe after years of believing words from Patty’s mouth only to be destroyed by her, words just don’t do it for me, whether they come from people or professionals. 2 years of therapy and I feel as though I never changed all that much. Robin is a wonderful therapist, but I could see a hundred more and still come out feeling this way. I know this. I think I understand what would help me and I have made several attempts that all failed miserably to where they just made things even worst.
Would it be unfair of me or just not right to want someone to come into my life and “nurse” me back to normal? I have for others. I’ve seen people do it for others.  Hell, my ex’s new husband saw her when she was “unhappy” and made every effort to help her to destroy me and my life, without her having any sort of remorse.
Guess I am extremely jealous that most people have had that one somebody who was in love with them. The kind of love I wasted on Patty for years, that was never returned. I have never been pursued. I have never been convinced that even though I will end someone, I will be ok. Not one person in my 50 years ever stressed or thought of my feelings or even came back to me when they were over. They were done, like a banana peel I was tossed away never to be thought of again. There is no one out in the world who is sick with worry or stressed over me. I will admit, there have been a couple of times I have ended a call or text with the words, “I just don’t want to live and I’m going to end it all”. No wellness checks by police showed at my door. Neither did the people I said this to or another they may have asked to check in on me. I wouldn’t hear from them until I once again called or messaged them and even then I wouldn’t hear back. The handful of people who saw what this has done to my health and sanity have also never, out of the blue, checked in with me.
Why should they? Why should you? Why should anybody? Everyone has their problems and very few are like me whose emotions seem to be dependent on making others happy, healthy, and safe. Maybe I should have been a priest or a minister. Seriously, you like your priest, your minister, and your vicar, but have you ever thought of their feelings, failings, or happiness? You just assume they are all about God and they are never alone. No one sits around thinking about their issues. They’re all so together, they have a purpose. I mean, when do you ever see a sad and depressed minister. If I was one it would be a perfect fit. I would give to everyone, be their support, and the voice of reason and absolutely no one would have to be there for me, because they all assume I am backed up by God. I’m not a common human, I’m a priest.
I will be seeing my psychologist tomorrow. I am fully prepared to ask for ketamine treatment, shock treatment, or magnetic treatment. I just want to become a zombie. I would even settle for a lobotomy if that’s still done. I would rather be a babbling drooling zombie sitting in a padded room than how I have felt and been treated these last few years.

Saw the psychologist today, so of course now I’m over thinking everything. I’m tried of grieving my marriage. What keeps playing in my mind is how could she do this.
How can anyone do this after 20 years and 4 kids and essentially a problem free marriage? I don’t understand how she could have been so troubled to immediately end our marriage and within days bring someone in and essentially get engaged in a month. As far as I know she knew him 2 months. She wasted no time getting married a year later, days after our divorce being final. I mean, I know about instant love and shit, but all the years we had. I think I deserved some form of respect. If it was about money, the here’s my crimes. In 20 years we had 2 vehicles repossessed. Why? Hospital bills, utilities,  and feeding the kids. We were behind on taxes. They were, as I told her, paid with our tax return.
There you go. My crimes. Because of this I have lost everything and everyone. Because of this I had to begin, with nothing, all over.
All I want is to hear from her why? Her life isn’t any different. Same job, same house, same car. The kids are there 24/7 and haven’t changed or seem to be affected. The guy jumped right in playing dad and no one said anything. 20 years of building,  making, and enjoying a life, gone in less than a day as if I was never there, literally, hand to God.

“If you love something, set it free. If it comes back, it is yours. If it doesn’t, it never was.”

What a freaking stupid saying this is… What a brush-off this phrase is to someone. To me, it ranks up there with saying:

” If you love her/him, you should be happy for them, even if they’re in a new relationship”

Do you know what that says to me? It says that somebody just does not want to talk to you about your pain or if the “leaver” says it, it’s just a condescending way of them not taking the blame for their part of the break up while being a total sarcastic asshole. Think about it. If you love your ex and it’s tearing you apart for years, you at least should have a smile because your ex is having the time of their life because they trashed yours. It’s like being in a horrible car crash with a drunk driver. You are permanently disabled and will have years of pain and suffering, but you should be happy for the drunk driver because they walked away uninjured. That’s fucked up, isn’t it? Yes, I’m a Christian and I should forgive my enemies and my abusers, but I’m a fair-weather one and I just cannot. Although, between here, Facebook, and even Reddit, I have been answered with good advice and understanding, yet in the “real world” I have been nothing but blown off by everyone and their brother.

” No crying over spilled milk”

Much to my dismay, the psychiatrist would not prescribe anything to allow me to be a Zombie as I wanted. I have never been a fan of drinking so I can’t drink the thoughts away. Same with drugs, hard drugs I mean. What has always helped me is apparently lost to me now. My parents are dead and gone, same as my daughter.  Everything else is MIA. Quite literally I would have to not watch tv, listen to music, shop at 6 am, and never leave the house except for work and even there refuse to wait on couples, to not be triggered into my depression. Anything to avoid couples in love and families. Almost everything reminds me of what I lost and the only thing that doesn’t is going to the bathroom. Yes, that sounds stupid, but it was one of the only things I did without her or the kids.

I guess some people just can’t be cured or can move on. I am one of those people. Other than her leaving me for him, there was nothing else that made me unhappy with her in the 20 years. Obviously, I cannot say that about her, but she did a masterful job of convincing me that there wasn’t.

I’m tired of talking about this. The whole healing everyone says will happen if all I do is journal my thoughts, doesn’t seem to have done anything for me. I just feel like I was a total waste of a person. I have done nothing to make anyone’s life any better. Even my children have thrived without me there to guide them. He’s there for that.

” He may have been my Father, but you’re my Dad”

I’m not sure what I will write going forward, it may just be my uneducated radical thinking about things.

I turned 51 today. Woke up to a text from my first ex wife Vikki. That was actually nice, but par for course since it was the only message I have received from anyone.
Put in the call to my kids and got ” Happy Birthday ” sang to me on speaker.  So I guess I can chalk it up to a good day.
It would be kind if nice to hear from Patty since she was a big part of birthdays, but I shouldn’t expect it anymore
Well it’s 3pm and what’s done is done. Guess I’ll down a few sleeping pills and wrap up in my blanket and sleep another crappy Birthday away…

20 minutes the 26th is over. The birthday wishes on here were awesome…Thank you.
I’m still sad I didn’t hear from Patty, which is stupid. I’m a man born into at the wrong time. My thoughts and feelings on relationships are obviously out of date in the world we now live.
I just never thought I would be at the point where I would spend holidays and birthdays alone and forgotten. It was nice to hear all my boys when I called them, but would they have remembered to call me? Would she have had them call?
Nothing from my friends or siblings. Why should they, they’ve haven’t over the last 3 years.
I’m just not ready to live like this, but I’m just going to give up on the race and just sit down and try to breath.
Wow. I am a worthless waste of skin and bones. I just refuse to see the opportunity I have laying in front of me, instead stuck in the past in a life I will never have again.  Oh there will be visits here and there from my kids, but I will always be on the sidelines.

I woke up today feeling like s#$t. Not exactly physically, but just overall mentally. I’m tired of saying this but I don’t want to live this way anymore. My heart and my head are held captive by someone who I seriously think wouldn’t shed a tear for me I’d I was to die today. I really don’t understand why or what I have done to her and everyone. I hate the fact I can’t seem to embrace this new life. New freedom.  Maybe because I’m living all my fears. I’m alone, no friends or family. My sons are there, but they have their own lives and have almost instantly excepted their “step father “. He now is their day to day Dad and I’m just the weekend get away. I never did anything to deserve this. I can’t shake the feeling that I am going to die alone. That I will laying in some hospital alone and pass away, only hearing the machines around me.
I haven’t been able to save even $5 in these 3 years. I still live in a long dead marriage because I am still paying loans and bills. I have to write a check every week to my ex in her new married name. She doesn’t need to ever think of me at anytime. The kids never ask her about me and I’m sure in her mind, she has convinced herself to see him as their father. As yesterday,  no happy birthday. I never get updates on the kids. Never get told of their accomplishments or anything.
I can’t write anymore right now. I need to call someone like crisis services or try to get intouch with my therapist. My anxiety is going through the roof.

I stopped by to see my boys about 4 hours ago. I haven’t stopped sobbing since. So many things going through my head that I’m about to just pass out from. I have no clue why I take the several pills every that is supposed to help me deal.
I miss my kids and even her. I just want my normal back. I haven’t had a day yet that my eyes haven’t weld up with tears and any of this makes sense. Over 3 years…
I anxious, I lost most everything I had. I have no savings, no rainy day fall back, and no retirement  savings. I stress every day as I live on the thin ice. If my job was gone tomorrow I’m screwed. No where go, no one to help me, and absolutely no support.
I’m at a loss about how people think or act. I used to be able to understand. How can a person spend 20 years with someone and instantly turn off all feelings like a switch?  Why does my dumbass still care about everyone who has ever hurt me? Why can’t I just stop like that?
I’m just so f@#ked in life right now. One more false move or set back and what little sanity I have managed to push together.
I’m mad at myself for not being a “man” about things. Like I’ve been told to “grow hair on my balls.” I’m mad at myself for mentally not being able to move on or get over. It’s been 3 years and here I am again writing the same entry just maybe changing a word or two. I’m mad that after 2 years of therapy and depression anxiety pills have done nothing for me.
I’m lost as to why I can’t seem to make a friend or meet a girlfriend. I’m not looking for a rebound or to make another over to be Patty. Christ, I’m 51, I know that soul mates don’t exist, but there has to be a woman out there that doesn’t want to be constantly alone. I’m not looking for a physical thing. If it goes OK, if it doesn’t for months ok,  I’m being real here, by this age most people have been through the ringer and understand that all our hopes and fantasies just don’t happen, but companionship still is nice and for the most part needed.
All I want to do lately is to just throw out all my stuff. Just keep the TV, couch, and bed. I don’t know how to decorate so I live in a dark blah apartment.  I was stupid to think someone who see me suffering and step up to help build me up or even give me push.
 
And if you’ve paid attention to my verbal diarrhea every day, I still haven’t heard from anyone, just an out of the blue Birthday greetings from my 1st ex wife and that’s only because mine is a month before hers on the 26th of March.
I kind of want to go outside and dig out a lawn chair and freeze. Enjoy the sweet cold air and the quiet of night and just close my eyes…

I’m feeling defeated today. Left for work with dishes in the sink and an unmade bed. I skipped breakfast. All I want to do right now is shut out the world, which unfortunately you can’t do with a sales job. The drive to work seemed to take longer than usual and the atmosphere at work is kind of numb, which is about the only normal of today.
I know it’s part of the BPD to think that I am less than and feel left out or looked over by people, but I just feel very unimportant and useless here. I literally know how to do everyone’s job here while the others know just theirs. Every day, I listen to the sales manager and the cashier/title clerk talk. joke, and discuss work without so much including me. I have been regulated to dealing with the more undesirable calls and customers. For 2 years and I am still talked down to as if I don’t do anything. I have kept this place viable by working with Craigslist, Facebook, and NY DMV. I have saved this place a number of times as far as the ability to perform the DMV stuff and stay open through the covid shut down of 2020. Yet, I am looked at and treated like the kid that gets carts at the grocery store.
I had a quiet moment here so for shits and giggles I check Match. I don’t subscribe and everything is blurred out and I can only talk to the ones I did while a member. The last lady I was trying to get to know gave me the brush off a few weeks ago saying things were going crazy in her life and she didn’t have time. In fact, she stated that she was just deleting her whole account. Guess who is still there and was online a few hours ago? It’s hard not to take things personally when they just seem to happen over and over again. Once again my ex comes to mind. The fact that she jumped straight into a relationship with another that I just can’t see where the attraction is. It’s hard to realize that you are or have become an undesirable nobody in 20 years of marriage.
I know the answers. Beauty is also what you project and your personality, blah, blah, yadda, yadda…
As I said, I’m defeated.

So after long last, my sister finally sent a text to me. Essentially it was all I expected it to be. This has been all my fault, although, as she says, my ex is a lying cheating bitch. Somehow all the years she was supposedly depressed and had issues, mine are just imaginary figments of my imagination. As she also put it, she did not have Mom and Dad bailing her out like I did and it was Mom’s fault that I am the way I am. Ah, the mom/daughter relationship. Forgotten are the memories of how my parents paid for a college that she never completed or paid for her first marriage. Forgotten are the times my Dad found and paid for her first few cars and their repairs. Yet, I am the total user that has never learned to be self-sufficient.
I was told once again how she and my kids are devastated by my divorce and my hurt is nothing more than being a child about it. How I lost the home that my parents slaved to get and maintain, even though her direct actions when my Mother signed it over to me gave Patty an equal share against my Mother’s and my opposition to it. This was thrown in my face as if I wanted it. Everything she does that doesn’t work out is due to the other’s incompetence and never hers.
I was reminded if I only would have listened to her 3 years ago I wouldn’t be in this position. For the life of me, all I can remember is how at my most hurt and vulnerable point she yelled at me and made it totally about herself. “You better not keep the boys from me.” How the next day when I reached out for the only person I thought I had, my brother-in-law threatened to beat the shit out of me if I don’t stop bothering her. At no point have I asked her for any money or help, but as I continued to read what she wrote, I was chided for asking for these things. How somehow with nothing to my name, I was supposed to get a lawyer and fight tooth and nail for everything. Every bad thing that has ever befallen me my entire life was all my fault.
She guilted me about the boys and how she and her husband are the only parents the boys know. How I and my ex never were proper parents to our kids. This comes from a woman who has never had children of her own and when she had stepkids in her first marriage essentially pushed them out as soon as they were old enough. A woman who took my niece from my brother because as she saw it he and his wife were failing as parents only to hand her right back when it became difficult to parent her.
I guess it is all my fault, she’s right. For some reason, I can’t live my life without family and I forgive and accept everyone’s criticism and blame because I need acceptance and validation. Because I can’t handle being alone. Maybe everyone is right. I have to man up, grow some hair on my nuts, choke it down, and get the fuck over it. No one is going to like that person, so I lose either way.

Another late afternoon I’m sitting here waiting on calls or texts that don’t come. I’m stressing on money issues. Both income tax returns have been kept because of reasons I have yet to be informed of. I am captive to the debt from my divorce and life to a point where there’s no light at the end of the tunnel.  I have no one to ask for help or loan. My credit was totally destroyed by the divorce.  It’s pretty messed up when someone can be a cheater and lier. Can destroy a family and another person and that person is the one paying the price for it all.
It would be totally horrible to start a go fund me or something like that. I’m stupid for even thinking that. I can’t receive and Government help because according to them I make to much. They don’t care that my bills and debt clearly is more than what I bring home. I know boo hoo, this is life and we all have issues. My ex doesn’t. She traded up I guess, well where the money is concerned.  Who can blame her, 90% of women would do the same thing. 9 out of the 10 women I’ve tried to date told me I wasn’t financially stable for them to get involved,  but I was nice and kind.
So to put it bluntly about myself, I have no friends, no siblings to lean on, children that love me, but seemed to be ok from the first day that I was gone and he was there. I have no savings or money really, I live in almost darkness and constantly cold trying to save money on utilities, I’m about to cancel my internet and will have to live without any form of entertainment. I’m down to eating the bargin basement food from the dollar store. I take toilet paper and napkins from work. I can’t get a raise and can’t find a part time job because the hours I work. Don’t have the right vehicle for Uber and to much of a gas guzzler for Door dash.
On top of all of that, the owners of the complex I live at are in default with the bank and is losing the property. I don’t even know if I will have or could afford this place in a few months.
Like I said, I was a honest, living, and true husband, brother, father, and friend. I gave everyone at one time or another the shirt off my back. All I wanted was my little family and this is how fate, karma, of God has treated me. For 3 years I have tried every day to get out of my funk, repair bridges, and find several things to feel good and appreciate, but I just can’t anymore.

Well, the evil little man that lives in my brain started to do his damage again last night. He waited until I lay in bed and tried to sleep. Maybe he’s right. I feel like no one needs me anymore. In all this time after the break-up, my sons haven’t come to me with questions or problems. I was always there to fix things and to show them stuff young men should know. They now have him to do that. The utter contempt their Mom shows me keeps her from discouraging him not to, instead as if I was never there, she’s giving him carte blanch to be the “Dad” to all 4 of them. It feels as though they also like it that way.
I struggle every day, trying to understand what it was that I did to all of them, that they just see me as a novelty and a deadbeat. Yes, I said that. I get the ” Love you” from them after I say it. That sounds petty, but is it? I’ve been made to feel like their Father, just not their Dad. I cannot remember when the last time was that any of them called me out of the blue. I used to feel important to people, but like everything else, that all changed in a day.
It’s hard living with depression and BPD, especially when you know what you need to do, but just can’t bring yourself to do it. Several times now I have put the effort into climbing out of it, only to look around and see nothing and nobody waiting on the top of the hole to greet me or cheer me on. I understand myself better than anyone and I know I don’t function well on my own. I never have, even as a teenager I needed my friends and family to fall back on. I wish I could be at the point where my bills were current and I had some savings, but it’s looking more and more like that’s just never going to happen for me. The thing is if I could only get $2000, I could have been so close, but fate or karma said no. Both tax refunds were kept from me for reasons that have yet been explained to me. I allowed myself at the end of January to breathe easy knowing that by this time I would be well on my way to financial comfort, but just as most things have been, here I sit on cracking thin ice.
Thinking about all this has literally has made me physically sick. A painful ache all over my body, crippling headache, and nauseous stomach. I no longer sleep right even with meds. Just everything has gone to shit with my body because of the worry and stress.

I can’t stand early evenings. All I want is for someone to talk or text me. I spent 20 years with someone I could talk with every single day who will not even humor me with an answer.
I just wish that somebody or even her would explain why. I’ve been told time and time again not to expect that explanation. I just can’t wrap that around my brain. Seriously, how does a person go from loving wife to total stranger? How is it she is so bitter and vindictive when, I swear to God, I was nothing but kind, loving, and caring every single day we were together.
I honestly would be ok if she said that it just happened or she just went as far as she could as my wife, of course to me that sounds stupid. Anything.  We have 4 kids together and she lives, owns, my family’s house. I went quietly, gave her everything she wanted. I so much as ask her and she threatens to get me arrested for harassment.  Who is she?
Who are all the others? I don’t know who my friends are. Maybe I never knew or maybe I was their D.U.F.F. The more I think about it, I think I have been wrong about them for all the years I knew them. I guess I never had friends, best friends..
I thought I was close to my sister. I was her baby brother, I didn’t realize I was just a baby bother. I was never close to either of my brothers, they made it a point to avoid me growing up. I didn’t do anything with them alone. Maybe my parents saw this and maybe they tried to keep me happy and comfortable because of it. I guess I let that go to my head and relied on them too much. It’s hard to learn to be an adult when you’re 51.

I feel like crap. Mentally, Emotionally, Financially, and Physically. Just blah. I want to just crawl in a hole and die. I’m taking shit from all sides lately and I can’t stop it or even understand it. I’m too old to become someone who just doesn’t give a shit about what people say or do or what I say or do. Maybe I don’t understand empathy. Maybe I’m not empathetic at all. Maybe I have been a pushover for the last 35 years and I just said it was empathy. All I know is I’ve become so used to it I don’t know how to stop and it’s tearing me apart.
I lost both of my marriages because I didn’t put up a fight. I came out on the losing hand in the divorces because I didn’t want to put up a fight. I was used by friends and family because I didn’t want to “rock the boat”. I have nothing because I couldn’t bear the feeling of others not having things. People have played me like a drum my entire life.
It’s all my fault that I have lost the will to live and fight for what I should have. Like all my life I want someone to tell me I’m ok and it will be all right, but those days are gone. My Mother and Daughter are both gone. They were my biggest and only fans. I’m not saying my boys aren’t, but they’re boys. The 4 of them are the only reason I haven’t found the hole. I’ve said it before and I will again, I’m drowning in a pool, and everyone is standing around it either watching me drown or standing with their backs turned, no one is helping or encouraging. These people have been with me most of my life and apparently, I don’t mean anything to them other than what they could bleed me for.
It’s hard to have to realize that after one of the most terrible things to happen to me, I was kind of living a lie all these years. If I try hard enough to remember times with them, I was used and never had anything come to me from them. The gifts I gave were never reciprocated. The help I gave was never offered or answered back. The simp I was to every girl I dated. The simp I am for wanting my cheating and remarried wife, excusing all the hurt I have been through these few years.
I’m just feeling shitty…

Patty, 
I’m not sure why I am writing this to you. My guess is as soon as you see it’s from me you’ll delete it without reading it. I know you know I’ve been struggling these years we have been apart. I miss you so much and the family we made together. Every where I look there’s nothing but memories of us, all of us.
I wish you would have talked to me then and explained why you were unhappy and falling out of love with me. I would have moved Heaven and Earth for your happiness and love. People have been telling me if I really love you that I should be happy for you. I try. You remarried so fast and that hurts so much. Didn’t anything I do for you our 20 years give you some sort of pause, was it all a waste?
Do you even care about me? I can’t understand how you could just shut it off, even as you developed feelings for him. You know it doesn’t change anything with him to still care for me. I’m not stupid, I’m just lost and I need to understand before I can move on. 
I gave you everything in the divorce and took on our debt so you had a new start. Why do treat me like I did nothing but abuse and hurt you, when all I did was to love you and keep you safe and comfortable? 
None of this is fair for either of us. Why couldn’t we have talked about things or cry about the end of a beautiful 20 years, even if the result was the same? I can’t see a life without yet and probably never will, but we were always talking and I miss that. Every day from the first we talked, it never old or tedious. We never went to bed angry and woke each morning to a kiss and hug. I’m glad you allowed me to have that one more time back then. If it would have known that was the last time you would be mine, I wouldn’t have let go.
I’m sorry. I’m not really being adult by writing this, especially since it’s been over 3 years and you’ve been remarried for over half of that time. I also now that you have told me to just keep it about the boys and anything is harassment. You know me better than anyone has ever, you had to believe this was going to wreck me after losing Kayla and Mom after the years of all the stuff she said with her dementia. You know that no one talks to me or contacts me. Other than the visits with the boys I have spent all this time alone.
I just wanted to appeal to the little piece of me that still is in your heart or at least I hope is. I love you Patty.
I’m apologize for bothering you,
Colby

Yet another anxiety attack. Sounds dumb, but after having so many in the past few years, I have stopped worrying that I am having a heart attack. I hate them. I just feel so angry, sad, and scared and I can’t control it. Yes, I am doing the breathing exercises and mindfulness stuff. I’m trying to just concentrate on the things around me. I hear the hum of the fridge in the office, the typing I am doing, and the occasional car driving by. Yet the tsunami of loss, pain, and memories keep overwhelming the whole process. I am seriously contemplating sniffing glue just to stop thinking anymore.
Much like yesterday, this all makes me sick all over.

162,https://www.opendiary.com/m/newt316/acceptance-214-6097748/,2022-03-05,Acceptance???,"
I spent the night dreaming of being with my ex-wife. We were together and the fact she had left me and remarried was evident, but we were in a new home, just her and me. The house seemed to be a combination of older places we lived and straight made-up ones I may have thought about. it was just her and me, no kids, and we were cleaning and had several teenage kids helping clear out the junk that was left behind. I woke up at 3:30 am and have been up since.
I think the writing is on the wall going forward, I’m totally on my own. I lost count on the days I have sat around waiting for someone to call or message me. She, Patty, has totally cut me and the memory of our relationship out of her life. I believe in much the same way that she wishes our kids weren’t mine and somehow his. I’m losing the memories of her touch, the warmth of her body, and the smell of her hair. I can’t get or stay warm in bed as I did back then. I can’t remember who I was for the last 48 years of my life since this has happened. I can only remember the hurt and anguish of the last 3. Losing her, friends, and family. Covid panic and now the whole Russian thing and how the prices of things going sky high to a point where I have to choose between eating and paying rent or gas for my truck to get to work. I’m not a young man anymore and the shit food that is cheap will only make me sick.
So, I’m going to have to accept that my dreams are over. The only life I wanted will never happen. No one will come into my life to help make the loneliness and sadness go away. That the days of family Christmases, Easters, and Thanksgiving are over or that my Birthday is just another day that I somehow annoy people about. The only people that will seem to really care will be paid professionals. I have to accept that I will have to work until the day I die and when I do it will be nothing but a burden on my children. I have to accept that I’ve totally fucked up my life with all the stupid easy choices I made throughout my entire adult life.
I’m stuck with a $55,000.00 student loan for a wasted degree in a field I had no hope of getting into, that I deferred for 16 years and will not be in any financial place to make the payments along with rent, child support, and the 2 loans I was stuck with paying off. I didn’t fight for my right 1/2 share of my home in the divorce that would have to give me a start on this whole new life, instead, I thought of my children and my poor ex’s wellbeing. I more or less gave her new Husband possibly the best relationship a man could ask for, an instant life without all the terrible living one must do to make it. He got a beautiful wife, great kids, a home with no mortgage, and all the stuff a man could want and no one has the slightest of guilt or pity for me.
*TRIGGER WARNING*
Where was God for me? I spent the first 18 years of my life in the church. I prayed and worshipped like a fanatic. I took pride in being an acolyte and an altar boy, lighting the candles, helping with communion. Like a freak, I went to everyone to share the blessing and sat wide-eyed as I was confirmed. WHY??? For both of my marriages to fail? For my 22-year-old daughter to die and also be responsible for killing her friends several years before in an accident? My daughter had such a shitty life even with as much as I could do for her, which in retrospect, wasn’t enough. For having to spend the last few years of my Mother’s life, the one person that was always there for me, as her dementia made her say the evilest and vile things a Mother could ever say to her child. Then she die a little over a year later, to take my Wife from me and give her to a man that had done nothing but live a crap life. As the lovely pastor who counseled me and also knew this man told me how he “came” to the church. So this f#$k gets my wife, kids, home, and possessions because he all of a sudden came to Jesus??? Me though, I have to endure yet one more “test” in a 30+ year “test” of faith? This “caring” man of God pastor married them, knowing full well that their relationship was built on adultery.
I think I have finally have got to a point where I’m “brave enough” to do it. That long walk off a short pier. That falling without a parachute. That not using the brake at a busy intersection. I’m a burden, a problem, embarrassment, annoyance, mistake, joke, and failure to everyone in my life. how would staying around or not be anything different? I would just leave and go if I had the money to, but I don’t, I am in a deep hole that I and they dug for myself and I don’t see any way out.

I miss the time when I looked forward to weekends. The family dinner I would make for me, Patty, and the kids. Just that time with them all. Now I dread the loneliness and sadness. The phone just sits here. Plans I thought were made just don’t happen, so I’ve stopped asking.
Because I am doing all I can to get out of debt, I don’t go anywhere.  At $4 what little mad money I have goes to filling the truck for the week.
I don’t know why I am writing this, I’ll keep it but who cares. It’s been 3 years of me sitting and hoping that someone would be there for me to just sit and talk over coffee. I honestly have been allowing the thoughts to come into my head. My kids are good and no one else cares. It’s going to be a long night.. 😪

164,https://www.opendiary.com/m/newt316/tuesday-2562-6098912/,2022-03-08,Tuesday,"
I finally found out why the IRS adjusted my return into a bill yesterday. Apparently, the “free” stimulus money wasn’t free at all. It’s not considered income, but somehow they figured out a way to get it back. It would have been nice to have informed taxpayers of this instead of hiding it within some mind-numbing political lawyer-like bill that the average person can’t or won’t read. Also, when they finally send a letter explaining if or not you can claim it, it was essentially 6 weeks into the season. So next year I will get screwed with claiming my kid because he will be 18 for a couple of weeks.
I have tried to be positive, yet I haven’t caught a break since the marriage ended. I got to say that it just doesn’t help to get advice from several people who have never been through a divorce or even been dumped. My ex is one of these people. She has maybe 2 boyfriends in school and dumped them both and then we got together. I guess she found Jesus in this new relationship because she can’t seem to talk to me because we’re divorced. Who cares that she lives in my family’s home and we have 4 children together. She has cut me out of her life completely. I’m not stupid, I realize you don’t talk all lovey-dovey with your ex especially if they are remarried, but you can still talk. Yeah I know, I’ve said this at least 200 times since I have been writing here.
I’m just as annoyed with myself for whining about this as I am sure people are reading or hearing it.
Truth is, I have no life to write about. Not that $3.99 breaks the bank, but it’s like throwing money into a wishing well, nothing comes of it. You don’t think I think the same things over and over? I have for 3 years. It’s all I do. With all the trying, all the exercise, all the healthy eating, and living, all the attempts to make new friends and hang out, all the therapy and medicines, I can’t get out of my head. Why is it when I lose, I lose so completely? I’m not special to anyone, I thought maybe my kids would have been at least a bit lost without me, but they, like everyone, just accepted my ex instantly ending things and moving a new man into her life. My heart tells me they love me, but my head knows that like most people, they never call, text, or write me.
So, let me tell you my sins. I lost several jobs during my marriage. Whether or not it was my fault or because I chose to, I lost them. I had never made a plan for our future. No 401 and no real savings. I essentially lost 2 cars to repossession. I am to blame for losing our first home, which was in her name. My Borderline Personality Disorder, which I did not understand I had at the time, caused me to be depressed and “woe is me”. That’s it. I realize I was hard to live with, but she never sat down and explained how it was making her feel even though we talked constantly. I never abused her, lied to her, cheated on her, and I always got us through things.
Screw it. I suck. I’m bald and short, overweight and ugly, and I should be happy that I can look back on life and say there was at least one person who a daily basis suppressed their gag reflex and somehow stayed with me until a better deal came along. The only unconditional love I ever felt came from two people who are long dead and gone. It’s been a hard but understandable lesson I have learned about how no one really cares or cared for me. I’m just a troll that hasn’t found the bridge to hide under.
I really wish I could write something special about my day, but I can’t. I wake in pain and sadness, crying over the dream I had. I force myself to shower, eat breakfast, and take my handful of pills. Drive to work while crying about how my life is shit. Get to work an hour and a half early to sit in the silence and try to compose me. Spend the day fielding the calls that the other salespeople can not understand, while they cherry-pick the big sales. I sit and listen to their comradery that never includes me even when I try to join the conversation, so I just sit in my office either writing on here or scanning the news on my computer. When the day is done, I drive home and the closer I get there the more sullen I get knowing I am returning to an empty blah apartment. I try to eat dinner with the crappy groceries I can afford. I don’t watch TV,  because when I see a couple in love or a family, I instantly lose my shit. I take the evening handful of meds along with a sleep aid, usually melatonin, and go to bed where I sit in the darkness and once again cry about the life, friends, and family I’ve lost. When I do sleep, I dream of them, not good things, but gut-wrenching pain and just being treated horribly. I wake several times every night, twist and turn, and then go back to the nightmares. I wake in pain and sadness, crying over the dream I had.
Also, it has been a month since I have heard from “the ones” who said they care and would be there for me.

It’s a hard thing to finally come to the realization that you are no longer loved and thought about. That your existence doesn’t mean dick to most everyone. Once again I found myself lying in an ER bed with just the overwhelming thoughts of dying alone and no one would find out for days or even a week. Obviously, I’m ok or I wouldn’t be writing this.
I came home and looked at my cell and saw only one message, ” Who are you taking this weekend? ” from the ex. I answered her, telling her about my hospital visit, and got, ” Fine, no one I guess.” Yes, this is the concern people have for me. I can’t tell people I was in the ER because I get that answer or I am told, “we all have our problems.”
I had a severe panic attack at work and fainted. It hit me when I was in our garage here and I fell and cracked my head pretty hard into the concrete floor. I don’t remember anything but the onset of it. The whole out of nowhere pain in the chest and cold sweat pukey feeling. I came to in the ambulance. I’ve had these before but, it’s definitely starting to scare me as I reach the age where my Mother, GrandFather, and several other uncles, aunts, and cousins had actual heart attacks.
It hurts that my marriage fell apart for essentially money issues and my ex now acts as though I am more of an annoyance than someone she “loved” for 20 years. IDK, I realize that she has no reason to console me or see me, I just always thought she would be concerned. That anyone would be concerned. I just wish that God, fate, or karma would somehow show me the reason why I’ve become a nobody to everyone I’ve cared for all my life.

I’m really trying to see some positives. My kids, they’re happy and healthy, even with me not being there or still with their Mom. They’ve liked the step-dad since the first day, it really stings. Maybe I seriously sucked as a husband and a Father. Maybe I sucked as a friend and brother too. I don’t feel like I am, but maybe I am a narcissistic asshole. I just don’t realize it. I guess I made everyone’s life hell and I am now paying for it.
Although I sat in the hospital alone and scared, I choose not to call anyone and choose to say I had no one to contact in an emergency. I’ve chosen to stop being the apparent burden to people. My life insurance goes to the boys and in retrospect, I feel I’m worth more to them dead than alive. It’s a horrible thought, but it just feels that way. ” Ethan, you want to learn to ride a bike?” “No Dad, Ed taught me.” ” Jonathan, when you come this weekend we’ll go out and practice driving.” ” That’s ok but, Ed has taken me out already and I’m used to his car. I think Mom and him are going to give me his car when I get my license.” I have essentially been replaced since day one.
So I live with that pain along with the covid crap and now the effects of the war and the government’s incompetence.  My paycheck is spent days before I get it. I can’t afford gas for my truck and am in absolutely no position to buy a “more efficient” vehicle. So I miss meals, take cold showers, and practically live in the dark to have money for gas. I make too much for social service help, but not enough to survive. My boss allows me to humor him about asking for a raise and then tells me he’ll think about it but seems to forget when I ask again weeks later. I like my job even though it always seems as though I am just here to blame the mistakes on. Besides, I don’t have the energy or money to restart again at a new one. I’m starting to explore the idea of getting a cap for the back of my truck and living in it with the weather getting a bit warmer.  Honestly, that’s where God, fate, and karma seem to be leading me no matter what good I put out into the world.
I’m starting to be embarrassed posting the same ” Woe is me ” “Pity me ” stuff every day and anyone who reads them should also be embarrassed too. At 51 I am just a child trapped in an adult’s body, unloved and unwanted by everyone around me.

I feel like I am in my own ” Ground how’s day”. It’s like I have lived the same day, everyday since January 2019. I don’t want to do it anymore,  but I have no clue how to stop it.
I just hate myself, like it seems everyone around me does. I don’t want to be so alone anymore but it really appears like I’m stuck.
IDK, I don’t know what to say anymore that I haven’t said here already. I’ve run out of ideas to help myself get out of my funk. I’m really defeated.

It’s after midnight and I’m sitting in the dark and really trying to understand where things went wrong for me. I know she cheated and lied and more or less destroyed me, but I miss her. All I want to do is talk to her and hold her again to stop feeling all the hurt and pain I’ve been through because of her.
I’m so lost in my life that I can’t live it. If there isn’t a God, then there’s no master plan and I am the problem. I am the bald ugly annoying guy. I am the cause of peoples embarrassment. I am the anchor of others dreams. I am every insult ever said to me.
Ithe way I see it, Patty was the best I could possibly do. What a horrible, selfish, and chauvinistic thing to say, I know, but I say it from a place of pain that average men know all to real. This is going to piss people off but any woman around my age that is physically appealing is either married or not around any dating site or place I would be at. What’s left are bitter women who were taken for a ride several time over the last 30 years. Women that have either let themselves go or just partied so much and so hard they look bad and act worse. Then, I’m so sorry for this, there are just plain ugly and unkempt and it’s so “shockingly” there that you can’t get past it to see the beautiful person they may be. Yet, I’m the last person to judge. Maybe way back in 1999 I was good enough looking to attract my ex so she would give me a chance to show her the real me, but no more. I’m short and bald with a big head. My smile seems forced and isn’t something to light up the room. My clothes never look or feel right, it’s like I choose to get dressed in the dark. I’m poor and starting over with nothing at 51, at time where most people have there lives and future set and now they want travel, spoil their Grandkids, and admire the life and effort that brought them to the comfort they now enjoy. I’m a washed up lover that couldn’t keep my wife, friends, and family happy and secure enough, so they .over on without me, not caring what so ever about whether I live or die. No looking back and no second chances. 20 years didn’t mean shit to her. 40 years didn’t mean shit to my friends, my “best” friends. 51 years and blood doesn’t me shit to my sister and brothers.
As I sat in the hospital this week, I chose not to call anyone because deep down I knew that none of them would care. They all found out yet not one call, not one text, and not one visit. Do you realize how hard it is to change who you are and have been for 51 years? How hard it is to build a new life without the least bit of foundation? I’ve yet to personally meet someone who didn’t have a friend or a family when they’re marriages ended. People fell over backwards to help and console my two friends when they were wronged and cheated on and going through their divorces. I was chided, yelled at, or just plainly ignored for mine, a marriage that lasted year longer than any of theirs.
What’s it matter. My life now is being behind a month on every bill. Being ignored or receiving dirty looks and being made to feel creepy for just saying hi. Starting every with the disappointment that I woke up again in this nightmare I live. Ending each wishing that I don’t wake in the morning.
I have and always will, hated myself. For being other’s burden. Being the constant odd man out. Being a shitty part time father. Not being capable to be alone. I’m just so alone.
I just miss her. She was the only person who made me feel like I mattered, and then she didn’t.

I couldn’t think of a catchy title.
And that’s how things have been with me. Everything goes back to the grey. I can’t make a decision anymore. My head hurts and my anxiety takes over. Like now, I really would like a cigarette, but i’m trying to quit, but I want one. Who cares, I guit for 3 months and nothing got better, life stayed shitty, no one was proud and I still sat alone and depressed, just without smoking. Same with food. Do you know the endless amount of bull shit you hear when you’re in the position I am in? Do something that will make you happy. I want to sit here smoke a pack of Marlboros, while I put down a bottle of RC cola, and eat a whole bag of ruffles, that would give me some happines. That’s about then only thing that would unless a magic fairy came along and zapped me back in to the life I had. No one else lost anything. I want to just go, but can’t afford using my gas, it’s bad enough I have to driive 20 miles to see a doctor tomorrow.
I can’t get or keep motivated. I just want to die and get it over with. Fuck it, i’m going to the gas station for a pack and some RC and chips. What’s the use anymore? Time to become the ugly, fat, and bald old greasy man I feel like and apperantly other’s do to too. Let’s give the fuckers what they want…

So I’m not sure if I should good or bad or once again taken in but I fell for the zoosk trap. All these likes and several messages, what could go wrong.. again…
The one girl(woman) asked to get to know more about me but that could have been the canned responses they offer. One who liked me recently is online, yet no answer to my message. I make them personal, no not creepy,  but not the stock ones like ” what’s it like living in ( insert town here) and how’s you day going..
So, much like things have been these last few years, I’ve once again walked myself into the lonely depression and hating myself. Shit.

Over and over again I wake up to face another day of dread. No matter what I try to do, my own mind sabotages me. Then it convinces my heart to follow. I used to be someone, well at least I thought I was. Why do I lose so permanently? Why don’t I ever get a 2nd chance? God, I miss it, waking to the sound of family. The whole safety, security, and love are all gone.
They say that grief takes time, that is unless you have the friends and family I have who have told me to move on or get over it since my world turned upside down. I know each one of us has our own life to live and that no one should expect help, but I see it everywhere. Friends organizing events to help another, family coming to comfort one another.
Do you know how hard it is to live with suicidal thoughts and exhausting defeat every day without acting on them? I can’t even get the strength to address them. If sad had a picture, it would be me. I am so not self-centered, but I just feel marked as though everyone got together and planned to shun me. I just want to take the final step of giving up. I do understand there are people out there who care, but they do it from afar.
Then there’s the love BS. You can’t love enough and you can’t be loved enough. Personally, I’ve had 3 people tell me they would always love me in my 51 years and they left me without an apology, explanation, and absolutely never giving things a 2nd chance. I guess it’s me, I must somehow turn everyone against me without realizing it. I must have burnt every bridge and salted the earth in every relationship I’ve had.
I don’t know what I need to hear or see to get better, but I also never understood what “better” is. Something is very fucked up in me and has been for years. Something more than Borderline Personality Disorder that they diagnosed me with. I think I seriously need to be institutionalized. Time and events tear me up. I know I should “live in the moment” but my mind is not wired that way. I am already lost about my oldest son going to college in 6 months. I feel like I failed him and his brothers somehow. That I didn’t hold them enough or play with them as much as I should. I allowed my total nervous breakdown these past years to take importance over them. I think of their sister they never got a decent chance to know and how I failed her. I’ve never been told by anyone that I did the best I could or have the understanding that I couldn’t help my reactions. Now there’s another man doing the things I should have done. Going to school conferences with their mother. Going to doctor’s and dentist’s appointments. Reading stories and tucking them in. Getting daily hugs and affirmations from them.
I want to hate. I want to be blackout angry. I want to beat him to death with his own arm and piss on his corpse. Right there in front of her. I want to burn where they work while telling their coworkers to go to Hell for backstabbing our marriage by not talking to her about how it was wrong and not letting me know what was happening. These people were my friends, most of them before she was even in the picture. Yet I’m not a psychopath and won’t do it, just like I didn’t fight for her and our family or for anything in my life. All I do is this. I whine, bitch, and complain. WHY ME? WHY ME?
All the stupid sayings about doors opening and closing, triumph from tragedy, God’s supposed plan, are all people’s ways to not talk or acknowledge my pain and having to maybe lift a finger to help or comfort me. I try to tell them what I need or what would help and I am told I am too needy or immature or selfish. All these people in relationships telling me how I should feel. The dumb shits on Youtube and Tictok who never had anything actually happen, but sit there all sad-faced while someone reads how to get on with life or how something bad happens. What a crock. DO they think they’re helping? 2 days prior they are dancing half-naked to a song about how “sexy” they are or showing how great their life is. The quotes they think are being inspirational because they are “sad” do jack shit when the next video is about dick size or how their fat asses giggle.
I hate the world…

I have never felt so ugly and unwanted as I have these last few years. From the treatment from my ex to the waste of time dating sites
I mean, I have wasted weeks on these sites with no real connections.  I guess it’s just the bots in the sites tricking me into thinking someone nice would actually send me a message.

As some of you know I took a very bad tumble a few days ago. What’s really is bothering me is no one around me has even made an effort to check in with me about it. The boys get a pass, I don’t expect them to, but others, that really hurts. Par for course I guess.
Once again I am stressing about the ex. I know, it’s like asking the sun to rise at night. I have never been one who can stomach being hated. I have never gone out of my way to even be put into the situation. As I said in another entry that I would like to beat her new husband to death with his own arm, however anytime our paths have crossed I just said nothing. I have never stood up for myself all these years. I guess that I have only myself to blame.
I’m at a loss trying to get out of debt. The thing is, just $1000 would get me on top of things but it’s not meant to be. I was screwed out of my tax refunds from the Feds and New York. My credit is ok, but all I hear is this or that about payment history, which since I inherited all the bills from the marriage I’m stuck while she got a totally clean slate.
I get so lonely I go to dating sites and they just make things worse. Besides the waste of money, I get emotionally pulled into thinking someone could be interested only to once again be made to feel worthless.
It’s warmer and sunny today in Western New York and I should really enjoy it. The sound of the spring birds returning and the clean smell of the air are all lost to me because of the pain I hold onto because I can’t let it go.

I never thought I could get any lower, but this morning I have managed to. I’m totally not built for this single life. It’s been 3 years of torture to me. Every bad thought and fear I ever had are coming to pass. With the accident and other health issues, I’m starting to realize I will probably die alone. I’ve tried and failed to put my life back on track or even to make a new one.
The wrong state of mind, I know.  I have tried therapy, medication, reading, and watching self-improvement stuff, and everything else with no improvement for how I feel. I never asked for much in my 51 years. All I wanted was to have a family like I was raised in. I had it and then one day, I had it all ripped away.
What’s the point? Every day I bitch and whine on here about how I was screwed out of everything. I read the responses I get and try to show my appreciation, but then I close the page and turn off the computer and I’m once again left alone. Everyone has moved on. My kids, my ex, friends, and family essentially from day one. You would think someone other than me would have cried or been blue, but no. It’s almost like I never existed. There’s no more point in doing this. It obviously shows that it hasn’t helped to see that every day is the same thing over and over, just written slightly differently. You win world. You have totally, horribly, and utterly destroyed and broken me.

I think the saying is, A bitter pill to swallow.
I guess I’ve finally swallowed my bitter pill, but who am I fooling, I have a bottle full to take.
Trying to be confident and let stuff roll off me hasn’t ever gone the way I have planned. Somehow I come off as arrogant. I don’t choose to live my life in the dumps, it’s just where I live. My wife, the ex-wife, left me for a man who is old enough to be her father. Meanwhile, women less than 5 years younger tell me I’m too old for them. The women my age or a bit older tell me I’m not “settled” enough in life for them, they don’t want to be with someone who has nothing as I do now. Yes, I understand that I may not be ready and I shouldn’t allow a relationship to define me, but that’s just it, I always have.
She says she has comfort and security in him. No one sees that in me, not her, my family, and honestly I don’t think my kids do either. That’s one pill.
My friends, family, and her, all see me as the dancing monkey. I made them laugh and feel better about themselves, but when the time came they all used me to get ahead or away. That’s another bitter pill.
At work when anything from a miscalculation to a form being filed wrong always lands on my shoulder, whether or not I had anything to do with it. I’m the go-to guy when others don’t want to do their own paperwork or if a caller sounds dumb or foreign or just plain undesirable to the others. I know a person needs to let shit roll off them, but even the man with the thickest of skin can only tread water for so long. I’m doing everything to get “better” but I am in a house of mirrors and my face is beaten and bloodied from constantly smacking into walls.
I want to write about happy things. My kids are healthy, that’s it, that’s all I got for you.

I woke up in a panic/anxiety attack. I can’t remember if I was dreaming. I have just managed to calm myself and I’m trying to center my thoughts here. I thought about calling an ambulance, but the pain is gone in my chest and I’m breathing better now that is passed.
I was thinking of calling a crisis line, but I don’t know what caused this and I really don’t want to some random stranger who may or may not care as they read off some script.
So, let’s see if I can work this out.

Patty is a constant thought in my head, just there like something on the edge of your vision that no matter how you turn to look, you can’t see.
Last night I sat and worked on my budget.. I’m screwed. I don’t know how I’m going manage this all. I mean $500 to $1000 would take care of so much and get things on track, but fate is conspiring against me. That and the IRS..

It had one or both of these that bounced into brain, right? I’m not losing my mind like I’ve lost almost everything else? Are all these medications giving me early on set alzheimers or dementia?. Could that account for the several attacks I’ve had over the last few months? Am I that broken I can’t control my own emotions?
I just want to call and talk to someone who knows me and cares to talk, so no one. I don’t have anyone to ask to borrow money or to help with other stuff to help relieve at least food or fuel. In NY as a single person I make too much money to get assistance. What am I going to do???

Maybe I should breakdown and blow my grocery money on pot. NY still hasn’t figured out the what and how, but our Indians have and I’m just a hop, skip, and jump from the Rez. Something has to work, right?
There is absolutely no second in my day that I’m not bombarded with regrets, longings, or mistakes. Music, television, and movies, anything with love implied or couples involved. Seeing a couple in the store or walking down the street, triggers me. All I want is to have just one more heartfelt conversation with Patty. Not a return to me one or leave him one, although I should because no one has ever thought of me when they’ve stolen my wife (wives) and girlfriends. Yes, I’ve only broken up with one girl way back 35 years ago in high school for the woman who would begin my losing streak. I have never had someone that was true to me. They’ve all cheated and eventually left me for another. I know, it must be me, I’m the common denominator in all of them. So, we have that answer.
I just want to talk to her about why. I want to know she cares about me because we spent 20 years together growing a family. She was with me when my cousin died, a friend died, my Father, my daughter, and my Mother. We made 4 children together. I don’t even care if she says the BS ” I love you, but I’m not in love with you” 🤮🤮🤮 I deserved a hugging cry together as our marriage died because I fuck sure don’t know why. This has been nothing but reverse amnesia, where I take the hit to the head and everyone else forgets me…
I’ve wrote about my fall, but never about the mild heart attack I had recently. It was what they call a Stress cardiomyopathy attack or as luck would have it “Broken Heart Syndrome”. I thought that once again I was having a panic attack, but somehow it felt different. So like the ass I am, I drove to an urgent care, and ambulanced to a bigger hospital for the poking and prodding. Seems I actually caused it by being the “winner” I am. They kept me overnight and released me, saying that although it was an attack it’s totally repairable if I just calm down, stop stressing, and relax. Three things I have yet been able to do in years. I’m just glad that the walk on the head didn’t have anything to do with it. The bills are going to kill though…LOL
So like I was saying before about no one checking in with me about how I’m doing or if they could help, still hasn’t happen except from my oldest boy Jonathan.
WHAT A COMPLETE DUMBASS I HAVE BECOME. I still think and hope for people, who clearly do not give the least bit of shit for me, to call me and see how I am. I almost feel bad because I didn’t have a widow maker where I could still be in the hospital plugged into machines and they would be inconvenienced by maybe having to bring my children to say goodbye.
And every second of every day I think about Patty and all the rest. I make myself actually sick with grief and sadness over these people, because I’m that guy. Mr. Sure you can have my first for your 2nd. Mr. Sure I’ll let you go first. Mr. Sure I won’t inconvenience your adultery by being passed off and difficult. What a joke I’ve become over the years. My kids love me, I know this, but I don’t think they ok up to me or even idolize me as I did with mine. I’m starting to not be able to see myself in them and if it wasn’t for my calls, texts, and visits,I don’t think anyone would talk to them about me.
Of course, as the title implies,  this is my thoughts in the dusty darkness of my damaged brain, where I’ve lost the ability to organize and pack up anything anymore. It’s all just one big cluster fuck in there now and it definitely shows on me now.

I have cried at least once every day in the last 1159 days.
I have broken down, worthless, hopeless, and unloved at least once every day in the last 1159 days.
I haven’t been able to come to terms with how she just stopped loving me in less than a day for 1159 days.
In the last 1159 days, she has gotten engaged, gone on several trips we never could, got everything she wanted in the divorce, had the wedding she always wanted, the dress, the pictures, and reception. In 1159 days she has managed to remove any memory of me in the house I grew up in, the home I was gifted from my Mother for my family.
In the last 1159, I have waited for the “I made a mistake” that doesn’t come. The “I miss you” or “how are you” that’s never said. In the last 1159 days, I’ve not wanted to wake up, afraid to face another lonely day or go to sleep to face the thoughts and memories that flood into the quiet darkness.
7305 days together and she forgot me and gave up in, what was for all intents and purposes, less than 7 hours. It took her 5 minutes to hurt me and 1 second to break my heart.

Last night I made my daily call to my sons. My oldest Jonathan, bless his soul, tried to avoid telling me that once again my ex and her husband had taken the little ones to Splash Lagoon in Erie Pa. I think he knows how much it bothers me that when I was there we never could afford trips or have a sitter to go on dates or overnights. He had become old enough around the time of the separation to watch his brothers so that she and he could go on trips and such. Something that feels as if it’s just one more thing held against me by her. One more thing that makes me feel I was just an anchor tied to her ankle dragging her down.
I’ve learned I don’t need to know why about the divorce anymore, I’ve more than made enough reasons to constantly hate myself for. I don’t know how to live with this dual life I now find I have to live.  Somehow making my own new path in life, but also having to make space for my kids and the constant reminder I once had nothing but all of them to live for. I get told by married people and happily single people how it’s just so easy to put it in the past and live. I was once an authority on that same outlook when I was blissfully married and surrounded by family and friends. Now living it seems dirty and wrong. I am forced to think of myself first to survive and I just can’t. The guilt of not being there 24/7 for the kids or making myself happy over her or my friends, just hangs on me like a bad smell. I stopped living for me 34 years ago when my daughter was born. To pursue my dreams was in my opinion totally selfish when there was a life depending on you. It appears I am one in a million because 99% of people do just that and somehow find the time for all the rest, that I am just not capable of. It could and very well may be how I’ve allowed most around me to guilt me since I was a preteen.
My sister and brothers would call me spoiled because by the time I was born my parents were financially secure and could afford things for me that they couldn’t as a young couple for the 3 of them. I never begged or whined for toys and shit, they just got me them. How my parents took me on the vacation trips that they chose to not go but would let me know how they couldn’t when they were my age. How my brothers never wanted me around them and their friends, some of which were nearly my age. To this day if my brother Jimmy is at a bar and I walk in, he leaves. Then came Vikki and our daughter. Thinking I was doing the right and honorable thing by marrying her, I was constantly bombarded about how I wasn’t doing this or that right from her and my in-laws and I allowed that took take over my thoughts. After the divorce, I never did anything right in people’s views so I stopped doing anything and didn’t need anyone’s disapproval, I gave it to myself, constantly every day right up to now as I write here. I had several moments of being told by my parents that they were proud of me, but that was it. Nothing from anyone else. No good jobs or keep up the good works. I’ve worked under the stress and strain, of my own doing apparently, that everything I was doing whether good or bad was not up to par. As far as my “friends” my opinions were always wrong and my views were just stupid, or so they made me feel as such. Why do I pine away for them and their support? I really never had it.
I’m not sure how to bring this to a close, I’ve just depressed myself, I know shocking…

Well where to start?
Wanted to take my son for the weekend for his birthday. I was just told by her I can’t and of course like always there is absolutely no explanation.  3 f@#$ing years and after a half day, I can never get an answer from her. What a monster I must have been..
Which comes on the heals of learning I may have a form of blatter cancer. My test came back with signs of high grade Urothelial carcinoma, or at least I think that’s how it’s spelt.
The world seems to want me to be an asshole. An asshole to deal with my manchild whiny bitch boy attitude and it also wants me to be an asshole so it can still look down on me for being one. I have to realize I’m just never going to win.

My confidence and self image were destroyed by the divorce and the months following it. The lack of friends, family, or the occasional person you bump into in life just added salt to the wound. Yes, I’ve complained about this probably every 3rd entry, I know.
Anyway, I went shopping and tried to talk and joke with several people. Nothing horrible,  just the “how are you” or “wow these prices” or the general hello. NOTHING.  ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.  Well unless you count the dirty looks, turned up noses, and frankly a look that was a cross between disgust and annoyance a something. I has brought me to another new low about how I feel about me and my looks.
Patty left me for someone I would consider not the great looking, but my opinions of him are skewed, but when I was with her and my kids in my “bubble” I didn’t care what others thought. She was always my biggest fan, until  wasn’t. I became, what I feel like, Frankenstein’s monster turned loose on the world, just without the little girl offering me a flower so I can throw here in the lake.
I no longer feel connected to anything and as much as I’ve tried, it all seems as though I am some mutant to be avoided at all costs.
If you’re thinking that’s a good picture, it took 100 takes and a shit ton of filters.

I think I figured it out, how to feel better. $1000. Just one thousand. That would get me out of the revolving debt that I can’t get a head of. Believe it or not, I like everyone live paycheck to paycheck and have since the divorce. Haven’t been able to get my credit to a point to get a loan. Let me rephrase that, I have the credit and still can’t get a loan.
Seriously, just to have one thing off the plate of worries would go so far. Truth is, I was one of the covid people who got behind on rent. Yes, I did apply for the rental assistance that was offered and yes they helped with all but one month and that has hung on me like a bad smell. Oh I budget for it and then repairs happen, hospital visits, mismanaged US and state Government that has made gas almost $5 a gallon and what cost $1 is now $3.
There doesn’t seem to be logic there. If you can’t afford your rent what makes you think if you catch it up you won’t fall behind again? Well, I can afford my rent, I just can’t afford to pay it twice in a month, unless I get paid to not work, use no electric or gas, eat every other day (ramen from the dollar store, which isn’t a dollar anymore) and shut off cable internet that has more uses than I can count. I could take showers at work, but oh yeah, I can’t afford to go to work if I’m going to get the money.
Why not a 2nd job. Where am I going to find a part time place that would work with the salesman hours I put in? Who would agree to allowing me every other weekend so I could see my kids and the ones I don’t, I have to work my main job. So essentially no weekends and possibly 12 hours during the week. The math doesn’t work and I would get maybe $75 to $125 extra. Where would this job be? Can I afford the gas to go to both. I live and work in the boonies, the country. Uber would be a waste seeing that I can’t fill the gas guzzling truck I have now and the same for dashing, did I mention I am close to an hour from any urban area to make it worth it?
So ask family members. Have you read my entries? I’m a 51 yr old man that is worse off than a 20 yr old. I had to start over with 2 pairs of pants, socks, shirts, and underwear and they all were already worn out. That’s it. Meanwhile she…. eh, fuck it, no sense in bringing it up other than the fact that if you’re a halfway decent looking woman, there’s always a guy who will pay for you.
I have made a decision though, not a good one, but one. What little possessions I do have are getting packed up. The chair, love seat, and the bed are being left behind. The weather is slowly getting better to sleep in my truck. Sure the kids will miss me for the few months I’m homeless, but I will make it up to them. Who knows I may have the money to find a new place by July, but I won’t have references since I left owing rent and left furniture.
I think it will work, just have to remember how to sleep sitting up and find a close enough rest stop from work.
Fuck my life..

They say if you feel suicidal (I’m not, just making a point) that you should call someone. A friend or family member. If this was the case, I’d be long dead.
All I  heard for months and months was to get out of that shell. Open up and talk, is what I am told and every time I do it’s like screaming in the Grand Canyon and not even getting the echo.
I don’t want to call or text a crisis line and feel like I’m being talked to by someone using a script. There seems like absolutely no real compassion or understanding from them, sorry it’s how I feel.
I also don’t have the money to see my therapist or even one on-line, but to be honest that’s not even what I’m looking for. I want something that’s gone and never coming back. Like my parents and my daughter, just gone.
You know what sounds good right now? Taking a sledge hammer and just wrecking shit. Hurting people who have never felt this way but want to tell me how I shouldn’t and how I should move on from it. Never felling this pain of rejection and loss, especially when their lives have never changed like this. The hopeless feeling that I can only imagine is like tripping on the edge of a cliff and tumbling over it. The pain and absolute panic, fear, and sick knowing there’s nothing you can do, but you madly look for someway, anyway out of it. The only difference is that people who have went out that way eventually hit the ground, where I have been falling for 3 years.

Bruce Willis. My hero for years. I was first on the bandwagon when he came on the screen as David Addison in Moonlighting. For better or worse I patterned my life on that character and Bruce.
Aphasia – the loss of ability to understand or express speech, caused by brain damage.
WTF!!! Why?
This is really killing me right now. I’m not sure how to even describe my feelings. YEAH, I know, me at a loss for words…
The past 3 years have thrust me way too fast into old age and all the fears that come with it. My health issues, friends from high school passing away, missing all this time with my kids because of the divorce, and now this with Bruce. I know it’s not like he’s dying, but retiring and out of my life in films and television hurts. Just one more brick out of my Jenga life that’s already wobbling.

What makes me just livid is the fact that she never took the time to think about it all. Never alone to wonder, ponder and even miss me and what I did for her.

A few weeks ago after one of my famous whiney bitch boy entries Muminah on OP told me to listen to Heavy Metal to drown out the “thoughts” and I fully believe it would work, but (sorry) I never really got into Metal as a kid. I liked some Judas Priest, but not much else. I have very eclectic tastes in music. I should have been born in the ’30s and grew up in the ’40s. I love Crosby, Sinatra, Dean Martin, and big bands. Sam Cooke and Nat King Cole, SO AWESOME!!! Blues music. BB King and Buddy Guy. Chuck Mangione’s Feels so good I can listen on a loop. Herb Albert is also great. Old Cape Cod by Patti Page DAMN!!!
But my all-time favorite, no matter what type of music they put out, is CHICAGO…  Never stopped liking them. I couldn’t listen to the ballads they put out since Chicago 16 and up for a while after the divorce, but I had everything before to keep me company. The one song though that instantly gets me in a good mode is an instrumental one called Mononucleosis.

I feel like I am letting all of you down. You have all given me such good advice and kind words, yet I sit here in my mud puddle beating my fists and whining. I do realize that being 51 isn’t a death sentence, but I had never felt my age and the passing of time when I was in the family bubble with Patty and the kids. Then one day it was just there in my face. 30 years of misspent living, bad choices, and decisions. No savings, no retirement plan, and the mind of a carefree teenager that stopped mentally growing the day he was told he was going to be a father in 1989. No one to turn to for help or a loan. No one left in my life to reminisce with or distract me from my pain and sadness now.
Edit: the people here around me I mean, all of you have been great. Ah.. you know what I meant.
OK, ENOUGH OF THAT
I seemed to lose everyone on the way back Chicago song yesterday. If anything maybe you have become interested in their older stuff. I’m pretty sure most people have heard 25 or 6 to 4 or Saturday in the park.
Now for a big trivia question… It’s not exactly how the theme song was, that version was instrumental, but it played this way at the end of the show. Anyway, this was just the first season theme, it was changed to a more well-known one from the 2nd season on. Yes, you need to be around my age to maybe know this.

Not decided if this is going to be a new thing for me, but it’s better than the usual entries… LOL  Let me know in the comments.

My 1st ex-wife’s mother died the other day. She had texted me about it soon after she found out. Of course, my misplaced feelings I can no longer control kicked in. I thought of her and I thought of our daughter and her passing and our grandson. In the usual way that I f%^& up with what I see as the best of intentions, I messaged Jayden’s father about things asking if he could get in touch with Vikki and have Jayden talk to her and cheer her up. Well, that just all went to shit.
I had planned on taking my son Ethan for the weekend to celebrate his birthday Wednesday but learned my sister had all-day plans with him and his friends on Saturday and wouldn’t be getting him home until well over 7 pm. I originally thought I would take him overnight, but wanted more time with him so I just messaged Patty that I would take him next weekend. She replied that she had already made it clear that she won’t allow either of the little ones to come over by themselves until I get “my shit together”. My “shit” is my health issues lately, but once again I am slapped in the face that I somehow no longer matter in the slightest to her as a person or the father of our children.
So yeah, these two things that happened minutes apart have me once again crying at work and wishing I was dead and out of people’s lives. HOW? How is it that I seem to be the only person I know that really hasn’t done the wrong thing to anyone but gets treated as though I was the worst thing that ever entered their life? I guess I should just take my chances with the relationship with my boys with the hope that they will seek me out in the future for a relationship, and just leave it all behind. Of course, I have no money whatsoever to do that or a place to go.  I guess all I can do is accept that this is who I am until the day I die and it will never change, even with the efforts I put in.

Do you know what it’s like to be totally erased from people’s lives?  I’m not stupid, although a ton of people think of me that way, I understand divorce and breakups.  People around here all say I’ve done it all to myself, even a few online also have said it, but I don’t think I did. In fact, I know I didn’t.
My trouble is I take this all to heart. Even with the vile comments and name-calling, I allow into my own issues I have about myself. I made the mistake, again, of clicking on my ex’s Facebook profile. Her pictures, shots of her and him in our kitchen, our deck. The pictures of them with my boys, like a big happy family I was never part of. The blatant cropped photos from years ago that I was a part of. I have said and will again, that I wasn’t a bad person, husband, and father, but I’m treated as though I was. Everyone, EVERYONE, accepted this from day one as if I was never part of my family. The only connection to my kids is my last name and if it isn’t asked, it’s not offered as though they are his.
I have struggled for 3 years to understand and come to terms with how this went down. It would be easy to hate her and wipe my hands of it all if my friends and family were there for me, but even they wrote me off from day one. You’d have to be the most self-centered loner to just roll with it, I am not. I excel at people’s opinions and compliments. Their support and acknowledgments. Their company. None of these things have remotely come from them all since this all blindsidingly happened. * Yes I realize that is not a correct word, but nowadays people say worse, also *

My anxiety has been through the roof all day.
All I wanted today was to talk with someone,  not even about my usual issues, just some talk. I sent messages to everyone one in my contacts, because some where along the way, calls became rude. I even went so far as to almost join an online therapy site until I found out I wouldn’t see or talk to anyone for up to 48 hours.
I just tired of falling back into the trap I set for myself. I can’t go anywhere because I can’t afford to. I couldn’t get my kids because they had plans, plans made without no consideration for me. No one will ever bring them to me. I can’t go to a bar, see the reason why I can’t go anywhere.
Some how I’m still madly in love with her. The mother of my children. My center and my calm for 20 years and ultimately my destroyer. Yet I can’t get through a day without her in my thought. She doesn’t answer any questions or concerns, in fact she has barely communicated with me after she said she wanted a divorce all those years ago. My friend, my everything thing, my life, hopes, dreams all gone and I instantly became too old.
And try as I might, every day it sneaks back into my soul.

Yes, I’m currently in the tub writing this. I only wish it was a nice deep claw foot or garden tub instead of the awkwardly small apartment one. Aw the joys of living in poverty….
So I’m thinking of changing my number. I have had it with waiting for calls or texts that never come, so in my salt the earth way of dealing, I will inconvenience myself by changing it so no one will be able to not call or text me. That will show them.
Oops, there went a gallon of water over the side and all over the floor. I wonder what life would be like if I could actually do or have something that doesn’t seem to exact a price.
As fate would have it, Morgen’s ears must have been ringing about my earlier post and he called out of the blue. He told me about how mom and Ed were tearing the walls and floors up and how underneath one of them was a wall me and my brothers and sister had wrote our names and drew some pictures on way back when I was very young. This is after all the house I grew up in. That was quickly destroyed by the both of them he told me. And he apologized for it. He should have to apologize.
I put to much sentiment into things, too much legacy. I have traced the Newton name and our male blood line to the 1300s. I wanted the boys to be proud and it all ended because of me. Through countless generations no Newton had divorced and had raised their children in a loving family.  I fucked up twice. My daughter is dead and my boys probably will never want to be married or have children because of this. Because their father failed and their showed nothing but disrespect to them and the family who took her in as one of their own.
I’m I being too dramatic,  maybe,  but I never fought with her ever in my children’s lives. I never bad talked her around them since. They saw me worship their mom and learned from me how to respect and honor her, only to see her bring in a new man the same day dad left, hours after. They watched as she let him toss out their fathers memories. Why would any one of them want to be in a relationship or bring a child into a world like this. I destroyed an almost thousand year continues unbroken blood line.
There is knights in our line, yes, Sir Issac Newton was a son of it. The man who helped settle Massachusetts is a distant grandfather and where I grew up my family’s family’s family were settled there just after the revolution of which they fought in. Then there was me. To stupid to notice things, to caught up in other’s lives that I destroyed my own and started the end of the Newton line.
I think too much in the bath, don’t I? I believe I have shown you another asinine reason why I can’t become a functional person. Maybe if my siblings had made the attempt to comfort me and to let me know I didn’t fuck up I’d be better. Or if friends helped me to feel normal or even stood up for me. Social media is like a drunk, the truth comes out. As anyone else would do nowadays, I looked at her Facebook. I saw all the loving pictures and I also saw the comments from my friends that should have been there for me.
Yes, I should build off the anger and betrayal. I should make myself better to thumb my nose at them all. I know this, you don’t need to tell me. But, I have never been motivated by hate or anger. I learned my Bible lessons. The ones that swore up and down that good things happen for good people. I apparently am the exemption to that though.

I woke up today and was disappointed that I woke up. People have always reassured me that “things will only get better”, “time heals all wounds” and all the other BS that is said when people want to brush you off and not want to help. Words, all just words. I could pull out at least several inspirational made-up quotes out of ass, but they’re just words. They are as helpful as screaming “SWIM HARDER” at a man, that can’t swim, and who is drowning. People don’t want to get wet and drag a drowning man to shore, but if they say the right words, they can walk away feeling justified in their actions of yelling words as if they made every effort to save him.
OK, I GOT TO LIVE WITH THAT!! MESSAGE RECEIVED…
I should erase all that, but I left it in. I was just “put in my place” by two people in the last 3 hours. Don’t go thinking that I was put in my place, I wasn’t. Both of them are so transparent in their views and how at the end of the day they’re right, I’m wrong and I should carry on as just a numb unfeeling man who should just do what’s asked and expected of him. I shouldn’t have or feel bad for the lost dreams, thoughts, and plans. I should just be glad if and when I may again be part of someone else’s. Well fuck, problems solved… And solved by 2 people who never experienced what I have or been on the other end destroying a man for another. Two women who by all intents and purposes, have lived charmed lives. Neither bought a home but got one from the ashes of a relationship. Two women that are both in a relationship, yet know everything about dating and such. I’m going to make a somewhat blanket statement here. It’s not about all women, but it could be. Most women don’t have to be alone if they choose not to. It’s as simple as batting their eyes or offering up some company to a man. Ok, maybe lesbians understand the guy’s view I’m saying here. Other than extremely good-looking or rich men flashing their cash and possessions, men are SOL. It sounds very self-centered of me but I think I’m the “good guy” most women profess to want. I’m decent looking enough, clean, dress nice, and have all my teeth, but that doesn’t change the revulsion in the eyes of some women when you just say “HI”.
That was harsh, but ask almost every man and I bet they would agree.
So here I am, 51 and essentially penniless. At this stage of life, choices are few and far between for a guy with a personality and a good attitude. My own wife choose to destroy me and any normal family life for her boys, for a schlub who offered her money and silly promises. Oh, she’s in love and I am sure the trips, the new vehicle, and the home renovations are just secondary effects.
This leads me to my other state of mind. For good or bad, a new bitterness and angry mood have appeared in me. Yeah, I bet you couldn’t tell by this entry… Who knows, maybe I should embrace it and drop all the filters.
Stay tuned!!!

I promised myself a couple of days back I wouldn’t continually write the “poor, woe is me” stuff. Yes, I know this is my space to do it, but after a while, it starts wearing on a person. Well, so much for the best of intentions.
So, to the title, validation. I’m going to come off as the biggest narcissistic cry baby man child, but I crave validation and acknowledgment. There were a couple of times many years ago while I was a teenager that I received a “good job”, but that all ended when I had to tell everyone I had gotten Vikki pregnant. From the age of 18 onward, I don’t remember being acknowledged or validated for anything I have done. No “you’re a great husband or father”, “you’ve done a great job” or even “we couldn’t have done it without you”. I must correct that, I was always acknowledged for mistakes and others’ wrongdoings, sort of like now with Patty, she cheated, lied, and broke our family up and it’s all my fault. I didn’t do enough to make her comfortable, my bad luck was always on purpose, or my favorite, I was not “man” enough to keep her satisfied. ** Side note: for the last few months of our marriage I was experiencing ED among a couple of other medical/physiological issues. So on top of everything I was dumped because I couldn’t perform and I had some ouchies. Now I’m struggling alone.
I realize people have said it and there are millions of “inspirational posters” that wax poetically about being your own hero and not caring what others think, but it would be so great to hear my “close” friends, my siblings, my ex’s, my children, or even my coworkers and boss tell me I’m needed, appreciated, or made them proud. Even a good job would help me. Now I’m fully aware that you guys have said it to me, I appreciate it, I do, but you and I both know that’s a whole different from those who are around you in your “off-line” life. 
I’m not, nor have I ever been a loner. I suck at it now, just as I did in the past. Am I happy with myself? Just about how everyone is happy with their selves. After 51 years, I think I’ve become very intimate with who I am, what I want, and what makes me happy. It’s not much, but it’s not going to happen. I will never be a father like my dad. I will never be missed or even thought about or worried about. It’s pretty apparent that I will struggle with medical issues alone and have no one there to hold my hand and assure me, let alone if the worst happens, to sit by me as I take my last breath. No, not as long as there are scumbags like her new husband that have no moral or honorable traits when it comes to another person’s marriage. Maybe I should become one of those men. Selfishly whispering thoughts into a woman’s ears about things to insight her fears and anger. Convincing another man’s wife that her husband can’t fulfill her or never could. Day after day turning her against a solid 20-year relationship and when all his manipulations get hold of her and multiply her own fears and she thinks the destruction of a man who was always good to her is worth taking the chance with him instead, he gets everything the man holds so dear.
I got to stop here, the homicidal thoughts are bubbling up in me and this is not what I intended to write about. Now that I think about it, maybe I should have not written this at all.

I heard back from a lady on a dating site, who according to her profile, is actively searching for a serious relationship. As it always seems to be, she wrote that she just doesn’t have the time for a relationship, let alone time to date. She went on to say she had 3 young children, which she also mentions in her profile, and went on about how it would be wrong for them and me to become involved. It really strikes me as funny seeing my ex instantly move in her guy and thrust him immediately into my kids’ lives. I guess I can appreciate that she cared enough to let me down easily and say she is not interested in someone like me. Suppose it’s better than letting I guy swing without any response. So yeah, strike #20 on the whole dating thing.
All this got me thinking last night. Every major relationship I was in for the last 35 years has ended abruptly and so final that it has to be me. I literally spent close to an hour straining my brain, to a headache, going over each one and looking for the why. I must be a narcissistic ass hat because I just can’t think of a time I was horrible or nasty to any of them. I never cheated, was attentive, and did everything within my power to make each one comfortable and happy. Maybe that’s what the problem was. Deep down they all wanted an asshole. That was the type of man they choose to leave me for. Must be what I and all the other “nice guys” have been right all these years that deep down most women say that want a nice guy, but they really don’t. I must be the problem then.
I must be the problem at the jobs I have held over these 35 years too. Like relationships, I somehow rub everyone wrong and I am left out and always the excuse for others’ failings. I finally got to a point here at this job where I asked to be credited for my own sales. I don’t profit from it at all, to me it’s just a point of pride I would love to have for my hard work. That was too much to ask though for the other 2. My co-worker, the sales manager, has several plaques on his wall for sales. That’s because every sale, every new customer, and every prospect get written up under his name no matter who takes the call or makes the sale. The other lady that works here was hired to be the cashier/title clerk and yet she chose to get involved in sales and several times sold trailers or promised them without ever letting me know, she and he are up each other’s asses that they could be conjoined twins. This leaves me having to backtrack and call a customer I worked with and tell them the trailer I promised has been sold, which leads them to call the manager and complain about what a two-faced bastard I am after I assured them I had their trailer. Knowing full well what has happened, I am thrown under the bus to save face. They “cherry-pick” people and send me the “undesirable” ones and either way I am made to write up the sales. She screws up the title work, I have to fix it. They screw up a sale, I have to fix it. Yet I’m not allowed to take credit unless it’s one of their mistakes or fuck ups, then I get the credit and am still expected to fix things.
I’m sure it’s all in my mind, that’s what everyone says, but when this keeps happening day after day, week after week, and year after year for 35 years it’s hard to think “it’s all in my head” Maybe I should be glad that I am noticed even if it’s to be blamed and used.

It’s midnight and I’m still up hoping against hope that someone will message me. Thing is, I know no one will. The truth about it is and always was that no one around here even cares. I really shouldn’t be grieving over someone who has done nothing to show me that she ever cared for me and like others left me so completely it’s like I never was there.
I’ve been sick for close to a month, my depression and stress has finally caught up with me and I’m pretty sure I had a mild heart attack. IDK I’ve had some seriously scary panic attacks that put me in the ER for the night. People know this and I have never received one “how are doing ” call. A smart man would say fuck all of you, but I’m not a smart man. My heart does the thinking, that’s probably why I have gave myself broken hearted syndrome. Oh there’s a fancier name for it, but let’s just go with that. Now along with that my urine test have both come back with evidence of possible cancer, another fancy name I can’t remember either. Congrats,  you are the only ones that know that about me, I may have bladder cancer. Yes I know if caught early it’s like 99% treatable. Point is, I’m just not going to share that with people around here. Half will think I am making up for attention and all won’t give a shit anyway.  I guess I just can not understand how I went from being cared about and important to forgotten and worthless in what seemed like overnight. I just want to know what I did to everyone. They don’t have come back into my life, but at least explain why. I would even settle with a “you suck” spit in the face. I has to be better than the erase me completely out of your life, memories, and importance.

I have 2 of my son’s this weekend and I’m going to have the older ones through the week. They have Easter break. I woke up today just embraced by anxiety and my body just aches with the usual older guy pains.
I’m stressing about how to keep them happy here and fed. All the while fighting back tears and sadness about the divorce.  That leads me to thinking of her and what my life was like when I was happy and comfortable. I seriously should have got into an inpatient program when I could have. I really can’t deal, even with the therapy and happy pills
I just want to give up.

I’m just going to unload what’s on my mind today and what will be on my mind later too.

I’m finding I can no longer watch or listen to certain things anymore. They actually make me sick to my stomach. Anything with couples, dating, marriage, family, love, or loss.  The trouble is I don’t like death metal and shitty television.
Why don’t I matter to anyone? More precisely, how did I instantly stop mattering to anyone on a fateful afternoon in 2019 and on? No one asks my opinion or thinks to let me know things happened.
How is it that people can so totally leave my life without looking back?
Why do guilt me about things no other person would? I have an opportunity to do, be, and live how I want to and all I can think is how other people will be affected by it when they have all moved on as if I was just an annoyance to them?
Back to the mattering thing, why is it that my efforts, accomplishment, and hard work never matter to those I work for and with? Oh when things go tits up, it falls onto me no matter what. The trouble with the DMV? My fault even though I haven’t been in charge of it for almost 2 years. Why are sales down? It is because somehow I don’t do enough. The paperwork is wrong, even though I had nothing to do with it. The daily money is not balanced, although I am not the cashier it is my fault. All I wanted was to put my name on my sale orders, but no, I can’t even be acknowledged for them.
For some reason on dating sites, I can’t catch a break. She contacts me first, I reply, and I never hear from them again. If or when they do, it is to tell me they just don’t have the time to date or they aren’t looking to date. Why then are you on the dating app? Oh. I see I’m not up to your standards. I’m not good-looking enough or flashy or well off. I see.
How is it I can’t just accept my place in the world now? Be the bitter lonely old man that hates everyone and everything, not be in my kids and anyone else’s lives, and just live in my dark musty apartment shut off to the world until I die alone where no one will mourn me and be surprised years down the road to find out I died years back.
Why do I have zero interest in any hobby or distraction? Why is it I think I can only be validated by how others think of me?
Why am I not allowed to raise a family in the traditional sense? How come I get pushed into a supporting role in my children’s lives while Mr. Dickwad, who broke my family up because he had no respect, gets to make day-to-day decisions and raise my kids? Why do my exes hate me that much knowing that was all I wanted?
Why can’t I find the strength to just end it and stop being a thorn in everyone’s side?
Why aren’t the therapy and medications working? Why the eating well and exercising working? Why aren’t the prayers and living a moral life not working?
No, there aren’t the “little things” to me anymore?  The sun rises and sets, birds sing, flowers bloom and sometimes the air smells and feels sweet. I don’t f#$%ing care. Not anymore. Food and drink have lost their taste to me. All I have is the constant bad things that have happened to me these 3 years. I had a great fulfilling morning on a Thursday in January 2019. I blissfully drove to work knowing I was loved. I had a beautiful loving wife and family. I lived in the home I was raised from a baby to a man in. I had savings, a great job, and a future. In 9 hours it was all gone. My wife, my family, my friends. a couple of days later my home and savings are gone. Then the car broke and I could not afford to fix it, I was essentially homeless, and within the next month, I was unemployed because the new management insisted that the job I had done for 2 years had to be done by a microbiologist. The quality lab manager made positions for the 2 others in my position, but not the guy who was going through the hardest thing he faced, essentially poor and homeless, and with absolutely no means to find another job. The company fought me on unemployment benefits and by the time I did find this job, I had been approved, but I was working again so sorry about the last 2 months, but you aren’t unemployed anymore. Here’s a couple of weeks of money, but know that come tax season we will order you to pay it back and when Covid shuts down the world 3 months after that, we will use the last 2 months as a reason to stop weekly benefits in 2 weeks into the shutdown and let you swing by your nuts and not give you anything. Oh, sorry but when you do go back to work and based on your estimated average income, you don’t qualify for food stamps or money assistance.
No Colby I don’t have your agreed-upon share of the house. We spent too much going on camping trips and buying new furniture and home fixing during covid. Oh, the $4500 stimulus and the $9000 tax refund went to the kids, are you saying you don’t love them because money is more important? Oh, by the way, you are 2 weeks behind on child support and our debts are now ours, it’s only right because although I was all on board with the vehicle and such, I never wanted that, so it’s all on you.
I can’t help you and if I could I wouldn’t. I’m the boy’s Aunt and you and her don’t even care about the boys. You don’t even pay child support anymore, why are you 2 weeks behind, that’s for the boys… You act like this is the end of the world you selfish ass. Can’t you see what this has done to me, what your daughter Kayla’s death did to me? You don’t know hardships!!!
Why did you get a dog? Why did you rehome the dog? Why are you depressed? You have no reason to be, it was just a marriage, it’s not like someone died… Jesus, poor Colby…

This is just a small sampling of the 2,000,000 thoughts I deal with in my head and trying to make sense and peace with them is like the title says, “herding cats.”

Between the eviction notice and the nearly $1000 medical bills, I got to thinking maybe Patty was right about me and that’s why she left. I was better than bankruptcy for her. She got a fresh clean slate and I was left in crushing debt. I have absolutely no one I can borrow some money from and because of how I work finding part-time work is practically not going to happen. Where I live and because I own a gas guzzler truck door dash, Uber, or anything like them is a no-go. I would put what I made back into the tank and not make anything. So, here I am, making too much to get any social service help, but not enough to pay for the necessities.
I have made a budget today and I guess I can get by if I don’t eat, stop taking my meds, and never get my kids. Oh, come July maybe I can start to get ahead of things. I have asked and begged every one of my creditors, apartment management, and utilities if there was something we could do. Mostly no, but instead of a 14-day notice I now have 28 days to pay up my arrears in rent, a budget plan that will default if I miss a payment date, and a reduced monthly payment on the “marriage debt” that will essentially all go towards the interest with maybe 1/3 on the principle.
I’m just going to “power through” the withdrawal pains and effects from the psych drugs, not eating every day should help keep the blood sugar down, and well, roll the dice on the other issues I face.
So yeah, they were right, my ex and my sister, in saying I suck at money management. Patty found her “older” man who had money and now lives a life we never could. My boys have stuff I could never give them. People in my hometown have all forgotten I ever existed.
I’m really thinking it’s time. I had some “good times” along the way, but 3x the bad. Not one of the people in my life seems to care or even acknowledge me anymore, so would they actually miss me?  I worry for my kids, but they’ve been unfazed by what their mom did and like everyone, never questioned or argued with her about it. I’ve said and written it here before, none of the women who “left” me ever saw it as a mistake and gave me any type of caring or concern. 20 years of mostly trouble-free years with Patty and she wouldn’t piss on me if I was on fire. I’m pretty sure the words ” I really wish the boys were Ed’s” have come out of her mouth several times in the past few years. Why? It doesn’t matter to me anymore, not now anyway. I’ll give the boys Easter, I don’t want to ruin that Holiday for them.

205,https://www.opendiary.com/m/newt316/how-long-has-it-been-35-6107672/,2022-04-14,How long has it been?,"
I stopped counting a few weeks back about how long it’s been since I’ve heard from any of the “people” in my life. I think it’s been 2 months or so.  The Grand Experiment I decided to start then was to stop being the one who contacts and see how long it would take for that “how are you” call or text. I’m not going to say I’m shocked, because I figured this would be how it would go. I’m not cruel enough to do this to my sons, but between us, I think they wouldn’t either.
I know, “yet another whining poor me” post. I’m getting sick of them too. It’s all I have though. I’ve tried to make new and different experiences, but those all just fall into the same hole. Meet someone, they say they aren’t looking for a relationship, but immediately get into one with the next guy. Go to a bar and it’s all I can do to make the bartender listen to me about ordering a drink. Attempt to strike up a conversation at a grocery store or the Mall and it seems like I’m some pervert or weirdo. So whether I want or not, I’m alone and totally on my own.
I received a message from my primary that they want me to go to Roswell Park, Buffalo’s cancer center, to have tests on my small intestines because of the masses shown on my cat scan. I’m not sure how I’m going to manage it because they’ll have to sedate me and I have no one to take me and drive me home and I just can’t afford taxis and Ubers. Well, not for the next several months if I can stick to my budget. On top of that, they haven’t received the results from what is called a CX bladder test, but the other test that’s been done twice keeps coming up with high-grade urothelial carcinoma. I suppose this all could be nothing and the support I used to have would make all this easy, but I don’t have that. It’s me and an already overwhelmed brain that’s still trying to make peace with all my losses over the last 3 years.  I want to talk to my older boys about it, I really wish I could talk to Patty, but I won’t worry them. Jonathan is on track to graduate and go to college and he doesn’t need the worry. Morgen, well he will internalize it and become more distant.
If you were to ask me at the beginning of January 2019 how I would cope with all of this or anything, I would just beam as I talked about my loving wife and kids, my sister, and my best friends Tony and Sean. By the end of January 2019, I had none of those people anymore and haven’t since. I starting to think that if it all goes bad, I’m just going to run its course. If God saw fit to allow all the hurt, pain, and loss from the last 3 years as his plan for me, then I guess so is cancer. Praying hasn’t made me feel better, bring my wife back, or even given me a break, so what would the point be about any of this?

That’s what friends are for played on my drive into work this morning and all I could think is, what a complete bull shit song. At least for me.
Had another rough night of sleeping and dreams last night. All the dreams I can remember involved moments that were already crappy, but only 10 times worse. I can not even rely on my own dreams to allow me a break from real life anymore.
I’m just going to unload it all, I can’t think of a direction to write about right now:
I totally hate myself, more than everyone who does hate me. I hate how I feel and the fact I can’t seem to change. I hate that another man is living my dream life with the people I love. I hate that those same people have just moved on as if I was never a part of their lives, maybe I wasn’t.
I hate the fact that it’s become almost impossible to remember the good times, the happy moments anymore. I hate the total worthlessness I feel and how it seems I am useless to anyone and everyone.
I hate that no matter what I have tried to do for myself over the last few years, it all blows up in my face and makes the pit in me deeper.
I hate that the only 3 women with who I attempted to have some sort of relationship, expected me to just acknowledge their wants and expectations. They were not going to be receptive to anyone else’s feelings and selfishly thought just of themselves. I would listen to their “issues” and attempt to comfort and reassure them only to be mocked about mine. In fact, that’s how everyone has treated me.
I hate that I make decent money and can’t enjoy it. My bills, my medications, and the debts I pay so she could have a new perfect life, have dragged me into the mud so deep that I can’t see a future for myself anymore. All I ever feel is the stress that one false move will make me homeless and stuck. I hate that I have no one close to help me feel I matter.
I hate that I still have faith in God. Sinners are supposed to be punished and shunned, but here I am. I did everything in my power to make her happy, safe, secure, and be there for my children, family, and friends. Live as much as I could to be the best Christian and put my faith in the Pastors and leaders in the church to be the example, only to be betrayed, lied to, and left hurt and alone by them all. She broke the vows and committed the “sin” and he lived a depraved life for most of his, and there they are, living their best life essentially problem-free and I have been tortured, hurt, depressed, unlucky, and ignored for the last 3+ years as if I broke all 10 commandments. None of my prayers were answered and constant “tests” of my faith.
I hate that no one can give me answers and just all tell me to accept that it is what it is.
I hate waking each morning and hate going to bed. I wake alive and go to bed wracked with thoughts, guilt, and dread of the next day.
I hate that all it would take to make me feel better is someone in these few years to acknowledge my pain or have made an attempt to comfort me somehow. Not to treat me as if I was all of their problems. That their time with me wasn’t always miserable and wasted. To stand up for me knowing I was a good friend, father, brother, and husband and appreciate it.
I hate that people take my sadness and cry for help as me being selfish and throw them in my face as though it was the only thing I ever did in my relationship with them.
I just hate myself. I hate the fact I can’t move on. I hate that I can’t accept. I hate being alone. I hate being stressed about debt. I hate being dependent on several medications to get through the day and life. I hate that the depression is more dominant than the will to improve. I hate my looks and being bald.
I just hate me.

207,https://www.opendiary.com/m/newt316/why-2665-6107908/,2022-04-16,Why,"
WHY?????
WHY CAN’T I MOVE ON???
WHY AM I, TO THIS DAY, HAUNTED BY EVERYTHING????

Yet another morning where the first thought is about her, about my lost family. Once more the night was full of dreams of her, all the same, no love or affection, just disgust. I don’t want to remember her this way, but even my mind is rebelling on me now because I can’t remember her any other way. Is that a good thing? Is it my mind’s way of telling me to get over and move on? She was never like this, never nasty and so stand-offish, even when she was pissed at me.
I have some fucked up needs to be validated. Oh, I’m sure if we were to sit down over coffee I would be due to being a momma’s boy. How she spoiled me with comments and acknowledgments that only a doting mother can. That’s why I’ve been the dancing monkey my whole life… “NOTICE ME, EVERYONE”, “LOOK AT ME”, or “LOVE ME”. I guess it all worked when I was younger and better looking, but now it’s just a sad middle-aged loser needing to be validated that he matters, at least to someone.
I said it before, I probably say it every time I write, but the change or end of the only life I knew and enjoyed happened in seconds. The loss of my sister’s love and comfort in hours. The end of lifelong friendships in days. Everything that defined me was gone in a week. My faith had failed me. My beliefs had failed me. God, it seems, had also turned his back on me.
I’ve attempted a few new “relationships” and they have all gone the same. They tell me how their “experiences” have shaped them or affected them. How he did this or that to them, how it hurt, and how they would now only live for themselves. I would just barely open my mouth about myself and would be shut down for making it seem as if my problems had no meaning and they were only there to validate them. I’m not looking for a caregiver or a replacement for my mother but is empathy too much to ask for.
I guess I’m just a hopeless waste of skin now to everyone. I’m my boy’s father, but even they don’t turn to me for advice. I don’t want to think anymore, but I have the suspicion that God’s sense of humor would completely keep my brain and thoughts in tip-top condition if I tried to do something to end them. I have always said that I won’t attempt suicide because I would fuck it up and wind up totally helpless and paralyzed with my mind fully functional, stuck thinking and agonizing for years without no way and no one to help me.

I’m just going to come out and say it, I don’t want to live anymore. I don’t want to commit suicide, I just want to die. Be that 1 in a billion chance to get hit with space junk or quietly in my sleep.
My life and this world is just shit and it’s just getting worse. Maybe if I was dripping with friends and family and 20 years younger I could deal,
I can’t even live in a angry state and just live to piss people off.  All the love I have put into this world has been used against me like an innocent deer covered in spring flowers that walks into a hunter’s kill box.
Right now I’m sitting in at a Tim Hortens parking lot drinking an almost $3 medium coffee and all I want to do is flip off every one who passes by. Yet I don’t because for some stupid fucking reason I care. I care for people who wouldn’t think twice about me if it meant they would get ahead.
I love a woman who took that love and destroyed me with it, emotionally, mentally,  and financially. I sit here and haven’t even received one holiday greeting. I’ve sent out over 20 and not one reply.
“Gee Colby, why are you so bitter and angry?”

209,https://www.opendiary.com/m/newt316/april-18th-4-6108266/,2022-04-18,April 18th,"
I really should go and re-read my entries. I think I have bitched and moaned about the same thing several different ways. You see, that’s my problem and I make it everyone else’s problem too. I don’t know what I need to do to fix myself. I’m my own worst enemy in all of this. All I know is that all the years with Patty and the kids’ nothing broke me. I had a home to keep me busy. Believe it or not, I loved to clean, cook, and even do laundry. The smile I got from her was all I needed to get over anything. I haven’t seen that smile since the morning of the “end”. At no time afterward has she smiled at me. I bumped into the two of them at a store and received a look like I was a stranger, the same as the ones I have gotten at the last few events for the kids. Y2K and 9 11, the wars that followed. My daughter moving to California and her horrible accident. The death of my parents and Kayla. All of them were traumatic, but her smile and a hug were all I needed to keep going. My “bubble” as I have called it.
I have been nothing but alone with my divorce, covid, and the breaking of the world that seems to be happening. I’m facing possible cancer without no one to be there just to hold my hand. Several holidays with no one. A milestone birthday with almost no greetings. I’m financially wrecked with no solution. And on top of it all, I have Borderline Personality Disorder, something I’m told I have suffered with for years but didn’t take hold until she made my world come crashing down on me. The one person who held me together tossed me away like nothing for money. Oh, I’m sure a case can be made about the “falling out of love” thing, but you would think there would be conversations and tears, especially with 4 young children involved. She would be lying if she told anyone that I was abusive, aloof, uncaring, and lazy. Has she? I can’t say for certain, but people who were once mine and our friends all avoid talking to me.
I agree, it all seems too dramatic, but even without BPD, it still is. I would be lying if I said I haven’t tried my hardest to move on and get over this. I do the exercise, breath, and meditate. I fight the triggers. I take several medications I cannot pronounce. I have drank and drugged to no avail. I see a therapist and psychologist. I’ve talked to ministers and pastors, prayed, and screamed at God. It all, life and me, just gets progressively worse. I said it once before, it’s like herding cats. I get ahold of one thing and several others take off in different directions.
I would like a relationship with someone, but it seems as though women my age are at a point where they could care less about a man’s feelings and expect them to cater to their wants and needs. Men my age, especially the ones like me who wear our hearts on our sleeves, are expected to be financially set and somehow not affected by the past and years they’ve lived. All the while allowing the woman to be independent and “free” from the partnership a relationship should have. To make that more clear, I have met several women my age or slightly older. They chose the assholes they married, but assign blame on any man. They want to be wined and dined, be taken on trips. They expect “old world” treatment like not paying for things and being treated a certain way, but they won’t change for a man and they have “paid” their dues with others and absolutely refuse to change or meet halfway with another.
Are there women out there that are not like this? Yes, but they are married and have almost everything they want. They know what a relationship should be and always tell me that I am handsome and a great man, that is they were single, oh they would be all over me regardless of my financial issues at 51. Then one day, one of these women did find herself single and like the others, told me I wasn’t what they wanted and for all the “pep” talks and “support” she also turned her back on me and hasn’t made any effort to even say hi. Or the ones who have never once in their lives been dumped or heartbroken who have no absolute idea what it’s like and they want to excuse it away like it’s as easy as changing a pair of underwear.
Well, this all has taken a turn and all the advice about “journaling” has made me angry and hurt. Defeated. What’s the point of living a moral and ethical life if, in the end, you have nothing to show for it and all the hard work, blood, sweat, and tears ultimately go to someone else who did nothing but sweet talk your wife into leaving you? Every day I lose just a bit more faith, but that’s a rant for another day.

210,https://www.opendiary.com/m/newt316/this-morning-255-6108374/,2022-04-19,This Morning,"
I feel numb today. I’m hoping to hold on to this feeling. Well, for the most part anyway. It’s also making me like giving up the fight and just settling into a life of loneliness and accepting that this is how it’s going to be from now on.
I’ve been chatting with a lady I met online. I have no clue what it is that she wants. I’m old enough to recognize the game she is playing about getting together and dating though, and I have to say, as alone as I am, I don’t care to play it. She is doing the waffling back and forth thing. Saying she doesn’t have the time but has acted mad because I haven’t asked her out or talked on the phone. She is playing the wait until I text her instead of ever texting me first and if I don’t I must not like her. It’s hard to actually explain it, but she’s playing at the “chase me” thing as if I was some horny teenager and I don’t have the energy. I just want to meet, have coffee, and talk. I don’t have the money to wine and dine her and I’m sure that will end things even though she professes that she doesn’t need anything from anyone.
Or, maybe I am just an asshole. What is it they say about doing the same thing for the same bad results over and over again? “Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.” I like her, but we’re both over 50 and I don’t feel like I have the time for a slow burn, especially for the distance. She is not far, but it’s far enough to make the build-up annoyingly longer than it needs to be. That is selfish of me, I don’t know what she’s been through.
IDK, as I said, my mind is numb and I really don’t know where I am going in this entry.
I want what I can’t have, but others have proved that it happens. In a span of weeks, my ex met a man for whom she destroyed me, our family, and all 20 years of memories.  For all the ” things will go sour after the honeymoon phase” crap I’ve heard, they’re going strong. Remarried and jumped right into all kinds of things together, much of them what I would have done, but she never wanted to or asked of me.
I guess the biggest fear I have held all my life is coming true. I will be one of those sad-looking old men you see at the store. They’ve given up on themselves wearing the same clothes for days and just don’t want to make the effort to shower. They either reek of cigarettes or have that weird musty smell. They sit at the counter at the diner and try to interject into people’s conversations and annoyingly flirt with the waitresses. They walk out either saying goodbye to no one’s answered salutation or quietly with one last look around at the happy families and couples with a sigh. That’s what I am becoming.
Does actual love matter? I would have done anything for Patty, yet she never once ask me and never showed me that she had problems. She just sat there getting bitter and angry. Bitter and angry enough to just throw me under the bus and allow people to say all kinds of shit about me knowing I wasn’t that “man”. How do you change if no one says that there is a problem? How do know someone is unhappy if they never let you know? Maybe I’m not worth the effort. Maybe that’s why the lady expects me to do all the work to date her. I have always felt that I have never been loved other than my parents and my kids. I guess I should be just satisfied with that.

I’m not feeling ok and I’m just “blah” about myself. It’s very hard to keep up your chin when even your dreams actively kick you in the crotch. I immediately think about my ex thinking that all the time we were together she was secretly sick of me, yet swallowing her pride to stay. I’m hard-pressed to remember a time she actually showed me affection without me initiating it first. I’ve been a fool for thinking her or anyone would love me as I have them. Would she have broken a family and destroyed their father to be with me? Hell, I can’t get a woman on a dating site to even date me. I swear it’s like a shoeless man standing in a shoe store and saying he’s not looking for shoes. Well, not from me anyway.
I’m me, been me for over 51 years, so I think I know myself. I have been beaten so badly personally, financially, and mentally these last 3+ years, that there’s barely anything left. It’s horrible but the only thing I can think to do is to withdraw from everyone. I’ll never make peace with her leaving or my friends shutting me out or my siblings turning their backs.

I like my job. I have an office and business cards. I get paid a decent salary (although it hasn’t helped me to get out of debt as quickly as would hope) I like the customers I help and sell to.
What I don’t like is how I am treated. How I believe I’m treated. I work with 2 people, one is the sales manager, the other is supposed to be an office assistant/cashier/title clerk. I know how to do both their jobs, and I was trained to do both their jobs. The last I knew I was the office manager/salesperson. Somehow along the line, he’s telling our new corporate boss and referring to her as the office manager, and low and behold as the business cards arrive, he’s the sales manager, she’ office manager, and I am just a sales representative. Ok, it’s a little petty of me to feel this way, she and I both make the same salary.
So here’s where the real fun starts. The two of them are constantly buddy/buddy. Stick with me on this. I am never included in the conversations, even when it’s about this place. I have no input on anything. For 2 years I have been the catch-all, fire putter-outer, and “sales representative” (Yes, I found out that she ordered the cards to say what they say). I talked to my corporate boss a few weeks back and asked if I could be credited for my own sales and he said he would set it up. He did, for all of one day when I wrote up new customers and sales there was my name, I felt like I finally was recognized here and to corporate. One day. My sales manager found out, obviously through her, because as the cashier she sees who wrote up the sale.  The next day my name no longer appeared on the list. I didn’t see it as a pissing contest, but he did. I guess he blew up on the corp manager about it. Rumor is he gets a small commission for every sale in his name, can’t prove it, but it’s as plain as the nose on your face. Obviously, by me taking credit for my sales, he was losing his kickback and yearly plaque for sales.
You see, I write my sales and for the most part his. Oh, he does the small-town hick stuff for the customers he gets and then sends them my way. Every single sale here is made out threw his name. 
Let’s just get to the shit part. Every day when he’s not puttering around he’s watching something online. She is watching something on her cell or doing a bunch of personal crap. She answers incoming calls, but mostly forwards the calls to me so they can have their daily chats. When she does answer she “cherry picks” the “understandable” callers to send to him or Low and Behold herself because somehow she is a saleswoman too. It says that on the newly ordered cards. Saleswoman/Office Manager. I’m still a sales representative… So, every “hard to understand” and the majority of all calls are sent to me, while she’s too busy with shows or personal stuff and he can’t be bothered. All I wanted to do was have my name on the sales, petty and selfish, YEAH.
Now as I said, she is in charge of DMV title work for the sales and has f#$ked it up on several occasions. Who fixes it and is mostly blamed? That’s right, me. I take the angry calls from the customers and the NY DMV. I have to search through mounds of paperwork. A recent example is getting plates to assign to trailers. She waited until we were 1/2 through our last box, essentially 25 plates left, to order more. It came back denied due to outstanding plates and interstate plates missing. Can you guess who caught shit about it? That’s right, I took a 5-minute browbeating from him and the usual, “I did it right” from her. I had better make this right… So 2 banker boxes and 1 file cabinet later, with zero help from the “title clerk” I found the stuff. I contacted the sheriffs to account for the one I could not find and of course, when he showed up, they greeted him and sent him to me with the line, “I don’t know why he doesn’t keep track of things”. Plates that get assigned to the wrong trailer? My fault.  Oh, I also am to blame for any mistake on sales orders. Well Colby, you just said you write them all? The ones I write aren’t wrong, it’s the ones they mess up.
They never inform me of their sales, especially the ones that are not even delivered yet, so here I am, once more, being chided and told to call my guy and explain we don’t have his trailer after all. ” Keep this up, we are going to lose customers.”
 
Hmm. maybe the therapist is right, maybe it’s cognitive dissonance. Maybe my sad narcissistic mind is overthinking it. I guess much like my life outside of work is going it will have to be here too. The only place I have left to feel damaged by the divorce and loss. Head down and mouth shut the adults are talking.

I’ve totally lived my life wrong. I have become a walking joke to most people. No one respects me even when I am doing nothing wrong. I really don’t matter to anyone, even my kids it seems. They have never called me or asked for any advice about being boys and young men. They don’t call me when there’s a homework issue.
Maybe Patty was right to leave me. They all live and have a better life without me.
"
214,https://www.opendiary.com/m/newt316/am-i-ok-5-6109514/,2022-04-25,Am I ok???,"
No, I am not ok…
I don’t even know or remember what ok feels like. Being a man I’m supposed to just always say that I’m fine and ok because if I don’t I’m seen as less than. Oh, everyone says that’s not the case, but it really is. Take it for a man who’s living it.
Fake it to you make it… Oh, how wonderful that would be if I wasn’t so completely damaged from the last few years. I literally woke up one day with everything a man could ask for and by the afternoon of the same day, completely nothing. I’m not exaggerating, everything was gone or against me. People who I trusted, possessions I worked for, savings, comfort, and love, were all gone in a day.
I am obviously here, so I didn’t take the darkest path I could have, but with all the therapy, all the medications, all the sacrificing of food, utilities, and distractions, all the praying, all the asking, calling, apologizing, nothing has improved or changed. I am still running late on rent because I got F@#Ked by all the covid handouts and I was taken advantage of by her and others at my worst.
I’m told to be selfish, to think about myself and what I need, but the same people who give this advice are the first to chide and guilt me for it.
I don’t know, I had all kinds of thoughts on things, but there’s no point anymore. I would like a relationship with someone, yet that’s not in the cards. Even as I have tried, it gets turned on me as if I am the reason. I had been talking to a woman, taking my time and holding back on the drama. She essentially said she just wanted someone to “have fun with” and was not looking for anything more and that she was always busy with her mother and work and kids. So, I kept the messages short and nice, but out of the blue, she lost it on me about not asking her out or anything. I explained that I figured the little “hints” I would say about it would eventually get her to think that she would take some time, I didn’t want to impose on her obligations. A few days later, I did ask if she wanted to actually talk or meet up for coffee and I was read the riot act for being the exact opposite of what she was looking for. I won’t post her profile here, but I can tell you that there is no mention of “let’s just do fun things when I want to do fun things” in it.
Another one is, “Looking for a new relationship, kids are older and more independent and I am looking for companionship.” Well, obviously she was taking pity on my ugly loser ass by texting back to me to say that this is all too new and she just doesn’t have time to even go for coffee or wouldn’t with someone she only has texted with for a week straight. OK, so would you like to talk on the phone? Absolutely not!!! I have my daughter here and I hardly know you!!! Something tells me if I wasn’t the ugly, bald-headed failure I am, this would not be the case.
So, am I ok? No, I’m not. Not in the least. I’ve seen what my friends and family really think of me and how “strangers” view me. I am every bit of the worse I think of myself. I’m just going into survival mode. I don’t need a family, I don’t need friends, and I don’t need to be anyone’s problem ever again.

So I’ve been making an active effort to not think about things, at all. Just floating on the outside of myself looking in as I go through the motions of the day-to-day. I’m not making plans or anything and just letting the past thoughts, hurts, and betrayals just slam up against the little bubble I’ve wrapped around me. Yes, I realize that this isn’t the way to deal with things, but it’s the only way for me right now.
Patty wanted me to take my son to karate Friday, but I just cannot. I little crack in the bubble. She has to know/understand that she put me in this situation and never stopped once to show a bit of compassion. Where did the woman I loved for 20 years go? Who is this person she is now? How does someone act like you were never in their life when they live in your childhood home, with your children, and constant memories of the family that took you in as their daughter and sister? That’s what haunts me. Not losing the relationship anymore or her love. Not even the security and fulfilled life I had ripped away from me. So, as much as I want to take him I can’t. I honestly do not have money for gas and “fingers crossed” will just have enough to get to work until next Friday. I didn’t put myself in this position, she did. I was left penniless and homeless then, with just promises that were all broken. I restarted my life with over $12000 in debt from the marriage, while she sugar daddies herself up and never skipped a beat and wonders why after 3 years I just haven’t somehow been rolling in cash.
Whatever, either way, I will be guilted by her and my sister who was supposed to take him.  I’m sure he likes it well enough, but it’s just one more thing my sister starts for my boys without asking and then throws into our laps without thinking about what we have going on and it always is my fault. Everything is.
Is it too much to ask to have someone to date, talk to, and have company? Of course, everyone knows that I’m not ready, because it doesn’t matter how I actually feel. You see, no one has ever lifted a finger to talk to me, console me, support me, or help me since the marriage ended, but they all seem to know how I’m supposed to think and act. So I have to be the unfeeling dancing monkey, the scapegoat and push over when only they want or need me to.

I don’t why I just can’t stop caring for and missing a person I should hate with every fiber of my being.  Why do I care so much about what people think of me? It seems everyone has that person in their lives who help them power through but I don’t. I always had someone until these last few years. I do love all the support from people online, even the chiding, but at the end of the day, it’s just me.
I have talked to a lot of divorced women over the last 3 years, but somehow I am always the wrong fit for a friend or anything else. They all tell me how bad things were for them, yet they leave out the part where they live in the same home they’ve lived in for years, surrounded by their children, grandchildren, and friends. Yeah, I imagine it was difficult, but my whole sense of normal ceased to exist in a day. Nothing was left for me and no one even acted like I was ever involved. Sure my kids are there for me but never asked their mom why. Never questioned the “new guy” showing up hours after dad left who has never left and is now their step-father. Not one sibling, friend, or acquaintance spoke up for me or for that matter to me. It was like I just blinked out of existence and I was nothing more than a faceless sperm donor who decided he wanted to meet the kids his “donation” created.
Once again, I was a nothing, a no one, like I had been for most of my life. She made me feel like I belonged to something and someone and took that all away in a day like I was just dirt being swept away. I’m now back to never hearing “good job” even though I  work my ass off. Never being contacted to see how I am or a holiday greeting. Now I can add laying in a hospital for a couple of days with not one call, visit, or even a check-up from anyone I still hold sop dear to me.
I know, I know, I should just cut them out and move on like they never existed, but then what do I have? Who am I? I know who I am and I have accepted the fact that this is life, but I’m just fading away into obscurity. Hiding away in my office at work, getting upset that nothing I do gets noticed, and being left out of every conversation. Then home, where I close the shades and sit in the dark and cold place wishing I could just die in my sleep. I’m not suicidal, I just want to go to sleep and never wake up. My kids will be frustrated that I don’t answer the calls and texts, which will immediately cause my ex and sister to call and text horrible quilt messages and eventually tell me I am a shit father and human. In about 2 weeks someone will notice a smell coming from my apartment, but it will take another few weeks before the apartment manager comes, with an eviction notice and just so happens to open the door because I didn’t reply to her knocks. She will be overwhelmed by the smell and then maybe after a month and a half, people will learn of what happened to me. In death, I will also be a burden on someone. There won’t be a funeral or memorial and no notice in the paper, but someone will bitch about how much it costs to cremate me or even still, donate my body to science and not pay anything. Years down the road someone might just say “Hey I wonder how Colby Newton is doing?” only to discover I had passed years ago.
I don’t see myself in anyone’s lives, not as an important part. Sure I’ll be “dad”, but the man that now raised them will be “grandpa” and they will all go there for holidays and maybe I will get a call, card, or an hour visit. My grandchildren will hardly know me and will shrink away from my touch and will absolutely hate coming here because I’m weird and smell funny or something. The day will come when I can no longer live on my own and I will be dropped into the cheapest adult care place, where I may see my family once or twice before I die there.
Ether way, this is how my life plays out…

I’ve been tossed away from everyone. It’s way to late to get my life I loved back. I’ve been erased from people’s lives. A woman I loved so deeply for 20 years just walked and forgot me in less then a day. Lifetime friends don’t even call to check in or even answer my calls. Family members that treat me like I was never part of their lives.
I see and hear of the brothers who are best of friends and then I think of mine who never have been there for me, unless they needed something. I see and here about how friends and family gather around to help someone and support someone,  I have none of that these last few years.
I can’t do this anymore. I feel like a nobody. I wasn’t wrong with what I wrote last time. No one cares around here and I just can’t seem to make a friend that does around here either.
I’m just tired of writing the same thing over and over. I make the effort, but run into walls everytime.

I’ve wasted my life. I have some wonderful memories,  but they’re all too painful to think about right now.. I love my children,  wouldn’t want that any other way. I haven’t ever been the same since my daughter died. Patty was escape, my calm in the storm and now that’s gone, she’s somebody’s else’s.
So that brings me back to the wasted life. It wasn’t just her, it was also my first ex too. I gave up my teenage dreams to be a father and a husband. I have never been respected as either. Child support has been a constant struggle for me since 1991 with only a brief break. I never saw the world. Never got to spend the time with friends.
I see people, several of my high-school friends, so successful. They are someone. They are principles, business owners, doctors and lawyers, even one who has been in movies and even written several plays. Here I am, no retirement, no home, barely surviving. I threw everything into her and my family and now I don’t even have that. Her new husband wasted his life being an asshole and he fell into everything I built for years knowing that I gave up all the childhood dreams to go all in on my family. It’s all gone now.
Not like a natural disaster or a horrible fire, it’s all right there in plain view and is no longer mine. Since day one of this people have just acted as though I had nothing to do with any of it like it was her and him that built their lives and I was never anything.  It doesn’t help that nobody around here even acknowledges me or helped me in any way.
So here I am
I’m a joke as a father, brother, husband, and a man. I have nothing. My clothes are old. My health is shit. My kids love me, but don’t need me for anything. They don’t call for advice or help on homework. They rarely if ever just call to talk or to see how I am. They’re kids, I get it, but the 4 of them are the only 4 people who seem to like me.
I have never been told why she decided to leave me at all or why I lost everything.  I had no fight in me because of the lack of support and no money to fight for my fair share.
I’m 51 years old. I have a job I like, but everyday I am left feeling that tomorrow will be my last because of how I’m treated.  I am a month behind on rent with no way to get ahead of it. My truck is about to break and I can’t afford to fix it or repair it on my own. I can no longer afford therapy and I have over $500 in hospital and doctor visits and I woke up this morning pissing blood, again. I can’t get a consolidation loan to fix my credit because of my credit.
Why? Because I wasted my life for other people. I gave all I could for their safety, security, and comfort. I never had time to get a higher education to be a better person and find a real career. I am in debt so my ex can have a fresh start with out so much as an apology.
There’s help out there, just not for me. I make too much for any social services,  but not enough to pay things. I work a job for a salary that has odd hours so it’s next to impossible to work a part time one and actually find time to sleep more than 3-4 hours. Sure if I was younger and healthier this wouldn’t be an issue, but I’m not.
I’m a shit person that is taking up someone’s, who’s better, air, water, and resources.

219,https://www.opendiary.com/m/newt316/advice-287-6110367/,2022-05-02,Advice?,"
YouTube is full of advice. How to start over? How to move on from an ex? How to forget someone? How to make yourself happy? All kinds of advice.
The one thing that is similar with all of these is the types of people giving the advice. Maybe I am a bitter asshole, but with every single one of these knowledgable advice-givers on life people are good-looking and obviously well off. I love how traditionally beautiful people can tell me that I don’t need a relationship, with the fact that they can pick and choose as easily as changing socks. They sit in their lovely homes telling you that, like you, they have been through the horrible loneliness and mountains of debt. Sure they have… Yeah… Being able to choose to be alone when all you have to do is spend a minute in the world and have several people come up to you and compliment you or ask you to have a drink or dinner is exactly my problem as a slightly over-weight, bald, 51-year-old man without a pot to piss in. It’s just that easy, right?
They all say “surround yourself with friends and family” they will support you and help you through. Go here or there, take a trip, exercise, or get a hobby. It worked for them. I’m sure it had nothing to do with their looks or finances. Find a new relationship. Like I said, one minute out in the world they will have several people approaching them. I can’t even get a person to return my salutations at the store.
“You don’t know if you haven’t tried.” I have and I have failed at every attempt.
My only friends nowadays are you. Online friends that I may never meet in real life. I appreciate all of you.
I have these moments where I just cannot regulate my feelings and thoughts. I am so down that I want to end it all. How does that saying go? “If you feel like you may harm yourself, call someone.” “If you’re depressed, reach out.” My favorite has come from my friends and family “if you want to talk or vent, we’re here” BULL SHIT. They have never been there for me, not since day one. They have chided me for feeling sad and lost. They have made my pain their own as if I ruined their lives. They never answer calls or texts, let alone reply either way. The HOTLINES are a crock. They’re scripted crap that these people are told to read. I understand that they field hundreds of calls, but do they help? “Why do you feel like this?” “That’s awful.” “Life is tough and I am sorry you feel like this.” No real personal talk. No real answers, just take my bad feelings and essentially turn it back on me to figure it out. Same as the therapy I have had. Maybe a few things to do like learning to focus and calm your mind, but 90% of the time they ask the same questions for money that you get on a free crisis line.
Maybe it’s me? Maybe I just can’t be helped? Maybe over the course of my 51 years, people have done everything to try and help me and show me I was doing it wrong and I was too pig-headed to understand and now they just have given up? Instead of being the empathic and giving person, I think I am, I was actually an asshole taking what I wanted from everyone who would touch my life. I tortured Patty for 20 years, taking and taking and never giving back. I must have mentally abused her and beat her in my sleep and the poor timid girl was just too afraid to leave me until her friends and her 20 year older sugar daddy came along and gave her the strength to leave me?  Maybe all the things I did for her, my kids, friends, and family were all part of my psychosis?
That must be it…

I’m in the middle of a possible bladder cancer scare. I’ve done all the peeing in cups and intrusive procedures that a person can. They sent a sample for what is called a cxbladder test that does some voodoo with it to test for cancer. It came out clear… Apparently, Cigna Insurance knows so much more than my Urologist and the Doctors and science behind this procedure because they refuse to cover the $2500 cost of it. While I don’t agree with that price to swish around some piss, I am totally pissed (see what I did there) that an insurance company that over the few years I have paid more thousands to can decide this.
Here’s where I get a bit conservative about things. Why is it that people who sit on welfare can have better insurance than I person who pays close to the same amount they make on welfare in medical insurance? I have always considered myself a moderate, but seriously, WTF. How absolutely f#$%ed up is our government? I totally agree that some people need social services, but I have also grown up around a lot of abuses of the system. The one way I’ve seen is the “keep it in the family” way.

Get on it young, have a kid when you’re a teenager. Get on the system
Continue this process at least every 3 years which is usually the cut off time for women with children
Do this until your 1st born is old enough to get on the system and can claim you as a dependant
Repeat

At least that’s how you ride the gravy train here in NY. Trust me if you legitimately ask for help here they work you for every last penny to deny you, but if you do get off the “train” they make it so miserable that it’s easier to stay on. I once ran a convenience store and I hired a girl who was on social services. She was the absolute best employee I had ever worked with. I made her my assistant manager and got her a nice salary. They garnished her wages to the point that it was not worth actually working because at the end of the week she was getting more in benefits than busting her ass working.
Talk about jumping off trains, this entry has definitely gone off the rails, sorry.

Maybe it’s just me. I have been told that BPD does cause these feelings. I just do not think that at any point in my life I have ever been taken seriously. Not when I was “the Boss”, not as a father, brother, son, or friend, and definitely not as an employee. Everyone gets to have opinions, but mine is always 100% wrong. I honestly do not remember ever hearing “that’s a good idea” or “Colby, what do you think”. Oh, I am the first one to blame when the shit hits the fan.
My marriages ended with both of them cheating and immediately “shacking” up with someone, but they both came down to being my fault. Why? You tell me, I have exactly no f!@king idea. I would gladly take the blame if I did so, but I never cheated or abused either one. I guess I am just someone’s pity project until they can trade up.
Here at work, I’ve once again learned how unimportant I am. The inspection system for NY DMV is changing and I have done all the leg work to learn what we need and how to implement it because no one else can be bothered. Well, today the DMV rep showed up, and as I started to open my mouth, I was told to stay quiet by my “manager” who then sat and discussed the new system, and of course as the rep drove away I was chided about opening my mouth. Yet, 3 weeks ago when the “office administrator” cashier ran out of plates to issue, guess who was blamed and told to fix it. Who has to take care of both their mistakes on sales and DMV issues, not them. I did her job for several months before she was hired. I trained her to do it. Somewhere along the line though, she became “office administrator” and I became just a sales rep, who doesn’t even get credit for my sales.
I like this job, been the first one in a long time I actually enjoyed. I can absolutely not leave this job and start over again. So, mouth shut and head down, I lay flat on the floor and be the mat again, like I have for the last 34 years of my life. My opinions are never right, my answers are dumb, my problems are insignificant, my depression is made up, and I’m the cause of mine and everyone else’s problems.
Guess what? If I try to be like them, and I have, it blows up in my face. Every single time. I eat the shit sandwiches they hand me, but I get destroyed if I offer up one to them. Or is it like that?
I don’t see myself as a 51 yr old man or adult. I look like some odd cross between Fester from the Adam’s family and a potato. I’m not good enough to be a husband, friend, or brother, let alone an “equal” at work. I am apparently a shit neighbor by the reactions and looks I get from the other tenants. I good enough to dig the holes, but too stupid to take any credit.
I have wasted my life.

I woke up today to the feeling of defeat and I have just decided to accept it. I don’t care. I put on the same clothes I wore yesterday and reused the coffee pod in the coffee maker.
I dreamt about her again and once again it even felt like it was all wrong.
Blah, just blah…
What happened to my life? I just can’t find it in myself to move on and change. Why? Everyone else here has what they want and what they enjoy, but things for me just end so finally, even if I could get it back it will never be the same.  20 years, you would think that a proper end would be the right thing to do. I was nothing but loving to her and she gutted me like a fish.
I know here I am again saying the same shit I have said since the first time I wrote here over 2 years ago. Funny thing is, my life has absolutely not changed in that time. Oh, I have tried. I tried to mend friendships I didn’t break and tried to meet new friends. I’ve attempted to get healthier and exercise more. I have read and practiced meditating. I have gone to therapy and a psychiatrist.
I’m paying for sins I must have made and just do not remember.

Is it too much to ask for? Just to be loved by someone. A romantic I can’t live without you kind, like I have for her. I know they say that if you truly love someone you should be happy that they’re happy, but that sucks. That works if the two of you sat down and cried together about your fading romance and relationship. Instead I was sent to work with a kiss and came home to a end. No reason, no explanation, no talking. The few times she did talk was to say she’s done and move out. Not at any time in our 20 years was she like this, so unfeeling.
Now it’s all gone. It’s been over 3 years now and I’m still struggling with it and broken physically, mentally,  and financially. I can’t believe I was destroyed for money and the lying whispers of another man.
It’s not just that. All the things they tell you to do to forget and move on just never happened for me. No friends to hang with or talk to. Oh I tried, but a day later they wrote me off and never wanted to talk to me about anything. What family I have didn’t helped to have some sort of normalcy either. My body is fighting me too. Cancer scare, horrible painful knees, no sleep. My mind won’t calm no matter what I do.
I just want friend who I can sit with and feel comfortable with. Someone that’s not judgemental that’s willing to spend time even as I’m healing.

I don’t like myself. In fact, I truly hate myself. Maybe I am finally seeing what so many others seem to see in me and that’s the reason why they have all “jumped” ship from my life. I want to change, but I just do not have it in me too. I can’t imagine another me. I can’t afford to go out or be part of something, I can’t. I make just enough to stay in my apartment and get to work and that’s it. I work stupid hours for the same salary week to week. Any and all requests for a raise or help fall on deaf ears both work and personal. Ha Ha, what a joke, personal…
That’s it, that’s all I have right now…

I don’t know how to write my feelings right now. My dreams betrayed me again and now I’m sitting here once again lost and feeling like a loser.
All I want is someone to talk to, preferably in person. Someone like my friends here, who will listen and not judge. I just don’t have that here. I can’t put it on my kids.
I can’t keep doing this.
This morning is one of those I can’t get out of my own head days. Why? Why after all this time, does it break me. Trying to write this as I am bawling again like it all just happened yesterday. The kids and her have all moved on from me in weeks after. She’s remarried so quickly I feel hated like all that time never mattered. So now I feel I wasted all those years and now I sit here wasting space.
I want to talk to her. I just want to hear her say that she just appreciated all the years, but… Just something instead of this treatment as if I never existed. Actually I wish anyone would say something,  but everyone doesn’t even text me a ” how are you?”
I’m not a man, not in any fashion. I’m just a lost 51yr old man-child no one wants to be around.

I don’t understand why I need to matter to someone or anyone. At the end of the day, you’re only with yourself.
It’s physically and mentally killing me not being attached to something or someone. Why did she toss me away as she did? Why did my kids accept it so fast? Why didn’t anyone stand up for me with what she did? Why did everyone treat it like our marriage and relationship never was?
For the 20 years I spent with Patty, she never was one to “share her business” with anyone, so what did she say about me and our marriage that made everyone turn on me? Apparently, she has said it so much over the last few years, that even she believes it. She became so nasty for no apparent reason. OK, you fell out of love, but why say the horrible stuff about how things were when they weren’t bad. I mean we had what I thought was a loving relationship right up to the day it ended. She blew the smoke up my ass with promises. “I won’t bring him around the kids.” He was there the same day within hours. “We will have joint custody.” Nope, but I couldn’t afford to lawyer up. “You can use money from the account to get established.” That was gone the next day. Why? I was walked into the field and Ol’ Yellered.
Now 3+ years later, no friends, no savings, several bills from the marriage, no settlement, and I still bawl like a tard every day, wishing I mattered to someone or something.  I haven’t seen my therapist for months because I can afford to and even she hasn’t checked in with me.
So, of course, I feel like a disgusting monster, A troll that no one wants to acknowledge. Just a nobody who you can lie to and not feel the least bit of regret for. This feeling has taken a hold of me and I can’t get it off of me. Like a clamp that’s too rusty to turn. Why is it so easy to be blamed, lied to, and forgotten by all the people I made my life?
I’m doing the “work”. Exercising, reading, and meditating, haven’t helped. I’m too angry at God to be a practicing Christian right now. Everyone wants to give God the credit for the good stuff. So why were her betrayal and cheating going so well? Why is it a good thing for her and a multi-year “test” for me? She is essentially a Buddhist and her husband was a shit man for most of his life save for a couple of months of bible study?  SO he gets rewarded for “coming to Jesus” and I, a lifelong Christian man, lose everything and for the next 3+ years have to scrape by for anything? How is it that the same Wesleyan pastor can tell me about the horrible sin they committed and yet marry them? Why do I keep losing when I am playing the game right? Two marriages, the ability to raise my kids other than a weekend dad, and my daughter all of 23 and a new mother? I mean F$#%!!! How much has to be heaped onto me? I passed the point of “God never gives you more than you can handle” about 2 years ago. Do I think that God has it out for me? No, I know it doesn’t work like that, but how much does a good man have to go through to “possibly” enjoy an afterlife that may or may not be true? There are rapists, murderers, and lying cheating people out there enjoying a better-fulfilled life than me. What little “good” has come to my life since he’s left it just as fast. It has literally been 3 years, 4 months, and 18 days since this all went down and I am no better off than I was then.

I feel compelled to write, but I don’t have anything that I haven’t said 100 times before. I’m sitting here at work listening to the one woman we work with, who just started dating a guy. He’s already moved in with her and she’s talking to another woman listing his faults, but also saying how she’s sad and wants to help him overcome all of them. WTF!!!
All I ever hear is how I have to fix myself before anyone would even approach me. How I am stuck and they don’t want to make the effort because I would weigh them down. Truth is, I’m not worth anyone’s effort. I’m not “hot” enough or rich enough or set enough. I have young children and they don’t want to be a mother, even though I don’t want them to be. I’m too old or too far. I’m starting over and not established.
I wasn’t good enough for Patty to stay with me even though she was there for the struggles, illnesses, deaths, and challenges. She witnessed firsthand how I tried and tried to make her safe, happy, and content, that it wasn’t my problem, it was our problems. She never said we shouldn’t this or that. Then when things got tough, after 20 years, she gave up on me when a guy with some money professed his love for her by saying he could solve all her problems. Not one thing from our marriage has she taken care of. I got all the debt and she got the shiny new life. Now, $20,000 in debt, with absolutely nothing to show for it, I’m not good enough for anyone. I’m “too bitter” for my friends. I’m “too absent of a father” for my sister’s respect. I’m not complacent enough for the ones I work with and for. I’m not financially set enough for anyone to date. I’m not worth enough for even a check-in from anyone.
I can’t “live” because I can’t afford to. Sure there are free things like church and groups, but I can’t afford to get to them or even have the time to. Get a hobby? Even the most mundane of what I would want to do is out of my price range. Go for walks. When you walk a hundred feet and your knees buckle under you because they are nothing but bone on bone and full of spurs. Get surgery on them. When you have no savings and shitty insurance that requires a high deductible before they even attempt to pay and their “doctors” that don’t think you need something that you need and they refuse to pay for it. Enjoy the single life. When all the shit I just mentioned is happening.
I’m sorry, but I can no longer give hope to the sayings and biblical passages that say this or that about what I am going through. It’s the “honeymoon” phase, she will realize what she did, NOPE. Things will get better. NOPE. You’re a handsome great man, anyone would love to be with you. NOPE In times like this, turn to God, friends, and family for support, they love you and will be there. NOPE. Your therapist and psychologist care and will support your healing. NOPE… Especially when you can’t afford the $ 65 – $120 bills. Maybe I should go down to the city and get a crack hooker who would at least act caring for the same amount and maybe get a stress relief out of it, for all the good the “professionals” have done.

229,https://www.opendiary.com/m/newt316/hate-386-6112684/,2022-05-11,Hate,"
I’m embracing the hate from now on. I hate people. I hate those who have turned their backs on me for their own selfish reasons. I hate those who used me and pushed me in front of a bus to improve their own lives. I hate my “friends” that have abandoned me when I needed them the most. I hate my brothers and sister for not being, loving siblings like I have had them my entire life. I am the baby of the family and I have always looked up to them and attempted to do everything I could for them. I hate my co-workers who put the blame for their fuck-ups on me and play games with me like yesterday. I hate my neighbors for being the absolute fucks of humanity. The one to the right of me who proclaims how she is a “professional” dog trainer but has no control over her dog and the one she watches as they slam against the door or window of her apartment, viciously growling and barking at anyone who walks by. I hate the other ones who glare and whisper about me as I walk by. I hate people in general, rude asshats at the store, on the roads, and in general.
Most of all, I hate myself. My looks. My health. My life. I hate I have never selfishly taken advantage of anyone to get what I want. I hate that I cared too much to leave anyone broken, because of money. I hate myself because I am not good enough for anyone to stand up for me when others lie and damage my reputation when they know that it’s just not true. I hate myself because everything I have done over the course of the 51 years I have lived to improve myself, has crumbled at my feet.
This whole thing, open diary, has done nothing to help me. I have said the something thing, over and over since I joined, in different ways to no avail.  All of you who have made comments, thank you from the bottom of what’s left of my heart.

Still feeling the same as yesterday. My son had his first chorus concert last night and I couldn’t get to it. Why? Because the same shrill b$%^h who wrote me the guilt note that spared no words to say what a shit human being and shit man and father I am. Her new husband is more of a man and a father than I ever was…
I didn’t ask for this life. I didn’t walk away, I was forced. By her and everyone else. I’ve cried out for help and support for these years because I just couldn’t do it all on my own. For some reason, I have this fucking stupid idea in my head that she cares for me, but is putting up this wall. Truth is, this is all her.
She was evil enough to quietly set it up behind my back and spring it on me without any compassion. She shrewdly lied and broke promises to me. Two weeks into it she left the card she got for him out that stated her love for him, more love than she has ever felt, wanting to spend the rest of her life with him. She was engaged a month after the separation and remarried days after the divorce was final. She turned all my acquaintances against me. She took everything and now talks to me like I was some nasty fuck that held her hostage for 20 years. Hate that I have no clue where it came from. But, I sit here thinking that she just let it get out of control. I keep waiting for the “honeymoon” phase to end and for her to at least realize what she did to a good man who sacrificed everything for her happiness.
That won’t happen
Thing is, I have a problem, an illness, that holds me back from healing and moving forward. No one gives a fuck. I’m no longer useful to any of them. I am already not comfortable with the new therapist I will be seeing. It will be two weeks until I do. She’s made more mention about the costs and getting paid, than why I was seeking help. She refuses to hear anything from me until that time and expressed that I fill out paperwork ASAP.  Maybe I am expecting too much. Maybe this is how the real world is. I just spent 20 years in a bubble where everything was bright and happy until it stopped abruptly for reasons I will never know. I was written off by everyone one I held dear and left in the desert alone with nothing. I can’t do it anymore.
September last year I thought I had turned a corner. I gave up smoking, lost 45 pounds, and was even exercising on a regular basis. I developed a confidence I never had. Then, in a matter of 3 weeks, I was told that I wasn’t religious enough by a self-proclaimed recovering drug addict and alcoholic who “found God”. I was told that I was too old by a woman 5 years younger. I was told that I wasn’t “financially set” and that I had too young of children to date. I spent yet another holiday alone with no salutations or visits. I was called creepy for asking a girl I knew for years for coffee.  I was straight off lied to by a woman, a friend, whom I had talked to from 2 months after the separation, almost daily, who professed that she would be there for me if she ever came back “home”. She did in December, a week before Christmas. I have never heard from her since. She hasn’t returned calls or texts, nothing. People wonder why I gave up. Why I don’t embrace this “new life”? Why do I feel too old and lost? Why I don’t do this or that?
Yeah, I’m important all right, important enough for people to have a reason to pat themselves on the back because their “words” and inspirational quotes, that one time, releases them of any quilt of me and says to the world that the 1 time they did so is more than enough.
I’m held here by the love of my children. I know full well, that I can no longer raise them how I wanted to, dreamt of, and hoped to. My relationship with them is completely changed because of her. Yet, even if had the money, I just wouldn’t be able to walk away from them or anyone else, as they have all done to me.
I know when my time comes and goes, besides the boys, that I won’t be remembered for nothing more than a failure who was just an annoyance because he never was a “man”, an adult, or just anything.

I can’t regulate right now. I’m slipping into anxiety attack mode and I’m really trying to calm myself.
I hate this. Over 3 years and I am suffering just the same. Wracked with miss placed guilt over not being able to keep Patty happy enough to stay with me. Wracked with guilt that I will never be the father I wanted to be for the boys. Unable to do anything and knowing I have to, to live. I just can’t see the light at the end of the tunnel.
I’m a joke. I’m no real man. Who would want me? No one has ever regretted leaving me. I hear all the time how after break ups, the one who caused it has come back in some form, whether a crying phone call or a moment of weakness, but never for me. People leave me and burn everything to the ground and salt the earth, so nothing will ever grow again.
OK, I admit it, I suck at money. I never had plan. I’m always behind on stuff. I make stupid impulsive purchases and had barely any savings ever, but I loved with my whole heart. I was honorable and faithful.
It was never good enough. I just want to give up. I’ve reached the point where I can’t keep treading water anymore. I need help, but to get the help on my own is causing so much anxiety and guilt. I should commit myself to a 30 day program,  but I can’t because I have work responsibilities. I feel like I’d be further abandoning my kids. That my absence will causes other people’s life difficulties. I can’t afford to do that, even though I really should. I should have from day one.
I need someone stronger than me in my life, but someone who communicates their issues. It’s all fault. Ever since the day my 1st wife told me she was pregnant, I tried to do the right proper thing, but it wasn’t.  I was blamed for getting her pregnant. I was blamed for the divorce. I was told that I didn’t have to marry her by the same people that told me to take responsibility. I worked the long shitty job like a man should for his family only to watch my family be ripped away and given to another. Twice. I never properly grieved or dealt with things, because I was told to man up and shake them off. But I just never did.
It’s almost 1 in the morning and I am typing this on my phone with tears in my eyes for the 2000th time. I’m not saying someone has to do this for me, but everyone knows I am struggling and not one of them has even lifted a finger to help me at all.
I don’t want to live anymore and I wish that something would just end it. Die in my sleep. A heart attack. Stroke. A plane falling out of the sky on top of me. Something. I just don’t want to live this way. I want what I had back, I did nothing to have everything taken from me.

There’s a part of me wanting so bad to be someone new, someone different, but I’m held back by the past. By responsibilities that seem as though no one else have. Morals and ethics are supposed to be important, everyone says they are, but at the end of the day, only the person who is moral and ethical loses.
HERE WE GO AGAIN
I spent most of my adult life trying to do the right thing. Never selfishly thinking of myself and now I am paying for it and all they can say is, I brought it on myself. I just don’t want to feel guilty anymore for doing what everyone else does, living my life. Everything I do is the wrong thing. Don’t pay a bill to pay a bigger one, ” You’re so irresponsible.” Can’t get my boys for the weekend because I only have just enough gas to get back and forth to work, “You don’t love your boys enough.” People put me in spots and complain and yell that I’m in that spot. Patty took everything, without one spread of respect or an ounce of guilt and now calls me a poor scumbag, knowing full well she kicked me into the pit. Now I’m judged. I’m judged by banks as a risk so I can’t get a loan that could change my life. I’m judged by women on dating sites when they want to know me. I’m supposed to be this man everyone wants, but I never seem to fulfill. I was a loving father and husband, no good enough. I was a caring brother, not good enough. I was a best friend, not good enough. I am a hard worker, not good enough.
It seems my life is nothing but dominoes and egg shells and any direction is the wrong move.
I have always accepted my responsibilities, but I’m tired of also having responsibilities heaped on me from people who shirk theirs.
I’m sick of writing these everyday as I am sure people are sick of reading the same whiney things everyday. I guess all along it is me. I am to blame for my and others bad lives. The cruelest thing is I am too oblivious to see that I have dragged people down all my life and most are worse off from knowing me.

Can someone explain why a person who ended the relationship has to be so nasty?
My part in it… During our marriage, I couldn’t keep a job. Let me explain. I was fired once, the rest was either I was let go due to money issues in the department or like my last one, I was trained to do a job that they decided they needed a microbiologist to do the same thing.
We had 2 cars repossessed. Lost one home, but in the same breath, we’re given another.  So, yeah, I sucked at money. Maybe I should have changed on my own.  I’m an adult, right, but I’ve learned that I had a personality disorder and among other things, it made me impulsive. I still am, but now I understand myself better and work every day to control myself. Does that win me back my life? No.
At no time did she ever ask me to sit down and tell me we had to get our act together ( or my act depending on who’s telling the story)
That’s the only issue I can think of or be indirectly told of. To me, we had an essentially fight-free marriage. We enjoyed our kids, worked together on projects and improvements, took Sunday drives, and sat down every night as a family. I understand and realize that sometimes love is unsustainable and shit happens, but she cheated and lied. She broke the marriage for whatever reasons that were bouncing around in her head. I regret leaving and not putting up more of a fight, but there was nothing there. She had checked out as soon as she blindsided me with it all.  No compassion for the man you spent almost half your life with and had 4 children with. The man who brought you into a real family that loved you as a daughter and sister.
So why, when I walked and gave you everything and left with nothing does she have to be this nasty vindictive person? Why throw shit in my face when she knows full well she broke me mentally, financially, and emotionally? Why say shit like “well I knew you wouldn’t pay for this” or ” I have to pay for all this, no thanks to you” when as soon as the same day I left she moved in a 2nd income source? I was homeless for almost 3 weeks. I was given the marriage debts that I pay almost $300 a month for and I’m still paying after 3 years. She has taken several trips, paid for a wedding, and is in the middle of remodeling my childhood home with the huge tax returns for the boys and the closed to $10000 in stimulus payments from the last two years. There is no mortgage payment at all. I have to pay $700 a month. I literally starve 3 days a week, yet like her, social services think I make tons of money. So much money I actually have bonfires of just cash. I’m single, what responsibilities do I have, Right?
I get talked down to like I was the cheating lying abusive one and somehow she and he have turned most people who know me against me.
WHY? She has everything she ever wanted and all it cost her was my whole life up until the break. Yet, I am treated like shit.

Cloudy skies, but humid. No real breeze. Starting to regret sitting outside.
Never been a summer person or any season person.
My future just limped by. He didn’t even respond to my greeting. Head down, but you could see the lost look in his face. He lives two doors down and it’s kind of weird seeing him outside at this time. He usually goes out at dawn or the dark of night. His windows are darkend out and there is no lawn chair outside.
Across the way the “odd” neighbors are gathered. It’s good to see them having fun, but the language is something to be desired.  I figure it’s about an hour away from the sparklers, lady fingers, and bottle rockets.
The call to the kids goes unanswered, but it’s OK. I know they are having a good family time together.

I wrote a post first thing yesterday where I tore into people and was reminded by a comment that my feelings don’t matter and I’ve made myself the victim of my own crime.
Once again I was told by someone to man up, grow up, and move on. Others have problems too.
There’s no point to argue my case because my situation is nothing compared to others.
My wife leaves me and more or less destroys everything about me. Well, I should be happy that she is happy, that’s all I need to move on.
My friends deserted me, but I should be thankful they’re healthy.
The kids seem to have taken it all in stride and I should be happy they adjusted well.
 
I read an article today about an 18yr old celebrity who committed suicide and how tragic it is. Everyone knew he was depressed and they all did what they could for him. If only he would have manned up and have been an adult. If only he would have stopped asking and begging for help. Wow, such a weak-assed kid.
 
*Because we live in the world we do and people don’t have the common sense to understand sarcasm, unless they say or do it, the last thing I wrote there is just that, sarcasm. It is a tragedy, but the difference is that people who “loved and cared” for him tried, they made the effort. I somehow, without the money or fame, am supposed to roll with it. I can’t afford the help. I can’t afford rehab. I don’t have anybody falling over themselves to help me or council me here in the real world, but I am sure I will once again be told to man up and put on my big boy pants, by someone who does or someone who has never been this low and defeated. 
 
And that is officially my last personal post here.

So, I’m forcing myself to write today. I won’t go into the usual crap, nothing has changed there, but that doesn’t matter. Trying to come to grips that the relationship I wanted with my boys will now have to be something else like Kayla all over again.  I already have regrets about stuff even though I’ve done everything I possibly can given the circumstances. I’m sure we will be close, but not as it would have been if I was still there raising them in a whole family. They will have his influence, whether good or bad, it will be there.
This thought will probably anger people, but I have never had something that was truly mine. Ok, underwear, but nothing significant. Not a relationship, friendship, and even fatherhood. All those things I usually come out on the bad side even when doing it right.
But, I said I wasn’t going to go into the stuff as I have.
 
What’s new in my life. I have just come from the Orthopedic office. Had both knees drained and pumped up with cortisone. It hurt like hell, but my doctor there is a very attractive woman, so it’s a give and take. Had x ray’s done and I definitely need both knees replaced, that ought to be fun to go through alone. Seeing that I more than met my insurance deductable with all the Roswell visits I am hoping to get this done before November.
Had a like on bumble and we started chatting last night, it went great, I thought. Her profile is gone today.
So, yeah

So a literally far removed family member said this:
“For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction”
Yes I am actually related to him through his Grandfather.
I am that equal and opposite reaction.
I am the garbage dumpster for every one’s good things. For their good actions or things that come their way, the opposite reaction alway, or atleast the last 4 years, seems to fall on to me.
I can’t catch a break.
 
I didn’t want to write this, I have spent the last 3 hours fighting the urge, but I guess that’s my problem. I never know when I should sink back into my hole and not annoy everyone with my crap.

Apparently, a large percentage of women around my age who are single believe there is a white whale of a man out there waiting on them. A man who has no past hardships or scars. A man who is vulnerable, but doesn’t show it. A man who says screw you to the old relationships, but will fall in line with what they expect, demand, or want. A man who will accept their mood swings, past, and scars without question, yet will never once bring up his pains. A man who if he has children should be a good father to them, but always put her first, because as she says, “children are very resilient and as long as you show love, they will be there.” even if she has never had them. If she has children, they will always come first no matter what.
Now, these “white whales” are always trumped by looks and/or money. You can be the most fucked up man in the world, but if you look awesome or you come with money to make their lives ten times easier, any amount of shitty past can be chalked up to life’s mistakes. Heck, they may even accept some jealousy and abuse as long as in the end, they can have nice stuff, trips, and possessions.
As I am learning, I am not either. Apparently, I am a Plecostomus. That’s the fish that eats all the shit at the bottom of the fish tank. I have my role, it’s useful, but no one gives a fuck about me until I can’t clean their mess.

It just really bothers me that someone won’t take a chance on me because they just may have to acknowledge I have hurts and pains in life too that maybe, just maybe they will have to maybe sometimes have to give me a hug or tell me things will be ok.
Why a person you spent 20 years loving, be devoted to, and treating as the most important person in the world, can just one day turn on you and from that point treat you as if you are the shittiest of shit person. No regard for this man’s life, survival, or health concerns. The man who is your children’s father is only good enough for weekly payments and paying off debts you also made.
Why do I even care for any other person. On this planet where 95% of people would push me in front of a bus to have a few extra inches in line. After all, it seems to me people seem to like assholes more than honest to God decent people.

Apparently it is me. Everything is me. I am meant to be my own person, as long as that fits into another’s view or wishes.
I’m told to heal, but told I’m not doing it right. I’m told to express my thoughts and opinions, but told they are wrong.
I’m told to be a father, but not like that or told I’m doing it wrong by another who in no possible way can be a father. Oh yeah, I forgot, it’s 2022.
 
Screw it. I wanted to write more, but it doesn’t matter. My truth is all wrong anyway, I’m constantly told. Oh some people try to be nice about it, but it’s a very condescending type of nice.
I’m tired of having my happiness torn to shreds for other’s.  I’m tired of having to be happy for them because they “found their happiness ”  I’m done being the nice considerate push over. Seriously,  it’s over. Staring with my crap neighbor and her nasty as dogs. First comment out of her mouth hole is going to be shoved straight back into her.

I just hate myself. I hate the fact that I have put everything and everyone infront of my own self for most of my life and they have all just shit on me. I’m sorry for the language, but honestly there is no nice way of putting things anymore.
I appreciate the love I get from some of you here and I wish I could live up to the hopes and thoughts you have for me, but it’s not going to happen. Not how I think you want for me.
I’m just angry at a world that doesn’t owe me anything,  but sure likes to beat the f out of me on a daily basis.
 
I know the the responses I will get and I realize it’s all my fault. I’m the piss poor whiney bitch boys who thinks I deserves something no one is promised in life.  All I ever want was to be told why. I don’t give a f that Patty doesn’t love me, but I have never done anything what so ever to her to hate me like she does now, yet I’m supposed to just accept that 20 years of my life doesn’t mean shit anymore and I am suppose to act like it never happened. I lost my hair, my looks, my health, friends and relationships and I’m the bad guy because I feel cheated that I gave up everything that made me who I am for what amounts to nothing.  And I have to accept that and be one of the few who doesn’t deserve any sort of help or support.
Its great to be told about the injustices of life from people who have never really went through them. The ones who tell me how to feel about my dead daughter, who never lost a kid. The one who tells me about dealing with a broken marriage, while they sit in theirs. How not everyone is this way or that way, when if given the chance wouldn’t think twice about pushing me aside to escape a fire. Everyone knows what I am feeling and how I’m hurting better than me and my thoughts are just stupid and wrong.
 
Yes, I am losing my shit today, but that’s that. These will probably be deleted later, because like always I will choose once again to bend over and take it because someone else feels offended.

Yeah, I went off the reservation today with my entries
Thing is, I don’t know how to live anymore and I’m in constant pain physically, mentally,  emotionally,  and financially. The divorce didn’t take it all from me, but was the shove off the cliff.
I can’t seem to find my place in the world, because everything I have tried over the 51 years of my life have all ended in failure and heartache for me and those around me. Enough so that my people have left my side instead of once again being part of my failures anymore.
I have to let it all go. Let go of everything and everyone.

Look, I lost my mind this weekend. It happens from time to time. I have at least seven opposing views about how to move forward going on in my noodle and there is absolutely no common thread to any of them.
I have tried to heal over these last few years and I have constantly been met by people telling me I am doing it wrong, but in the same breath, they tell me I have to do it on my own. What used to be, “you’re not my type” has become “you’re not at the same place as me in life.”  It wouldn’t be so hard dealing for me if I had spent my life selfishly thinking of myself and all others be damned, but I haven’t. I  have lived for others. Given up who I am and my dreams to another only asking for someone to be there for me. Not a demanding ask, just a be there request.
I will use my friend Sean as an example. I don’t think he ever considered another’s feelings when it came to him living his life. Seriously, if the opportunity came around for him to screw your girlfriend, he would, with no “bro” code whatsoever. He had 2 sons with his first wife and at the time seemed like a great dad, until the divorce. Although he was receptive to his young children, he was absolutely not there for either of them. He immediately went back to living a life of no responsibility and selfishness. Not one person ever called him out on his shit. He had so much potential but lived (lives) a life of just enough. His 2nd marriage was over and done about as fast as it began, and he didn’t skip a beat, and no one abandoned him, even I let him stay with us for 2 weeks. There was a passing appreciation when he was there, but that was instantly forgotten when he moved on. The 3rd came with 2 children not his own, but to who he gave a bunch of time and effort, even more than his own boys. That relationship ended and immediately he left their lives, with whom he spent over 5 years in. In no time, he’s now into his 4th major relationship, with a very successful woman who also has a son. He doesn’t bring anything to the relationship other than being fun to be around. He hardly works, has no pot to piss in, smokes pot, drinks way too much, and sits on the PlayStation more than a teenager. He’s 51 years old. I can’t even get 2 dates out of an ex-alcoholic.
My other friend Tony, who I will be the first to admit had a rough youth, now has a horseshoe up his ass and unlike me, he is there for Sean constantly. For friendship and support. Where I was told that he didn’t want or care to hear about my divorce, he’s planned parties to cheer up Sean. They organized 50-year birthday parties for each other and have yet to tell me happy birthday on mine and it’s been a year and a half. I guess the point is that they have a friendship that for some reason I thought I was part of, but like all my relationships, I overvalue my importance. Both my marriages ended abruptly and each ex wasted no time getting back into a relationship, without so much as a regret, even with us having kids.
I guess it is me. I am the factor in it all. I don’t feel like a narcissist, in fact I know I am not one, so I guess I’m just worthless to people. I guilt my way into their lives and they just reach a point where they could care less if I die and never get heard from again. Over dramatic? It definitely sounds like it, doesn’t it? Yet, I swear on the life of my children that that is the way it has gone.
People notice me when there is a reason to tell me I’m wrong in their eyes. I have done something to upset their applecart. When the shoe is on the other foot, I am unfortunately in their way and I am insignificant.
 
None of what I write makes any sense and it shows. I need to be committed or call it as it is, I’m disabled because of my mental state. Eventually, it’s going to totally break and someone is going to be hurt and not just me. When you know you need help, but you also know that that help is unaffordable for you, what do you do? You all can tell me, yell at me, that I need professional help, but how? Where? No one is going to have a GoFundMe for Colby to go for a 30-day mental rehab. Dr. Phil isn’t going to come around with a show-funded commitment. My “loving” family and friends are not going to care enough for an intervention, I haven’t even received a hug from any of them. So, how, where do I find the “help”? Especially when my faith has been so damaged that I just refuse to hear the religious angle of it all.  I just don’t know how to find a cult to join either.
 
So here I am in horrible depressed lonely limbo. Every effort I have attempted has added more to it than relieved it.

What do you do when you finally realize you’re nothing? That most of your life you have been sheltered and essentially lied to? When you are stuck in a spot mentally and physically where you can’t seem to get help?
It’s funny, I know exactly what is wrong with me and how to try and fix myself, but I don’t want to. I can’t get over that hump alone. Everyone can remind me and/or tell me I have to, but I just can’t. No one seems to care enough to see this and try to help, whether with or without my blessing, they just write me off and move on. Other than the comments I get on here, I have not heard from anyone, other than my boys, in months. Some even years. Yes, I have made the effort to get in touch, but it has gone nowhere.
 
All this makes me hurt. Seriously, I feel this constant pressure in the middle back of my head, a throbbing dull pain that never goes away. Not when I am happy like I was at Jonathan’s graduation or when I take the medications for it. It is just always there. There’s a filter over me where I just can’t enjoy life in any way and can’t escape my problems. My days are filled with thoughts and my nights are filled with dreams of my pains. I just want to hear from someone who has mattered to me in my life that it is ok. That the missed time with the boys is ok. That I did nothing wrong. That I am justified for feeling hurt and betrayed. I know that I had a hand in everything thing that went bad, somehow and someway, but I accepted it and apologized, and yet it’s as though no one cares. Why? Why have my own flesh and blood siblings turned away from me? Why have my lifelong friends just left me broken and alone? Why does it seem like I carry a stench that repels people, even though I can’t be any friendlier and kinder?

I really want to talk to someone, well I want to talk and I want them to listen, agree, and tell me I’m ok that is.
My oldest is back home after a 3 day visit and every feeling I fight so hard to escape rushes right back in and I know I’m going to be a mess.
The couple people I have to possibly contact are more than likely busy or just can’t handle my shit today, not that they have any other.
Sites like better health and talk space sat they can put you with a therapist instantly, but that’s so far from the case and I really don’t want to overwhelm some poor volunteer at a crisis line.
People ask why I feel so alone, thus, this here is why. I have no one emotionally available to talk or listen to me. Everyone in my life does, they have spouses, friends, and family. I have to fight with myself to call a stranger or look to you all, who don’t even know me for support.

What did she lose? She still lives in the same house, with all her things, and the kids 24/7.  What did my friends lose? They still hang out every Friday and have party’s.  What did my siblings,  especially my sister lose? Nothing, none of their lives changed.
Why was I the one punished? I worked to keep the marriage and family together. I checked in on my friends religiously,  for birthday and holidays. I bent over backwards and kept my mouth shut when my sister berated my parenting skills.

I want to write, but it’s always the same thing over and over. I want to live, but I just can’t seem to get passed myself. I want to matter, but I have learned that I never had.
All my memories now have asterisks with them. I can’t remember them as completely as I should and no one cares enough anymore to help fill in the blanks.
I learned to love from my parents, but I will never have that. The world is against me. It’s been a hard pill to swallow that no one will love me as my parents loved each other.
Why do I not get a 2nd chance? All the years and memories with Patty and the first chance she had to walk, she took it and had no second thought of destroying me. Oh, I am sure she doesn’t speak ill of me in front of the kids, but she doesn’t talk about me at all with them. She never sat them down and explained anything to them, just forced a new man into their lives hours after I left to give her “time to think”. What’s worse, all I have ever been told was it was about finances.
Maybe I am missing something? Maybe I should care less about others. I should destroy people and others’ relationships for my own gratification. Maybe I should steal the watch off a dying man’s wrist instead of helping him. Maybe that’s what life is about. Maybe I missed that point in my years of reading and learning the Bible. I must have because it appears that the sinners and the selfish have everything they ever wanted.
Maybe I am unloveable? It has seemed so easy for others to give up on me, leave me, and forget me. Three women in my life that I gave up on myself for, just dumped me from their lives without so much as a thought.
I must be a lousy brother, father, and friend too. No one has come to me in my hour of need as I have them. My kids go through the motions for holidays and birthdays. The “homemade” projects that they make in school are almost the only time they show I matter. In an age of cell phones, texting, and video chats, I still have to contact them. I love them all, but in the 3+ years I have been out of the home, I have received maybe 3 calls “out of the blue” and those were just questions. No, I don’t expect them to be lost without me, but every visit I get with them, they call their mom before bed. How have I become the horrible one?
Yes, I am a whiny bitch. I have a “woe is me” attitude. I scream of the lack of fairness in an unfair world. No one owes me shit. Only I can make myself happy. Yada, Yada, Yada…
 
Even I hate me.

I spent some time looking at myself in the mirror this morning. I really don’t like what I see, I haven’t for a long time. Maybe everyone is right to have left.
Although I have lost some weight, I look disgusting. Besides the obvious fat, the loose hanging skin just looks ugh. Age hasn’t been kind to my body, in all kinds of ways. “Things” don’t work right anymore so essentially if I would happen to fall into a relationship, I wouldn’t be able to “please” anyone in that way. This has been the case for probably 4 months before she left me, so it probably was just one more reason she was done with me.
Whatever looks I may have had 20+ years ago are well gone now. I am sick of being bald. It has made me look odd and ugly since 2004. If I let my “hair” grow it looks as though I am a dog with mange.  My facial hair is a combination of several shades of red, which is weird seeing that I had dirty blond hair when I had hair. No matter how I groom it, it looks like crap, but my “clean” face looks worse.
No matter what style of glasses I wear, they all look odd on me.
The world doesn’t help either. I’ve been called creepy for giving compliments. Creepy for asking people I have known for years to meet up and talk over coffee. The looks I get for just saying “hello” to a stranger in the store only add to the truth I feel about myself.
 
I am more than willing to go back to therapy, but because of covid and a society that believes women are men, men are women, and dogs are cats, therapists are limited. Also, it seems only well off richer people can afford one. My insurance sucks and therapists agree because trying to find one that accepts it is harder than finding the golden fleece. A 45-60 minute session of having your issues repeated to you in question form cost over $100 a session. That’s essentially my food and gas for a week. Honestly, I just want to go to have a friend at least once a week. Yeah, I am at the point where I need to pay for a friend. I am at a point where I would waste $500 on an escort just to come over and talk and maybe cuddle for a little bit of time.
I am a disgusting man, who has pissed away any sense of companionship trying to do the “right thing” and live what I was raised to believe was a moral and proper life. Now it’s just a selfish “me first” world and I just don’t fit in anymore.
 
I know, and people will say, that I am in control of my own happiness. No one else is, but everything I have tried, everything I have done has done nothing whatsoever to me.

I guess it was the speed at which people shut me out of their lives that keeps haunting me. Patty wasted absolutely no time jumping into things with her new husband. It still tears me up that all those years, times, and memories didn’t even count for a speck of doubt to her. Same with my “friends” and others.
 
I don’t know what it is that keeps stopping me from embracing and accepting this “new life”. I do know that the criticism and guilt I get from her and my sister definitely throws a monkey into the wrench. I never have learned to please myself first and people know that and use it against me like a weapon.
 
I can’t accept the fact that I am doing everything a man can, given the circumstance, for the kids, but somehow it doesn’t ever feel enough.

Wendy,
You’re my big sister and I have always loved you. I remember going everywhere with you as a kid. Your “hot” friends that, inevitably led to my unhealthy obsession with women in general. You’re the only female figure in my life and I have always held total respect for women because of growing up with you. That said, you have broken my heart even more than Patty ever could.
I came to you when she turned on me. I really don’t know how you couldn’t see the absolute pain I was in. I choked on my words, begging for some compassion and understanding. What did you do? You yelled at me that your “access” to the boys might be damaged and drove away. Hours later as I called you, trying to fight off the “thoughts”, you would not answer and said nothing when your husband called and threatened to “kick my ass” if I didn’t leave you alone.
Since that day, when you “talk” to me, it has been ridden with guilt and shame for not being the father I should be for the boys. Yelling at me for my depression and anxiety. In fact, your big thing is how not me, not Patty, but you are the only one for the boys. You are the only one there for them, the only one showing them what family is. This apparently means, that when your real father is instantly “replaced” by a strange man, it should be immediately accepted. It doesn’t matter that your real father was a wonderful man to your mother and you. Women should be allowed and even encouraged to make themselves happy. Weeks later you showed them all was good as you had them all over for parties, birthdays, and holidays like I was never a factor. They never saw their mother receive any sort of ramifications for doing what she had done. You made it look like it was the best thing she could have ever done to their father.
I can’t and won’t say that you have never faced hurt in your relationships. You had bad boyfriends through the years, of course, your choice in men sucked ass, in my opinion. Just like a lot of women, you had to have the “bad boy” so you can change them. You lost Don, your 1st husband to cancer. Don, who went against the grain of guys you had in your life. He wasn’t the bad boy, of course, he was well off, so, there’s that. His death was hard, but you now tell anyone who will listen that he was horrible to you, something no one else ever saw. You say that dad knew, but our father wouldn’t have let that go on. If he had so much of an inkling that Don hurt you, he would have pulled him inside out. Remember this was the man who literally pulled the father of Scotty’s bully out of his window and beat the shit out of him. I guess what I am saying is, that you have never been broken up with. You have never been divorced. You drag the name of a dead man through the dirt, who left you wealthy and went on to marry another asshole, with whom you used all that money and you have never had a child of your own.
Is that harsh for me to say? Yeah, but you are in no position, and neither is Patty, nor your husband, to guilt me or correct me in how I feel and have reacted to all of this. In fact, no one is. Not you, not your husband, not Patty, or my shitty friends have any idea what I have gone through and none of you have ever shown any sort of consideration to understand.
All I ever wanted was to have some normalcy in all of this, but I guess I have never been worth that from you or anyone. You, like all of them, won’t like who I am becoming as I alone climb out of this hole you all left me in.

Today started out with so much promise. So much for that though.
None of the boys came over or wanted to. I’m not going to force them to just because I need someone. That’s my problem and why I am now in the place I am in. I’ve forced people all my life to be with me. Whether through things I did or said or because I made them feel quilts and shamed if they didn’t, I made them stay.
In the Grand scheme of it all, I deserve to be where I am now for what I have and have not done. The proof is right there. Both of my ex wives kicked me out of their lives and immediately jumped into a new one with others men and they are happier than they had ever been with me.  I gave the kids the choice if they wanted to come over and they chose not to. Kind of don’t blame them, I suck to be around.
I hate weekends. I hate any extended time alone with myself. I have no money to go anywhere or do anything, well unless I don’t want to pay my bills or rent.
My head constantly hurts from it all. There like a dull ache in the back middle of my brain, just enough that it seems to not let the thoughts and pains get out and let new in. I almost wish I was brave enough to try hard drugs and have that out of body experience or something, just to stop thinking and stuck dwelling.

I’ve been stupid this whole time. It’s hit home like a ton of brick today. The answer that I’ve been searching for 3 years and couldn’t get from her, friends, family, or even therapy, just came to me.
Although I have a lot of traits of BPD, she is the one who actually has it. I probably could have even stayed in my home with my “bubble” for most of this time. That’s all on me though and honestly it wouldn’t have lasted too long before the eventual divorce anyway.
She lost her father at 10. As much as I ha e been told, things weren’t the greatest in her parent’s relationship and as have probably written, her mom became about “what can you do for me” then “how can we do this together” and as much as Patty hated that, she was bound to become that, and she did.
Me, I was raised by both my parents. A mother who hated the fact that my grandmother was pretty selfish and horrible to my grandfather, so mom showed more then she should have, respect to me and my brothers and by a father who was raised in a family of sisters and learned that you should overly respect women, almost to the point of being walked over. I think it’s called being a gentleman or “nice guy syndrome”. My my mom’s dad was the same too, because my grandmother rolled the fuck over that poor man. Did my mom have secrets? If she did, they died with her in 2017. All I know is I have been a week willed nice guy to women and friends and it’s cost me everything. The damage is done, no putting the genie back with anyone before this point. I have tried to “repair” relationships, but it’s too late and honestly why should I, it’s time they “step up”, I’ve did my end of things.
My crimes? I let myself go some. I was never a cut type of guy. Obviously I had a “dad bob” since I was 20, I was a dad. I chose enjoying my employment over just working and getting status. I let my opinion be known in out village and people never confronted me, instead they gave Patty shit at her job. I have become impotent, not by choice, but it happened and it effected me and Obviously her too. Would it have been better that we talked about instead of her looking for it outside the marriage, yeah, but you women are human too. I did do my share of house work, yard work, and kid raising and I never used it as a “I did this so need to do that” thing. I did it because it had to be done. She is lying if she ever said that I didn’t.
Point is, I am the guy most women will say they want, but really don’t, unless it’s an open marriage and they need a free babysitter/ provider. Let’s not kid ourselves, those of you who tell me I seem like a great guy all wouldn’t be caught dead in a relationship with me other then a friendship.  That’s all on me though.
If I can avoid it, this is the last time I will post, write, or mention my whiney poor me feelings. I will still write, it’s the only conversing I do nowadays, but I’m going to be the aloof, sort of an asshole, type that people seem to want to know and be around instead of the agreeable pushover nonrespected loser I have been for 40+ years.

I think those of you who commented on my last entry misunderstood what I was saying. Totally understandable given that 99.9% of everything I have written here is “waa waa, poor me, life sucks”.
 
But seriously, I was trying to convey that something has “clicked” finally. That I have somehow got through the fog of it all and have seen my divorce and frankly life, for what it is. 50% my fault and 50% theirs. I have always been too kind to really blame the “others” for my life’s crappiness. I have mostly believed it was something I was or wasn’t doing, but it’s them.
Sure, no one wants to be around a sad loser, but I have become mostly that way because I judged myself and my accomplishments on the thoughts and feelings of others. IDK, maybe it is because even though my parents kind of spoiled me, they were also rough on me, for my own good. Compliments we’re very far between. They knew me better than I ever knew myself and believed I could be so much more, even more, successful than my siblings. I would bring home “B’s” and they would say it should be “A’s”. The “A’s” should be “A +”. My dad would have me re-rake the leaves, finding the few stray ones. He never really taught me sports, because he knew if I didn’t want to play them, what would it accomplish wasting his and my time. My mother never really answered my homework questions, instead, I had a mother who had thousands of books and the Encyclopedia Brittanica and every year’s update. Yes, I was the kid who burnt my hand to learn that fire burns, fell out of the tree to learn that not all branches can hold your weight.
It sucks that at 51, I now understand what they were trying to do. It sucks that I have had 2 failed marriages and 5 children (one of which has died) that will never enjoy the highs and lows of being brought up in an environment that I was. That’s all I ever wanted for them.
I have spent 3+ years torturing myself that this was a failing on just my part. Sure an outside observer could say I did this or that wrong, but I will maintain that I did the best could without any “feedback” from anyone. Seriously, if you want something to be purple, don’t get mad if it’s blue and you never said anything. That’s what happened here, she let her issues fester. She kept her insecurities to herself. She felt the world owed her for her shitty upbringing. Her “friends” to advantage of her feelings because they couldn’t burn their shitty relationships down, so they pushed her and lived through it.
It all just “popped” into my head. Hours and gads of money later and I came up with the answer I have begged therapists and psychiatrists for.

I decided to go off topic from my usual rants and express my opinions… God help me…LOL
 

Roe vs Wade stuff.   About 31 years ago, my 1st ex-wife and I decided to get an abortion. We had Kayla and honestly that was extremely tough for a 19 and 18-year-old married couple. We were just barely getting by, even with the help from both our parents, but we were determined, or at least I was, to not have to be dependent on anyone. We could have and should have used protection in one form or another and we both knew the consequences, we were stupid. She was maybe just 2 1/2 months along when we made that choice. I think we both live with regret until today, but all choices come with two sides and have to be lived with. Also, knowing now what I didn’t then, there was an extremely good chance the child wasn’t mine, but I digress. Here’s the rub though, I totally agree with Supreme Court. Abortion should be a State’s call. In fact, a lot of laws should be too. It’s the United States of America, meaning 50 individual States working to be civil together, but having differing ways. States were set up that way. Not like other countries with territories or providences all under the thumb of one or a few officials. It should and in my opinion is, a great system if it is allowed to work as it was intended to. I for example live in New York State. We pay stupid high taxes and are essentially governed by the whims of the boroughs of New York City. Want an example? In 2016 the democratic primary, essentially every county in the state voted for Bernie Sanders. The 5 boroughs of the city voted for Hilary Clinton. She won.  A 322-mile area was decided for a 54,556 mi² state. Nothing is fair in this State. Area wise the majority of the state is Republican, but not the city, so yeah there’s that too.  Yet, I stay here because we don’t have oppressive heat, killer tornados, horrible drought, and only an occasional hurricane. When it snows, the world doesn’t shut down because the roads are passable. Not sure how the states in tornado alley tax their citizens or anything like that, could be they are financially better off and own more stuff, but could literally lose it all in 1 storm at any time. The point is States should be allowed to view things differently from one another and I’m sorry, even though I used it too, abortion is a totally unnatural process to do when there are thousands of safe sex methods out there and 90% of abortions are “whoops”. I also believe that rapes and life-threatening abortions should be allowed to happen. Vote people, that’s the way to change it. Not protesting or rioting or even following a judge or elected officials home or to restaurants.
Whatever Ted Cruz is bitching about gay marriage. Now here is something I believe should be left alone by the court. Why? There is the separation of church and State. You wish to be married in the eyes of God, marry in a church, but because it is a church, follow their rules. If you want to get married in a casino, county building, on a boat, or dressed up like two Marvel characters, whether it’s gay, not gay, or whatever the kids are calling it now, go ahead. Just know that it can’t happen in the beautiful church on the corner because they don’t believe in it and shouldn’t have to be forced because of the separation of church and State. Besides in most States, it is legal to do so in everywhere other than the church. Now if some made-up religious church, like Scientology, allows it fine, but don’t force the local Catholic church to especially if you only go there for Christmas and Easter. I personally don’t care if two men or women want to marry. Like most of them, it won’t last anyway, so why live with the Christian guilt of divorce when you can casually shake off the civil union?
The absolute craziness of the far left and far right. I consider myself a moderate conservative. right from wrong and common sense. I could care less if you are straight or not. I don’t care if you think you’re a space dog from Saturn or secretly a lizardman from the center of the Earth, just stop pushing it on every single person. Stop forcing it on others and then punishing them for not agreeing. Most arguments start because of someone belligerently forcing their views on another. The far-right and their purity of the white race or extreme bible views or the far left and their concepts that one race is worse than another and history is wrong or someone needs to be punished for it. The views on what a man or woman is, what gender means, what an individual should be, how you should be pure from the moment of birth and never make what they consider to be a mistake, a concept that changes every other minute. Honestly, because of the internet and 24-hour news cycles, people are just throwing shit at the wall and seeing what sticks so they or their “at the moment” odd thought can be seen as some toddler screaming “look at me”. Somehow, the majority of common sense people, like you and me, are now governed, guilted, and shamed by people who one day just thought of the craziest things to get attention for.

So there are some of the “other” thoughts that go through my noodle besides the usual depressed, woe is me stuff. You see, part of my issue is that I am considered a dinosaur because I tell a bad joke or say a word that used to be ok to say because people understood the ignorance of it and also that it was not intended as hurtful or hateful, you just gave it back the same or worse, laugh it off and kept playing or partying.
Offense nowadays can be found in any word, phrase, and action. “Hey guys, be careful” WHAT DO YOU MEAN GUYS? THERE ARE 2 WOMEN AND A MAN TRANSGENDER HERE TOO. “Hey, break a leg out there” WHY ARE YOU BEING SO HURTFUL AND VIOLENT TOWARDS ME? ARE YOU THREATENING TO BREAK MY LEG? “I just like milk chocolate” WHAT ARE YOU SAYING? IS WHITE CHOCOLATE NOT GOOD ENOUGH? DARK CHOCOLATE BAD? I could go on and on, everyone knows this, but every day there is someone or group that decides to have their “NOTICE US” moment over something that 99% of people understand that it’s not offensive or said in any offensive way.

261,https://www.opendiary.com/m/newt316/chicago-169-6128159/,2022-07-20,Chicago,"
Chicago has a new album out, Born for this moment. There isn’t a bad song on it, in fact, every single song is so good it transports you back to their music in the ’70s before they got all David Foster popish. Sure I miss Cetera and Terry Kath, but they seem to have recaptured the “sound” again.
I do love everything they have done over all years I have listened to them and have come to see the founding members as a type of a family to me.  I miss Terry and what a tragedy that happened to him. I miss as much as I am angry with Peter Cetera. I just don’t understand why he couldn’t have just sucked down his pride for one night when they were inducted into the Hall of Fame.  I am totally heartbroken over Walt Parazaider having Alzheimer’s and the inevitable effects that will steal his memories from the over 50 years with the band.
So many of my heroes have died or become sick and it kills a little bit of me as they do. I don’t know what I will feel if anything happens to the last 3 guys,  although the “new” generation of members will definitely keep the band alive, Robert Lamm, Lee Loughnane, and the coolest man on the planet, James Pankow, are all that is left of the heart and soul of Chicago.
I listened to it all on Spotify and I am not savvy enough to put a link here, but if you have Spotify and/or any music streaming and have an hour to relax and reminisce give yourself a treat.
 

See I can actually make a non-whiney, poor me entry… 😎

262,https://www.opendiary.com/m/newt316/struggle-100-6128261/,2022-07-21,Struggle,"
Well, I am once again struggling with the “thoughts”. I mean I am looking at things in another way, but Patty’s text kind of poked the bear. They are taking my oldest to Washington DC. I’m assuming it is for a graduation present and I am happy for him, he likes that sort of stuff. Where the mental problem comes in, is the fact that I can’t do anything like that and may never be able to. It’s not really a jealous thing and it’s probably all in my head. there are also several other things going on too. Caden my youngest, who has autism, has been put on medicine without me even being told until after the fact. I really don’t mind, but the fact that since the first day I have never been included in anything for the boys or even our late pets. In fact, she immediately allowed him into all the decisions as if I had always been a non-factor.
Of course, my sister is right there on the front lines of “what’s going on” and she doesn’t even inform me about things. Do you know what it is like to be accused or brow beaten about not knowing the things that you have never been included in? To be considered essentially “useless” by people who never tell you about anything until it’s happening or over? Oh, here’s my favorite, to be told “I had to pay for everything and you never help” when not one person asked me to or even my opinion about what it is.
 
Ok, I’m back-peddling on the gains I have made, I know, but I am also not falling apart about this as I have for the last 3+ years. This is totally a new thing for me to look at life as “what I do for me” instead of “what I do for others”.  I personally do not like that I have to be a good guy asshole who is supposed to be a mind reader and never assume that people in my life will ever put forth an effort for me to be a man. A man who has to be a certain type of person that I may or may not want to be to have and hold onto a relationship with. I have to learn to be happy for people who intentionally “fucked” me over for their selfish wants. I have to be the one to consider others’ wants and needs instead of my own or become the asshole who made their life tough. ( I gave up my share of my home, my family’s home that was left to me because it’s where the boys live, only to watch as the equity is used to take trips, buy cars, and other such items to make her life better, as I have struggled for 3+ years to even save $50)
So, I have accepted the fact that if I want anything or anyone in my life, I have to become someone other than who I have been for most of it. Or I can just be me, alone, and live, letting the chips fall where they may, accepting the fact that I will no longer be able to trust anyone to have my back, no one to depend on if I need a ride to and from a hospital or even someone who cares enough to check in with me at least once a week to be sure I’m not dead on the floor.
 
I don’t really care anymore about people other than my kids, so, I am happy Jonathan gets to visit DC. I am happy for Caden to get the help he may need to get some control over his Autism. I am happy they all can still enjoy somewhat of a “family” experience with their mom, aunt, uncle, and stepfather 🤑. All of that at my expense.
 
I hated writing this, but I had to talk to someone. In fact, that’s just one more thing I have to stop doing to be a “man” someone wants to hold close to them or wants a relationship with, allowing myself to expose my feelings or even being comfortable with others feeling toward me. I can no longer allow myself to ever become comfortable or secure with anyone as I did with my family and Patty ever again.

So my previous entry, which I wrote moments ago, was just my shitty old self peeking through, so you and I need a nice alternative.
 
 
 
Today here in Western NY it is one of the few summer days where the humidity is low enough that the warmth doesn’t feel oppressive. Not that it’s horribly hot, 75° and a slight breeze. The bugs aren’t being assholes also. Kind of day where you wish you had a hammock and some nice jazz playing.

264,https://www.opendiary.com/m/newt316/moving-forward-174-6128383/,2022-07-22,Moving forward,"
Last night I was laying on my couch listening to “calming meditative” music. First thing, it really doesn’t work for me, but I keep trying. Any-hoo, I have made a decision going forward, I’m just going to make plans. No more hopes or dreams, nope not anymore.
WHY??
Since I was a teenager every dream and/or hope has gone to shit. Either life threw a curveball at the last possible second or I have achieved it and handed it right over to someone else. Let’s see, when I met Vikki, my first wife, I was instantly in love. Although or probably, because I was 17, I dreamed and hoped to be with her, maybe get married and have kids and live together forever. Well, it actually happened and I fixed up our little trailer home, worked the 40hr job, and all that jazz. Then a POS name Jeff came along, Vikki left me, got the house (trailer) and child support, full custody, and pretty much all the above. Good ol’ Jeff got to be the “full-time father figure” to my daughter, moved into a pretty decent place, and turned Vikki totally against me (more than the “I just don’t love you as I should” she said). I lost the car I had wanted but kept the payments. Boy did he and her enjoy the shit out of it too. Trips and things I wanted to take with my “little” family, but she never wanted to, were taken by her and him. All of a sudden, babysitters were coming out of nowhere so they could have date nights on the weeks I didn’t have Kayla. And, I was left with nothing, except a little girl I got to see every other weekend, that is if I had paid the child support.
I had dreams and hopes with my 2 best friends/brothers from other mothers. Camping trips, hunting and fishing trips, and just pure F’n around stuff. Well, they got to do all that together and never included me. Even today that’s the case. Not sure why I keep insisting that they ever were my friends, even until today.
Then came Patty.
Just like Vikki, all I could dream and hope for was my life with her, even more so because I was an “adult” now. Through blood, sweat, and tears, I scrimped, sacrificed, planned, schemed, and worked my ass off to get us things. I did what most women would say a good husband/man should. I cleaned and cooked without being asked, and I cared for the kids as an equal partner should. I left my comfort zone to fix and improve our house to make her and the family happy and comfortable. I helped build up great savings and retirement. Everything I dreamed of and hoped for came true. 4 great boys to teach and mold into proper young men and everything. Then good ol’ Ed the homewrecker met Patty at work and preyed on any and all insecurity she had. Yes, she also had a huge part too, but when you know someone is married and has four kids, ethics and morals tell you to not do things like breaking a family apart selfishly. Plus old Ed was this “born again, Weslyan Christian man” and supposed to know the bible better than this old Lutheran. So Mr. Ed, with the checkered past, who up until a year before our separation was just a schlub of a man who coasted through his 58 years, was handed all that I built, dreamed, and hope for. The woman I loved, the role of “full-time father figure”, the home I put hundreds of hours into improving. Along with that, essentially all my savings and the money in the joint checking account. He essentially was given a great life without putting in anything for it.
 
So, no more dreams, no more hopes. I am done making them for others to enjoy. In the 32 years of my adult life, I’ve had to start over at zero, with absolutely nothing. I have never had a credit score over 550 because I have been saddled with debt for things I can no longer say are mine, all the while others enjoy them or “sell” them to fill their pockets. I’ve fathered 5 children who will never truly know what it is to be raised by me and will take on another’s views.
 
Just small possibly attainable plans for the rest of my life.

265,https://www.opendiary.com/m/newt316/diet-116-6129917/,2022-07-24,Diet?,"
OK I’m a fat schulb with no motivation. Some how last September I got motivated and lost 45pounds and quit smoking for 3 months then the holidays hit. It wasn’t all the great food, it was the depressing loneliness of what was once an awesome time to be part of a family.
So I’m back to wobbling around 255lbs and my gut constantly hurts. Not inside, but on the outside. It’s very tender and hard. I’ve never been fluffy fat. On top of that I have recti diastasis and I can’t do normal ab exercises.
Kind of wish I could hire a personal trainer and a life coach. Must be nice to be rich or famous and have all that.
Now, when I was losing all that weight, I wasn’t extremely active. I did this and that. It was mostly what I was eating and for the life of me, I can’t remember what it was. I certainly wasn’t eating enough, but I didn’t have any weird effects from it.
I do remember eating Fiber One every morning and I can’t seem to find it in the few stores around me lately, it’s alway gone. It had a shit ton (no pun intended) of fiber and actually tasted good. Not sure of the science, but I was full for most of the day and didn’t have cravings. Oh, I could eat, but I wasn’t a slave to it. It’s the late afternoon evenings that get me though. Oh, and the price of “healthy” food.
By all means, I don’t want to just sit around eating myself into disability, although I would certainly fit in here at the ol’ Derby NY ghetto 😅
I guess for some people it is probably the easiest thing dieting and exercising being alone and on your own, I just can’t find the motivation. At my age I think I can still get to a decent look, but nothing like if I was healthy for the last 30+ years. IDK 🤷‍♂️ maybe if someone showed some interest in me I could use it as a springboard or if I had active friends, or any friends for that matter. I hate to say it, but my kids aren’t the most active sporty types either, so the thought of keeping up with them is kind of a non-factor too.
Well, that’s just see what I can do these coming days, weeks, and months.

The boys are home and I could really use someone to talk to, but all I have is OD.
The apartment is so quiet now. I’m missing the sounds of boys fighting and goofy YouTube. Watching movies and making dinner together.

I can come to understand her failings and my failings. I can agree that humans suck and sometimes they do shit things.
But, I still hate the fact that I will never be able to have a family vacation or essentially family anything with the boys. Sure I can make my own “memories” with the boys, but I alone won’t ever have enough money to take the boys on a trip or anything. A restaurant here, a movie there, that’s all I can do. Yes, there are walks and drives and stuff like that, but those are memories that fade fast, not like a trip to DC or the huge water park or the week in a cabin.
 
I hate that Patty and Ed 🤑 get to do this, just one more thing they have taken from me.

Although I have gotten to a point where things don’t fill my head constantly, I still have the what-ifs and if only.
What if I fought harder to save my marriage? IDK, I was so beat with things then I just didn’t have the energy anymore. If only I had the support I could have had the strength to fight harder.
What if I stayed on course with my weight loss last fall? I could be at 180 lbs, healthier, I may be better looking to others, maybe filled with much more confidence and energy.
If only I wasn’t a “nice guy”. Instead, a man who stood up for himself. A man who didn’t spend the majority of my life pleasing others instead of incorporating them into my happiness.
 
It’s hard cleaning out the cobwebs in my head, picking what to throw out and what to keep, they all have value to me, but are holding me back. I wish I can get back to 15yr old me. I was confident and unafraid to be who and what I wanted. I kind of knew what I wanted in life and was sure I could get there. My friends were mine and saw me as someone they want to hang with instead of someone to pity.
Here I am at 51. My body is fighting me to do anything physical and my mind betraying my every thought to move forward. No, you can’t really chase your dreams at 51 and broke. No, you can’t do all the things you have wanted to. These are just things people say when they want to blow you off and not have an actual conversation and/or do not want to lift a finger to help you. I can no longer fly Apache helicopters let alone join the service. I can’t just pick up and leave and see the states. I can’t just worry about myself and flip off the world.
I should be 4 years from retirement. I should have a 20yr military career and am almost 20yrs into my chosen job. Sitting on military retirement and a decent 401 or pension. I should have a happy marriage with adult children and some grandchildren we can spoil. I should be able to hold my head high knowing I behaved and lived as a man should. I should look and feel like an adult and respected in the village I live in.
But, I’m not. I’m a 2-time loser at marriage and being a true father. I have over $70,000 in debt and nothing to show for it. I’m fat, bald, and depressed. I have no one’s respect no matter what I do. Not my work, my family, my friends, and to a point my kids. I have absolutely no retirement and will work until I die, which seems like I will be alone now. Another man is having and making the memories I had always wanted to have with my kids and ex. My brothers and sister don’t talk to me and are all pissed at me for losing our parent’s home. My friends don’t talk to me anymore, going so far as to not even reply to the simplest of “how are you?” texts.
I am trying to be better and it’s hard when despite all your efforts, nothing happens to make it seem like you have made any improvements. I am eating berries and twigs, but it doesn’t seem like I am losing weight. I am skrimping and saving, but it doesn’t feel like I’m getting anywhere. I am reading self-help books only to feel like I have wasted time.  I am working to come out of my shell only to get dirty looks or absolutely ignored.  I just want a win.

I’ve been off Facebook for so long that I forgot the awesome hypocrisy of some people. Oh sure, people mature as they get older, but “I remember when”.
One of the “posts” I love is “my kid is being bullied, why isn’t the school doing anything? These kids’ parents are terrible at raising a good kid”. This is coming from a woman who in school was the biggest bully and, I’m sorry, bitch. She was merciless in her actions and would constantly be in fights and such. Between us, her kids are kind of the same, but the one time a kid stood up for themself or gave back the same stuff they had been constantly taking, look out. She now is the biggest morally blessed person in the world. Just makes me laugh.
Another thing that humors me is how people who treated me pretty shitty when I went to school are sending me friend requests and messages about how cool and funny I was back then. They even have stories I remember very differently. I mean, I’ll take their “memories” and go with them, honestly I am pretty sick of my memories of the past. I’m just trying to forget about most things that have happened before today at this moment anyway.
Of course, there is the opposite of that too. The heathens I remember partying with that every other word out of their mouths was a swear are now “born again” and not ashamed to push it on anyone who may say or post something “off-color”. Yes, my humor is better suited for life pre-1990 and I am really working on it, but honestly, a lot of people go way out of their way to find and take offense in every verb, noun, and adjective in any phrase you say nowadays.
 
So, yeah, I’m back in the upside-down world of FaceBook again…

So with going back on to Facebook comes the sadness. I see the happy family pictures of people I know. The get-togethers I wasn’t invited to. Yes, I even trolled Patty before I blocked her. There is absolutely nothing that says I was part of her life for all the years. If you didn’t know I was the father to the boys, you would think they were his.
I mean, everyone is happy in them and I am mostly to a point where I understand it all, but as I said, the friends and their tight-knit families and their posts. People I know went through piles of shit and made it work, unlike me that was never given a chance.
The last time I was on FB I cursed the world and almost everyone in it. I saw how this one would do that for another, but couldn’t be bothered to even say hi to me. The “no, I don’t do things anymore and just stay home” people who somehow magically showed up in a picture the same day. The number of people, that were my friends, commenting on Patty’s pictures and posts about her and him.  I had (and have) learned that there is no such thing as loyalty in the world, at least not for me.
 
So, how did I do it? Why did I do it? Well for one I wanted to get to know you guys better, not that your entries don’t say enough, but you know what I mean. Also, as I wrote a few days back, I have given up on hopes and dreams other than hoping I get out of debt and dreaming about a full head of hair, now I just make plans. Then only for a month or two out. I have also come to the understanding that a lot of people suck and I can no longer be the “nice guy, white knight” to anyone other than my sons and myself.

This entry will probably be all over the place, it’s more me attempting to reconnect with myself or actually connecting to who I should be for myself and not what I think I have to be. I should probably keep this private, but who knows, someone out there will read it and help me or something. It would be preferable to talk to a therapist or psychiatrist, but that is really becoming a rich man’s thing. So this will not be a straight flowing thing, more of me stepping out of myself and looking at my life thing.
Let’s start at the start, my parents. Both of them were born in the 1930s. My father’s parents were born before the turn of the 20th century and my mothers were born a decade into it.  As far as I can find out, Dad’s family were farmers around the area I grew up. In fact, his paternal side was in the area since the 1700s. I never really got to know my Grandfather, I can remember just a couple of times, and mostly the quiet sad man who sat away from people at my Grandmother’s funeral. He didn’t last too long after that. I guess you could say he died of a broken heart because I’m told he was extremely healthy for a man pushing his late 80s. My dad was born and raised by parents well into their 40s. He had 3 adult sisters, the youngest I believe was in her early 20s. I think my grandfather work a farm for a bunch of years, but by the time dad came around he wasn’t. Anyway, I can honestly say that he raised my father as a man should do to make his son a man. My dad was one of the greatest men I have known, but unfortunately, life being what it was in the 60s and 70s when I came along, he couldn’t be there as much as he should and probably would have.  Dad worked a full-time job and an afternoon side landscaping job for several people who were doctors, lawyers, and business people, so needless to say, that “part-time” job was making more money for him than his full-time one, but without benefits and state retirement. He wasn’t an absent father but just wasn’t home as I grew up my first 8-9 years. Well, he was but I just really saw him for about an hour before I went to bed during the week. I don’t think I got the attention that my other 2 brothers and sister received as they grew up in their early years from him. Oh, I hear stories about the financial problems and how they say how “rough” their childhoods were, but they all got a lion’s share of growing up with his influence that I didn’t. I am constantly reminded by my sister because neither brother makes any effort to be in my life, that I was spoiled and got “everything” I wanted. Well truth be told, I kind of did, but not because I sat on the floor having a fit rather it’s because in 1971 when I was born my dad had a great paying job on the NY Thruway and an even better paying part-time one. Trust me I remember just as many gifts they got under the Christmas tree as I did. Heck, some of them were way pricier than mine. My sister could literally piss in dad’s cheerios and would not get even a raised voice and my brothers all were given his mementos from his time in the Army and Navy and the “passed down for generations” stuff.  When I was about 10yrs old my mom decided she wanted to go back to work and she got a cleaning job at school, a whole other bunch of craziness for me. So every day after school and Saturdays I was right there by his side raking, picking up sticks and leaves, and eventually mowing, but the damage was kind of already done. I suffered through it, damn it sucked even though to this day if I attempt any sort of landscaping job I follow the disciplined lessons that he installed in me. No, they weren’t lovingly discussed either, I can still hear him yelling to this day if I am raking or mowing.
That was it though. I know he loved me and would walk through fire for me and my family, but dad never taught me to shave, play a sport, or deal with life’s issues like love, relationships, and heartbreak. My parents had their time for themselves, they just didn’t live for their children as so many do in their marriages. I learned stuff either by trial and error, playing with friends, or dirty magazines. Television showed me fashion sense and how to be cool, just not in the real world as I found out constantly. All I know and remember is until I was essentially 17 I did everything to either please them or not enrage them. I learned how to not rock the boat from my brother’s stupid mistakes but what I didn’t realize until, well, now is that I was being who they wanted or expected me to be and not who I was. My grades were never good enough. I wasn’t failing but I wasn’t an A student either. Report card time was usually followed by the “you can do better” talk. As I told you, mom was right in the school mix. Any cough or fart I did at school she would have a full report on from my teachers and I would hear about it. Thinking back, I played baseball and football to have that look back towards the bleachers moment all the other guys had, only to not see them cheering me on. I realize now that they were both working and such. By the middle of the season, I just miserably push on because I didn’t want to disappoint them, my friends, and the coach and never because I really wanted to play. I would listen to the girls complain about guys being assholes and I immediately took on the “good guy white knight” thought even though it wasn’t who I was. Not that I was an asshole, I just betrayed who I am/was. It only got worse when I got the chance to touch boobies. I went against every core belief in myself for the next fix. For the next 36 years, I have lost who I should be, who I am, for the next “booby” fix.
So here I am, 51 years old, a father 5 times over that only flitters around the outside of my children’s lives, but is wrecked by pain that I am not with them 24/7. I have gone through 3 years of self-inflicted punishment because I didn’t keep Patty loving me only to realize she did want me to be who she wanted me to be but who I really am. All the people, which is mostly all of them, in my life, I acted how I thought they wanted me to be instead of just who I am. I sat here for these few years dying inside because of the loneliness from the people I called friends, who only knew me as someone I made up for them. When I say I have never felt romantic love from anyone, it is totally true. All my relationships loved me for who I tried to be for them and never for who I am. More than likely, it will never happen now, but there I go again, defining myself by what I think others will.
 
Have I come so far in life that it’s just too late for me to be… me? I don’t even know who I am anymore or for that matter who I was then.

It’s almost midnight and I’m still up. I have to work in the morning,  but my brain is still in thinking mode.
I read through what a wrote earlier, something I never do, but I figure I would clear some things up a little.
I love my parents, they did the best they could in a world that is doing everything it can to kill a traditional family and what it should be. My issue isn’t about them raising me, it’s about what the world did to them and all people. I can’t and won’t speak for every man in the world, I can just speak for me.
As I said, my problem started before I even can remember. The world forced my dad to not be there as much as he could when I could have really used his influence.  I know that sounds horrible and I’m the last one to talk just based on the fact I’m not there for my boys. I was mostly raised by a loving, over protective mother who did spoil me, her last baby. She began molding me into what she thought a man should be. My female teachers reinforced this thought of what a man should be also. I never had a male teacher until well into high-school. All around me were constant reminders of what a bad guy did and what a good guy should. What I saw was my sister crying about the shit guy she was dating treating her bad and how I should never be like him. What I should have seen was the fact that she chose this asshole because he was an asshole, the “bad boy” like so many women do. The excitement of taking a rough edged guy and changing him into what you think is a good one, only to leave him for being so unexciting. You broke him and then blame him for it. Boy, that sounds familiar 🤔 I think I know someone like that.
What I’m saying is my “formative” years were filled with people who forced their ideas on me about what I should be instead of letting me be who I wanted to be. That has defined my life up until now. I’ve allowed every single friend and family member to tell me how to be me and I have done everything to please them.
Everyone’s true colors came out over these last few years and left me a shell of the man I am. Not any single one of them would even think to see their blame in what had happened to me. I can not even express to anyone what and where my mind went to during the first year after losing Patty and all the people I had lived for all the years. I realize that it sound like a made up problem to get attention,  but it happened like I have said. I lost everything and everybody in less than a day and to this day, I have no clue why. I just know or think I know my part in it all and that is my fault for giving up who I was meant to be all those years ago.

The last couple of entries have come off as me blaming the world for all my issues and bad luck, but that’s not what I have been saying at all. When I was a child I didn’t have the wherewithal to understand what all my influences were doing to me. I believed that I was the correct version of myself.  I shook off the breakups and never happens as the other person’s fault. They had the issues and problems, not me. They were being cruel so they could look at themselves in the mirror and tell themselves they were better than me.
I wanted the closeness of “brotherly love” from my 2 brothers, but they were always stand-offish and distant. They were somewhat cruel and never stood up for me when their friends would pick on me, make fun of me, and be physical with me. I made two friends, Tony and Sean, to fill the hole my brothers left in me and I have come to realize I just replaced my treatment of my brothers with two “friends” that were exactly the same. I had other friends and now that I think about it, better friends, but I could never see my nose in front of my face. Because of my own doing, I am to blame for my social emptiness.
The truth is, it’s been all my fault from day one. By trying to please everyone, I was digging my own hole. By forcing myself onto the people in my life, I have never known the “feel” of someone coming into it on their own. People have, but I was too stupid and blind to see and it has made me a lost and broken man. This is what I am trying to understand and come to grips with by writing these “Doing the Work” entries.

I have been reading “No more Mr. Nice guy” and I’ve come to the understanding that I have “Nice guy Syndrome”. I have had this practically all my life and boy was I abused. Some examples. When I was a kid and Tony and myself were friends I would beg my parents to take him along on our vacations. To Canada and Cedar Point everywhere we would go.  Did I ever go with him and his family? Nope. I was the little gentleman in middle and high school. I really liked a girl named Lisa and I would help her with homework and buy her cute little gifts. She started dating another guy, a real scumbag. I would always put forth the effort with my friends and they would forget me constantly as they would do things. I have been cheated on in all my relationships and have always apologized to them for it. Yes, you read that right. Even with Patty.
At work, I have quietly sat as others walked all over me, even today as I came to work there were several notes about customers either one of the 2 other people here could have taken care of. One is currently going for a high score on some matching game on her cell and the other is watching old seasons of some show or the other.
The book isn’t teaching me to become an asshole, but I wish it was. The last few times I have attempted to stand up for myself have all come crashing down on me hard. Seriously, one time a coworker put in a harassment complaint because I choose not to do her work along with mine. I was a quality lab tech at a place and I had tons of things I had to get done every day. Needless to say, I got a slap on the wrist and wound up having to do half of her stuff anyway. Kind of why I sell trailers now.
 
I have been looking into the MGTOW movement lately. Men Going Their Own Way. So I’m not as militant about things as they seem to be, but I do agree with a lot of what they say. Having come out on the losing side of 2 divorces does that to a fella. I’ve begun thinking and practicing some of the things they preach. No longer am I going to allow another woman to run over me. I’m not going to be used for a free dinner or drinks. I’m going to live for myself and the boys from now on. If Patty gets herself in a jam, tough, and that goes for anyone. The last thing I ever wanted to become was a dick, but people can piss on you (no pun intended) so much before you kick them in the nuts.
 
I’m sorry for the next woman that may enter my life because the scars of the past 35 years run deep and won’t heal unless it’s Muminah. The offer to run away is still on the table. 😜

Yesterday evening, I felt a loss of control of my feelings coming on. I soldiered through, but it just reminded me that I have no real social life for distraction. Buffalo/WNY area has absolutely nothing on MeetUp. Most everything is online or across the border in Canada. I’ve never been a “bar” person, especially the club type with standing room only. I didn’t mind going to the bar in the village I used to live in, but they are too far away and I would definitely bump into someone who will rile me up. As I have said before, the neighbors in my complex are essentially horrible. I know that’s bad to say, but I’ve been here almost 3 years and have tried to meet and greet these people and they’re just the dregs of humanity. God, I wish I could afford a house or even a trailer with a plot of land to keep me busy. I’m definitely not throwing money into a place that is not my own.
 
I went back on Facebook to “reconnect”. I love the fact that I have become FB friends with some of you (of course, I’m still unsure who you may be because I only know you for your OD name) Not that I am naive, but I just thought a few of the “old” crowd would be excited to see me back and would at least want to get together since it’s summer. I did take the chance to ask one of them out to a “friendly” dinner to catch up, but somehow that led to the “I just started seeing someone” response, which in no way had anything with what I said, but God knows what has been said and passed around town about me from Patty, her “husband”, and the yenta friends of hers. Not to be too “trollish” but I’ve noticed a bunch of “my friends” are now her’s and making all kinds of comments on her “new life” posts. I have blocked her, I just had that “I wonder” moment and I realized that I shouldn’t have even looked. But really, traitors…
 
Tomorrow would have been my anniversary and Friday is my youngest’s birthday, so this week is hard anyway. Of course, I have not been invited to the “family” party my sister is having. I guess my presence at that would be uncomfortable for Patty and Ed. I will have him on Saturday and Sunday though, so we will have our own thing, but…
 
I’m starting to rethink the MGTOW thing. Well at least the FB group I got in. You see, I don’t hate women and I don’t expect them to be as they were supposedly pre-1900s, but I do agree on how it’s become tough to be a man these days, and dare I say it, a white man. Having been a victim of a made-up harassment case and on the losing end of divorce and support judgments that were based on lies, I feel the MGTOW agenda.  I just can’t be as militant as some of these guys. Like almost every conversation today where someone will always be the dick in a conversation just to be that, this group is totally like that. You would think that a group based on “traditional” men’s rights would be a little less “woke” but not this one and isn’t the thought of being a traditional manly man totally the opposite of most woke thoughts? IDK, I guess I’m just a dinosaur. I don’t go out of my way to oppress or make fun of marginal people and races, but I do believe in the old saying, “Sticks and stone will break my bones, but names will never hurt me”
 
Anyway, what have I done today towards my goal? I got through some of the saddest poor-me songs on my Spotify without tearing up or thinking about how “that’s exactly how I feel”. That’s actually a big thing for me as silly as it seems. I have a rant building in my head that I will not write about or comment on FB about, there’s that. I feel a bit lighter even though I don’t look it.

Today would have been my anniversary. Now, I would be stupid to think someone would wish me that, but for the last 4 years, I haven’t had anyone check in on me either. Yeah, it still stings
It’s funny how people have reacted to my “tragic” moments over the years. Never once did I get any sort of acknowledgment or actual compassion for my losses. It’s wrong for me to think this way, it makes me narcissistic and selfish and that’s not who I want to be anymore, but…
I lost both parent’s and besides my immediate family, no one reached out. I lost my child, my daughter, and no one reached out. I lost my wife, my home, my possessions, my dreams and hopes, and no one has reached out. So, when I see things on Facebook like “come celebrate ****’s life annual party” or ” let’s all get together to cheer up ****”  It really hurts my heart and soul. Oh, before you say something about either of these, one was a drug addict that had numerous interventions and still overdosed and the other was a cheating, lying SOB, and still is.
This type of crap is what hangs in the corners of my mind like cobwebs. The kind you don’t notice when you’ve cleaned a room from top to bottom. Yet there are all your so-called “friends” whooping it up and raising toasts to these two individuals and have not once called to even check in with me.
I want to be social, I can’t stand being alone, but there are absolutely no people or groups around me to get involved in. I can’t afford to drive into the city to volunteer to “feel like I have friends” and I’m sorry church and religion have failed me so many times I just can’t do that. So I guess I have to go to the local bar. I have tried the gym, but at the one, I go to it seems no one wants to be bothered, at least by me anyway. I mentioned religion and I have to “believe” that this is all a test of faith and God’s plan, and believe it or not, I do, but this has gone on for close to 4 years with no let-up and I really do not believe I did anything to deserve it. I’m not talking about you guys here, I appreciate every one of you. I’m talking about the ones here, the ones that have been here, some for over 40+ years, not even attempting to try and cheer me up. If I wasn’t the “dancing monkey” I wouldn’t even get any notice.
I have learned to deal with it all though. Sure I whine here and there, but “it is what it is”. I only wish I wasn’t left destitute from the divorce. My credit is ruined and I have to live in an asshole of the world apartment complex and have to hope and pray each day that nothing breaks because I can’t afford to fix it. I used to have a home of my own, savings, friends, and family that faked caring. A deck to enjoy the outside and not be afraid or disgusted at what is around me. Walls that were walls, not the thinnest of drywall where you can hear the neighbor fart and snore. But, this is where I am in life now. Like clockwork, I save $500, and something breaks or I break and it costs $600. I can’t get out of my own way.

I don’t feel right. It’s nothing to do with Patty either. I just do not feel right.
I’ve always felt like I don’t fit in, I have since childhood. I’m never comfortable in situations. Not at home, at work, or out in the public. My body doesn’t work as it should and I honestly check the box on everything a man dreads. I’m bald, fat, and out of shape. I am below average in areas and things don’t work anymore. It’s heart-wrenching as a man to find out the “pills” and supplements do not help whatsoever. It didn’t help that I was experiencing all this when she left me and how it went down.
What little energy and determination I had all went away with the nervous breakdown I went through in the 1st year of the separation/divorce. The loss of support has all but killed it.
I have made great strides with things, the reason I am still on this side of the ground, but at my core, I am less than a man.

All gone. Back to square one. Back to the lonely loser with absolutely nothing to show for it. I’m just going to sell everything other than essentials and just exist. Give the boys all the money I don’t need for bills and gas. Then maybe I will be worth something to people around here.

it’s been a rough weekend. The good parts were having my youngest and oldest here. Caden loved his birthday gifts and I enjoyed that he did, then I went into the bathroom and I cried quietly to myself.
My self-esteem has gone to shit over the last few days, of course by my own hand. I just don’t think I can ever feel normal. I can’t keep a budget or a savings. I can’t even fantasize me ever having anything more that what I don’t have now.

The best way I can describe my mind anymore is just one huge over-tied knot. You know the one. It’s so tight that it’s almost easier to just cut it out, but unfortunately, I can’t get TMS therapy or electric shock, so the option of “cutting” it off isn’t an option at all.
I am really trying to put myself and my life on some sort of schedule. I admit that I have become super lazy and do nothing since the divorce. My depression and loneliness have made me not really care about anything. Mix signals on health and happiness have left me anxious and confused. The overall lookout of my life in general almost makes me feel like I am just taking up other’s resources like air, water, and food.
I have always found it hard to believe in myself, no shit huh? For example, I am paying my child support and checking my budget daily, almost hourly. Let’s just say I am doing everything to keep on top of things, but all it took was Patty bitching about the one week I missed, due to my ever-growing medical bills, and I have totally “gone off the reservation” in my head and I have stressed and been anxious all weekend about how everything is spiraling out of control.
* That all comes back to me living on my own. It’s been a horrible 4 years doing this on my own without even a whisp of help(support) from those I used to hold dear.*
I absolutely hate this, but it’s like finding yourself in a situation like jumping into deep water, knowing you can’t swim great and panicking. Sure, when you sit on the shore comfortably, you can rationally tell yourself that you need to remain calm and not flail about in that circumstance, but we all know that’s the farthest thing from your brain when you’re in the “shit”.
 
Sharp turn
 
I’ve been going down the MGTOW and feminist rabbit holes lately. These YouTubes and tic-toks are all over the place. I have noticed a common theme in them. Have you ever noticed how it seems that white women are even more aggravated about racist things than the actual race? How they cry and scream in the most “notice me” way totally making it all about them? Well, I see a common trend in the MGTOW (Men Going Their Own Way) and feminist stuff too. I’ll explain…

If you take the time to watch these videos you’ll notice that these are all done by “pretty people”. The man preaching MGTOW is so good-looking and put together that people fall over themselves to be around him. He probably has never been alone unless he has chosen to be. The same thing is true for the gorgeous feminist who talks of not needing a man although they get their pick of hundreds of guys who will hand over their life savings to just have her on his arm. Yet, these people will tell you that “doing you” and going your own way is the best thing ever. They have absolutely no clue what it’s like for the rest of us schlubs. How we need companionship or at least some people in our lives.

Or maybe it’s just me? I can no longer live with myself alone anymore. Don’t get me wrong, I do “like myself”, but I am sick of constantly having life seem to take a crap on me and not having anything to show for it. I have put forth the effort, although it seems as though I haven’t, to get my life in order, only to constantly be used, lied to, or ruined by others. I don’t want to be an agoraphobic hermit, but life just wants to make me so. Why? What have I done or put out into the world to be treated as such? Besides getting down on myself, I am probably the nicest, most helpful, and most genuine person you could meet. Do I have to become the type of person I hate to get on in life?

Patty became my identity and then she and my boys did. I don’t know who I am now. I haven’t for 4 years. I just can’t wrap my head around a new me. Oh, I have tried several hundred times and they all just crash around me days into it. Everything and everyone around me is changing, even my boys have taken on some of his traits and views. Do I matter to anyone other than obligation?
 
I joke, but I seriously think I am becoming agoraphobic. I don’t want to do things out in life anymore. I don’t want to go grocery shopping or even to Walmart.  The job I actually like is also slowly becoming another anxiety-inducing chore. I have my theories, but the world seems to tell me that I need to love myself and be able to be alone. To a point, I am, almost too much.
 
Seriously, what’s wrong with me? I just never feel healthy or content anymore. Along with watching my boys grow, that’s what I miss the most, happiness and being content. Yes, some women/people are just assholes, but it just bothers me to no end that Patty did this to me when there were so many other ways too. She didn’t need to “Scorch Earth” me and then salt the ground as she did, she had absolutely no reason to. She keeps doing it still. Yes, I know she can always do it as long as I allow it and all that jazz, but I have been a thirsty man on a raft in the ocean for the last few years trying to stay hopeful because everyone tells me it will get better. Of course, a large amount of those people say it and then disappear from my life.
My oldest is staying for a couple of days with me and then will be off to college and a new life on the 22nd and all I can stress is how poor I am and how I can’t take him on a trip like the ex did or my sister does. How he had to buy his own snacks, because I just don’t have the extra cash and how I am at work all day and he’s stuck sitting all alone or to come home and sit some more.  I am a shit father, maybe they are all right about me.
I just feel like a huge failure for being 51, poorer than ever with no help in sight, and feeling like a washed-up no good man just as people seem to have made me out to be. I try to raise myself above it all, but the quilt that people and especially myself, lump onto me just pushes me back down to the bottom. I just want a win, just 1 win after the 4 years I have struggled through. I don’t even know what I would call a win, I only know I want one.

For some reason, I dreamt of both of my ex-wives. We all sat around discussing, as far as I can remember, me. If I go all psychiatrist on myself, they were telling me all the faults I find in myself already. Truth is, neither of them has probably even dedicated a fart to the memory of me or our time together. Once I was “out” everything was forgotten. Patty acts as though she happened to find out I was the sperm donor at the bank and is incredibly embarrassed now, yet she totally remembers I am the boy’s father when it comes time to sit in the coven of cheating ex-wives at her work and spin tales on who has the biggest dickhead of an ex-husband.
“Sticks and stones…” I know I shouldn’t give a F%$& but it hurts to be made into a monster and especially to be believed by several people who have known me since I was a teenager and know that I have been nothing but a decent man.
I just can’t figure out how to shut it all out.

I’m lonely, really lonely. I would like to date. I think I’m ruined though.
I made a Hinge profile and boy I am totally out of my league. I am nothing any of them would even consider. What can I offer? I’m totally broke, in debt, and well, me…
Patty ruined me both financially and mentally. I can’t even fantasize having a girlfriend. I miss the days where a friend would fix you up or when I was actually not am ugly troll.

287,https://www.opendiary.com/m/newt316/how-do-you-write-a-feeling-6138588/,2022-08-11,How do you write a feeling?,"
I’m feeling really defeated today. Nothing has happened, no arguments or accidents. I just woke up with this overwhelming sense of dread and defeat. It’s like I am stuck in that stage of feeling just before you cry, without actually surrendering to the tears.
My paycheck is already gone and it hasn’t even been deposited. I realize the bills are paid and I have a roof over my head and that should be good enough. That’s all it has been though, good enough.
Once again my dreams were filled with Patty again. For some reason, she was in a store grocery shopping. She never liked to grocery shop when we were together, but from what I have learned these last few years is that she goes out of her way to do all that and be a doting housewife. At no time during our 20 years was she like that with me. I didn’t care and didn’t expect it, but it just adds fuel to the fire about whether she ever did truly love me and how once again I was just the stepping stone for another important woman in my life to find their important man.
I’m a bit more comfortable being alone, but it’s a horribly unconstructive comfortable. I just don’t have it or can find it in me to “go out into the world” anymore. I have always been a bit socially anti-social, but it has gotten worse. As much as I would love to have and miss a relationship, I just don’t think I would be someone anyone would want. Besides being dirt poor, I just don’t care for huge gatherings like concerts, fairs, and crowded bars. I got so used to the “Ma and Pa” life with Patty. Just sitting on the deck after work or a casual drive with the occasional dinner date. Apparently, she never cared for that seeing she is the total opposite now and making it seem that I always held her back. IDK, maybe I did? Maybe I was the “killjoy” to everyone? Maybe that’s the reason no one invites me or even comes around?
No, before you say it, I didn’t sit around with people all full of dread and doom. I had a nervous breakdown and not one of my friends or family acknowledged it, in fact, they went so far as saying I was faking it all. Even today knowing I was in the ER several times the first few months for panic attacks and stuff.
I’m going to leave what I just typed even though I thought about deleting it all. It’s always the same rant, just written in a different way with me. The fact is, I am more than likely the only cause of my miserable life and I am too lazy to fix and learn from it. I get horribly jealous and mad when I see how others have come to another’s defense or aid when these things have happened to them. I mean I was one of those people for my 2 best friends and my sister and brothers. I just really always thought they would do it for me, but as I have been told hundreds of times in the last several years, that’s not how the world always works. 
I have other thoughts but right now I can’t seem to find the words to put them down.

So in the constant battle to “normalize” myself into this life that I was thrown into, I have been dwelling on what it is that is constantly nagging me. All the books. therapy, and talks I hear how I need to just find me and my place. I try and try.
I guess that unless you’ve actually been through it all like I have it’s never going to be fully understood, this whole divorce/new life/start over.
Patty of course had her “exit” planned. She knew she wouldn’t be put out and she would have little change in her “world” and that she had a new man that was more than willing to give her anything to “ease” what pains she may have had. I don’t think she ever sat and thought, “what have I done?” I don’t think many people in her position ever do and with her “friends”, him, and to a point, my sister, filling her head with thoughts of it being the best thing to do for her and the kids, why would she. My gestures of not fighting or contesting the divorce only came off as me not caring and giving up to her and them, but like I said none of them ever were in the position I was. And, yes, I can say that because I know them all.
 
So back to the point. I need to change my thinking to live this new me day to day and embrace it all, but the thing is my past is like a black fly that no matter how much you swat it away keeps being right there in your face. I have to call about visitation, I have to pick them up and take them home, home to the house I grew up from the day I was born. I have to write checks and address the envelopes with her “new married name”. Anytime my sister disagrees with Patty about a decision, I get all the shit. I have to live week to week because I am paying bills that still show up for Colby and Patricia Newton.
You see, I have come a long way with all the feels, it’s just the fact that I am the only one in this whole thing that is tethered to the past.
 
That’s what bothering me today, again…

289,https://www.opendiary.com/m/newt316/forcing-myself-3-6138708/,2022-08-12,Forcing myself,"
Like the title says, I am forcing myself to write. I would love to be the first to say that “journaling” helps me, but it doesn’t seem to as much as one would think. I really don’t know what would ultimately make me feel new and refreshed anymore.
Money? It would totally help to get the monkey off my back. To have enough to catch up on the bills and finally be ahead of things, but since I have never been at that point since I became “an adult” I couldn’t say for sure.
Love one’s support? Having the people I used to hold dear actually acknowledge my hurt and when it mattered being there for me, would have made a huge difference.
A new relationship? The distraction and “feels” of a new person would definitely help. Both my ex-wives immediately jumped into a new one and never once allowed themselves the time to think about whether it was a mistake or not. Then they both started to believe the shit and lies told to them by their “new guys” and friends, which soured anything left of “the truth” of our relationships. Why don’t I get to have that as a healing process?
 
I realize I am in a dating pool of thousands of plain men like me who are mostly disposable to most women. Rich ugly men have money to attract someone. Good-looking poor men have their looks. Confidence and humor are traits that women say are attractive when they are attached and unattainable, but the moment they are, those fall by the wayside.
I really do not have anything to offer. I am 51 years old with 3 children under 16. I have no savings, no equity, and no retirement. I didn’t mature into “sexy older man looks” instead I went from a handsome young man to a beat old guy. I can not wine and dine with anyone or go on trips. I can’t impress another with my home and secure lifestyle. It’s horrible when a man is hit in the face with reality.
Sure life-long bachelors can say they are totally comfortable in their life and being alone. That’s because they planned that from day one. I, on the other hand,  became a father at 18. I was surrounded by people who told me I had responsibilities to my children and their mother and that anything I did for myself was selfish and wrong. Church and the bible told me all of that too. Even if my exes became totally selfish women and ran off to do “them”, I was to be that responsible man. ” They are your children, you have to pay support, but you have to respect my wishes.” said a woman I love who at no time considered the children when cheating and leaving. Maybe all men are not like me and can sleep comfortably every night not caring for their kids or the “responsibilities” they created, but I can’t. I have a friend who had two kids with his first wife, but when they divorced, never made an effort to be a father and only thought of himself. He got involved and married twice again to women with kids, who he became a great stepdad for, but as soon as things ended, never had anything to do with them. I can’t live with the fact that I can’t be there for all the cuts, scrapes, and bruises and I allow myself to be drowned in guilt because of it.
Shut up and accept the choices and mistakes you have made even though so many others haven’t and they all seem to be living better lives.
I used to believe that if you played by the rules and lived by the commandments that life would be good and fulfilling. It’s probably true for most, but it hasn’t been all that great for me.

Maybe they got it wrong. Maybe I don’t have BPD and instead, I really am manic-depressive. I don’t know what I am looking or hoping for to make me whole or if I have ever been whole. I’m tired of hearing from people who pretty much have their lives by the balls, that I am ok.
I haven’t felt special to anyone for a long long time. It even seems like my kids just “go along” with the fact that I am their Father. Yes, I need reminders. Yes, I need to feel appreciation. I’m sorry, I can’t be and I have never been my own cheerleader. I can’t be truly happy to be Colby. Why is it when I essentially go through a trauma like what I have, I have to just “suck it up”?
A man witnesses his life being destroyed, like watching a loved one being horribly murdered in front of his own eyes, and then the same day he’s told by everyone to just accept it, life sucks. No one wants to actually lift a hand to help, but will give their two sense and inspirational bible quotes and walk away proud of themselves for “doing all they can”.
These years I have been asking, begging, and pleading for water and all I get is an empty cup from these people around here and then told I am a complaining attention whore because of it. From day one.
This comes off to people just like that, whiny bitch-boy look at me, but I have done the work these last couple years, alone and it still seems that the world wants me to not succeed. It has taken away all I held dear and is refusing to allow me anything in its place.
But, it has always been my fault. I am to blame for the point I am at. I didn’t work hard enough, save hard enough, or love hard enough.

I’ve spent the better part of the last week being bombarded by dreams of what I had and what I can never have again. My 2nd oldest boy has been staying with me for 4 days and it just doesn’t bring the “feels” that it should for me. As far as I know, everyone who has given me advice or encouragement has never been where I am. The divorced people didn’t lose everything or were stuck with nothing. The women still live in the home they have for years and almost always have their kids with them and the only thing that changed is the man is missing. The men have a new home, relationship, or something. Absolutely no one has even been close to where I am. Oh, I won’t deny that they had hurt feelings and felt loss, but none of them seem to have had life just keep dumping on them day after day.
Yeah, I guess I’m a drama queen. I blow things out of proportion. I cry out for attention.
I just want to find that hole to climb in.
I realize that you don’t do the work to expect the outcome, you do the work because you have to, but when you don’t ever get anything after doing and trying over and over, it’s hard to get up and still try.

292,https://www.opendiary.com/m/newt316/that-old-house-down-the-street-6140581/,2022-08-16,That old house down the street.,"
It’s been almost 4 years now and I am still waiting for this plan. You know the one. Some call it God’s Plan. others call it Life’s Plan and still some will say karma or fate.
Patty has moved on, remarried and new life with new friends and such. The kids have moved on, this is all now so normal. My siblings and friends have moved on, to the point where I have absolutely no place in their lives.
So, where is my “new” and “better”?
I have gone through some of the darkest stuff a person can go and put themselves through. I have had people straight out lie to me to not have to spend time with me. I have even been used by someone who never even considered what it would do to me. Besides my kids, I have zero people to sit and talk to, that is unless I do it online which is helpful, but not what I need to really heal. I have been lied to and fooled by a priest. Forgotten by a therapist. Called a dog killer by several neighbors. I am constantly ignored by people I try to pleasantly greet and get to know. What few acquaintances I have known from years past are all supportive from hundreds of miles away, but as soon as they are a stone’s throw away from me, won’t even return a phone call.
I have made healthy choices and worked to better myself and still nothing. I just don’t understand how the “world” can shit all over a person who never lived a horribly selfish life. The women who left me cheated on me and others lied and used almost everyone they came in contact with, they all have better lives than I do. The men I’ve known who were just assholes and users, now sit with their children and wives in perfect Facebook pictures either on their boats or on vacations. I can even find a quarter in my couch cushions!!!
Every single time I have allowed myself to breathe and drop my guard, I have been hit from yet another angle. I spend days chatting to a person, making a connection, watching what I say, and saying the “right” things only to once again be left alone and ignored.
I’m not one of the people who can go out into the world and live thousands of miles from mankind and be perfectly content. Neither am I the type to have the means to enjoy life without people, able to take trips or buy fun things.
I have a friend, Jim, and for most of his life, he’s been on his own. Now several years back he was married for a couple of years, but it didn’t work out and it was clearly apparent to him and his ex, so there was no “shock” to it. Unlike me, he wasn’t a Father at 18 and he was able to chase a dream or two. Unlike me, he had connections that helped him get a job on the railroads and made awesome money. He bought a home, that he didn’t lose, and things, that he also didn’t lose. He’s alone but has friends, yet he longs for a relationship. At the end of the day though, he can go sit out on his deck, looking out at his property and stuff, and feel accomplished. I can leave my apartment and sit on a plastic chair on the 4’x4′ piece of uneven concrete and try to remember what it was like to have anything and realize that no matter what I do, I will never have what I want whether it’s a relationship or stuff. I will never be in a position to buy a home. I will never be able to buy a new car or even major appliances. I will never have enough money to make people think that I am doing what I should for the kids.
Have you ever lost a dream? A hope? A want? I have, up to this point, lost 95% of my hopes, dreams, and desires. There are a few left, depending on what my sons do, but I won’t push them to do it, so those are all up to chance. Even a majority of the “good” memories are gone. I have them, but I can’t share them with anyone, and even the ones I can have been tainted by those I would share them with. Patty will never sit with me and reminisce about how we watched the fireworks when the year changed to 2000 or the midnight trip to Niagara Falls. For that matter, even the last Christmas we shared as a family has been forgotten or changed in her mind.
 
 I’m just an old abandoned house full of ghosts now. No one wants to come close to me, but they all seem to have memories of what the house was like, whether right or wrong. They don’t want to put time, money, or effort into the slowly crumbling place, they just want to sit around and say, “someone really should have done something”.

One step forward, two back. Two weeks ago I was getting back on top of the world and now I feel like it just fell on me once again. I could really use a win right now. Jonathan leaves in less than a week for college and the weekend visits with my other boys are going to be totally different.
Not that it’s a bad thing, it is just the fact that their loser father can’t afford to give them anything. They have to come over and coexist in a 3 room apartment where there is absolutely nothing to do.
I’ve been reduced to a joke by my ex. A woman that knew all my dreams, hopes, and fears. For 20 years she knew that she was my rock. She knew this and she still destroyed me.
I have to, need to, make peace with the fact that I’m a loser. I lost at life from the get-go. I never came anywhere close to chasing my childhood dreams. I never established a future. Everything I had was wrapped up in a relationship I believed was solid and permanent. Almost everything I had and was, was lost in a couple of hours on a day in January 2019. The relationship I wanted with my boys was forever changed and now another man is in their lives 10x more than I am able. I have no savings or retirement. I have no credit or possessions worth anything. I can’t get “social” help and I can’t seem to make a connection with anyone off the internet. I say too much or not enough. I’m called “creepy” for doing nice things.
People tell me I have to love myself, be good to myself, and then the rest will solve itself. I have and nothing is changing, in fact, it’s getting somewhat worse.

I’m not depressed, but I don’t care anymore. I can’t care anymore because I don’t want to hurt anymore. I have lost years caring for people and things that in the end do not care about me at all. I am not motivated to be someone new, why should I? I did everything right. I cared and loved as I should. I made the effort to do my share and then some. When someone needed me, I was there. what is it about me that people can just walk away from without one thought?
I hate what my life has become and that it became this way with me doing everything to keep it from failing. How do you keep trying when all your best efforts keep leading to failure?

I don’t have any of my kids this weekend. It’s Jonathan’s last couple of days with “the family” before going away. So as a family he, his brothers, and Mom, and his step-father are spending quality time together. That’s both nice and incredibly fucked-up.
I received some unsolicited advice last night from a girl I know. To me, she is a classically pretty girl next door type. She checks all the tabs for me, petite, dark-haired, and dark brown eyes.  She went on to tell me how to get through adversity as she did. It was very nice. Also complete bull shit. This girl has never spent a moment alone if she didn’t choose to. She has a large group of supportive friends and family. Men would fall at her feet to just be near her. She tells me about how at one time she was so lonely and how she went out and made friends and it was just that easy. How I should count my blessings as she does and wake each day and see all the good. Pretty women just don’t get it, they don’t understand what it’s like to lose everything and never have any support or attention from the world. They never experience the dirty or repulsed look from someone when you just try to say hello or pay someone a compliment. She also would never be caught dead with me out having a friendly dinner or cup of coffee, so there’s that too.
She’s not the only one, I have had these “cheer up” messages from other “pretty people” who had a couple “ouchies” happen to them and just don’t understand how I just don’t have it roll off me as it does them. The common theme to all of these is not one of them could be bothered to actually sit down and be a friend, they just needed the “pat on the back” for their comment. You see, they di their good deed and should be acknowledged for that.
This is going to sound horrible and mean but screw it. I have a friend who lost her adult son to drugs. Oh, there were several attempts to help this boy, several interventions, but he still overdosed. It was a terrible thing to happen to her, losing a child. Several hundred people flocked to her side and even made a go fund me to help her. Each year they get together and have a party, of all things, to celebrate his life. Yes, people organize it for her. I am not saying that this is wrong or anything in any way, I am happy that people care so much for her to help comfort her through it all. My daughter died, not because of drugs or actions that would lead to death. There was a hastily organized memorial that was mostly for her mother’s side to in a roundabout way, to blame me for all that went wrong in Kayla’s life, while celebrating her. That was almost 10 years ago, the same time as her son passed. I haven’t been consoled since. Nine years have passed and not one person has checked in to see how I am doing.  Even in the first few years when I was still with the ex, she made no mention of it.
Yet these people want to give me advice about grief and suffering and how to get through it. Did they hurt? Yes. Were they sad? Yes Were their tragic things horrible? Yes. But not one of these people, these one’s around me (I don’t know your story here, but I know theirs) were ever alone and struggling even when calling out for help as I have. People swarmed them whether it was because of a loss of a loved one or a breakup.
So, as they give the pep talk and advice and then move on after saying, “well I tried” they then start to get upset and uncomfortable when I ask to have some company with them. Then I just become a perverted, creepy guy and not a lost soul looking for a friend.

“Like a sick bird’s ass” That was a saying I heard throughout my life. So once again I am writing about the same thing again, like a sick bird’s ass, constant shit over and over.
I don’t know who I am. I am Patty’s husband and my children’s father and that’s all I have known for over 20 years. Nothing else has seemed right. I really can’t handle life alone, but deep down inside, I know that I am no good for anyone or even myself right now. I do know this though, I can’t do this alone. No I don’t mean doctors, therapists, and specialists, I mean someone who cares enough for me to pick me up and push me along.
Let’s just put it all out there. I’m a mess and I always have been. There’s a hundred and one reasons I can agree with what Patty did to me, in fact, there are several that I can think of as to why she should have never given me the time in the first place all those years ago. By no means was I a shit man to her, I don’t think she will ever find anyone who cared and loves her as I, even this new husband, but I not a complete man. First off, I have obvious mental personality issues. Secondly, and I don’t believe I am writing this, I’m not really good at certain things. How to put it, I’m a grower not a shower, a breeder not a pleaser. I think that covers that. And now my body hates me because I have new issues with the plumbing. I guess like most marriages you hit the point where just companionship and holding another at night was more comforting then sex. Apparently it’s not for her and probably most other women of a certain age.
So here I am, lonely and in need of companionship and too broken physically and mentally to be anything to anyone. This is effecting me in so many ways. I want someone in my life, but I worry that I won’t be able to give them what they want. After the way Patty left me and the person she has become has made think I just am worthless to anyone. This was all about finances she said back then, but she has become very uncaring and unfeeling to me, almost to the point that it seems if I was to die tonight, she wouldn’t miss a beat tomorrow.  How does someone just stop the feelings. I mean 20 years with someone, beautiful experiences,  horrible pains of loss and there is nothing there from her. She has no reason other than maybe greed to hate me. This all sits in my head, if someone can spend years with me, good years, happy years, and then just hate me and despise me. It sits at the edge of my thoughts every day that I am just not good enough for anyone.
This is how it is in my thoughts. Patty, in what seemed like one day, fell totally out of love with me to a point where I felt like I disgusted her. My friends and family never once really made an effort to acknowledge my pain or even tried to “cheer me up”. My kids seemed to except it from day one like I was never part of their lives. Neighbors and acquaintances in my hometown just kept on like nothing was different, even the ones that new us best.
So, here I am. A pretty much impotent 51 year old man, who has lived a life where things are taken away or leave me without any reason or chance of reconciliation. All I ever wanted was to have that family and watch my kids grow day to day. Do you know how fast kids grow when all you can see them is every other weekend? This is not by choice, this is the world kicking my ass and  not allowing me to be in their lives more because of money and distance. I have nothing to really offer than being an honest loving partner. I have no money, no possessions,  no security to offer.
It doesn’t matter how much I love or not love myself. At this point and maybe until the day I die I don’t think I will ever be able to do anything I have ever wanted. Not travel or vacation. Have an actual fun hobby or even retire and sit and watch the clouds float by. I’ve accepted my fate, I just don’t like it, but deep down, I know it’s what my life will be from now on.

Jonathan leaves for college in the morning and I just got off the phone with him. He is very shut off with his feelings, a trait from his Mom. That kind of scares me, I don’t want him to allow stuff to build in him until he makes rash decisions like she did. Then again, her getting with me all those years ago was probably one.
I am once again feeling like a total failure. Did I do enough for him and his brothers? Does everyone hate me because I had my whole melt down? Why do they chose to not understand it? Do my sons just see me as a joke they can’t rely on, just a get away now and then?
I just want to talk to someone. He’ll I just want to be held so I could just not feel so vulnerable right now.
I should have never had kids. I should have never gotten into relationships. I should have just gone into the military at 18 and had them beat the Colby out of me. Colby has done nothing but leave my life in ruins.

I have tried and attempted hundreds of things over the last few years to try and make sense of who I am and what I am here for. I am a father, but I don’t feel like one. Living away and apart from my kids does not feel natural and it leaves me constantly feeling like a failure, but I can’t bring myself to be a super co-parent with Patty because of how I feel towards her and the absolute pain she brings me. Maybe if I wasn’t alone. Maybe if I wasn’t always stuck in my head. Maybe if I had actual friends and family that gave a shit to be there for me.
I don’t think of suicide, but I constantly feel like everyone would be better served by me not being around anymore. Yes, I know I am important to my boys, but as much as I try to spend as much time with them, they now are being raised with another man’s views and it is showing. I hate that.
I understand that people fall out of love and I wish that was how Patty approached the whole divorce from the start, but she went the “scorched Earth” way and destroyed me and our family in the process. She forced this man into the boy’s lives from the moment I left to “give her space” to think. I have begrudgingly come to the realization that she may have never romantically loved me and that even if we were the last 2 people on Earth, she wouldn’t ever want to be near me again. Most people wouldn’t. I just don’t understand why.
This leaves me to “guess” why. I have written this before, I am a 5’9″ bald, overweight pod of a man. No matter how I try to dress, I look like a slob. I may be “book smart” but the shit that comes out my hole makes me seem like I am challenged. My depression runs very deep and as much as I try, the lack of companionship and money always tips the scales towards the dark. I live with guilt. Guilt was instilled in me by people from an early age and it affects my decisions, my actions, and my thoughts. I’ve been hurt so much by my exes, my friends, and my family that my confidence is gone and I just can’t get it back. People know this and everyone uses it like a weapon against me. I am 51 yrs old and the world makes me feel like it’s over for me and all I have left is to accept that I will die alone. I don’t get opportunities to meet someone new and dating sites are all jokes, especially for men like me.
I know there are men out there who would love to be on their own and not be beholden to anyone. In fact, there are at least 3 in the apartment complex I live in, but that is not me. It doesn’t mean that I don’t love myself, as everyone keeps saying, mostly as an excuse to not really get to know me.
Everything, almost everything, I have loved and worked for is gone and mostly taken from me. There is a 20-year life I built being lived by a man who did nothing towards it. He saw an opportunity to take a woman’s insecurities and twist them into hate. Hate that did not consider 4 boys’ relationship with their father or the man himself. Hate that faded the 99% of good into 1% of bad. I can’t blame him though, I’m told, because if she actually cared… If anyone cared.
It will forever bother me that my friends and family sat by and did nothing, but still had a relationship with her. That a “man of God” who blew smoke up my ass about what is right and wrong, did nothing, and essentially encouraged their adultery. How people who have known me for years and knew how I loved her and my family, just sat by and acted as if it was meant to happen. The people who now don’t look me in the eye or return salutations. The people who make light of my painful posts.
 
So, who am I? I don’t know anymore. I never wanted this. I don’t understand how to live like this. I don’t want my kids to see me as the father who was never there, even as I try to with the world being against me every step of the way. I don’t want to be thought of as the absent father by my ex and my sister, even though it’s as plain as the nose on their face that I am one man trying to survive and they are both “coupled up” when it comes to money, security, and happiness. I have always lived for someone other than me and built a life for them, not for me, so to try and do it at my age, in my health, with my issues, and never having to ever do it before is not the “swinging bachelor” no responsibility carefree life I am constantly accused of. Yet I am the weak-willed, whiny, bitch boy-man who is supposed to shake off 50 years of living as nothing and start a new life, but be responsible for things from the past while no one else even considered them. I am supposed to accept that I am everyone’s door mat.
 
I don’t understand how a man can just say “fuck it” to everything and everyone and just go. Or the one’s who say, “if the kids want to know me, they will come to find me”. Or the concept of leaving a man, burning his world down, and bankrupting him financially and emotionally only to chide him for not being able to move the Earth and Heavens for his children. Will they actually grow up to “understand”?

Maybe I am being selfish and narcissistic or just naive and self-centered, but it seems like everyone hurts me. Some come right out with it, lording over the fact that it’s just that easy, while others do it in the kindest of ways. Either way, the end result is me on my knees and in the dark, hating myself.
The truth is, no matter how much I “love” myself and accept myself, my life sucks. I don’t want to be who I have to be and really, no one will like me that way either. People all remember a “Colby” I never was. They all ask about where that guy went. That guy never existed. A guy from high school messaged me and told me how he remember how funny and cool I was to hang with and how he missed those times. This guy used to relentlessly bully me and made jokes at my expense in high school. I can not even remember one time back then when we even shared a joke or had a conversation.
The couple I have always thought of as my “best friends” were dicks to me too. Say what you want about loneliness, it gives you a huge amount of time to reflect on things. My one “best friend” used me throughout life for his own gains. His first girlfriend was my girlfriend first. He would go on for hours calling me “pussy whipped” and chide me for being a bad friend because I wasn’t at his beck and call, only to pounce on her the day we broke up. Of course, since he was dating her, I couldn’t be a friend like before. He never once respected anything of mine. Now he takes my pain and makes fun of it on Facebook. The other one, well when he is at his lowest, I am his best friend. He has time for me and he comes to me when he needs something, that is until he gets back on his feet and could care less that I could be drowning.
My siblings are also “fair weathered” people to me. My brothers have only been there for me when they needed something. I haven’t heard from either of them this whole time I have been separated and divorced from Patty. My sister used me and my pain to get what she wanted as an Aunt, throwing me under the bus and siding with Patty for unlimited access to my sons. She occasionally, begrudgingly has to talk to or see me because they want to include me.
People see me as their “cause”. They put forth an effort by saying inspirational things to me, but if and when it is time to get their hands dirty, they turn on me and either yell at me for not being healed by their “words” or they leave without a word or explanation just like she did. They know my pain and the cause and they do the same exact thing to me.
I hate this world and I hate myself in it. How many times do I have to try and “reinvent” myself before I get my happy ending? I’ve built 3 lives over the course of 30+ years, for myself, and without so much as an opportunity of a 2nd chance, I have handed them over to someone else. There is a man out there married to my ex-wife, living in my house, my parent’s house, sleeping in the bed I bought, raising the kids I made, and getting the credit for it all. Again.
I am told to “wash my hands” of them all. Maybe they’re right. I’ve just lost so much though and it’s hard to need to lose so much more. I was brought up to have morals and to be faithful. If I did the right thing and lived for others, I would be rewarded in the end. When is this end going to happen? Why are all my rewards ripped away? There comes a point when you just can’t say that you are thankful for your health and the beauties of nature. I can’t keep standing in a burning building assuring myself that if I just have faith and be thankful for the glass of water I am holding that everything will be ok. I have looked for the exits to try and save myself, but now I am stuck and I am yelling and screaming for the help they all said they would be there for. They aren’t and they choose not to be. Besides my parents (I don’t count the kids) everyone has lied to me all my life and now they all blame me for listening.

You see it all over the place “if you know someone or are someone who feels …” say something. Do something.
That sentiment seems to be lost on me with the people around me. Yes, I know I should have a standing weekly appointment with a therapist or two, but it would be nice if the people I “care” for, cared for me. Even before Patty ruined me I have had issues and even then my “depression” and issues were laughed off and ignored.
Lately, I have fallen back on “crying” and calling out for help on Facebook and I’ve caught more shit than help. Apparently, I am a unicorn. The one and the only person who can not be depressed or sad. John Doe’s mom dies, and there’s an outpouring of love and support for weeks. Jane Doe’s son overdoses, again for the 5th time, but this time it’s fatal and there’s a go fund me and yearly remembrance parties. John Doe’s marriage ends and there is pretty much a petition to run the “bitch” out of town. Jane Doe’s dog has to be put down after biting yet another person and there are cards and letters of sympathy.
Colby’s daughter dies, oh poor Wendy, she lost her niece. Colby’s wife cheats and leaves him, destroying his life in the process. “You’re just making a mountain out of a molehill.” Colby should be happy that his wife, the woman he loves, has found happiness. Colby is just an attention whore, he’s not depressed or has any personality issues. Colby needs to shut the fuck up and be the dancing monkey we need to rag on to feel better about ourselves. Colby doesn’t know the pain and hurt, I lost my mom, I lost my dog, I lost my marriage which was so much better and all he did was lose his sister’s niece and made his suffering wife’s life miserable. SHUT THE FUCK UP AND MAKE US LAUGH AND FEEL BETTER THAT WE AREN’T YOU. YOUR PRETTY PROBLEMS ARE NOTHING COMPARED TO OURS. YOU LOST EVERYTHING WHEN PATTY LEFT YOU, WAA WAA, MY KID HAS A SLIVER, HE KNOWS REAL PAIN…
You know what? After this last week, I’m fucking done. I’ll just sum it up with the words of Roger Waters from The Wall:
I don’t need no arms around me
And I dont need no drugs to calm me.
I have seen the writing on the wall.

What do you do when you need help? Really, tell me. I need help, I ask for help, I’m told I need help. This goes round and round. So I guess what I am being told is I have to buy a friend to talk to. Meaning therapists.
But, what do you do when you sit down and budget your money for the next 2 months and after all is said and done, you may have about $200 to buy your 2 oldest birthday gifts.
I see my kids on the weekends. So I could get a part-time job and not see them. During the week, I work messed up sales hours for a salary and there are no part-time jobs that will work with these hours.
I’m not saying I’m poor. I’m saying that I just don’t have therapist $120 visit money. Besides, my “friends” have all said from day one if I need help just ask. Only, they can’t talk, they are busy, they have other plans, and on and on..
What has made me write this, besides my usual mental problems? My usual mental problems coupled with financial anxieties and loneliness.

No, I’m not a pirate, but I am so frustrated with my life and the world. If you haven’t guessed, I’m writing this after I dropped the kids back home.
I hate this. I hate being the one who has seemed to suffered for this divorce that I never wanted let alone do anything to cause it. Honestly people round here treat me like I did all the shit she did.
I’m tired of all the “advice” that essentially is people saying whatever they can to  ot have to dirty their hands and doing something. People hate when I say this, but I hate the hypocrisy of people who have no chance in Hell to ever be stuck alone and depressed unless they choose to. Oh, the advice I get from people in relationships and others who just have to bat an eye to have several people come to them or meet them.
So, I know I’m am depressed. I know the triggers and the things that help, but sometimes they just don’t and that’s when it sucks, because I don’t have the people to count on. My “people” choose to think of me as an attention where and they won’t add to it, but I’m not. New friends? Yeah, not happening.

I was sitting on my porch back in 2012 around this time. My daughter had languished in a coma for the past week and I was sitting by myself talking, begging for God to let her come back. The call came from Vikki, “Kay’s gone”. Looking back I should have realized that I would be alone for moments like these. Patty was sad, but not devastated and she hugged me and kissed my forehead then left to go back inside. There I sat, alone.
For the first 7 years, I had my family, Patty, and the kids, to help me through the memories and then I didn’t. I don’t get calls or messages from anyone asking how I am and I have never really dealt with it. Kayla’s passing, watching my Mother descend into madness, all the emotions that came with it, and Patty’s ultimate betrayal broke who I was.

Today has been grey all day, rain for the first few hours I was a awake. The war is going again in my head. I miss my life eventhough it hasn’t been my life for almost 4 years, but what I made over 20 years is still going and I have nothing to do with it.
OK. The hard truths. Patty never was in live with me. She loved me, but was never head over heels in love. So, she essentially wasted 20 years of her life. Sure she loves the boys, they’re her babies, but I can bet she has told people she wishes they weren’t mine. Like most ex-wives she now talks down to me and no matter how much I spend or give her for the boys, it’s not enough. Also she knows exactly what she did and how I left with absolutely nothing, but that doesn’t matter.
Should I have fought more for her to stay with me? No, it was a losing battle. It always losing battles for me.
I know that sounds like me once again whining, but I mean it. It has happened when I was happy, sad, and/or oblivious.
I just don’t want to do this alone anymore, but I can’t just settle for a friend I don’t want.

307,https://www.opendiary.com/m/newt316/maybe-i-am-unfixable-6144656/,2022-09-06,Maybe I am unfixable,"
Hard truths:
I am lazy, well not lazy but I will always find the easy and quickest ways to do things. I’m undisciplined, and can’t stay on point with anything.  I’m a thief and a liar. I am a lousy “lover” and selfish. I dwell too much on the past (NO SHIT, RIGHT?) and worry too much about the future while the present passes me by. I suck as a father, husband, boyfriend, brother, son, friend, and as a man and decent human. I know I need “professional” help, but I can’t afford it and can’t seem to find free help. I can not hold a conversation even though I constantly claim to want to have one. I am never sure of myself and my abilities. I’m 51 yet I don’t feel mentally older than 15. I don’t understand “adult”.
Looking back, I may have been romantically “loved” by one person and I hurt her horribly. I’ve had 5 children with 2 women who never really cared for me and neither of them thinks I am a father to them. Once they “left” me, it was as if they never knew me. I’m not sure if I ever had friends, more like I had several people who pitied me through the years. My own kids don’t look at me like their “hero” or example. It’s like they are just going on the fact that I was unfortunately their “sperm donor”.
I smoke, overeat, and stay out of shape. More or less I have given up. I have squandered every chance, opportunity, and gift I have been given from day one. I was raised believing everything I do or don’t has “eternal” ramifications so I am constantly filled with guilt.
I cry every day like a child. I am useless. I am alone.

It’s pushing midnight here and my damn head is at it again. Same shit, over and over. Maybe I should drink or get some weed. IDK.
Earlier I allowed myself to get roped into the guilt again with her. I know she knows that she ruined me especially financially, but she loves being able to get digs in about money and support. Seriously, she has 2 incomes. Knowing what I know about her husband, he’s a simp and is giving her all his money. He’s not just living there and she’s paying for it all. The house has no mortgage payments and she has all the equity in it. Over 75k. She got all the covid stuff and just got some tax refund for home owners in NY. Yet, it’s the miss support payment because I have to pay rent or I’m on the street, seriously, and it all starts. I paid this for him and that for them. I have bills too. All that stuff. I just don’t understand where all her bitterness and hate has come from? I have theories.
The second mind f@#$ I’m stressing about is my knees. They have gotten progressively worse and you can literally hear the pop and crackle and grind as I walk. At least several times a day my left leg just stops working and I have to catch myself. Don’t get me started on the pain. It’s not constant, but when it hurts it really hurts. So anyway, the Doc said he would do the surgery,  I’ve managed to get my surgery down and dropped a couple of pounds. I called my HR and was told all I can get is FMLA leave because I didn’t have the company short term disability  and if I was to pick it up I would have to wait close to a year and a half before I could use it. My knee is a preexisting issue. So that would only leave me at the mercy of NY short term Disability of which I would get maybe $170 a week and 3/4 of that will have to go to Patty for support. No rent, no utilities,  no gas for truck when I can drive and all for a minimum of 1 month recovery. So that’s not gonna happen. I will just have to learn that obese waddle so I don’t put too much weight on them. Come on, I know it’s a Woke world, but you have all seen the waddlers.
I’m also stressing about my life and relationship with the boys. I’ve talked to them and been reassured by them that they are OK about this all, but I just can’t allow myself to feel that and I stress with guilt that they are missing out or their lives are ruined, eventhough things are 10x better for them now then they ever were with me there.  Ah, another thing there.
I’m serious about the booze and pot. I can’t do this anymore.

Can someone tell or explain the ex-wife’s logic to me? Now I am not saying every woman who has found herself in a divorce is like this, some ex-husbands are assholes too, but where does the illogical thinking about how life works come from?
So what am I saying? I give my experience as an example.
My ex let shit fester in her head, but never once showed or talked to me about anything. She just kept up the appearance of a loving wife and mother. She never sat down with me to express her frustrations about money or anything. She went to work every day and soaked up the sweet promises of an older man who had ruined his own marriage and life but managed to save up some money by living rent-free with his sister and inheriting some property and money. Oh, I am sure he made her feel like the best thing in the world and it all just was so fresh and exciting enough to forget that I did that every day for the last 20 years of her life too.
Anyway, out of the blue and in the manner of hours, she ended our marriage and hitched her wagon to him. She cheated, lied, and essentially went public with the affair. She left in the middle of the night to be with him and treated me as if I had abused her for years without stopping. She sat me down and promised 3 things if I would just “give her space to think” 1) She would not expose the kids to this man right off the bat so they could ease into the understanding that their parents were separating. 2) We would try and do counseling, which I didn’t understand because she had never shown me any displeasure until the day she “blindsided” me with wanting to divorce and had a “friend”. 3) She wouldn’t close accounts so I could get an apartment and get somewhat settled. Two hours after I left she broke all 3. He essentially moved in that night, making dinner with her for them and the boys without so much as an explanation to them about where Dad was.  The next morning she emptied all the accounts and left me penniless and pretty much homeless.
Why didn’t I fight? Well, I was broken and alone. Everyone in my “circle” just treated it as “shit happens” and I was being “over dramatic” about my pain, loss, and confusion. They watched me lose my mind and ignored the fact I was suicidal. I did talk to a lawyer, but I had absolutely no way of getting the retainer fee or anything. Yeah, he felt for me, but he felt more for his wallet.
What I am saying is that she ruined me and broke me mentally, spiritually, and financially and she knows it. She knew she wasn’t going to give me dick for my share of the house. She knew I had nowhere to live at that time and that I was in no condition to care for myself let alone have the boys with me. She knew I had nothing and it was her (and him) that did this to me, out of nowhere with no warning.
But…
I should still pay my half of everything. I am obligated to pay support and half of the boy’s expenses even though I have no custody rights and haven’t been included in any decision made for them in 3 years. That I should be a better Father, this told to me by a woman who forced a new man into their lives and publicly destroyed their own Father. I should have money because I am now single without obligations. Apparently, my rent, utility bills, car payment, insurance, and groceries along with paying off the debt we had are just excuses not to fork over half my paycheck every week to her. I don’t and never had understood the difficulties of having 2 incomes, tax refunds, thousands of covid relief money, and no mortgage compared to my spendthrift single lifestyle of candlelight to save on electricity, cold apartment to save on gas, piss poor food from dollar stores, and never going anywhere to save on fuel.

They say life is what you make it, but is it really? I know my life isn’t. Oh, I’ve done everything to make my life what I want, but have been forced to adapt to what others want. Every twist, turn, or intersection I have come upon my thoughts, needs, and wants had absolutely nothing to do with what life gave me. Is it because I just can’t fuck someone else over for my own selfish needs? Is it because I have empathy for others?
You would be hard-pressed to find anyone connected in my life that has any sort of regret in screwing me over to get what they wanted. My ex-wives stepped on and over me with no emotion or conscience or guilt about trashing a man who did everything he could to please them, but just not enough. My friends have sat and chided me over things that they wind up doing without so much thought of me. My siblings show no support and even outright walk away from me as I am laying and dying on the ground with emotional pain. My co-workers constantly throw me under the bus or toss their mistakes on my back.
“You need to stand up and take control of your life,” they say.  Do you know what would happen to me if I did that? Well, it has already happened. I spoke up in my defense about what my cheating, lying, ex-wives, and my words were used against me. I told my friends how their words and actions make me feel and they laughed it off and walked away. I spoke up to my family and have been branded a spoiled brat who never went through the “hard times” like them. I speak up at work and I lose my job.
For everything I have wanted in my life, I have lost so much more and the one thing I thought I finally got, is now gone and someone else is enjoying it all without so much as lifting a finger to earn it.
 
Do you know how people “make their life theirs”? They have luck and money. They have no soul when they run over others. They have no respect for anyone. And if the day comes that something bad may happen to them as they have done to others, they take everyone down with them. I can’t be that so life isn’t what I make it unless what I make is a life lived alone with nothing.

This morning, based on my ever-enjoyable dreams I have, my thoughts are about what I have done for others but have never had much of a return on. I guess right off the bat we’ll talk about Patty’s new view on things. I have written until my fingers are black and blue about how she has become the typical bitter ex-wife for no other reasons but her wanting to, but I got the message today about the fact I didn’t send child support this week. Yes, I am responsible for the boys too, I know this. She was the one who went back on her word about custody though. We had agreed to joint custody and that was the plan right up until I was served the papers. So I get to pay and have weekend visits, but I am not allowed to make decisions or even add my 2 cents to anything. She just loves to itemize what she paid for as if she is all alone and destitute living in a cardboard box. She loves to play the victim of the divorce she created. She loves to be seen as a brave woman who “lept into the unknown by giving up all to strike out on her own”. Thing is, at absolutely no time was she in any sort of trouble or victim of any sort of domestic horrors. She had all our money, and our home, and immediately moved her “simp” future husband in on the day I moved out.  I, on the other hand, slept in my car, went days without eating, woke up in the ER, lost everything from money to friends, and became the ire of everyone for something I had never done to Patty ever.
“I just spent $180 on Ethan’s clarinet,” she says. This is the first I have heard of him actually wanting to play one. She doesn’t seem to recognize that Jonathan has a $1500 laptop I am paying off and Morgen has a $300 computer graphic drawing kit and a $600 game system that they all share. Yet, I miss a week of support because I need to pay my $715 rent, while she lives in the mortgage-free home.
I would totally accept my blame for my failed marriage if I personally did something to cause it. Every marriage I know of unless there were millions of dollars going into it, has financial issues. We had financial issues. Not mine, not hers, but our financial problems. She never said “NO” to the purchases and sacrifices. Yet, I was the blame and I became to reason. So, brave Patty made the “hard” choice of cheating and leaving me for an older man with a couple of thousand dollars saved, stuck me with all the debt but took all the “stuff” and she somehow crawled out of the dark black hole of misery she was locked in because of me.
 
On FaceBook because sometimes I get personal several people have decided that I am going to be their “feel good” act of the week. They have never known me at all, just a casual greeting from time to time. They give me their advice and experiences that have absolutely nothing to do with my problems and then become totally irate and pissed off when I don’t fall in line with their beliefs. A lot of them are what I will call “pretty people”. Now, pretty people can have “ouchies” too, I do realize that, but when their “problems” happen they have several people there for them to support and south the hurt. They feel alone because they choose to and never because they are. They just do not understand how I can be so depressed and down at life when every time the “shit hits the fan” for them it always works out. There is always a helpful person when they ask, always a friend when they look, and always a “partner” when they are alone, so why am I being such a “Debby Downer”? Why don’t I just get out there and shake it off as they can? And Dear God, do not make them feel bad or bothered with my “poor me” posts on the FaceBook feed.
 
Maybe everyone is right about me. Maybe I am right about myself. I don’t think I could handle a relationship of any kind right now and before you say “Well you have to be happy and in love with yourself first” stuff, I am satisfied with myself. Am I overweight? Am I lonely? Would I be happier, could I be happier? Sure, but at this moment I can live with myself how I am. If anything, maybe having some more money so I can have a sense of security again would be great. Having to crawl out of the deep hole I was tossed in by her isn’t the “life of a swinging bachelor” everyone thinks I have. I do have some insecurities because of money and health issues. Not that I couldn’t be an honest, loyal, and loving partner or friend, but enough to play on the mind because of the total blindsided divorce and loss of people that happened. “You need to get your confidence back,” they say. How? How do you get that back when you never get an opportunity to test that confidence?

What’s the reason for texting? No one ever answers me. I assume the “new” normal is to text 1st and not to call straight out, but  o one answers that way either.
All I want to do is talk to someone and the only choices I have are a few people I really don’t want to. I realize that makes no sense, put the one person who says they will talk is one of those “oh you think your day was bad” People who all they do is one up you when you’re just trying to keep a person to just listen.
 
I’m back to the godamn Patty shit again. Almost 4 years and thus is still tearing me up. How stupid am I when I can’t realize that she did such awful shit to me and I pine away for her. On top of all that, it’s totally ruined any confidence

313,https://www.opendiary.com/m/newt316/a-day-in-my-head-2-6149967/,2022-09-15,A day in my head,"
Most days:
I wake up after a fitful night of sleep filled with nightmares about my ex just treating me horribly and just acting totally different from the woman I loved for 20+ years. My body, especially my bum knees, just ache from the tossing and turning and I have to sit on the edge of the bed for 5 minutes attempting to “work out the kinks”. I never do and I limp to the bathroom hoping that today isn’t the day where they just give out and I am stuck on the floor.
Most mornings I attempt to try to eat breakfast. I look at the mess from yesterday and tell myself “later”. I take my pill “cocktail” which just doesn’t seem to help anymore. Get dressed, hate how I look, wish I could buy new clothes, know that I can’t, and hate where I am in my life. I think back to when I would help my sons get ready for school, make a big breakfast, and have the loving feeling of a family around me like a bulletproof shield. I spend the next few minutes fighting the tears, again.
I walk to my truck and get accosted, as I do every day, by my neighbor’s dogs. One day they will get through the screen. When I get to my truck, I glance over at the daycare across the way and see the parents dropping their children off and the loss hits me hard. I immediately think about how I had all of that ripped from me and given to another man. Almost everything that made me happy and complete is gone and my relationships have all been irreparably changed and every day I struggle with why…
The drive to work and home has become one of the only constants in my life now and even that has been recently messed with. The county has decided to “fix” the one road with tar and stone and they have done the most half-assed job of it. My truck now has tar spots all over the bottom of the doors and wheel wells and at least 4 new chips in my windshield from passing vehicles.
I arrive at work knowing that it is my only escape from it all and also yet another cause of depression for me. My 2 co-workers, who have their lives together, talk of trips and activities I probably will never have. Their families stop by occasionally. They keep all the good parts of this job to themselves and saddle me with the bad. I deal with difficult customers, paperwork mistakes, and messed-up DMV paperwork even though it’s someone else’s job as an “office manager”.  During the day I will see a couple or a family come in to browse or buy and it pulls my mind right back to all I lost.
I come home to the lonely apartment, once again getting aggressively barked at or occasionally “lunged” at when the dog is tied outside. My apartment is constantly “stale” and blah. There are always dishes to be done and no matter how I move things, it just feels constricting and prison-like. I sit and listen to the kids and families in the complex play and laugh and yes, I once again think and miss my own. I cry every day. I push myself to “clean up” and no matter what, it never seems to feel clean.
I quickly lose interest and hope. I take the “nighttime” pills and the pill my psychiatrist says will help me sleep and watch shitty YouTube videos until my mind surrenders, or so I think. I go to bed and attempt to quiet my brain with mood music or soundscapes, but it doesn’t help. I eventually must fall asleep because I am again in a dream with my love who once again has become the nastiest person I have ever met.

I wish I could be the man I see in my work’s bathroom mirror. I don’t know why, but that guy seems to be attractive and confident. Not overweight or sloppy looking.
It’s amazing what the proper lighting can do…
"
315,https://www.opendiary.com/m/newt316/ive-said-all-of-this-before-6150184/,2022-09-17,I’ve said all of this before,"
I’m sitting on my couch and I just can’t quiet my thoughts. Yes, the same thoughts I have several days a week.
The vicious circle. I was put out by my ex, who lied and cheated on me. I left with nothing and really haven’t been able to get back to comfortable. I make enough to keep the ship afloat and that’s it. So, weekends like this one where I don’t have enough gas to get my kids and to go to work. I had to buy a pick up. Stupid.
Yet, her, my sister, and others think I am just being a shit father. Yes, the woman who knew exactly how this was going to go and forced it to go faster, now bitches at me about being a bad parent, when she put up all the walls and dug all the holes. My sister who is married, with 2 incomes, and no children whatsoever,  guilts me constantly,  but never wants to acknowledge how my life is stuck in this cycle. She never brings the boys here, knowing that weeks like this, I have $20 left for gas. Why can’t she ever stop by and see her little brother? She’s never been supportive at all in these few years. She was the one person who could have called out Patty’s shit and even sit down and talk to her, but she didn’t, she just played along until the point she believed all the crap Patty and her “new” husband were spitting out.
I miss having a family. I miss not dreading tomorrow because I had a family. I miss people coming around. I miss hugs and kisses. I miss that untouchable no worries feeling when I held Patty at night. I never would have imagined it would be her to cause all my nightmares to happen.
Excuses, that’s what everyone calls my pain now. I can make my life, I can become someone new, I can do this and that, and everything else. I have been trying,  but there are limits, actual limits, but once again excuses. My full time job has weird hours that won’t mesh with a part time. I can’t go miles out of my way for a part time. My 2 crap knees limit me from a lot of stuff and even though I have been ok’d by the doctors, I can’t do it yet. I have no savings,  no company disability,  and can’t live on the $150 a week the state may possibly give me for the month or month and a half I would be out.
Well, poor me. Others have it worse and I’m just a selfish asshole.

I wrote earlier about my usual blah. Still haven’t shaked it off.
Why can’t I just see the facts. She didn’t want me. She at no time showed regret or even compassion towards me. I mean, who starts the day with hugs, kisses, and and saying I love you when you know you’re going to totally dump the other person without so much as a reason?
Do you know how hard it is to try and avoid triggers when you are so hurt and just want to go back to when life made sense? The family in the store. The shows and movies always sneaking a love interest or having a family moment.
I still do not know how to view the world this way. Alone, part time Dad, and left by family and friends.
"
317,https://www.opendiary.com/m/newt316/i-am-671-6150315/,2022-09-18,I am,"
I am a shit human. I just sit around watching the world go by. I can’t bring myself to be part of it.
I am a shit father, I guess I have always been. I constantly talk about missing my children. All the things I wished I would have done, but didn’t. Making excuses instead of doing everything I possibly can even though I have been put into a position where I can’t.
I am a shit brother. I should do exactly what my brothers and sister tell me. As my sister constantly tells me, if I would have only listen to her advice, which never happened,  I would be ok.
I am a shit friend. I worry about what they think of me and expect they care enough for me after 40+ years. Their lives have always been more important than mine. If I so much as said one thing to them that they do to me, I would be made into the biggest uncaring asshole.
I can’t do the things people want me to and judge me on. I literally can not. I had exactly $40 left this week and that went into gas for the week to get to work and hand to God, it will only last that long.
I don’t have fancy stuff. I haven’t bought sneakers in over 2 years or new clothes.
I can’t do life on my own, but the world, fate, or God’s plan is making me have to, but it’s not working. I know this by the fact Patty trashed me the way she did. I know this because of how my family treats me. I know this because of how my friends have treated me since day one. I know this because my sons never call, text, or send me letters. I have managed to survive losing everything and going from living in my car when no one would even offer a couch to now, a meager existence where buying a candy bar throws all my utility bills off.
I hate me. I don’t blame them for hating me too.
"
318,https://www.opendiary.com/m/newt316/just-forget-it-7-6150407/,2022-09-19,Just… Forget it,"
I have been nagged by the same thought all weekend and today is no better, but what’s the point of beating a dead horse?
 
I know I have to change, that I have to move on from the past and fix myself, alone. I really thought I meant something to someone, but short of them not wanting me to die, I don’t. This whole experience over the last 3+ years has been nothing but a total soul-crushing mess. I never imagined Patty doing what she did, but she did. I never imagined my friend’s reactions would be what they were, but they were. I thought my sons would be somewhat lost without me, but they rolled with it all like their Mother and accepted it as just a normal thing.
 
Part of “changing” who you are involves some support from loved ones and this whole time instead of that support and understanding, I’ve been criticized and shunned. Another part is being financially secure, which I have come nowhere close to being these 3+ years, at all… The people who have broken me financially, all seem to think it was me and me alone that put me in this position. I didn’t fight the divorce, I couldn’t afford to. To this day, people tell me I should have, knowing I was poor as f**k, and refusing to help me, yet if you were to ask them today, they will tell you they would have, but I never asked. HUH??? Seems that all of this is one vast joke that I’ve been left out of…
 
I have the inner conflict of wanting to be better and of wanting to just lay down and fade away. No one cares. I don’t have people around here calling or checking in with me. I don’t have lifelong friends and siblings coming to me to lift my spirits. My kids never get in touch with me because they “miss” me only to ask for something. It hurts to realize that I suffer every second about all of them, but I am just a fleeting thought to them and only when they need something.
 
Don’t tell them, but therapy and psychiatrists haven’t really helped. Neither has religion. Yes, I go about them all with an open mind, but nothing has seemed to “click” with me about all the guilt. Whether it’s self-imposed or from others, I just haven’t been able to shake it. Maybe I was this “asshole” to everyone in the past and it’s all coming back onto me. I don’t remember being that way, but maybe that’s part of it. They say some people lie so much that they believe their own lies. Maybe I am that guy…
"
319,https://www.opendiary.com/m/newt316/hard-truths-12-6152141/,2022-09-22,Hard truths???,"
After yet another night of “dreams” where I came out the loser yet again, I’ve come to the realization that it has been me all along. Lately, with all the Alpha, Beta, and Sigma men talk and the whole MGTOW stuff, I’m just none of those. Yes, I’m not even a Beta male. I think I fall into another category.
 
Patty must have suffered in silence for years with me. My “woe is me” attitude about not being someone better for her and the kids. The fact I wasn’t an assertive a-hole to anyone. Not a super take charge person. Guilty about not doing more with the past. Essentially being a person that only his mother could love and even though my Mother always did, the last 3 years of her life were spent in dementia and Alzheimer’s fog and most days I was called horrible things, told I shouldn’t have been born, and constantly hit by my Mom. Patty lived through that too, I realize that, and besides me, no one in my family ever thanked her. Why should she have any more loyalty to the “Newton” side?
As far as I know, even if it seems to me that he’s a waste, her “new” husband is mostly what women want but say they don’t. He’s one of those “Named” men. He can afford to be. He was 56yrs old when they got together, she was 38. He had years to fuck up his life and relationships, which as far as I know he did. Yet, he was selfish enough, unlike me, to not consider anyone else’s feelings when he pounced on a married woman going through a “down” time in her marriage where decent people would have explained to her there are rough patches and they can be worked through. Oh, I’m sure he loves her, nowhere near how I do, but he does. I am sure he has affection and cares for my kids, they’re good kids. I am sure he has taken this 2nd, 3rd, or 54th chance God has given him and did it right this time. As they say, “some guys have all the luck, some guys get all the pain” or at least Rod Stewart does.
 
I have always believed dreams were “escapes” with an occasional nightmare, but mine have all been stark reminders that I fucked up and lost everything. My love, her respect, and everyone else too. It doesn’t make any difference that my waking hours are filled with regret and what ifs, I have to have a 24/7 cycle.

I just painfully realized I just don’t fit anymore. Not in the lives of my loved ones or friends, nor I to the lives of ny co-workers and neighbors. It shouldn’t bother me, but for 48 years, I did fit.
I have reached a point where I have stopped expecting anyone to call or stop by, but I wish they did. My boys have all reached that age where they don’t comprehend their father’s depression and sadness, so they get a pass, but it hurts like Hell.
I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention this one acquaintance, she has thrown a couple greetings my way and offered a shoulder, which I unfortunately accepted. The ear she claimed to offer turned into the “you don’t know what pain and loss feels like”. Dhe has somewhat one up’d me with every thing. I am sad, she is sadder. What she doesn’t seem to get is, she has a house of her own and a couple children that are there 24/7 and more actual active friends then me. Her “comfort and understanding” is equivalent to the lash that jockeys hit the race horse with to run faster.
Even though I could never bring myself to it, I wonder how long I could go without calling or texting anyone before someone would notice? If I was a betting man, I would definitely think it would be months.

Let’s talk about depression and suicide. For years after sad shows or movies, talk shows, and commercials all you heard was “if you or anyone you know is considering harming yourself or others, please call a friend, family member, or the hotline.”
Sounds good, doesn’t it? I’m sure it does for a certain kind of person out there. A person that others want to fall over themselves to help. Just not me.
NO, I am not considering anything, I have accepted that the people around me could give a shit about me. I’ve made the “late night” calls. They went either unanswered or rudely hung up on. These “caring” people in your life…
I have learned that I am only the jester to my friends and family, the dancing monkey I like to call myself. From day one of all of this, they stepped away from me. Oh, I have heard from them, I have been made fun of on FaceBook for “over-sharing” and guilted because of my “attention whore, woe is me” made-up depression is inconveniencing others.
This all, reach out for help thing is awesome, for the pretty people. The people others admire or want to be around. Not me though.  You hear all the time after the “shocking” suicide death or overdose of a famous person, how there is always someone out there to help. BS… Not for some schlub like me. I appreciate the thought behind the “helplines”, but I don’t quite understand how taking everything you say that is making you feel shitty and turning it into questions like, “And how does that make you feel?” Hmm, well seeing I just called the hotline, crying my head off, you would think that’s obvious.
I realize that all of this sounds completely assinine and you’re probably correct. I guess I am the whiner they all say I am, so much so all these years that when the “worse” happened no one cared.

Jonathan is home for the next couple of days. I picked him up on Friday and had my 2 days. I dropped him home to Patty’s house, hugged and kissed him and his brothers.
Now, like the last 3+ years I’m sad, but this time I’m sitting in the Tim Hortons parking lot inconsolable and crying like a mad man and I can’t stop.
I don’t want to go home. It’s not a go somewhere type of feeling, it’s a I just want to drive off the edge of the world because I don’t have it in me to go on, type of feeling.
It’s not helping seeing the couples or the families pull into here. I’m not a monster, but I’ve been made to fill like one from everyone.  No, I don’t wear my pain and depression on my sleeve. It doesn’t hang on me like a bad smell, but I don’t know how much longer I can keep it between you here and me out of public. At any time I want to snap. Just lose it on people PDA or rudeness.
I’m not made for this. I never was. I know several people who want nothing more then to be alone and away from humanity, I am not one, but I am being forced to be no matter what I have tried to do to be social and part of something.
Honestly, it’s getting hard to even still write here. Yes, most of you understand me and make attempts to keep my head above water. Thank you all, but, I need something more. It sound horrible, but I just need someone there. Someone actually there. All the virtual therapy and text based “coaching” doesn’t fill the hole that a hug or seeing someone across from you would.
I don’t want to go home…

I once again had a panic attack Sunday night. Like the thought of going back into the past and killing a butterfly that will somehow change the future, my attack could be one of a hundred reasons.
My visit with my son. It was over before it began. Dropping him home to the house I used to own, my inheritance, and being surrounded by his brothers, my 4 sons, ripped my heart apart.
Sitting in a parking lot sobbing. Calling and texting people I thought and was told, would be there, only to never get any answers or return calls.
Once again making myself believe that Patty has some form of caring for me, at least as the father of her children, only to once again be reminded that no one ever really loved me and the ones that did are all dead now.
Getting the automated call from the electric company telling me that my electricity will be turned off by week’s end, knowing that I will absolutely have no money to even put down on some sort of agreement. I have rent to pay, which is more than what I bring home. Child support. Gas so I can go work to make the money. I have to somehow have food for the boy’s visit this weekend also. I gross too much for social service help but bring home far less than what I need to live on…  Thank God there isn’t inflation, what would I do if the costs of everything went up when my check seems to go down?
I thought I was a good person. Yes, I lied and did a couple of bad things when I was a younger man. Nothing arrest worthy or life-altering, but I did them. Why is it that I have constantly been pushed into the mud these last few years? Why did I lose everything in a day? Why is it that with everything I have done so far, the therapy, the “mindfulness”, the apologizing to people who hurt me, why am I still being f#@%ed every single day?

Ok, here we go:
 
There’s this part of my brain that keeps telling me that all of this was a mistake. Patty got caught up in the “feels” and it all went too far too fast and now this is how things are stuck. The rest of my brain and all the fibers of my being know that she was gone days, weeks, or months before. She immediately moved him in and took absolutely no time to close joint accounts. She packed the “sentimental” things and had my sons give them to me within days. She was engaged within weeks and married days after the divorce became official. Yet, I sit here listening to the part of my brain that tells me it’s all a mistake. Honestly, I don’t know if I miss her or if I miss being loved, wanted, and needed, because when she checked out of my life, so did most everyone.
 
I am so tired of hearing how I have to love myself, know myself, or fix myself, by people. To me, at this point, these people just say that so they can pat themselves on the back as if they helped. Not one of them calls or visits or even makes time to actually sit and have a coffee. Just saying the phrases is enough to help and if I happen to ask more, I am an unappreciative broken man and I need professional help. You see, I do care for myself and I am doing the steps and I have reached a point where I want others in my life. It’s like running out of gas and everyone stops to tell me I need gas, but no one offers to drive me to the nearest garage when I ask for one. It’s all “no, no, no. I can’t do that. You have to figure out how to get gas.” I have! I need a ride to get gas. I have bad knees and can not walk that far, everyone knows this, but as they drive away, they have all said “call me if you need something…” They never answer.

I really don’t. I made who I am based on a marriage that for the most part was happy and problem free, where there were family gatherings for holidays and birthdays. Sunday dinners and being needed by my kids. Sleep was never fitful, the warm body next to me told me that I could make it through anything and I did then.
And then it was all gone…
People think I am overdoing what happened, but I’m not. It literally changed and ended in a day. Immediately I didn’t matter to anyone. Patty, who hours before, hugged, kissed, and told me she loved me, now was shrinking from my touch. My sister shut me out as if I had done so grievous harm to her. My friends dismissed me like I was only supposed to be the dancing monkey in their lives and not this broken thing. My children seemed to accept it like it was always meant to be.
And I still don’t know what I did or didn’t do…
Now the only interaction I have is here, with you. People, I will never sit across from having coffee, drinks, or dinner. All my efforts to “apologize” to my “friends” have led to silence. All my attempts to meet new friends or date make it all worse. I don’t want to live a lonely life, but for some reason, God, fate, or karma is making me, and try as I may,  I can not make it work.

326,https://www.opendiary.com/m/newt316/how-do-you-do-it-18-6158106/,2022-10-10,How do you do it?,"
I’m serious, how does one go about moving on from a life spent with family and friends to a new one with almost no one? All I have ever known since I was 18 was being a father and being a partner to someone and for the last 4 years I have had to change what it means to be a father and be absolutely alone most of the time, and I can not find any peace with it. Where is this supposed peace that comes when you accept and learn to care for yourself? I do care for myself and I have accepted, but it’s like finally learning to float and having 100s of gallons of water being poured on you constantly.
Look the “things” I supposedly can do now that I am “free and single” cost too much. I can’t travel unless it’s one way and I want to live in my car. I can’t do the hobbies I want. Hell, because my knees are so bad, I can’t go hiking and I can’t afford to fix them unless I live in the aforementioned car. I have become rated as a bad father because I miss a week of child support here and there and because I can’t do things at the last minute for my kids that I was never told they were doing in the first place.
I want to date, but I don’t have the money for the early stages. I can’t take someone out or even meet them if they are not in a 10-mile radius.
I have an acquaintance, Jim, who is one of those loner individuals. He was married once for a couple of years, but that ended as if it never happened.  He was always outdoorsy. Hunting, fishing that stuff, plus he knows how to clean all that stuff. He has his own home and property to fiddle with and to keep him occupied. I on the opposite side lost a 20-year marriage with children, my childhood home, and now live in a 3-room apartment that costs more than his mortgage. I can’t fiddle with the yard or the apartment.
I read sporadically, there really isn’t anything on the television, and for some reason, I just don’t give a shit about playing video games. Yet, that’s all I have and all I can do.
Over the last 4 years of my endless whining and bitching, I’ve been “schooled” by people who insist they understand what I am going through. Take Nicki for instance, this beautiful woman who can’t breathe without exhaling on a friend, family member, or a man that would bend over backward for her. She decided that enough was enough and messaged me through FaceBook. She had spent the first 15 yrs as an adult partying and drinking. Had more relationships than I can count and dumped every single one of them. She eventually got engaged, without slowing down with the “partying” and that ended horribly. Not abusively, just “hot girl summer” BS.
She was broke and pretty much an alcoholic. She had to move back to NY but was immediately taken in by friends. She had tons of people supporting her to get sober as if all the nonsense was some great cry for help, but even if it was, tons of people. Around here, people were falling over themselves to give her a job, loan her money, or just be there so she never had a “sad” moment.
Anyway, I was preached to about self pitty and being down by a woman who at really no time was in my position. She told me that life always works out, forgetting about all the effort people made for her. You see, I just had to be “TOUGH LOVED” to learn my lesson. Like she was… Wait, What?
I’m not saying there aren’t people like me or worse out in the world, what I am saying is my “circle” of people has absolutely no understanding and no interest in understanding me or even supporting me. I was written off the first time I said that Patty wanted a divorce. At no time has anyone one of them sat with me and listened and talked with me about any of it.
You all have been very kind to me and the hours with therapists have helped, but what I need is to feel normal again. Feel like I belong to these people. I am so far from a loner and it totally feels like I have no choice anymore, I have to become one.

I have reached my end of sanity. I guess the kids call it the “red pill” moment. I have become the “thing” that most people wake up and think, “how can I do or say something so I can feel I have said or done something without actually doing anything?”
Let me explain:
In this world of FaceBook and Instagram where people want to show the world, they are good and caring when in reality, they are selfish assholes, there is only one thing to do. Spout BULLSHIT. “LOOK, I put up a Ukraine flag on my profile. I care, but wouldn’t actually get my hands dirty.” “I care, but not enough to do anything but say that I CARE.”
I finally lost my shit on FaceBook yesterday. I opened up about being an older, bald, broken-down man who put years of effort into friends and family and when he needed them the most they all turned their backs and turned my pain into my fault. You see, I’m negative and I put negative out into the world and therefore I am only to blame for my misfortunate shit hole life. It has nothing to do with how since I was a kid I was a devoted friend and brother. I was a loving, caring, and honorable boyfriend and husband. I was hard-working and a team player. I went to church every Sunday and on special occasions. I never “rocked” the boat and gladly allowed others to “cut in line” in life. THEN, one day I essentially lost everything. My wife, who for some fucking stupid reason I still am totally and painfully in love with. The woman who knew this, planned for weeks or months to leave me and destroy me in the process and never ever give me a reason why. I lost my family support as my sister decided that by stabbing me in the back and shutting me out, she could have unlimited access to her nephews. My friends who I held as their lives fell, gave them shelter when they had nowhere to go, built them up to become better men, heard me cry for less than a second, and told me they didn’t care and it was my problem. ONE DAY, I lost a home, savings, and every possession I couldn’t fit in a backpack. I fucking slept in a car for weeks because I was refused by all of them to spend one moment in their homes.
And I finally let it all go out on FaceBook.
 
…. and it’s all my fault for being so negative. I should just look at the fact that 51 years of building a life that burns to shit in less than a day, is just a simple bump in the road.
Let’s not kid ourselves. The world could give a shit about a broken man.
The only ones that care, do so so they can fly their Ukrainian flag and show the world how they care, without caring.
 
Negative is all I have. I have a roof over my head, it costs me 2 paychecks. I have a vehicle, it costs me 1 paycheck and will break at a moment’s notice. I have 4 sons that love me, who are now influenced more and more by their fucktard stepfather. I have some people that care, the average distance to the closest one is over 400 miles. I have all this freedom to be who I want and go where I want, with what money? What time? How? I have a failing body that I cannot do anything to fix because I literally can not afford to fix it physically or mentally.
Deep down, I understand exactly what I need to “fix” me or at the least make me feel better, but every time I have attempted to say or act on it, I am told by people (everyone) who are much better than me I am wrong and I need to do something else.

I think I am done. No, not with life or living, just done with the fighting. I’m just going to go along like the worker ant. Do what I do to get by and to improve others’ lives by doing it. I’ve proved the point that I am not special to anyone over the last few years and the only time I hear from someone in “real life” outside of our little Open Diary Virtual World is when I owe money or a favor. I literally had a cancer procedure that left me “compromised” for almost a week I told several people about it and never heard a peep from anyone, but a week behind on child support, I get nothing but guilty texts about how shitty of a father I am.
I’m tired of writing the same thing here just in several different ways, and I don’t think I want to do it anymore.
You guys have been awesome, thank you, but I don’t think I have it in me to try any further. I’m too tired from the several attempts that seem to have made things worse. It’s kind of like the movie scene where the car is precariously hanging off the cliff where if you just don’t move it won’t tumble, but any movement whether it’s toward trying to get out or go over makes the car fall.
Plus I’m so tired. I’m tired of learning that I no longer, if ever, meant something to someone. I’ve said it before here, I no longer am the hero to my kids, I know they don’t see me as that. They love me, but they just see me as a failed man too, but entertaining enough to hang out with for the weekend.
I just want to sleep, yet that no longer brings peace.

No matter how I write this, I will come off as an asshole.
 
I literally can’t afford to pay my child support right now. I have medical bills that have piled up and I am behind on utilities. Next month’s rent will be a week late and don’t even get me started on the credit cards. The $500 a month I pay would go a long way to helping me get back on my feet.
Have I been constantly paying her support? No.
Do I love my children and want a good life for them? Yes.
They are your children, you are half responsible.
So, here’s the rub. I left with absolutely nothing but 3 promises. She didn’t keep any of them. She took all the money from the joint account the next day when she promised to help me get established. She moved her “new” man into the house immediately, although she said she wouldn’t. She filed for sole custody, although she said we would have joint.
LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT… At absolutely no time was my ex in any sort of financial hardship. There was no homeless threat. There was no starvation. The utilities stayed on (because of what little money I had before leaving paid for them). He came with money, I too would have a bunch of savings if I had just lived a year and a half rent-free with my sister. LET ME REPEAT… At no time was she in any danger of being homeless, hungry, or cold. YET, she is the brave one. She broke away from all security to be on her own and he was a saint to see this struggling mother of 4 and give all to her, or so the narrative goes. ANYONE with half a brain could see this and know the real truth, but apparently, all the “people” around do not have that.
Anyway, after losing my job and sleeping in my car, I managed to ink together some money to get an apartment, that to this day consists of a bed, a tv, and a couch I was given. I pay close to $700 in rent, she lives in a paid-off home. I struggle to pay the utilities, car payments, insurance, and groceries, she has 2 incomes coming in, and thousands of Covid money saved in the bank. They have gone on trips, bought new furniture, and a new car, remodeled the house, and put on a new roof, but because I can’t get that weekly support to her, life is so hard. I didn’t get an equal share of the home when I left and divorced, close to $40,000 to “start a new life” as she had done. I did not have a new person in my life handing over their paycheck.
She caused the breakup. She cheated and lied. Yet, somehow if I don’t hand over a 1/4 of my take-home pay I am the shit parent. I don’t love or care for my children. Does she give me money to feed them on the weekends? Does she give me the gas money because she refuses to bring them or pick them up? Does she reimburse me for the clothes I bought or the school supplies?
I know, I know, they are my children and I created them and I am responsible, but to be the Devil’s advocate for a moment, she was given a paid-off $80,000 home with all utilities paid. She took all of the $3000 in the bank and kept both of the tax returns which added up to over $9000. She moved a “Simp” in who handed over all his money because he was a washed-up 58yr old man who just won the 38yr old woman lottery. With covid, she received probably close to $10,000 in benefits and another 3 years of returns in the thousands, but me not paying that $500 a month is breaking them.
Yet, no one can see this unbalanced craziness. I’m a deadbeat. I am a horrible father. My children would be better off if their “step-father” was their real one.
 
I was essentially the loyal loving silly dog. I occasionally made mistakes and had mishaps, but I would be there next to your side in a moment wanting nothing else but to do what you ask and please you. Then for no reason, you threw me out and brought in a new dog. You ignored me and stopped feeding me. People who once came to pet me or play, now throw rocks and dismiss me. But, I am still expected to guard everyone.
I have tried to pay for the support on a regular basis. I have gone weeks without a decent meal and fumbled around my place with just the light on my phone. I wash clothes once a week and shower twice if needed. I steal toilet paper and paper towels from work. I go nowhere so the gas in the truck will last for a week and back and forth to get the kids. No, there is no lowering of the amount. They could give a shit where your money goes only what you gross. They could give a shit that it takes 1 1/2 checks to pay rent. 1 to pay for the car and the other car from the divorce no one has. They only care that someone gets the cherry on top of their sundae and pay no mind to who gets hurt by taking it.
You see, I wasn’t the man who left his family for someone new and had tons of cash. I didn’t have a 2nd home to move into or money for a fancy lawyer. I instead put my hopes and life into the hands of friends and family that I believed would see me drowning and would attempt to lend a hand. My mistake. I thought a woman, who had spent 20 really trouble-free years with a man who gave her the family she never had would have some small speck of conscience about destroying a good man, her children’s father, but she didn’t. The type of man who complains about the support, that is just a little drop in the bucket, 1 less bottle of wine, or 1 less party.
 
But, shut up Colby, and pay your child support. You’re half responsible for them, although you legally have no say in their lives anymore.

Did you ever see or hear of the Simpsons episode where Bart keeps putting his hand in a fire without learning that it burns? The hand goes in, he says “ow!” and then does it again.
That’s me and the people who over the last 4 years have let me down. Once again I reached out and now I am sitting here burnt.
 
It’s becoming very difficult living with just using my kids as the reason to push forward. They are the only PROs I can think of when it comes to measuring life. The CONs are too numerous to list.
I would love to leave everything. Chapter 7 bankruptcy shit. Leave and never be heard from. I don’t want to give up, but when you try over and over, and never ever see results from it or nothing changes, it becomes very hard to keep it up.

Therapists have constantly harped on me to journal, but with the thousands of words I have typed here, I don’t think I am any better for it. Open Diary has made over $100 for the pleasure of my daily whining and bitching, but I feel just as lost now as I did the first note, sometimes worse…
I have done tons of things these last few years since I lost everything and everyone and nothing seems to want to stick. It all comes back to my failings as a husband, father, friend, and brother.
I haven’t learned why a woman can do what she did, how she did it, and not feel the least bit sorry. All relationships have “tough” times, but Patty literally came from a messed up upbringing with an immigrant mother who, for the most part, is a selfish person. She lost her father at an early age. We met and I gave her my world, I didn’t force it on her, I never held her back from anything. Right from the start, she was there for my “tragic” times. My brother in law dying almost instantly from cancer. She sat right there with me as he told us, crying and lost, that he had weeks left. She watched as I put my daughter on a train to California with her mother. The real last time I would see Kayla as a fully functioning healthy girl. She was there when I was told Kayla was in a horrible accident and may not make it. She was there when my father said his last words. She woke me with the news that Kayla had a horrible seizure and they didn’t know if she would make it, she didn’t this time. She was there to watch my mother fall to dementia and to also feel the warmth leaving mom’s body as she died.  We celebrated all 4 births of our boys together and faced all kinds of good and bad together.
So why did she not say anything about being unhappy? Why did she walk me right into the blindside? Why did she destroy me without so much as a tear, a sad face, or a hint of apology? Why did she immediately start a new life with another man, hours after I left? No time to sit and explain to the kids or even cry with them about any of this.
This haunts me every day. I tried “mindfulness” and therapy. I take several “happy” pills. It’s been almost 4 years, but every day it falls on me as if it was January 19th, 2019 3:30 pm, the exact moment all my 48 years of living amounted to fuck all…
I’m obviously a fool for thinking I would have a “Hollywood” movie type of separation. No one cared, no one consoled me, no one sat her done and caused her to rethink anything. They all encouraged her. They all told her how brave she was to do such a “scary” thing as leaving her marriage to be on her own, with nothing but cold and hungry children. Thing is, she never was. She had everything and more. All the money, all the help, the family, and friendships and acceptance. I was homeless and poor, my friends told me to either shut up about it or to just not come around, they didn’t want to get involved. My brothers haven’t talked to me at all and my sister made it all about how it affected her and her relationship with the boys and to some degree Patty.
What did I do to cause all of this? Ok, I will list my faults. I had reached a point where all the hurts from losing people and things couldn’t be just packed away and it showed. Not in a violent or abusive way, more like an ” I can’t do it anymore” way. I became irritated by the shitty way I was treated by bosses and coworkers and I would talk to Patty about it. Over the years I had left jobs and been fired from a couple because I spoke my mind. I mismanaged money, but not in a gambling or drinking way, but in a how can I make her happy and the boy’s happy way. Yes, we lost a couple of vehicles to repo, but we had 2 and well, the boys needed clothes, food, and diapers. We gave up our first home, but we were given my parent’s house and the bank made 5x more money selling it than we owed. But, I think my biggest crime of all, I wasn’t “man” enough. I enjoyed making my kids and others laugh. She seemed to enjoy it too. I was too empathic to others and didn’t cause an issue about silly stuff. I wasn’t a jealous possessive man. I was not “adult” enough.
So, you see, because I am who I am, I was everyone’s “dancing monkey” when they needed a laugh or a favor they would never have to return, even my siblings saw me as that. The monkey became old and lame, not able to dance and amuse anymore, so I had no use for people.
 
It’s funny, you hear the line, “If you truly love her, if you truly love them, then you should be happy that they are happy without you.” Do you stop to think about who says that? Never anyone in my position would. The people who even on their worse days, shit gold flakes, say it. The ones who have never had a broken heart or have been the heartbreakers, say it. The happily together people say it. Tell me how? How should I be happy, even though I love Patty wholeheartedly, for her when my whole life was made with her and was taken all from me and essentially given to a man who did nothing for it? How do I live in a dark and cold apartment I can barely afford, driving a vehicle that is at a point where a stiff breeze will break it, and eating dollar store crackers and chicken broth, see her still living the life I helped build, and tell myself “it’s such a great thing for her”? The cheating and lying she did to get to this point. The zero acknowledgment of my hurt and loss by anyone. I should be happy for her. I should be happy that my sister, but not me, has “carte blanche” to my children. I should now go out of my way to make her life easier by paying child support even when I don’t have any money left, because somehow her 2 income existence is not enough for her to live comfortably. I should feel guilty for even once thinking of myself and not her or the children, no matter if it is even a life or death thing. I should be ashamed to even have a thought of suicide, not because of the sin of it, but because of how it will affect people, who could care less about how I am living, but “oh how inconvenient it would be if I died.”
In the last 2 months, I have heard from my oldest son 3 times. One of those times was me driving a couple of hundred miles to bring him home so I could see him a day and everyone else the rest of the week. I have heard from Morgen, my other son 2 times, both to be told he and his brothers were ready for the night over I get because my sister sees them Friday and most of Saturday. The one time I heard from Patty was to tell me to “talk” to my son about his disrespect and yes it was the 2nd time in almost 4 years she used the word “our” son. Absolutely no friends called or texted.
I have always said this and it bears repeating if I was to die today the only way anyone would know is when the smell starts to be too much to take.

The title has nothing to do with my daily rant, but has OP been hacked seriously? Should I even proceed with writing?
 
As I drove to work, I went through the thousands of things in my brain that bother me, to write about. As I opened the OP page though, I thought “WHY?” Who cares? I’ve said it all before.
The several people around me, who claim to care, have proven to me it’s out of pity or for the little hug emoji on Facebook. No one gives a shit.
I wish I could embrace the anger and hate I feel. Others do and it seems they are rewarded for it. I have a friend named Tony who is the world’s biggest asshole and he lives a pretty charmed life. On the other hand, I can have my cheerios pissed on and hang my head, pour the milk, and eat them.  NO ONE CARES…
Screw it, here’s where I am in life and why I just want to end things.

I have nothing, other than 5 children, one of them dead, to show the world I have even lived for 51 years. I know that sounds horrible the way I wrote it, but my kids don’t seem to need me in any sort of fashion. They accepted their “stepdad” within hours after I left to give their mom “space”. They seldom call or text me and when I do talk to them, they quickly end the conversation. Yes, I know they are children and children are “busy”.
I have no savings, a couple of possessions, and poor health. For over 30 years I worked. Twenty of those, I built a life with a woman, who didn’t think twice about taking it all and turning around to make it seem it was all my fault I lost it and guilting me that I needed to give it all up for my children. Meanwhile, even though they are taken care of, she and her new husband have it all and never made any effort to earn it.
I have 2 bone on bones, Osteoarthritis ridden knees, that cause me horrible pain and keep me from doing common tasks. I cannot afford to fix them and can barely make it through 8 hours at this job, let alone a part-time one. No, NY disability, if you qualify, does not cover a single divorced child support-paying man. I am sure happy that the “new guy” can have his operation as his “new wife” is there to add her wages to his child support-free disability along with the extra $500 I send them…
The average temperature here for the last several nights has been about 40 degrees. I can’t turn my heat on, I can’t afford to. I can’t use a space heater, I can’t afford to. As it stands now, I will possibly be homeless by December or have a home but no vehicle or job.
I  know that I will be alone for Halloween, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. I know I can not buy my older sons birthday presents and none of my sons Christmas presents. I know I will hear from their mother, the person who put me into this position, how I am a shit father and how he is a better father than I ever was.

 
I have aggravated myself writing this and I am thinking that I am done with Open Diary. Along with Facebook, OP mostly leaves me empty. I have made several “internet” friends here. I appreciate every word they have written me and I truly believe that they mean everything they say to me, but they are all hundreds or thousands of miles away and are all involved in their own lives and really don’t need me dragging on them.
I’m done being the “pity” project for people. Everyone around me sees that I am drowning and hear my cries for help, but not one of them has cared enough to make any more of an effort other than send me someone else’s quote or send a hug emoji.

I have made a decision. It comes from having yet another shit night. It is probably a heartless one that doesn’t do me any good or anything for those around me, but F&*( it.
After this entry, I am probably going to shut myself off from everyone and anything. If I could survive without a job I would tell them to f&*( off too.
 
I will send my kids money and their mother child support, but I will no longer attempt an active role in their lives. I’m essentially shut out of them anyway unless there is a problem that can be blamed on me. Maybe it’s harsh to say, but since the day I was told that she didn’t love me and wanted a divorce, not one of them came to me and said how sad or how much they missed me without prompting. Hey, I know they love me, they just don’t need me. In fact, no one does. Not them, their mom, my family, or my friends. As I have written time and time again, I could stop reaching out to everyone and never be contacted or checked in with for weeks, months, and possibly years.
 
I have never lived a selfish life. Have I lied? Yes. Have I cheated? Yes, a long time ago when I was a teenager. What I have never done was use people or let people sit and suffer alone. I never  looked at a friend or family member and told myself “it’s their problem”
 
I have given away and lost everything I have ever loved or owned to others. I have 3 pairs of underwear, 3 pairs of pants, several shirts and socks that are and have always been mine. That’s it. The tools I bought, his now. The family I made, his now. The house I grew up in was given to me by my mother in the days before she became lost in dementia, hers and his now.
 
It’s over. everyone else wins. I give up. I’m done writing here about it. I’m done thinking someone I knew cares on Facebook. I’m done doing all the “extra” at work only to find out someone who does less has been given a raise or that I am left out of the planning here. Over. Finished. I don’t care anymore how I look or smell. I can not afford the utility bills so I won’t shower every day, who cares? Everyone avoids me now anyway.
They wanted and made me out to be this, well this is the last thing I will do for them. Be the asshole they make me out to be.

I’m really not ok. I’ve somehow fallen to a new “low” as I’m sure you can see with my last several entries.
I’m trying to think of reasons to stay or go. Yes, my kids. They are a reason to stay, but I never hear from them unless I call or I text. I have mentioned how it hurts to my ex and my sister, but even the “adults” don’t care enough to tell them every now and then to reach out.
Which leads to a reason to go. No one cares for me. I don’t mean you who read and comment and feel for a worthless little bald fat man, I mean the people I loved and cared for. These people all knew how this has turn my soul apart and damaged everything about me and not one of them has made any sort of effort to at least cheer me up. I haven’t been wished happy birthday in 3 years. I turned 50 to a dark quiet apartment.  Holidays have been spent in quiet also. They parties are still going, I’m just not invited anymore.
I just want to quit life. I just wish I could quit life. I am just living it so the kids won’t have to live with the stigma, eventhough I’m never part of things.

Hey,
You commented on a ton of my ramblings, rants, and woe-is-me entries, so I figured I would call you out on this one. You have always said great things to me and I have appreciated everything you say.
Reading your newest post, I am so happy that things seemed to calm down with you and that your guy seems to be finally on the right track for you. I know how hard it’s been for you and I only wish I could support you more. In fact, I miss being that guy, but he had it all then and I could focus on helping others.
So, would I like to uproot and move somewhere else and do something else, I am in no position to and I’m kind of scared of what would become of my relationship with my kids.  It seems sometimes I am the only one keeping myself in their lives.  What would I do? I am a hodgepodge of useless work experiences. I never made a career choice, I just blew from job to job and got a useless diploma from ITT Tech. Unfortunately, I missed the cut-off date by a semester so I didn’t get my loans forgiven like others who went there.
Let’s see, bankruptcy probably won’t help me. Sure getting rid of credit card debt would help, but I’m not paying them off now, so? I can’t afford to lose my vehicle, so that won’t change. Rent is still going to be what it is, and no, I live in the cheapest place around. Student loans aren’t dischargeable so they will remain. So, I need either a rich uncle to leave me some money or someone to take pity and do a “go fund me” campaign to help out a short, fat, and bald guy get back on his feet after losing everything and pretty much-exhausting everything to get to this point…
The world is cruel and shitty and it seems that those of us who try to live right seem to be stepped on for the others to get out of the pig pen.
Contrary to what I have been writing, I’m ok, I am just angry and still hurt even after almost 4 years. I am mad at myself for believing I finally had someone who truly loved me. I don’t know if she ever did, more or less she must have felt trapped. I refuse to “be happy” because my love for her should make me happy that she seems happy. That is about the dumbest shit I have ever heard.  I’m happy that her “arrangement” has been beneficial to my sons, even if I have been totally left out of everything. Also, how lately, it’s been like I am in an undertow and fighting to just make it to the surface only to be pulled back. I’ve been told that God doesn’t give you more than you can handle, but I think he turned his back and forgot to turn off the shit-giving machine…LOL

Hey Lady,
I did this yesterday for another, but I thought I should do one for you. You’ve been like a best friend since your first comment on my rambles. From that first one you made me feel like at least one person cares, a thing that’s been hard for me to believe myself.
I want to apologize that I had a meltdown and rage-quitted Facebook, again. It was nice to be able to communicate with you at the moment. I try to keep up with your and others’ diaries, but sometimes I just don’t know what to say. Obviously, I have enough issues figuring it out myself. I used to be that person though.
Although I know there are issues, it appears as though you have a wonderful family and enjoy life even with the ups and downs. You have inspired me to try to get more active. No bike yet, but I do try to waddle with my knees to get some steps in.
When you do leave comments, it gives me some hope that there are people out there that will and can care about me even though it seems like no one does here.
 
Thank you.

I’m a poor mama’s boy who just wanted to be liked, loved, and cared for. So much so I compromised my entire life to others so they can live theirs. Everyone knew how I love Patty and my little family and how I would beg, borrow, or steal to keep them happy and healthy, even at my own expense.
Yet, they all seem to have forgotten that when she left me. How tied to her and the kids I was. How it was my only world. Well, I should say, they remember enough to use it to guilt me to do things even when I am sick, tired, or even hurt.
Have a cancer scare? The operation leaves me stuck with a catheter and no ride home? I’m a horrible father because I can’t pay support or pick up the kids. Give up everything I had, everything I built for 20 years? I don’t care for the kids because I have no money and I am essentially lame from working a job where I have had to do the work of 3 people while the other 2 are either hurt or shouldn’t have to come in for 4 hours.
Or maybe, they are right and I am a narcissistic mama’s boy who had everything handed to him and I have never felt what real lose or sorrow is.

I can’t get this thought out of my mind. How people tell others to “live their best life” no matter what, which in general sounds terrific. You do only have one.
Unfortunately, many of the “best life” livers leave broken pieces behind or build their “best” off another’s effort and take all the credit.
My “best” life is one of these victims. I can’t live my best life anymore. I can live a decent one, but a best? No. Most of what would have been a “best life” were ripped away and more or less given to someone else who doesn’t deserve it. IDK, maybe he does. Maybe I should go out there and destroy someone else’s family, fuck up mine and other’s lives, and cap it off with a drug and weapons arrest, but as long as I can convince people I found God, everyone will find me better than a man who did everything right.
I’m sorry, I just do not understand any of this. 1 +1 = 2, that I understand? Scumbag falls into another man’s life? No.

I woke up in pain, but that’s not the issue. I waddled around the apartment and started cleaning, wishing I could do more, but knowing I can only do so much with a can of glass cleaner and dish soap.
I decided to make soup today and went with my last $10 to Tops to get ingredients. Cheated the produce scale and managed to find discounted meat and crossed my fingers that I had broth at home, I did.
Buy, that’s not what ruined my day. What did was once again seeing the couples and families shopping. The couple that look like her and him. The single lady I say hi to that looks anywhere but at me.
Come home wanting to talk to someone and knowing I really don’t have anyone too. OK, there is one, but I can’t do it. She is a girl I knew a long time ago and honestly I never thought too much of her. She’s a decent human and all, but there’s never been anything there. Well, she contacted through Facebook,  because when I am on it I scream at the world, and she offered an ear. That lasted 1 conversation. It then turned into an obsession where she is constantly contacting me not to ask about me, but to tell me how she has had it so much worse. I lost a marriage, she lost a marriage plus… I have a cough, she has full on covid. Now it’s become yet one more “guilt” Colby thing if I do not immediately answer her.
If my head was screwed on normal I would understand something out of all this, but I started with a jumbled up shit storm of a head and this is only making things worse. I feel like I need to please everyone or I can’t be right. I re

It’s Halloween and that means the start of the holiday season where once again I am left out of it all. Obviously, it isn’t the same if I was to just show up at the ex’s house to “hang out” with the kids. I don’t get to carve pumpkins with them anymore or help with costumes. It’s just the start of me for the 4th time attempting to “change my way of thinking” because I am no longer a family man. There’s someone else in that place and I am just a weekend Dad. Holidays for me now are like taking the kids to see the same movie they’ve seen once before. Yeah, it’s still fun, but the real excitement isn’t there anymore.
I cannot believe I am still grieving over my lost marriage and that life. Unlike a lot of other men in the same spot, I haven’t been able to recover anything since. I haven’t been able to save money, bills are out of control, and my credit score is in single digits.  The state of dating is such that I am totally undesirable to anyone. What can I bring?
You would also think that I would be included in friends and family holiday stuff. Nope. In fact, my sister and brother-in-law are hanging out with my ex and her new husband tonight. How fucked up is that?

It’s dreary and rainy today. Just gray and sad. It’s making me miss my family life. At least then I had something to look forward to. Hanging with the kids, snuggling with my wife. I am fighting the useless urge to write Patty and say a bunch of heartfelt things to either be ignored or told that I am harassing her. Short of that, I have this, OD, and just like in real life I am talking to myself. Like slamming against a wall expecting a different result.
I have no urge to go home and clean, although my place could use some attention. Nor do I want to go home and cook. I don’t want to go home, but I have nowhere else to go.
I am back to tearing myself apart trying to understand what I did. What have I put out into the world that caused me all this loss and heartbreak?

Why does the one thing currently in my life that sort of gives me an escape from things now have to be such a shitty thing?
WORK
It’s not enough that I know all the roles.
It’s not enough that I never hear one word of appreciation or thanks.
It’s not enough that I have had to do 2 people’s jobs after my coworker busted 5 ribs and somehow got the company to pay, even though his drunk ass fell off a bar stool.
It’s not enough that I alone for the last month have unloaded each and every delivery alone when it’s almost too much for 2 people.
It’s not enough that I have had to work every day while the others have had days off either because of injury or obligations.
It’s not enough that I have to work every sale that walks in the door and deal with any caller they deem “undesirable” because they either can’t be bothered or just choose not to.
I make the same as the woman who is the title clerk and cashier and less than the “broken ribs” guy who actually gets a small commission on everything sold here, but I do both their jobs and then some. I can’t “rock the boat” as far as asking for a raise and I am absolutely in no position to find another job.
 
I realize that people face adversity every day, some worse than me, but it feels as if I have nothing in my life that I control or has gone right for years. For every 1 good thing, several balls drop. I’m just tired and I really hate myself for this. All of it. Maybe it is all my fault. I ruined my relationships, family, budget, and employment. I took the path of least resistance and wholeheartedly stepped off the cliff. There comes a point when you put yourself in a bad position where you hear that little voice telling you to stay calm but all you can do is panic because there really isn’t a way you can save yourself and you need someone’s help. They just choose to ignore the call.

No one wants to tell me what I did or didn’t do, but they all want to give me shit about it. I guess I’m just stupid. I don’t understand how you can be with someone, have kids with someone, and make a life with someone for 20 years and then just drop them from your life as if they never existed.
Three therapists and two psychiatrists have yet to answer that.
I know I made mistakes, but u did everything I should have and yet I am the one paying the price. I stayed loyal and I am the lonely one. I loved with all my heart and I’m so desperately heartbroken.
I can’t do this. I can’t move on in life feeling this way and not even getting any sort of reassurance from anyone I hold dear. Is it wrong to want someone to show they care? I get the whole pull yourself up and move on thing, but all I want is for someone that has any sort of stake in all of this, to acknowledge my pain and attempt to help me feel differently.
Maybe an invite for dinner or a visit. Stop by for coffee and just talk about nonsense. Something. Almost 4 years and not one single friend or sibling has just showed up unannounced to just hang out. Not one call or text to say they’re thinking about me.
It’s really becoming very difficult to find reasons anymore. I’ll never have the life I wanted or get back the one I made. No one wants anything to do with me other than those of you who are securely “online”. The only people who talk to me are customers that want something and therapists I pay to talk.
Honestly, no one would be lost without me. I figure the kids would miss me to a point, but not in some “our lives are lost” way. I guess I wouldn’t want them to feel like that though.
It’s hard to face the facts that I have never been really loved or needed. No one has ever been lost for years, let alone days, without me as I have them. I can’t see a future anymore. All I see is the next bill, the next shoe dropping, the next screw up, and the next let down.
I won’t commit suicide, but I really don’t want to live anymore.

344,https://www.opendiary.com/m/newt316/over-the-last-night-6161213/,2022-11-07,Over the last night,"
Maybe I ask too much of the world. I’m not stupid, I realize other people have their own issues and dramas. I’m tired of always losing my dreams and accomplishments. Yes, I know win and lose, yadda yadda yadda.
But I see old friends and acquaintances and how they got to raise their families and now are enjoying that time after when they can sit back and live life together. Not me though. I will have to work until I die. No loving retirement with the one I love, enjoying grandkids, and looking forward to holidays. Now I live with the guilt that I can’t give my kids a fun family holiday visit. My kids have to grow up with a father who can barely feed them on their visits.
I give up trying to understand it anymore, I’m just a loser. Both in name and actions. All my relationships have ended with them all leaving me for another, their “true love”. I’ve only been a placeholder who they have mistakenly had children with. It hurts when I tell my children to love and respect their mother when I know in my heart that she wishes every day that I didn’t father them. I mean, she appreciates that my family gave her a home, and treated her as a daughter and sister (still do), and essentially assured her a fulfilled life.
I, like other men in my position, have to live with the fact, true or not, that we are the cause of everything. I did everything, but I didn’t. I loved totally, but I didn’t. All the lies told by her and him are true, even though they are not.
I’m sorry but being a 51 yr old man having to start over fresh in life while having to still pay for a past that others destroyed is not the same as a 51 yr old woman who leaves or gets left but still has a home and the comfort of her children and friends. I’m tired of people saying they understand and how they went through this too when they really haven’t. I realize I could’ve and should’ve fought in the divorce and I know I can’t win either way about how I didn’t. If I fought, I was the fuck who took the home away from the kids. The one who made life difficult for his ex and kids. I didn’t and now I am the stupid fuck who gave up everything. The one who doesn’t care because I didn’t fight it.
It’s horrible, but I am starting to think I should just drop everyone from my life, even the boys. I love them, but they would be so much better off. They speak like him now. They spout “news” with his viewpoints. I get called his name at least twice when they visit. I listen to what they did together and how they all went here or there. That’s the hardest thing to deal with. The Fact is that everyone treats me as if I am some degenerate scumbag because I can’t hand Patty hundreds of dollars for the kids. I can’t pay for this and that. I can’t do this or that. You see, everyone has enough common sense to feel water and know that it is wet or fire and know that it burns, but for some reason, they can’t get it wrapped around their heads that I left with nothing, asked for nothing, have to pay almost just as many bills without another there to help me. I don’t have a paid-off home and I pay more rent than what the mortgage would have been if there was one.  My utilities are almost double living in a paper-thin apartment than a home I know is weatherized to the hilt. I don’t have children to claim so not tax return or all the “free” money that has been handed out over the last 2 years. Nope, all they see is a man who can’t hand over his check to an ex who will tell everyone and their brother that she just can’t afford things. Of course, she says this while sitting on her new outdoor or living room furniture in a house currently being renovated in between the conversations about the weekend in DC or the waterpark visit.

345,https://www.opendiary.com/m/newt316/alone-1020-6161388/,2022-11-08,Alone,"
The thought came to me today that I really want to be alone. I want to be alone to hate the world for what it’s done to me. Two failed attempts to have a family of my own, lost love, a daughter’s death, and so on. I know who I am and I am fine with it, other people still tell me to “discover” myself and love myself, but I don’t love myself, I live with myself. Every accomplishment I may have made was for nothing. I did what the generations before told me to do. I loved, I worked hard, and I stayed loyal and I lost it all or had to give it away for the sake of others. No one ever gave up something like that for me. My parents were already 3 kids in, I didn’t make them have to change, they already did. Neither ex-wife gave up anything. They kept the house, the kids, and the life.
I’ve been almost everyone’s sacrificial lamb. I have been screwed over, cheated on, lied to, and left by everyone that has come into my life since 1989, all to get what they wanted and to take what I had. Not one of them has ever apologized or even sympathized with me. They did this and blame me for it all.
Am I a saint? No. But I am not a cheater, constant liar, or abuser, but you would never know it by what they say about me, and the people who truly knew me, listen and believe the crap. I can’t even go back to the town I grew up in for my kid’s concert without dirty looks.
So yeah, I’m alone, and deep down inside I choose to be because I don’t think I could honestly take another heartbreak without becoming postal to the world. It would be so much easier if I was better off financially though. That worry just is the gateway to all the other worries.

I’m empty.
I’ve loved and cried, hurt, and waited for so long, there’s nothing left. I’m like a dried thing that has gone far beyond reviving.
For 4 years I have hoped for someone that I love and held in my heart to just come to me and be there. A call or visit to “see how I am and/or if they could do something for me” as I have done for them before. I got calls, ” How are you? I need a favor…” “I know it’s hard, but could you do???” Never just an “I’m concerned, can I help” call or visit though, always an I need something from you one.
From day one everyone has treated me as though I am just an attention whore who has never had a bad thing happen. A spoiled brat who was given everything in life. I lost Patty and my family for reasons I will never know and she was given the victim card and I was told “shit happens”. I was broken to a point where I had to start completely over with nothing and I am treated as if I have the life of Riley.
My depression is a joke to others. Their hurt and sadness are real, but mine is just a big “notice me” attention-grabbing selfish thing. They have all treated me this way to the point where I am now believing everything is my fault. I don’t know what or how I did it, but it’s all me and I cannot do anything to fix it or myself. I am told what I should think and do and any time I “do for myself” I am wrong, yet the answer to my calls for help is always, “love yourself and do for yourself.”
I will never love myself. Sorry, it’s not going to happen. I like me and I can deal with me, but that’s the best you’re going to get. I know other men in my position, alone and sad hoping to find someone to spend time with, but they are also better off financially and socially. They have friends that care and have the means to have hobbies and go out to see the world. What I am saying is they are not a prisoner like I am. I work but don’t make enough. I have health issues that limit me. I have constant guilt that leads me. My dreams and hopes are used against me. Patty knows me better than I know myself. She knew my fears, hopes, and dreams and used each of them to destroy me and hamper my recovery. So do others like my sister and “best friends”. It all just seems as though the only way forward is to do what they want, hide in my shell, or just flat-out end it all. The funny thing is though, I don’t believe anyone of them would even give a shit either way.

I had a whole tirade I wrote, but who cares. I mean, nothing will change.
I can’t wrap my head around living in this world anymore. I don’t make enough money to not care about anything or anyone, but even if I did, I constantly feel guilty that my actions or non-actions effect others who never considered me at all. Did Patty, who knew all my pain and hurt for years, consider me at all by doing it all to me herself? No and to this day even with living with my children and in my family’s home, she could careless about me. I sit here feeling bad because I can’t do more for people who could careless for me.
I don’t know how to move on in life. Who to be? What to be? What I can only be at 51, overweight, and bald?
It doesn’t matter that I have love in my heart or that I would be truthful, moral, and caring. I don’t believe I’m a fugly mess, sure I would feel better with a head of hair and a better body, but I’m not hideous. That doesn’t matter. I can’t spoil a woman. Strike 1. I lost everything and am back to zero. Strike 2.
There is someone I really like. She’s girl next door pretty. Not a pompous type. She has kids. Went through a divorce. Saw the bad side of the “perfect guy”, but I’m not good enough. Oh she cares, says so on my sad FB posts. She’s encouraged my “moving on”, and tells me how “nice” I am, but obviously not for her. Yeah, I understand before you all say that she’s not the one, no one is I think. I’m not good for anyone. I’ve screwed up all the chances the world has given me and now I am SOL.

The kids are gone and I get pulled back to my reality. No one to sit next to and hold hands watching them be kids. I’m not allowed to have that in my life I suppose. I did nothing to lose it, but it’s gone and never coming back.
I can’t enjoy my later years because I was ruined by life’s little tests. I am so far from being secure it’s not funny and it really feels like I may never be.
What do you give up when you’ve list everything? What can you sacrifice when it’s all gone? I live on a shoe string budget now. It’s freezing in my place, but I can’t afford to turn the heat on right now.
I just want to talk to someone,  but there’s no one to call or text. I know what people would say anyway, ” you have to get over this.” If they would be part of my life they would see I  trying and I have been for over 2 years. I just need someone, someone who cares enough not to wait for me to call. Someone who goes through with the promises that they care.
It’s hard when you have time. Time to reminisce like I have. Yes there are good memories, but I’ve come to realize that most of the last 35 years of my life were empty. Except for my children, I really have nothing. The failed relationships. The missed opportunities. The lost life.
What I need is to step out of life for 2 or 3 weeks. A health reset. Figure out medications and actual helpful therapy, but I can’t restart again. I can’t lose my job. I can’t find what little hope I have now again. I feel so worthless right now.
All I want right now is to have Patty laying next to me. Just up against me. Nothing ever bothered me when I was like that with her. Now I can’t get a reassuring word from a friend or family member. Strangers seem to go out of their way avoiding me or give me shitty looks for attempting a conversation. I’m sorry but I am well passed the “God is testing you” limit. Now it just seems personal. I’ve never had this much trouble to make a friend or even have a girlfriend. Now I am treated as a skunk. Judged and avoided by everyone.

349,https://www.opendiary.com/m/newt316/bitter-132-6162342/,2022-11-15,Bitter,"
I had a revelation last night. That happens a lot when you’re constantly alone with your thoughts. As much as I miss my life as it used to be and the people in it, I am very bitter toward everyone who gets to have what I so wanted for myself. Doesn’t matter if it’s in the real world or on a television show. An old friend of mine, one of those who left me standing with my troubles, got remarried for the 4th time. Yup, 4 times. He pissed away 3 other marriages and families, but there were 50+ people all congratulating him on Facebook. Don’t get me wrong, it’s great for him, but I have no understanding of why the world gives a man who never put any effort into being a father or a decent person countless chances and opportunities and I am bitter. They say that I shouldn’t be bitter and be happy for people that find love and stuff, but why? Why should I be happy for a person who sucked me dry of friendship when he needed one, but couldn’t spare one moment for me in the last 4 years to at least “cheer me up”? Why should I be happy for my ex because she has found stability in life by destroying mine? I don’t understand this whole process.
I’m not jealous, I’m bitter. I hate that it feels like for the last 30+ years of my life all my efforts, sacrifices, blood, sweat, and tears were for others. Everything I built and fought for was just handed over to someone else. Yeah, I’m sure the ex’s new husband brought something to the table, but it was my table. He got a home, the love of my ex, and influence over 4 beautiful children. He has my possessions, my tools, my BBQ, my lawn mower, my snow blower, and everything a man would want. My remarried friend isn’t much different. Here is a guy who has doped his way through life and then “poof” life gives him a relationship with a woman who is a well-off professional. She owns a home and makes enough so he can sit around and play the PS5 which she bought him in between joints. I know what you’re thinking too, no she is younger than him and not a hideous “no one will love me so I put up with it” type.
I do realize that I do this all to myself. I create the “issues” that I feel are unfair. The only nefarious things going on are all my doing. No one has ever set out to “fuck” me over. It is me making the guilt I suffer from. I’m just bitter because I have put all the effort into the world, the love, and all of me and I have nothing to show for any of it, and everyone around me gives me shit about it. I am sure that there are people who have it even worse, but I don’t know them, I know the ones who tell me they had troubles.
But did they?
Did Nichole, the cute short brunette who can’t sneeze without it hitting any number of people who have lined up to help her really have the same issue? When all of her friends and family fell over themselves for her, was she really feeling so alone she would rather be dead? Did these “hard days” occur between the parties or the dates?
Sean, did he feel so left out and depressed when people went out of their way to give him a 50th birthday party after he “left” his last wife because she was mean and told him to get a job? Should I listen to his “best life” advice as he constantly gets helped up?
Maybe Jodi, who tells a good tale of infidelity by a man she really didn’t want, who left her, giving her the house and the children, maybe she understands my predicament? I mean I lost everything and had no home for over 3 weeks and was left completely alone and abandoned by friends and family, it’s exactly the same thing and I should just “get over it” like they all did, hey, life goes on, look how fast thing became better for them, right?
I just have a piss poor attitude, that’s all. I should see the couple who worked through their problems and smile because it is possible, but just not for me. I should be happy for the person who never did a single thing in his life but has a loving wife and friends who will do anything for him. I should admire the pretty woman who lost her job because the business closed and had a jerky boyfriend, but within a day’s time had several men helping her and friends giving her a room to stay in for her to get back on her feet. You see, all I am missing is hope. If I would have just believed more and prayed harder.

I had a different entry written, but I erased it. It’s just helping anymore, nothing is. In the last 4 years, I have climbed mountains only to summit and realize I have even more to climb. I realize we all do somewhat the same thing in life, but I’m done. I have reached a point where although it’s doable, I need help. I’ve done the meds, the therapy, the prayers, the breathing, the meditating, and the acceptance and absolutely nothing has seemed to change. No new (physically near) friends, old ones never came back, all the efforts to repair relationships I didn’t break have been for nothing.
I’m ok with me, I just don’t want to live a life alone and that is what the world seems to be pushing onto me. I realize I am to blame for everything. I didn’t do enough to keep Patty happy and secure. I was a shit brother and friend. I get it.

I don’t matter to anyone. Years spent with my ex have all seemed to be washed from memories. Everything I did for friends, is gone. As soon as my marriage ended so did my family. My sister just wants to be the “super” aunt and rub it in my face that she would be a much better parent if she had been given the chance.
Gone are the days when “holidays” were special. I haven’t felt the “spirit” in 4 years and probably never will again. There was a time the family would come together with food and fun and now it’s a cold apartment and no greetings.
I don’t know any other way to live. For the first 48 years of my life, this is what I had, how I lived. For the last 4 years, it’s been nothing. Yeah, I get the kids a day or two afterward, but this isn’t the life I wanted them to grow up in. I don’t even know how to fake it.
I really can’t understand how these people I have loved and cared for over decades could have just given up on me as they did. I don’t know why when they all knew how sensitive I was and how deeply I cared for things, they just brushed me off and said “shit happens” and ” I don’t care to hear it” to me? What am I supposed to do?
Death is one thing. When you lose a loved one to death the finality of it is somehow comforting. This isn’t. I lost important people in my life although I can still see them, read what they write, and hear what they say all the while, they treat me as if there was nothing between us. I mean I was there for my ex for every doctor visit, every birth, and every happy or sad moment, but I get treated and talked to like all I ever did was sit and poke her with a stick for 20 years. She won’t even talk to me about the day any one of our kids was born like I just donated at the local sperm bank and I figured out that she “used” my sample.
It made sense with my first ex. We fought constantly. She lied and cheated. Hell, she even slapped the shit out of me for no reason one night. But, Patty, there were absolutely no issues being thrown around. Sure, in retrospect, I can understand it was a money security thing, but there was never a lack of love. As I have said countless times, the day she ended it all, we woke up, held each other discussed dinner, hugged and kissed, and we both said “I love you”. Then in the late afternoon without warning it was gone as if the last 20 years never happened. Everyone and I mean everyone, acted as if there was never a marriage between me and her. People literally looked at me as I was sobbing and inconsolable and told me “get over yourself” and “if you’re going to be like that, I don’t have time for you”. Do you know that I never was hugged or held and told “it will be ok. We’ll get you through this” at all, ever, to this day…
And now. I am always wrong. Always the bad guy. Not one person considers I may have an issue or problem, they just go right to “Colby’s a fuck who doesn’t care.” I pay over $700 in rent for a paper-thin walled 3-room apartment. The last few days have been cold and it’s only getting worse. My furnace has not stopped running since I turned it on 2 days ago. Not one break at all. It has never warmed the place up to the temperature I set it to, which isn’t the warmest either. That’s gas and electricity running constantly. My “budgeted” bills are too high to pay let alone what this will do. I pay 2 car payments, 1 I own and the other from my marriage that “who the fuck knows” where it is. $400 for one, $275 for the other. Every check has close to $350 taken for taxes and insurance. Insurance that still costs way too much for co-pays and prescriptions. Finally, I pay $200 a week for child support. What does this all mean? It means I live on $50 a week with no savings. It means that when I get my kids I blow what money I have on food for them. It means we don’t go anywhere because I don’t have gas too. IT MEANS, I am a no caring, shit, SOB of a father because I can’t take them this weekend… IT MEANS, I once again have to hear from my ex and my sister that EVERYONE has bills. YES, but not everyone has another person’s income helping, a paid-off home worth $80,000, several large Covid checks over the last couple of years, and huge tax refunds because you refuse to allow me to claim just one.
I’m just tired of always being wrong. I’m tired of having to rely on the kindness of strangers to feel like I am not wrong.

And just like that I am put into my place.
Like my life that has fallen and broken apart over the last few years, so is this winter storm I’m stuck in.
Just like the people who are in relationships and the “pretty” ones who have several people there to take out a splinter, so is this situation. I am stuck in my apartment. I am physically unable to walk through the deep snow and can only shovel so much until I have a raging sciatica attack. Yes, I am a medical mess. Could I crawl through the snow, sure but by the time I get to the front I will be in the midst of hypothermia.
So why the comparison? Well as said, just like the people who throw life advice at me that have never “really” been a 51 yr old slightly over weight, bald, and broke man, they are also telling me how to sit and be patient about the snow.
You see, they can get out. They have food and company. They are not stuck as I am, but they went through the same storm, so of course they know everything I’m going through.
I was supposed to get my oldest from college today for the holiday break. Was the only time I would see him, but nope, once again I will be the huge disappointment everyone makes me out to be.
“I would do everything I could to get out” says the guy with his own home and snow blower and several friends that came to help. Silly me, I forgot how easy it is.

Yup. I’m snowed in, out of everything,  and just got a call that I am being laid off.
It’s going to be a fucking rough night.
Of course I have no one to talk to so I call my sister. First I get, don’t tell the boys. Secondly I get the well get out there pep talk. What I don’t get is any compassion whatsoever. Why should I?
I’ve reached my limit of these “tests”. The “plan”. I’m essentially screwed. I have zero savings, just got screwed out of a Christmas bonus, 2 weeks before I would have been given it, and unemployment will barely keep me in this apartment I am stuck in.
I can’t drink myself to death because I have no liquor or for that fact anything. I guess I have to turn of the heat, can’t afford it and start thinking about what things I will have to leave behind.
I’m sure Patty will smile and say something about how I can never hold a job, but so much for the safety net I built for 20 years.  Homeless for Christmas.  Here I thought life couldn’t get worse.

My life had turned to shit in the last 4 years. I went from happy, secure family man to a broke loser whose life just keeps getting worse. Seriously there are so many things happening all at once, I can’t deal.
I can be my kids Dad, but I can never raise them how I always dreamed I could. I see all the holiday commercials and shows and they literally rip my heart out.
I’m such a failure. People think I don’t try hard enough or do enough, but I do constantly and these are the results. I wish I could find the finality in me to just end it all. I fight to stay here for my kids, but I really don’t know what to do. I can’t afford this apartment and it’s one of the cheapest around. I finally after 35 years had a job that paid a decent amount and my life revolves around it, how can I do it now? I can’t wind up living in my car again. Worse thing is I can’t afford the meds and I really don’t look forward to that all going to shit.

Another sunny day here that I can only enjoy from the window or the 5 foot clearing I manages to make outside. I’m sure by my usual posts that you all see me as positive and outgoing so, when I say I feel completely defeated it will come as a shock.
I never could have imagined my body could hurt like it does right now. The arthritis in my knees and hands. The sciatica all down my right leg. The just overwhelming feeling like something is seriously wrong with me coupled now with the I can’t afford my medicine or even Doctor visits in a weeks time. The hopelessness of not being able to dig myself out of this place to get to my truck and go to the store let alone get to the parking lot if for some reason someone would pick me up stuff.  Across from my building in another set of apartments. These house “special needs” folks who are independent enough to live on their own but have aids coming over several hours a day. There’s a clear path to their door. That sounds horrible of me to say. I’m glad that people care enough for them to help them maintain a regular day to day.
I’m not looking forward to the social services BS that will have to eventually come because of my job loss. I managed to apply for Unemployment but had to call because for some reason the website says I am using a VPN and I am absolutely sure I am not and besides its using my cell and data. Erie county is the worse social services experience one can ever have. I’m hope it doesn’t come to having to apply for food stamps, HEAP, or insurance and having to negotiate getting into the city and finding a parking place that doesn’t cost more than the actual benefits. I’ve never met a kind caring social services representative. I’m sure they are out there. I just don’t know what I can apply for in the meantime between things.
I don’t want to start over again. When I got the last job I was still able to go above and beyond and over the last few years I was able to adopt ways to still do it and not break myself. Now, IDK. I’ve never been a professional in anything so chances are the next job will have to be more physical than my body is going to allow. I’m not disabled but I know there’s absolutely no way I can stand or work physically for 5 days 40 hours.
I guess this is it. This is how my life will finish up on Earth. 20+ years of fumbling around with just memories of being someone at one time and how what little dreams and hopes I had were dashed for other’s dreams and hopes. Living with the fact that when I needed people no one really cared but gladly accepted all I did for them. How I built a life, home, family,  and future for someone who never did anything but take advantage of a woman having issues of faith in her marriage and now I have become the bad guy who just ruined everything and everyone and I am getting what I deserve because of it.

356,https://www.opendiary.com/m/newt316/thinking-726-6163313/,2022-11-23,Thinking,"
I’ve been rethinking my life recently. Being shut in does that I guess, the unemployment isn’t helping either.
The economy sucks and I am legitimately scared what tomorrow will bring. I am so screwed at the moment it’s making me physically sick. I honestly don’t have anyone here I can ask for help. Unfortunately I found that out over the last few years with all the divorce crap.
I’m overweight, physically broken ( my knees are so shot it’s effected how I walk and what I can do), and seriously lonely. I have done the counciling and learned what to do and nothing is really helping when the problem is me. I fight myself every second of the day. I don’t know what to do anymore. I really don’t want to start over again and that’s just pulling me back to the bad place I was in the months after Patty gave up on me.
I realize that you can’t go back and that if you could get it all back it won’t be the same, but all I want is what I had. I want to wake up tomorrow and start making Thanksgiving dinner for my wife and kids and my brothers and sister’s family. I want to sit next to Patty and hold hands like we did looking at the joy on our kids faces.  Now I’m sitting here alone, worried I don’t have enough for them when they come on Friday. Knowing that I can’t go all out because i just got the last paycheck and rent is due next week. Possibly the last time I can pay it.
What am I going to do? How do I find a job where they will be totally understandable that I am essentially lame? A job where they give a 51yr old man a chance. A overweight, bald, non professional man a chance. Before you say that it is easy and I am blowing things out of proportion,  I have went through this 3 years ago at 48 and went through Hell to get the job I just lost. The job I busted my ass to keep from losing its NYDMV privileges. The job where I trained the woman who is still there and not “laid off”. The job where I did 2 people’s jobs for 2 months.
IDK. I guess I will have to just live.
So what do I need to do? I have to figure out how to continue my meds and doctors visits. I have to try and lose weight without a lot of physical activities I can do because of my knees. I have to make peace with the fact that I will never have the family I wanted and somehow accept that I can only be a part time Dad whose children are being raised by another man. I have sell stuff and donate the rest so if the worse happens I can learn to love without it all. Maybe find something along a bus route or close enough I can waddle to when they come and take the truck. Not sure if bankruptcy will help. I’ve made the calls. Unemployment, HEAP, creditors.
 
I hate this

Happy Thanksgiving. Unlike me, I hope you are all enjoying your family and friends. I sat down today and put everything in front of me. I don’t know how I am going to do this. I can pay my rent for December and then… who knows. Obviously I can’t call creditors today, so I am canceling things I can do online.
I closed the pay pal account and canceled reoccurring charges, one being Open Diary. Yes its only $4, but I have to learn to do without. It’s funny, I’m sure Patty will make a nasty comment even with knowing I went out of my way for her to never have to worry about money issues. My sister will start annoying me with calls and texts about how easy it is to find a job, never once having lost one and always being handed hers. Her husband will say shit too, eventhough he was handed a living from his father.
No one will offer help but will tell me how I am doing something wrong. I busted my ass all year and I will be screwed out of my Christmas bonus which would have been given to me in a week.
Well, fuck me all to Hell.
I have a few weeks left before OP locks me out, so hopefully I will have some good news, if not thank you all and hopefully I will be back in a few months and you will still be here.

I took my son back to college today. He goes to Alfred State which is a little over 80 miles from me. I don’t think I could have driven any slower then I did to have time with him.
Am I a good man? A good father? IDK. The world and “my people” have left me feeling worthless. 80 miles, in the dark, and just my thoughts. It’s all fault, isn’t it? If I was a better husband or friend or brother or person, I wouldn’t be in this spot. I would still be married and have had enjoyed Thanksgiving with my family. At this moment I would be sitting holding Patty and just talking about things. Instead I am in a cold bleak apartment where the sounds of my kids have all gone silent since they are hone or at college.
I wasn’t good enough to keep my job. I wasn’t important enough to people here who left me stranded for 5 days while I literally watched them dig out empty apartments.
I don’t feel like I am important to anyone or anything anymore. People shook me out of their lives so quick and permanently. Even Patty, didn’t waste any time and now acts and treats me like we have no history.
I have always been good at failing. Great at losing no matter what. Having almost everything that made me happy and complete taken from me although I did everything right. I’m all for karma. You treat people or a person like shit, you should lose them in your life, but you essentially worship someone, unselfishly giving everything you can for them the last thing you would or should expect is to lose not just them, but friends and family too.
I don’t know why I write anymore. I’m not feeling the “therapy” from it. I feel like I’m doing everything I should to be better and everyone is ignoring me or just doesn’t care.

I have never rediscovered my love of cooking since the divorce. Hell, sometimes I can’t go shopping because I see something and I begin to tell myself “Patty would love this” and like that my shopping is ruined.
Now I have spent a few months as a chef apprentice way way back in 1989 and I have done line cooking and prep cooking. I made entire Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners for my family, but the one thing I never did was cook for one. One lonely man who would rather starve or spend money he doesn’t have at a restaurant. Frozen TV dinners have lost their luster and sometimes it’s a bother to cook Ramen or even Campbell’s soup. So it’s usually chips or deli meat (which both are probably killing me.)
I miss cooking for my family, in an actual kitchen, with all the right stuff. Now I have a 5′ kitchenette and 2′ of counter space. A microwave and the smallest electric oven in the world. Seriously,  a typical cookie sheet doesn’t fit in it.
I know why I’m still over weight, chips and shit food, but I don’t just eat all day.

BLAH

I’ve probably wrote this about a thousand times, but here we go again.
I can’t seem to find a happy balance in my life anymore. It doesn’t help I am now unemployed, that only adds to the stress and anxiety. The one person I seem to be able to talk to, my oldest, can’t know that I lost my job and to everyone else it’s “oh well”
I once again tried to talk to my sister only to be shut down. Friends are all gone and I just got played by a woman for money. My fault, but sometimes fat, older bald guys with nothing going right in life just want to believe.
I hate that I don’t have anything. I have an apartment that just went up $35 a month, a truck just taunting me that it will shit the bed while I still owe 10k, and now no job.
Is it wrong of me to just want to live on unemployment for a couple months? Try to “discover” who I am meant to be other than everyone’s punchline. Try as I may, I just can’t get past being a loser and a failure.
Patty could have tried and if she was determined to divorce could have been more civil and caring. That sounds stupid, but you would expect an abusive horrible marriage to end like ours did, but ours was nothing like that. Maybe she held resentments,  but she never told me, just smiled and acted as she loved me up until the morning of the day. I am some sort of pariah now, not just to her, but everyone I considered important and eventhough I should just say fuck them, I can’t get past the why. I don’t care what people say, when you’re in a position like I am, you need someone’s help. Sure, if I walked away with money saved and the ability to pick right up in life, but I didn’t and I am paying constantly for it. I get a job and save the business, train another to do my position and then take on sales and various troubleshooting things. I bust my ass for apparently no one because I am the one laid off. Not then who could easily retire tomorrow or the 2 income woman who could snap and have a new job in days. Me, the loser, the broken man who pissed away 30 years of living.
Oh, how I wish that some money could fall from the sky. I could get my knees fixed, pay off the anchor car loan, and maybe get a better place near the boys where I could see them more then a 1 or 2 day weekend. I’ve seen it happen for shitty people.  My friend Tony for instance. Quit paying rent at the trailer park he lived years back. Was evicted, but they pulled his trailer 2 days before the agreed date. Guess who got 16k and didn’t pay back rent? Or how he went into corrections and quit for 10 years, went back, got time served and back pay. Or my other friend Sean who never has done a note worthy thing since 1994, just happens to fall into a relationship with a woman who is a professor and sugar mommas him. WTF. All the years of honesty, loyalty, and ass busting and I am on the edge of welfare or disability.

Once again I’m sitting here thinking about what life was like 4 years ago, knowing I have to stop if I am ever going to survive. They only one I could talk to to fix it, is the one person who refuses to talk to me and essentially caused all of this.
I really can’t believe I have to live like this and will more than likely die like this. Alone. I know there are men and women out there that would prefer this lifestyle and I get it, but I don’t  I don’t want to be a part time father, an ex-husband and an ex-friend.

Well just like every week, this day comes around. I take 1 or 2 or all of the boys back home and I immediately descend into a depression. I am having such a hard time seeing the forest through the trees. I just can’t see this “better” life everyone insists will come.
I’m unemployed, alone, and broke. I’ve mapped out a way to live atleast until February. Yeah, there’s jobs, but half I just can’t physically do because my knees being so shot and others inconveniently to far or way out of my knowledge to do. I’m 51 and it looks like I have to get a minimum wage job at a place I’m going to feel odd at. This isn’t right or fair. I’ve tried to live right, pretty much to the point I’ve been stepped over and stepped on by people so much better off than I am.
All I wanted was my wife and my boys living in our little house. Being able to enjoy the holidays through all of their smiles, but no, I’m here being treated as though I spent my life screwing people over and so unworthy of anyone. I never hear anyone. I have to call or text. Most of the time they go unanswered. I just can’t understand what it was that I did to the world. I never ever have been treated like I have for these last 4 years. I am a reasonable common sense person and I know that I did nothing to deserve this, but all the therapy, pills, and attempts to ” move on” and “get right” have come to nothing. Not around here anyway. I have some friends here (open diary), but I am stuck. I have no way of moving nor could I bring myself to because of my kids,  but thus is killing me. I am not the loner type. I have zero hobbies and zero interest in one. Every thing I do other than going to the bathroom comes with pros and cons, everything.
I get invited to a person’s home. Yeah, company, but I can’t afford to use the gas.
I got my kids Christmas presents. Now I am in debt and they’re pretty shitty gifts.
I’m hungry, but I have limited money for groceries, so no 2nd helpings. I’m cold, but I have to save on gas and just run the heater when it is dangerously cold.
I just really hate me right now, probably as much as all the people I keep batching about and longing for. How fucked up is that?

Almost daily I think of Patty, my boys, and others, but I wonder if they ever think of me as I do them?
Part of me hopes they never do, but another part is lost because they don’t.
Maybe I’m weak, maybe I was spoiled and given a life, never dealing with adversity.  Maybe I should just give up on people whether lived ones or strangers. I’m not allowed to love things or be comfortable. All my life I have just lost everything that has brought my joy and comfort.
I had the love of my life and a perfect family and it was ripped from me and everyone, everyone acts and treats me like it never existed. My kids don’t even remember me being there. I finally found a job I loved. I busted my ass every day at this job, giving it my all, all to be laid off days before the holidays and essentially told that they probably will never call me back.
All this shit has happened without much reason why, but somehow always being turned back on me as though I caused or asked for them.
I constantly get told about the “better things to come”. When? How much more shit do I have to take for this good? The job was a supposed a “good” thing because of the divorce,  a fresh start, and all it’s done was make it worse. I had a job lined up that truly could have given me a better life, but I chose this one. So, what’s that say about me?

Like an asshole I wrote Patty thinking that at the least she would have some sort of compassion for all the years and the boys. Nope.
I hate that I do this to myself constantly. I hate that I can’t stop caring.  I hate that people choose to not understand the situation they put me in and blame me for.
Do you think I enjoy not paying child support? Do think I enjoy that that is the only reason people see me as a father? Do you think I like constantly losing? Seriously,  tell me how a man with no close friends and absent siblings can survive with nothing and no help. I am on unemployment and I make to much for food stamps. I have yet to hear shit from HEAP and I am living in a 30° apartment because I can’t afford to run the heater.
As I have learned the past 4 years, I have no one to turn to and no where to go. I can’t afford therapy, just like I can’t afford heat and food. I am guilted constantly for being a “privileged” white man, but have zero to prove it.
I thought my ex coworkers cared, but I haven’t heard shit from them. Not even a how are you. Do I expect to much in this world or is it actually me, do people just hate me or despise me?
I just can’t keep sleeping to past time, but there’s nothing else. The jobs I seem to be qualified for will bring in less than unemployment.
I am really starting to hate myself on a whole new level.

I woke up to such a dreadful feeling today. I’m no one. I know I’m a father, but I feel nothing like one. I’m fat but I don’t want to be, yet I can not find the strength to do something about it. Infact, that’s how I feel about everything now. I want something different but I just can’t muster the willpower anymore.
I saw a video about family. More importantly the mother’s view of it. 99% of the time, they stay with the kids in the home. You see, I wanted Patty to be happy and I left for her, but somehow this has all been twisted into me giving up and walking away because I didn’t want things. Don’t you think if I could possibly afford to I would be just down the street available 24/7 for my boys? Why is it that I am shown as a absent father when it’s common knowledge that I gave her everything and was left penniless and broken? Somehow another man who she brought into all their lives the same day I left is some sort of hero because he’s there. It doesn’t matter how much I love my kids, it doesn’t matter how i guilt myself and torture myself everyday because of it. I can never be the father I had dreamed of since youth now. I can’t offer my boys a place to live, I barely have one. I can’t buy them things they need because I have nothing. All of this was caused by their mother’s betrayal,  but everyone blames me.
I have never been an “Alpha male” living for myself. I don’t even know how to be so selfish to put even my own flesh and blood to the side for my own needs.
I’m so afraid of new, of change. There’s been too much, too soon for me and I can’t handle it, but I have to because there’s nothing to fall back to. I think of the what it’s.
What if: The day Patty dropped the bomb my sister/friends were there for me instead of chastising me. Maybe they offered a couch for a week or two so I could get my head right instead of fumbling around lost having everything fall apart.
What if: These same people called Patty out on her shit instead of just accepting this right off the bat. Maybe she would have allowed herself to think that she should atleast try to work things out instead of being reassured that this was all right.
What if: I could have stayed as more than a weekend dad. Would Jonathan be as guarded as he is? Would Morgen still be a carefree kid? Would Ethan not be as attention needing? Would Caden’s autism be better? Would I still feel like I mattered to them all?
I can’t live thinking that everything will work itself out. Live with just letting the world go on this way. I wanted to be a family man. Raise my kids from babies into men, in a tight family. Then they would bring their families and I could watch my grandkids grow. Now, I’m on the outside and I don’t know if I’m even part of my own kids lives and plans.
I spent 48 years being part of a family. Holidays and birthdays coming together. Love and support. A place in the dark to always come to. Then, it all stopped for me, and just me and no one can even tell me why. So Patty stopped loving me, why did my friends leave, why did my siblings stop talking?

Ive gone way off topic, again. Thing is I just can’t stop feeling like a worthless piece of shit taking up space in other’s lives. If people do think or worry, it’s because I e made them feel guilty. I can honestly say that at no time has anyone come to me “out of the blue” expressing concern about hearing about what had happened. I don’t mean shit to people. I have gone months without a Facebook post or a call or message to people without so much as a check in from anyone.

My mind. I have absolutely no clue what has set off this latest bunch of depressed thoughts I’ve been dealing with this week.
Seriously it feels like my head is in a vice. I literally have had a throbbing headache along with all the “thoughts”. I generally don’t feel good all over. I want so much to go to the doctor, psychiatrist, and anyone else and just let them throw shit at me.
Is it wrong to just want someone to call or show up and tell me I’m OK? The call for help thing hasn’t worked since this all began. All I ever get is the feeling I am disturbing someone. As if I am screaming for help as something is attacking me and people are yelling at me for screaming.
I’m at a horrible point where I have moments of jealousy over the special needs residents on the other side of the complex because they have people there almost 24 hours a day. Yeah, that’s fucked up, I know, but that’s where I’m at.

I remember there was a pretty bad snow storm 33 years ago. It seemed bad for an 17yr expectant mother and her 18yr old husband. I thought the world couldn’t be any better than it was. We married the past July and I had never been so happy and it all came down to this.
Kayla came to use around 6:30am. She was beautiful and I felt so complete.
Patty’s birthday is the 23rd and how I loved to surprise her. I would rack my brain thinking of the best gift, the best dinner, all I wanted was to see her smile.
Christmas eve was the best. Just sitting with the boys and my wife, one secure little family. Preparing to sneak the presents in and eating half of the cookie and some milk. Watching as they laid down the reindeer food. Everything was right.
 
All that is gone now. I’m sitting on a shitty couch in a quiet apartment. No one has called or messaged me about Kaylas’s birthday, but I guess she’s been gone for 10 years, who cares. Tomorrow Patty will wake up with her new husband and the thought of how I would wake her on her birthday a forgotten memory and Christmas eve, well it will be same, just without me.
And this is how I live now…

So I’m one of those lucky western New Yorkers who is stuck inside because of the storm. Not that I have anywhere to go or have anything to do or even am allowed to with the driving bans.
What sucks is that 4 years ago, it wouldn’t bother me in the least. I had Patty and the boys and the world could burn down around me and I wouldn’t have given a fuck.
I haven’t received any messages or phone calls for the last few days and don’t expect them tomorrow either. No one is ever going to tell me what is was that I did or didn’t do to deserve this. I don’t fault the boys, they’re young. Of course it would be nice if the adults around them, Patty and my sister, would have them call me. Yes, I call them and I message them, but when you lose everything and not even your children seem to have noticed, it’s become a soul crushing thing that I can’t come back from.
I long for my mother and father. The only two people who cared enough to love me, to listen, and to assure me everything would be OK. Not the ok I get from people who pity me or feel for me through my writings, the ok from the loved ones and those who truly know me. Throughout all of this all I wanted from these people was to be told that I’m ok. That things will be ok.
What I’ve heard is:
Let it go. Get over it. Shit happens. If you are just going to talk about it, we don’t want to hear it. It gets better. It’s God’s plan.
Never once a hug. Never a “we’ll get you through”. Never once an ” everything will be ok”.
From my first birthday a month after the separation until this minute, I have been alone on any special day that comes along. Sure my kids come over a day or two or a week after the fact and sure we celebrate, but gone are the days where the actual day means anything.
I think after tomorrow I’m going to officially shut down. I’m going to force myself not to care anymore. I’ll be there for the boys as needed, but I will no longer invest myself in anyone. If I could, I would pack and go without so much as a goodbye. Based on these last 4 years, it would be some time before anyone would notice and even that would be because someone needed something from me.

This is my forth Christmas alone. No visitors or calls, unless I make them. All over television and Facebook are pictures of family, friends, and fun. Me, I am slowly going crazy because I can’t avoid it. I’m slowly starting to realize that all the people who tell me about being happy and positive during holidays have never spent one alone like this.
I just want to give up.

I wanted to included a picture, but OP was telling me the file was to big.
Anyway, the worst of it is over and sure I will be the first to admit the snow and how it’s covered everything is beautiful, but I am not ready to spend another freaking 5 days inside. The simple fact that this storm kept me from seeing my kids for Christmas is now keeping me from getting toilet paper and food is pissing me off.
As I learned a month ago, there is absolutely no use in asking or complaining to the manager of the complex. The same people who toss a $25 late fee 3 days after the 1st for rent, will take their sweet time clearing snow.
I’m not a monster. I know that this was an unusual weather event, but there was a significant break on Saturday that they could have gotten a start clearing, but of course blamed the “driving ban” eventhough the maintenance people all live here. The snow is still fluffy and manageable for snow plows and blowers, but no, they will wait the the temperature rises and it becomes heavy and packed. The vicious circle will start later of the nasty texts about moving cars so they can plow when they know damn well that more than half of us are literally trapped in our place.
Can I get out? Yeah, I can destroy the storm door to get out. The snow is high enough that I can push it about half a foot and that’s it. I can certainly use my German temper to break the door and get out, but I will be charged for a new one.
Trust me, I would love nothing more than to just turn my chair facing the window and curl up with some coffee and stare out in youthful longing at the snow, but I can’t and I spend the equivalent of 2 paychecks on rent for 3 rooms, not 3 bedrooms,  3 rooms, and you would expect that the complex would be there 25hrs.
Somewhere deep inside me there is a 20yr old man who wants to just go shovel his own way out but unfortunately the true 51yr old, broken, arthritic me know that isn’t going to happen. I wish I could. I know there are others my age that can. I hate what I’ve done to my life and what life has done to me.

I can’t stand this anymore. The loss of the only job I actually liked, another crap holiday season, the fact my boys are being raised by another man who Essen took my life I built. All of that and more. I can’t do this much longer. I’ve done the meditation and distraction stuff,  but here I am at 2am with my mind fighting me with 4 year old memories of a life I will no longer have with anyone.
I don’t know how people can tell me this is a new opportunity for me. I have never wanted this. I just want this to make sense. I’m a month away from possibly losing what little I have kept and scraped together. There’s a good chance I will be homeless. I’m too afraid to start something new and to defeated to find any belief in my self. Seriously,  how can you believe in yourself when the worst thing imaginable happens and you are the only one who seems to care? I loved these people, I cared for them, I sacrificed for them. They were my friends, family, kids, and my soul and they all just went on with out souch of an acknowledgement of the ruin and pain I was in.
Why is depression so horrible for others but for me it’s just me whoring for attention? I have literally watched people through the years have others rally around them as they had a b heart break or loss, bur when I needed that I was selfish and needy.
Maybe I am a shitty person. All I see with the people I thought were friends is how even at their lowest, they were never alone. Whether it was siblings, children, or friends, they were never left standing alone unless they wanted to be. They never went through what I’m going through all alone, yet they all want to give me shit because they “understand” better and more than I ever will. They’re 3 year relationship was far more important then my 20yr with kids. I should just shake off the loss of everything and embrace myself. The loser with nothing who gave up all his shit because at his lowest no one gave a fuck. I  supposed to look deep into myself and say “yeah a new start” when all the others left me in a pile of shit and tears. I can’t do half of what I could, I look like a beat up demented older version of myself, and I have absolutely nothing to offer to anyone to be interested in me. I want to get in shape, but I’m too lazy. I want to give up, but I allow what ifs. I want to die, but I don’t want to do that to my kids, who don’t even act like I exist unless I call or contact them.
It’s so easy for these people who say things about loving you or being patient,  when in reality, they have never been in the situation I am for this long. What really pisses me off is people under the age of 45 telling me about how life gets better or telling me how to live my best life. I was living my best life. I went fir days and weeks without one negative thought and now for the last 4 years that’s all I can think about even when trying not to. And once again I’m up at well, now 2:30

I don’t how to title this. I don’t really want to write.
Did you ever just want to lose it? Just hit, kick, throw, and smash everything and everyone around you? But, at the same time just want one person to just come and give you a hug, the closeness that will drain the feelings out of your body.
I just want to talk to someone and share some company. None of my kids have even asked to come over on winter break. Yes, there was the storm, but they don’t even call.
Do you know how hard it is to go from thinking you are someone’s world to being an afterthought in days? That’s me. I don’t hear from people, no one checks in, my kids don’t call.
I wish I hard the courage and selfishness to end things. I can’t take control of my life. Every attempt falls to pieces and things get even worse.
"
373,https://www.opendiary.com/m/newt316/loyalty-29-6168205/,2022-12-28,Loyalty,"
Can someone explain to me what it means to be loyal? I thought I knew what it was, I mean over the years I was loyal to 2 wives who both lied, cheated, and left me for another. I was loyal to my siblings, who have chosen to just push me away from them. I was loyal to friends, who now mock and avoid me. I was loyal to my children who now never call or want to come over unless they don’t have a choice.
I think maybe my parents were the only loyal people in my life. My father until the day he died and my mom right up until she lost her mind with dementia. That was a hard 3 years caring for her as she hit, spit, yelled, and told me I was a mistake. Then she was gone and less than a year later so was everyone else.
I know my silly whines and cries are miniscule compared to others. Boo Hoo, Colby has no friends and no one wants him. I just can’t describe what the last several years has done to an already broken person. I know there’s a problem,  I feel it mentally and physically,  but I just don’t know how to describe it and when I try to it comes off like I am making shit up for attention.
I went to Walmart this morning and like always, as nice as I try to be, no one cared. No return greetings, no eye contact, no “excuse or pardon me”. Just rude people who seem to be sickened by my presence. I’m saw my reflection in the freezer door, I guess they and everyone else are right.
"
374,https://www.opendiary.com/m/newt316/how-301-6168314/,2022-12-28,How?,"
How do I force a change to happen? Gow can I make new dreams when all I ever dreamed of I had and lost?
Is there anything like a life coach who knows the ins and outs of rebuilding and saving a person? I’m serious,  I’m at a huge loss here. I can afford to pay rent for January but going forward IDK. IDK if I can afford utilities or pay my credit card balance or my cat. I can’t get my head straight about living. I am filled with self imposed guilt that no one seems to want to absolve me of.
I know I have to find work and that I can’t live on unemployment,  but I’m a 51yr old and with 2 bum knees and other problems. I really don’t think I can do some of the manual jobs anymore. I had enough trouble with my last one, but had the freedom to start and stop as I needed. I have waisted my life doing a lot of nothing, but not enough of something. I worked as a family man, who put the importance on my wife and children, never wanting to be away from them and being there for every moment. Now I don’t have them and I don’t have a job. The world hasn’t made me feel good about it either.
I didn’t ask for this and I know I didn’t cause any of this, but yet I still have all the blame and guilt heaped on me because of it. My ex treats me like a bum, eventhough her actions and my sacrifices brought me to this point. My friend blame me for doing the right thing even as they would if I did the wrong thing. I don’t know how much more I can give up or sacrifice to be normal again. Then again, I have no clue what normal is.

You know what, it has been me along.

I was a shit husband, twice. I was more selfish then giving. I needlessly expected love and caring. I did all these things for them both and assumed they would appreciate me. I didn’t realize they wanted to be unappreciated like the men they left me for. Instead of sitting around being a “man” I did things and made choices for all of them and not myself.
I chose to sometimes make sure the kids had clothes, food, and shelter instead of a car payment on time or such.
I assumed my friends and siblings would somehow be there for me as I was for them, when bad things happened.
I busted my ass for an employer who I thought would see and appreciate me for it. Pushing myself to a point where I physically unable to do some mundane jobs like stocking or standing for hours. Instead, I should have become more buddies with everyone so when it came time to lay someone off it wouldn’t have come down to who kisses ass best.
I lived a life of loyalty and honesty and now I am reaping the rewards of poverty and loneliness everyone strives for.

If you have allowed yourself to be tortured by my ravings, you already know that I have not allowed myself a chance to let go for over 4 years. I constantly whine and cry about the same stuff over and over and over. I would love to say that I have resolved this year to stop, but I haven’t.
It is soul ripping every time I drop my boys home after having them. I not only have to say goodbye, I have to see my home I grew up in that is no longer mine. I home that when my mother gifted it to me I helped build a family in. A life in. Now it’s all someone else’s. Oh I know Patty owns it now, but he is tearing it apart. He is sitting in my living room and sleeping in my bedroom. He has breakfast,  lunch,  and dinner in my kitchen, with my kids and the love of my life. He will live right up until the day he dies with the contentment that only a man with a family around him understands while it’s looking pretty likely I will be long dead on the floor before anyone notices.
All I know is I’ve been a house of cards. I know that I am totally responsible for my own recovery from all of this. I have tired over and over too move on and forward. Like I said house of cards,  I reach a point where I’m good, well ok with it all and then a word, thought, action, or something completely out of my hands happens and it’s back to 52 card pick-up.
I just do not have local support, meaning friends, family, and siblings. No one can truly teach you to ride a bike, but they can help. I’m not saying that no one cares, some do, but I have never heard from anyone about how I am or how I am doing here. I have never had a surprise visit from a friend or family. What I have had are lectures and brow beatings about not handling things how people think I should. I have had them since about 2 hours after Patty told me she wanted a divorce. Although I have found support from online people and a couple old acquaintances, I never received any here. Infact, I have been blamed for the lost of friendship and closeness to them all because I didn’t react how they expected me to. I know that’s very understandable but I have to give an example of how I have been made to feel.
Imagine… You are put in a situation beyond your control. Out of no where a rock falls from the sky on top of your house trapping you. You are in horrible pain and can hardly help yourself. Your cries for help are at first ignored. Then you finally hear an answering voice. ” What did you expect living in a house under the sky?” “You’re alive, so way don’t you just pull yourself free?” So you struggle and struggle, but it’s not helping. “Please, I am trying I just need some help.”  “We’re sorry, but everyone has problems”. So you go back to trying, days, weeks, months past and you slowly get somewhat free.  You never hear anyone ask if you are OK, in fact, they have all walked away from the crushed mess you’re trapped in. “OK, I have managed to get somewhat free, but I am in so much pain still, something is broken”. “Jesus fucking christ!! Get the fuck over it. I mean, we are all sick of seeing the eyesore of a smashed house. This is starting to ruin our view. It always help me, help me.”
The point is, you can do 99% of it, but everyone needs that 1% help, especially from the people you have loved and been there for all of your life.
So there I am. My boys are home and my world is back to quiet, dark, and lonely. There’s no one I can call or will answer to talk about it or even the price of tea in China. Just my thoughts that kick up the breeze next to the house of cards.

I have a friend named Sean. We had always seen things the same and had the same dark humor about it all. I always felt comfortable with him and as a kid I couldn’t ask for more of a brother. Even more than my own brothers.
Well that ultimately ended with apparently all my relationships with my divorce. I just had a memory of when he was talking about driving to Michigan to visit a couple of his friends from when he was in the service. He drove over 600 miles to hang out with these guys, but a 20 minute drive to come and hang out with me is too much. He’s much to busy. He’s not in a position to just lose a few hours on me because of this and that now. Also, he is to busy for me to go there. That’s what has killed me over the few years after my divorce.
My sister kind of summed it all up for me earlier when she said she understands why Patty couldn’t deal with me and left because I seem to always want some acknowledgement.  Maybe she is right. I am stupid for thinking that even my own blood relationships should know me enough to see me suffering and hurting.
Over the last month I have contacted over 20 people and asked how they were. Just out of the blue I sent them texts or emails. Do you know how many did the same for me? 2 people who know me through Open Diary. No friends. No family. Not even the therapist I used to see and suddenly stopped going to has even touched base.

I miss my job like I miss my wife. Both things that I shouldn’t because I was never considered good enough by either. The world in the last 4 years has taken a baseball bat to my face.
I just want to be a drone and I did everything I could to stay that way. I worked hard and went above and beyond to just have that comfortable feel.
Now everything is slammed into me without stop. Race guilt, man guilt, covid, the shitty state of the US, cost of food, rent, bills, MGTOW, feminism, what women want vs what they say they want, losing friends, losing dreams, global warming, war, paying taxes to feed and take care of everyone but us here in this country,  being judged on how I am a father based on my financial involvement, being told that men should have feels, but made to feel like a shit because I do.
If I so much as did to anyone what they have done to me I would be ran out of town.
 
I don’t want to be this guy I have become. I don’t want to see and bitch about the unfairness of everything. I just wanted to go to the job I loved and lose myself there. Yes, I had some issues with my coworkers, but I also had a job where I could go and lose myself in things without the world taking a shit on me. Same with my little family bubble I had. I want a relationship with my boys other than trying to shove life lessons and good times along with forming them into men, in 1 or 2 days.
I’ve been left alone with nothing but the world. Just pouring on the Bull Shit of the woke craziness of today. Sure I can just shut it out. Turn of the internet. Read a book. Listen to the radio. Embrace the fact that I will probably never have a good friend or relationship ever again and live.
Do what I want, they say. I have no money. My job is gone and honestly a lot of the jobs being offered will essentially make me less money then the unemployment I get. It sounds so easy. Find a job. Yet, there is gas for the car to get there and of course the car. There is the fact my health is poor and I am hitting an age that, like it or not, getting a decent job probably won’t happen. There’s the fact I can only see my kids on the weekend 9 months out if the year. I know, I know what I sound like and I also struggle constantly sounding like that.

The day doesn’t have any significance for me but I couldn’t think of a title.
So I have become a victim of the Ozempic craze. I can’t seem to find it anywhere around here at the moment. At least it’s not an anxiety pill that you can’t miss.
I’ve been forcing myself to think differently than I do. Pushing myself to give up the thoughts of family and relationships. My son called me out of the blue, which I don’t really think was out of the blue, but I’ll take it. It’s harder than I thought because it also makes me realize I have a lot of trouble living in a moment. I long for the past and dread the future, but everyone I’ve allowed myself to exhaul, shit happens.
I was extremely comfortable in my marriage and then BOOM. I was enjoying my job and making plans then BOOM. I thought my friends would be there to help and BAM they just do the opposite. So thus whole live in the moment for me isn’t going well. I feel like I haven’t done enough eventhough I can’t afford too. It’s raining and just a muddy snowy shit show outside so there’s nothing there. My dumbest had to move away from the kids, so it’s not a quick jog from them.

First thing. I want to say thank you and I so appreciate all of you who comment on my entries. I am trying to have something go right for all of you and myself. 
Also, I do read through your entries too. I just don’t know what to say sometimes and I feel like I may sound like a hypocrite to give advice.
 
Today I woke up feeling kind of hopeless. Thoughts about my job forced themselves into my mind. I realize that there is a special hell for people, like me, who makes things so personal. Why did this happen? I work through covid, she didn’t.  She toke several weeks off because of “covid exposure”. I literally trained her to do her job, which I was doing for months before her. I busted my ass to keep the place going when the other guy broke several ribs and couldn’t work. I worked overtime to keep our ability to issue dmv stuff and plates. All of this with no thanks, I guess I just answered the why.
I have applied to several jobs and haven’t heard a peep. I finally found a therapist and after waiting weeks, got a half-hour talk that I personally feel did nothing for me.
I still put out calls and messages to what seems no one. I just got dinged for $35.75 because I was a day late on rent, which I told them I would be. The place that left me stranded in my apartment twice this winter. Yes, it was crazy weather and yes, I understand only so much can be done, but when you watch the building across the way get plowed and cleared twice when yours is still feet deep it bothers you. This past Christmas storm they never came, the neighbors and myself shoveled a passable path. So, do I say something and take the chance of eviction when I have shit for money, no job, and nowhere to go? No, I bend over and bite down.
But that’s me. That’s all I have done in life. If you have read anything I have wrote, you know I have no backbone and I am nothing but a doormat for everyone and their brother. You see, when I have stood up for myself, it’s all been turned back on to me. People who said I should turn around and tell me I shouldn’t have.
So if I want to somehow make bad worse for me, I need to stand up for myself and lose what I have left. HOPELESS…

That didn’t happen and I chose another path but I still remember. So why can’t I get it wrapped around my head that it’s ok, somewhat, to be in the situation I’ve been in for almost 4 years.
I want to claim bankruptcy, well I don’t but it’s kind of where things are at. The things is if I do and I lose everything I am in no real position to come back from it. I will lose the truck that is seriously getting to a point where it’s going to break but is my only way to get anywhere and that’s the only thing keeping me from claiming.
How did I get in this spot? Why did I not fight for what’s mine? Why did I just concede? No wonder anybody doesn’t want to be in my life, all they see is a loser. I just come off as a “poor me” bitch boy eventhough shit just keeps happening to me. I didn’t lose my job, it was taken from me.

Thought I would do a deep dive of myself today, sort of a confessional.

I am a liar, a cheat, and a thief. As far as how and who, let’s just say everyone and leave it there.
I am a shit father, brother, and friend. I was a horrible son and husband.
I have lived most of my life being a victim to my own acts. I am lazy, I am narcissistic, and I cry out for attention instead of earning it.
I was a crap employee at pretty much any job I held. Never really doing more than I had to. I selfishly asked for more and did nothing to earn it.
I suck with money, always have. I spend for instant gratification and never think of a future. This is why Patty left me. I don’t blame her.
I have nothing but opportunities to be with my kids and do things. I should have learned from Kayla’s death that there’s only so much time and opportunities to be a good father. Instead I allow the world and it’s problems to hold me back.
I have only myself to blame for my weight and appearance. My health has suffered because I gave up on myself years ago.
Worse of all, as I write this and confess all, I will most likely not do anything about it because I selfishly feel like the world and people in it owe me something. That’s what I hate the most about me, I know better and was raised better, but I just do not care anymore.

All the others who said they would be there aren’t anymore either. I’m really starting to lose it here. I need a job but I can’t bring myself to look. I have no want to once again learn a job. I’m the old guy now. I’m slow and hurt and can’t keep up with people 20 years younger. My head is jumbled by the meds and I can’t get an appointment to see anyone until March for that. Why is it they say seek help and when you do you have to wait months for it. In the meantime your going crazy.
I really wish someone cared enough back then to have me institutionalized. I really wish I would have.
It’s like I have totally forgot how to live anymore other than hiding out in my apartment. Everything changed in a day for me and it’s like I was never there in anyone’s life 4 years ago.

I just want to sit comfortably and not stress anymore. Mental issues, physical issues, financial issues, life issues, family issues. It’s never ending in my head. All I ever wanted throughout the last few years is someone close to just show me a little comfort and tell me it’s ok, but it’s gone to far now and everything is a mess in my head.
I literally worry about what others think when they don’t think of me at all.
I keep thinking and waiting for things to change. Something to happen. Someone to happen. But it just seems to get worse.

No, I’m not really bleeding, but with all the thoughts going on in my head it feels as if my head will explode at anytime.
I tried to watch a YouTube about God taking bad people out of your life, well not bad but damaging. IDK, I saw the title and saw that the time was 11:11. I have been catching that time a lot lately.  Some say it’s a sign.Who knows?
So anyway, here it is again 11:11 and here is a video about how God works in mysterious ways, so why not. Right off the bat it became clear that this was a Uber far left/right religious thing. I mean I am a Lutheran and I believe and know that God makes a push here and there, but for the most part it’s a freewill kind of thing. This guy was going all “these are demons that God has saved you from”. I hate what Patty did to me, but I don’t consider her a demon.
Honestly, I don’t quite understand what lesson I’m supposed to learn from all this. I mean what is lesson to be learned when you lose the person you loved for 20 years in what seemed to be over the course of one day? What is the lesson when that person, from that point on, treats you like you are a stranger? What is the lesson when your family and friends walk away from you when you needed them the most? What is the lesson when you lose your job eventhough you have gone above and beyond for it?
I have lost all the dreams I have had since I dreamt them. No, at 16, 17, I didn’t dream of having a family and being a father, but when I got my first ex pregnant, all I wanted was to be just that. Yet, I didn’t get to raise my daughter like she deserved to be and now the same with my boys. Infact, they were and are being raised by another man. It doesn’t matter how good he does it, the point is they are mine to raise and it seem as if she, the world, and God wants me not to.
Besides that, I am old. Not busted old, but oddly old. My values are wrong for the modern world and now as I try to find yet another job I have to compete with 2 younger generations who understand it all so much better.
I just feel like a dusty keepsake that has no use, but you can’t bring yourself to throw out.

Eventhough they lied to me, cheated on me, broke their promises, and left me, it’s all my fault.
Let me be straight, I realize that i had to have a role in it all too, but nothing compared to what was done to me and yet I am treated like I am to blame.
Let me rephrase that, for almost every bad thing that has befallen me, has always been my fault. They cheat, my fault. They lie, my fault. They force me out and take everything and leave me with nothing, my fault. Things don’t go their way after they leave, my fault.
As I said, I know that I could be difficult at times, everyone is.
IDK, it is probably all my fault. I pushed all of them away because I wasn’t who they wanted me to be.
Everything is a mess. I can’t win either way.

Ever since my “breaking” after she left, I haven’t been able to control my emotions. Some say that this is healthy, but it goes well beyond a healthy thing for me.
I want to talk to people about things, but u instantly start to blubber and tear up. 4 years and the mention of Patty or the boys sets me on a crash course of intense feelings I can’t control.
This happens constantly. Anywhere. Anytime.  I can be in a professional situation and something said or heard, I begin to lose it. It’s almost disabling.
I could use a win. Something. How does one gain confidence when everything falls apart on an almost daily basis?

I wish I could put into word how empty I feel after taking one or all of my boys home. You would think that after how long it has been since the end of my marriage, it would be east, but it’s not. For 5 days, sometimes more, I live in a dark, stale, lonely apartment and for 1 or 2 days it comes to life with my children. It happens so fast that I can’t grab it and hold it and once again I come home to nothing.
I see the life at what was once my home. I see the dreams I shared happening, but without me. Once again I am dragged back to not knowing why or what I did wrong. The boys are young and don’t understand that I need that one more hug, that few more seconds with them.
Then comes the “great silence” of the next several hours. No one calls, no one answers, but I need to talk, I need to feel not so alone, so worthless. I’ve told people this, close people, but still they just choose to not be burdened with me.
I understand it. It’s my problem, not theirs. They all chose from day 1 to not involve themselves in my hurts and pains, and they have clearly shown and told me this several times in the past 4 years, but I walk myself right back into the minefield.
I want to escape my head. I never like drinking and when I have, I always stopped when the “fuzziness” started. The “control freak” in me will not allow me to smoke Marijuana. I tried that too and if there was a high, I mentally ruined it.
Fuck, I’m a mess…

I’ve been bopping back and forth with a potential job. At first the money lured me into considering it, but I ultimately turned it down.
It was selling accidental death insurance. Personally I think that it is a very good company. There was also hospital stay payments like Afflec offers. Over all 4 sales a week would gave making more money then I have ever made.
On the other side though, I would have to get an insurance license, which would be around $400 and since I don’t have one, a decent lap top, so another $500ish. The job is 100% commission, no draw, so no sale, no money.
I decided that I am too old with too many problems to do something like this. Also, unemployment is weird and if I took this job it would screw it all up and then I would be SOL. There was a very scared little boy in me afraid of change that is too afraid to take this much of a risk too.
So I passed on it, for what I really thought and considered good reasons. Now I am sitting here feeling like a failure once again.

I found myself starting to hate me last night. Not a I wish I was dead kind of hate, but a I hate what I have become hate.
Let’s get something, I never really knew what it was I wanted to be. I was just a carefree kid until I wasn’t.
As most are aware here, I just wanted a family. Wanted to raise my kids traditionally. I spent years building that dream for my ex, them, and myself. Then I was pushed away from all of it.
I guess instead of stepping aside for the benefits of my children and my unfortunate love of me ex, I should have got fight into the mud and fought for what I wanted no matter who got hurt.
I did what I thought a loving person should and I have been reminded daily that I fucked up. I already know I couldn’t win either way.
So what happened last night? It finally hit me I am no longer my kid’s father. I mean I am biologically their father, but I’m a really good friend. Not quite a best friend, but the friend you know you can totally count on.
On its surface that sounds like a great relationship, but there’s a huge difference to feeling your dad is your father then just dad.
I guess in the end it’s all my fault. Not being able to co-parent with Patty. Not standing up for myself.

I’ve just realized I have really failed at life and it’s all my fault. It’s become clear to me for some reason this morning.  It’s not like I had a Scrooge night where I awoke and seen the errors of my way and will strive to overcome it. I woke up and finally had the realization its been me all along and it’s too late.
I can’t repair my relationships. I’ll never be who I wanted, with the people I wanted. I’ve burnt down the forest and I complain that there is no shade. The apologies haven’t worked. The mending hasn’t worked. I am forced into the only forward that I have never been able to be. Alone.
I am pitied by my own children and they are all I have left.

You know, trying to “see the good” and accepting “life” is hard, well for me.
I can’t accept myself anymore. Worst of all, I don’t remember when I became so ugly and unappealing. I think I have answered my own questions on why people don’t talk to me in public and I always feel like some creepy old guy.
I just don’t like my looks. The old man ugly stick hit me hard. It didn’t help that my ex left me for a man who is almost 10 years older than me.
I find myself just wanting to accept that my time has come and go and I hope that I can find a job where I no longer have to deal with anyone.

I’m in a weird place right now. Around this time 4 years ago my life ended, well the only life I wanted ended.
I don’t understand relationships or people for all that matters.  I failed as a father to all my children. I selfishly took the “good guy” path and it’s cost me so much. Maybe if I was more present in Kayla’s life she would still be here, never had the accident that made her last 10years difficult.
My boys don’t call me with problems or concerns. I’m the last person on the list to hear about rewards or events.
I sit alone too afraid and guilty to live life any different then how I lived as a married man. I’ve been stuck this way 4 years, no matter what I’ve tried. I had a speck of possibility with my job, but that was ripped from me too.
At this point I want someone to see I’m a mess and have me committed or take conservativeship over me for a while to help me get right or not. Things have all gone out of control and all that would have helped was just someone, someone to have taken my side, seen me descending into my madness that haunts me now.
I can’t see the good in things anymore. The warm breeze blows on me and I only can think of the bugs. My kid gets an award and I realize that several others knew before me. I go to therapy and get 45 minutes to talk and have to wait 2 weeks to do it again when I need someone every day to help me.
It’s the loneliness I know. There’s a big difference between loneliness and being alone.

398,https://www.opendiary.com/m/newt316/the-urge-10-6172508/,2023-01-27,The urge,"
So right now I’m sitting in my truck outside my son’s “karate” studio. I don’t normally take him or pick him up, so this is still a little new. They don’t allow the parents to crowd around inside, so if your first thought was why I am not in there, that’s why.
Anyway since my brain is wired wrong, all I want to do is be back with Patty. Back with my family, living that life. Knowing that at the end of this sitting in a cold truck in the dark will end with family togetherness instead of the harsh reality of dropping him off and back to my hole.
I want to text her and talk, but there’s no point. Just knowing how it all ended haunts me into knowing she was completely done with me, not even enough left to respect me.
I realize that is my problem and it always has been. Acknowledgement, needing to know I’m ok with others. Sure I can pick apart all 20 years with her and find this and that, that could have lead her to do this to me. Whether or not it’s right or wrong, she did it to me. The one person, besides my parents, who I believed whole heartedly wouldn’t hurt me.
How do you come back? What did I do so horrible that she disregarded me so much? She literally forced a new man in the kids life and let the world know it and somehow is the “hero” of this story. I guess I would be different if I fell right back into a new relationship with a fresh financial start. I just never figured her for that kind of person who would push me off a cliff for a chance at something better.
I have this all in my head too. The loss and anger. I know I have to “get better”, but I’m holding myself back. Seriously, it’s like seeing the air while under water and needing to breathe, but I just keep my head underwater and I have absolutely no clue why.

Yes, I have said a lot of this in the past, but it’s almost 2am and my brain won’t stop, so I am working it out here.
This unemployment on top of depression has caused me to become an insomniac. Even more than normal. Yes there’s been a couple days that I have slept through a day instead of doing something productive. Recently though, I’ve had something going on with my gut, IBS, infection, or something is wrong with my innards. All I know is I just can’t get comfortable and when I absolutely tired, I sleep. Of course I can’t see any one until Feb 27, so there you go. Yes I am eating healthy. Yes I am drinking plenty of water. Yes I’ve stopped taking medicines that may aggravate it.
I am tired of being judged and treated like a shit father by the people whose actions put my in this spot. You know, maybe if they didn’t nuke my life for their own needs or guilt, things would be better. Maybe I could be a better father if they didn’t take almost every thing I built and saved for over 20+ years and leave me with the bills. You throw someone in a hole and yell at them because they are in it.
Why is the world so unfair? I built my life. The life I deserve,  the life I wanted. Then in a blink, a man who just fucked his up for 30+ years, gets my everything.  Sure, Patty had a lot to do with it, but you would think lying adulterous person would be the one punished in the “eyes of God”, but no. She has a fresh start, a church wedding, and friends all rallying around here, while I have struggled for 4 years to get through a day without losing it. Yes, the man who spent his first 20 years going to church almost religiously. The man who did the right thing marrying the girl he got pregnant in high school. The man who insisted on having all 5 of his children baptized. That guy has been broken, left, ignored, forgotten, and unappreciated by almost everyone he held dear a mere 4 years ago. Where’s my Ying for yang, my tit for tat? Nope, it’s just lose, lose, and lose some more.
Ok. I have more “work to do” but I’ve done a lot over the last 3 years and all I have to show for it is an apartment I may lose in a couple months. Laid off from a job where I busted my ass and literally saved it from going out of business. A truck that is possibly going to just blow up at anytime. No close friends to check in on me. No women interested in getting to know me. Hell, not even a person at the grocery store willing to have a conversation. My kids look at me as just a friend that they are happy to see occasionally, but not someone they are willing to change plans for.
IDK
Maybe I am the miserable fuck who knowingly sabotaged his only life, relationships, and employment.aybe everyone else has it right and I really am the problem.

I don’t think I have ever known someone who is more of an inconvenience to people like I am or how I am made to feel. Last summer as I was going through the scary possibility of having bladder cancer, it was nothing but an inconvenience to ask anyone to drive me to and from the hospital as I went through 2 procedures,  let alone to be bothered to even check on my wellbeing.
That brings us to today. I mentioned I have been dealing with a stomach thing. When I finally got to sleep, I woke and I was shivering.  I never get cold like this, 2 huge blankets and I can’t get warm. I feel like I may give birth to a rock at the moment. My sister can’t be bothered to change her plans to stop by and Patty, well she just thinking I am making it all up. My two youngest that are with me this weekend seem to sense I’m not ok, but I want to be with them for what little time I get, so I’m going to remember this when the ask comes from people. In a ditch? Feeling faint? Sorry, can’t be bothered.

So once again my “lucky hits home. I am being put out of my apartment. Not evicted, but told to leave by not renewing my lease. Seems I should have read the lease I signed in November, which I thought was just the same I signed 2 years in a row, but no. They changed the terms to month by month. So I guess they are pushing out over half the tenants to “renovate” all the apartments and apparently I am one.
Here I am, unemployed and soon to be homeless and no where to go. There are absolutely no places affordable and they all want credit checks and proof of income and well, I’m screwed.
Do I have standards? Yes, I will not just find a shithole that is affordable.
I don’t know what I’m going to do.

So pretty much around the day I was told “I don’t love you anymore” 4 years ago, I was told we don’t want you here anymore. You would think that at age 51 a man would understand that it doesn’t matter what he does shit still happens to people. Some more than others. I spent 20 years being the best husband, father, brother, and friend and it didn’t matter. I paid rent on time, even through covid, for over 3 years and it didn’t matter. The jobs I busted my ass for, gone.
I’ve tried to roll with the punches, really I have, but when life has puts you in a corner it’s way too hard. I want to be the cool no worries guy. I want the world to burn down and be able to sit there with a marshmallow and enjoy the colors. I can’t though. It’s easy for employed people to tell me it’s easy to get a job. It’s easy for attached people to tell me that love will find me. It’s easy for home owners to tell me to just get a new apartment.
Oh, and for you people keeping score, I told my sister. As I guessed, the first thing she said is ” I don’t have any money, what do you think I can do…” I didn’t ask for money or help, I needed to talk. Also, this has now turned into “you did something wrong” situation. Just like my divorce was my fault to everyone and my job loss was all my fault, I must have done something to lose my lease.
I seriously have to give up thinking someone will just come around and just cheer me up.

I suck at life. I’ve finally have come to a point where I can’t right the ship anymore. I’d say I burnt my bridges, but they burnt themselves down. I weakly took the easy path in life and hand “me” over to my ex and our family. I haven’t been “me” since 1987 before Vikki, the first ex.
I was constantly saved from my fuckups. By my parents and others. I just sucked for all these years. I had Patty as my security blanket always there to make feel like there was hope I would pull it together. No, I wasn’t an anchor on her, I did my part for us, but I was worried about not having “the moments” and having stuff instead of the real security of savings and planning. I decided that that was my life. Her and the kids until my last breath.
She just wouldn’t talk about what she felt bad about, letting resentment build in her. I would have done anything. I threw myself into making her and the kids happy and comfortable. I threw myself into the house and yard, making it safe and enjoyable. She took it all and left me with nothing.  This woman who up to the second said she loved me, said she was happy, said she cared, had turned on me with such a vengeance that just seems to get worse for the years we haven’t been together. She made me into a villain so throughly that she refuses to even remember we had a great life. Sure there was money issues and yes I will admit I wasn’t the most sunny person to live with for a stretch. I had lost a child who I had really failed to be a good father to. All Kayla wanted was to be my daughter and know she loved me and I blew it. She died because of injuries she got 10 years before in a car accident that would not have happened if I would have just agreed with Vikki when she wanted to send her to me because things were out of control in California. But things between her and Patty were tense and I took Patty side. We were just about to close on our home and were living with my parents and I told Vikki not right now, we have to get settled. Kayla never came to stay with us as just a normal girl again. After the accident, after the hospital stay and the little rehab she got, I came to bring her home to me. She thrived at the school special ed and exceeded all the goals and then turned into a teenager. Her and Patty fought, not violent things, verbal. Oil and water. Long story short, Vikki had moved from the “trouble area” to New Mexico and a new start and Kayla wanted to go back.
A couple years later she came back to stay and the first night they had a fight, verbal, about going out so late, I worked nights, and Kayla took off. Well, stupid me decided she needed a real world experience and honestly in Silver Creek she couldn’t fart without someone letting me know.
Point is, I should have been a better father. I should have worked with her and Patty to get along better. I didn’t and now she’s gone. That weighed in me, but we didn’t talk about it, I didn’t want Patty to feel uncomfortable.  Then all the crap with my mother falling into dementia and how I experienced my last few year with her as I became “a horrible fuck who shouldn’t have been born”.
So yeah, I was depressed and questioning who I was, what I did, what I didn’t do, how to make life better for her and the kids. I was bottling up the feelings I shouldn’t and whining about “what ifs” All the while she seemed to want to be there for me or at least I thought she was. She didn’t need to talk to me, just her being there was all I needed. Maybe you could say, she was the lock that kept the closet in my head closed and when she turned on me, 48 years of pushing all the pain and sadness down came rushing out and somehow I turned into a narcissistic whining bitch boy according to everyone. EVERYONE.
This entry has totally gone off the rails from what I intended, but it does show where my head and heart are at.
I just don’t know what to do and essentially because I’m 51 and man, everyone makes me feel like a dumb fuck because I’m lost and I can’t keep up with the losses. I am typing on a phone at 1am trying to make myself understand and somehow find that one thing to grab on to to start the change. That one thing to make it right. The one thing I don’t trust anymore. After the separation, I through myself into the job I had at the time and was “dismissed” because I didn’t have a degree to do the job I had done for close to 4 years. BOOM, back to the bottom. So after living on food stamps and 2 unemployment checks before they (the job) fought to pay. I find my last job, I learn the job even when I felt as though I was being talked down to. I bust my ass to be more than they need. This was my change. I screw up the nice covid unemployment pay day by figuring out a loop hole to reopen because the big guys down south wanted us to stay open. I fix 3 years of the woman I came to “fill in” for DMV mistakes and also discover along the way she was stealing from them. I train her replacement and stay on because I was the cover guy who could do all the jobs and the problem solver. This was mine, the first thing I had on my own, alone. Never took any time off that wasn’t necessary like the “cancer scare” last summer. I did all my work and the other guys work for 2 months because he broke 5 ribs without so much as a thank you. 3 days before Thanksgiving BOOM. Job ripped from me, back to hole. So I decide to take the “unemployment time” to fix me, get healthy, take some time to either go back or find something I would enjoy doing. I spent most of my life taking what came along. I almost finally get comfortable and not feeling guilty or wrong for being on the system BOOM, I am out of an apartment now.
I’ve know this for 3 days now and do you know how next to impossible it is to find an apartment? I am unemployed with shit credit because I can’t afford to pay on the credit cards. Even the shit places wants a credit check, who cares if I can make my rent. Oh and rent, it will take atleast $1000 down to get even the cheapest studio.
So what have I learned and why have I written this entry? I suck. I am a 51 year old “mommas boy” without a momma or a momma stand in. I never took being me seriously like I did being Patty’s husband and the kid’s father. I have no social skills or a common balanced mind to work life’s problems out on my own. I have no more filter on my emotions and can’t even mention her name or our family without becoming a blubbering idiot. I see 51 as a crutch and how I will be judged too old for everything,  except knee replacement which I desperately need. My end plans are all gone and literally given to another man who did nothing to deserve it other than take advantage of a woman who was questioning things.
I just can’t see me coming back from this anymore and it’s bringing my thoughts back to the dark place I was in for months in 2019 after the separation. I’m starting to not care anymore and feeling like no one around here cares.

So, I got a call about a new apartment, it’s just a showing, then application, and hope that the owner’s approval.
Yeah, it does seem hopeless based on my current karma, life, and fate issue.
As you can probably tell, I’ve been on the outs with God for some time now. I’m angry that these “tests” seem to keep coming for 4 years straight and the scales never seem to balance. I need prayers, could use money, and definitely help moving. I can’t ask people for 2 or 3, but if you can put in a word or two to the man upstairs, Allah,  Budda, or Tom Cruise and help me turn my luck around.
The place itself will be challenging. It’s back in Silver Creek where “she” is and all the other Heartbreakers. But it’s extremely affordable that unemployment can actually pay for it and it’s walking distance for the boys to come over anytime and that’s all that matters to me going forward, but I will still bitch and moan here…

I don’t think I ever learned how to stay in an upbeat mood. I was all good until 5 minutes ago and it just snuck in. The doubt, loneliness,  and pure terror I feel about being me. It’s like someone just through a weighted blanket over me and not in that relaxing huggy way, more like a scary suffocating way. My mind has instantly been thrown into panic mode at 9:30 at night when there isn’t anything I can do about anything.
I wasn’t lying when I said that the ex was the only person or thing that helped me not dread like this. I told my therapist last week I wish I could shut down and have someone live my life for me for a week or two, to get it back on track for me. I’m at the frustrated lash out and make it all worse stage.
When it gets like this, I can’t regulated my head. No music, meditation, or activity helps. I know it passes, but it sucks so bad getting through. This is where a nice chat would help. I really wish I was a bar person. Not sure if it would help, the world has made me feel like a creep lately when I attempt to talk to another. God I miss cigarettes.

Why can’t people answer texts? I get asked to do something and I say ok, but when or where, what time.
And
Nothing. I’ve sat here for over an hour waiting on an answer. I know if I ask again then all Hell breaks loose. But, the other way around, I get read the riot act for not responding.

Well it’s been a day. Looked at the studio apartment near the boys. It will definitely be a change from having a bedroom. I have no flair for decorating so I can’t imagine what it will look like if I get it. IDK, I don’t live a life where I just sleep, shit, and shower and go. Honestly I don’t live any kind of life, I exist.
The whole reason like I said is to see the boys more, but how and where will they sleep? I guess I can have them hang out during the afternoon and then take them home. I just feel at an age where stuffing myself into a studio apartment will make me feel worse about myself. I know, that’s stupid.
I hate the way my brain is wired and I wish I could finally flow with life. I feel like I have to be forgiven for all of this, like it’s all my fault. I can’t make peace with the fact that this is who I am now. I’m a father to kids I can’t be with 24/7.
 
Any way, there maybe a chance to get a place in Fredonia. About 15 miles away. The people who own this place owns some up there and I may be able to get in with just rent and not rent and deposit. I mean, honestly I see their side of it all. These apartments need updating. The timing just sucks.
The job search? Not great.

I decided to let you all see the sad guy who writes here. This picture took several attempts and I’m still not happy with it.
I’ve never really been alright with how I look. I’ve been skinny and I been (am) fat. I now have a double chin turkey neck and have successfully stretched my body so that when I do loose significant weight I will have loose hanging skin.
Yes, I know the man who can confidently be beyond this can be an obese mess but still attract people towards them. I also know that handsome men will be approached more and people will be more likely to respond to when you just say hello.
IDK. I’m probably wrong. Just had to get the thought out.

409,https://www.opendiary.com/m/newt316/the-struggle-22-6173385/,2023-02-03,The struggle,"
For the last several days I have been really trying to rethink life. Accept that what I had and wanted is gone for good. Even if I could go back to her and fix our family, it’s gone. So, I’m trying to figure out how to remake me.
I want to stop worrying. Seriously,  I worry about EVERYTHING. The news doesn’t help, the internet doesn’t help.
I want to stop feeling so guilty about things I had no control over. This whole divorce and all the fallout it has caused has left me feeling like it’s all my fault. No one, absolutely no one, has made any sort of effort to regret their part in it all. People have said some very hurtful damaging  things to me when it was apparent I was (am) suffering with all of this. I’ve said it before, all I ever wanted was a hug and “it’s ok, I’m here for you.”
Now, I just want to live alone from almost everyone. I want to be the man I remember my great uncle Bob was. Just laid back. Morning was a cup of coffee and a smoke. Some gardening, some puttering, a visit down at the bar. Now, I know there was so much more in his life. Good, bad, and all. It’s just the peaceful man he became. I want to find that peace.
I want to find a certain type of job before I have to take anything. I essentially want something that I can do alone with minimal management. And, I don’t want it to come home with me. I almost had that with my last one. I could lose myself in my office,  deal with my customers or go outside and do inventory or organize stock and I never once was told what to do. Of course as I unfortunately found out, it didn’t matter to anyone or appreciated by anyone, because all my efforts didn’t mean dick when they put me out.
The hardest things will be giving up some technologies if I can. This phone and all the shit it does for one.
I’ve been working on accepting some very hard truths in the world, especially today’s world. I will probably never have another romantic relationship. I will have to be a divorced father to my kids. All the dreams I had are dead and gone and any thing I can think of now is way out of reach and not very possible. People will still use me and leave me. I any way I play it, I’m always going to be wrong.

Yep, here I am again after the boys are dropped off at home. It just seems to be coming from all directions today. Them, the apartment search, the unemployment, and Patty.
Shit of it is, I can reason in my head about all of it, but then like a dog seeing a squirrel, I take my eyes off and boom, it all rushes in.
I just need a win. Something. The dating sites are playing the “likes” thing where they send you a email that you have so many likes and of course anything less than $29.99 you can’t see anything about them.

All I wanted to do was watch A man called Otto. I had no clue it was what it was. Sure the ads made it seem like he’s a grumpy old man who becomes a nice man, but they didn’t show the love and loss story.
Not to spoil it, but I couldn’t finish it. It hurt too much. No my situation has nothing to do with the character’s loss, but it’s the same feelings. His thoughts and actions about the loss are exactly how I feel about mine.
Yes there’s a difference between the character’s and mine, but if you see the movie you will understand how tough it’s been for me and how it’s still hurts.
Of course, I don’t have the neighbors or others around me as he does to help him see past his hurt.

It’s all weighing on me tonight.  The almost hopeless apartment search, the unemployment, my health (I’m not sick, just fat and disgusting), my kids don’t ever call me, not hearing from anyone, and wanting to talk to Patty about it all.
I know the answers to all of the concerns and I know what I have to do. I’m just feeling the heaviness of everything and I just want something to make me feel ok to happen.
I just want to be told I’m going to be ok, but I’m not. Not with all this happening. I want to somehow just have that Oprah, Dr. Phil type of rescue. I just want someone to take control of me so I can just breathe.
I have to figure out how and where I can live. My options are closing quickly. I have to not pay rent here so I can pay rent somewhere else. The deposits and rents people are asking for are horrible.
"
413,https://www.opendiary.com/m/newt316/waiting-1290-6182815/,2023-02-08,Waiting,"
I’m still waiting to hear about the studio apartment I looked at back in Silver Creek. It’s becoming a bit unbearable for me. My anxiety is back to levels I thought I was over. I should pack things or throw stuff out. I can’t touch any savings until I hear something so I can’t get a storage place yet. Most of my stuff is probably going to get donated. There’s no way it will fit in this place. I have to get rid of my bed, it’s way to big. I broke my rule about accumulating things and it’s going to be a bitch moving it all by myself.
Somewhere in me there is a voice telling me to get up and go do something, anything, but it’s lost in the hopeless dread I’m feeling right now. All those people who called me a loser and Patty leaving me because of financial difficulties are being proven right. I am an unemployed, no savings, broke and soon to be homeless nothing, just like they all said and thought of me. I tried, I really tried. I never asked or begged for help or money from anyone. I sacrificed to keep the lights on and car running. I did my job well and never complained to them, maybe here, but not there. I been a quiet renter, even when I was literally stuck in my place for days. I clean, I organize, I attempt to care for myself alone. But here I am in what is starting to feel like a no win situation.
"
414,https://www.opendiary.com/m/newt316/legacy-44-6196364/,2023-02-09,Legacy,"
The hard truth is I don’t really mean anything to anyone and I’ve never made any sort of impact on anyone’s lives.
My sons have live for me, I am their biological father after all, but they don’t need me or rely on me. I don’t get “guess what” calls from them. I’ve never had one of them come out and say they really miss me at home. Maybe it’s a testament to how good Patty is as a mother and how better her husband is as a father for them.
I must be what everyone thinks I am. A loser, a horrible father and friend, a terrible partner, a shit brother, and a lousy human being. Patty dumped me out of her life so completely it’s like I was never part of it. I would guess she wishes I wasn’t the boy’s father either.
She right, I don’t deserve to be their father. I haven’t been able to pay support since I lost my job. I don’t actively participate in the boys lives. They come for a night or two and we don’t do anything. I should have fought Patty tooth and nail in the separation and divorce, but instead I surrendered to the hurt, betrayal, and anger and have totally allowed it to slowly ruin me for 4 years to a point where I almost don’t want to live anymore.
There’s been no good side to this divorce. I don’t have a new relationship or friends who come around. The one thing I managed to have was ripped away, like everything else, in November. And now, I have no where to go after I leave this place.
Seriously, the cheapest place besides the studio I looked at, is over $900. I can’t get that much money together to move in any time soon. If I do find a job, I need to make atleast $19 – 20 an hour to even pay all my monthly bills and child support. I was hard pressed when I was worked and I was making a salary that amounted to $22 an hour. I’m fucked…
There are no programs for a poor guy who is single, unless I go balls into it. Fully homeless and addicted to something. Morbidly obese where I can’t walk or function. I have tried. I’m on unemployment and I still make too much for food stamps or most every assistance program. I managed to get insurance that is affordable, but I’ve already been told twice that they won’t cover things that my other did.
It’s a steep cliff I have to climb and I don’t know how to be a good father, friend, and sibling while I need to climb. It’s been 4 years, no one cares anymore. They never have. I don’t wonder how I will be remembered,  I just know I won’t be.
I realize that there are people out there so much worse off than me, who face each day with a smile and lay down with a prayer every night. I obviously can’t. I know I have to, but I can’t. I know I blame and I know complaining doesn’t do shit.
I guess I don’t know what I want anymore. I’ve had it a couple times and as soon as I was comfortable enough to believe I could trust it, I lost it all. I will never again have the opportunity to raise a family,  not how want to. No I have to do this divorced, weekend shit thing because my heart and soul can’t allow me to be around the life I made and had to give away. I’m not Bruce Willis who can hang with the ex and her man and still be awesome about things. She didn’t allow for any of that doing what she did and yet, she uses it against me. They all do. My hurt, pain, and loss are just weapons that people use against me. To hurt me. To belittle me. To show me how much better they are then me. To tell everyone who will listen that I am nothing because of my reaction to it all.
I want to build a new life on the anger, for me to be selfish like all of them. I can’t.  I worry about shit that doesn’t happen, won’t happen, and didn’t happen. I feel so God awful guilty if I do anything for myself because of others. I can’t accept a notion that as my sons get older they will want me in their lives other than a holiday.
 
It’s all just me. I have created this Hell I am stuck in. My thoughts and fears. My sense of time and life. My stupid hopes and dreams. My actions or lack of them. I thought I played the game right. I stayed loyal, I worked hard, I sacrificed living a life for just me alone to make others happy. I spent my days wondering how to make her comfortable and secure. What I could do for the kids to give them a childhood like I had. I didn’t make selfish decisions based on “you only have one life and only so much time” and because I didn’t,  everyone has used me and never once apologized or tried to make it up to me. Instead I’m told to suck it up, get over it and that’s life. I’ve never once thrown someone under the bus for my advancement or needs, yet I’ve become part of the pavement for them.
So I guess that’s how I will be remembered, if at all, as the easiest mark to use to get ahead. Oh that loser who we lied to and cheated over. That guy who did all that stuff to make our job easier. That idiot who spent years making a home and family for me to slide into.
I think I’m done with it all. I don’t know, I guess we’ll see how the rest of today plays out.

415,https://www.opendiary.com/m/newt316/thursday-night-123-6196477/,2023-02-09,Thursday night,"
I’ll try to not turn this into the regular poor me post. I just have to write, I guess if I actually had someone to sit down with I wouldn’t be writing.
So I’m once again having the urge to write Patty. It won’t make a difference and it won’t change anything. It’s been me all along thinking things are different or not what it seems. Yeah, it hurts that she did what she did and how she did. But, she did it. Most of my issues come down to me not feeling like anyone cares. She doesn’t have to love me, no one has to, but I don’t understand hers and others attitudes towards me.
It makes me laugh when i think back then when I was spiraling into a dark, dark place I was told people don’t know what to say, so they day and do nothing. Four years later, I should be over it and not mention it.
I have flashes of a new life. I have allowed the thoughts to come to me about it all. I see a man I want to be going forward. Yet, I am weighed down by all of the shit that’s come to pass.
How do you take it day by day when you have no real support in actual life? I have tried to get help (social services), they have all refused because I make too much in unemployment.
How do you move on (financially) when ots all stacked against you from the start? Yes, I was stupid for giving her everything. I did so because I thought she may have remembered I never did anything wrong and things weren’t as bad as she thought. I thought she cared enough, even with the lost love, that she didn’t want me to suffer as I have.
She doesn’t. If she does, then she refuses to allow it.
People here know me and they know I am not a horrible man. They know I made her and the boys my world. It still hurts that not one person stood up for me. Not one person held her accountable, instead they took the fact that I lost my mind about it as I deserved it all.
Whatever. It’s done. My actions or lack of them has proven everyone correct. They don’t want to see or understand what I have been through or how life seems to toss me endless amounts of curve balls. I hear shit from people, who have had jobs for 20+ years, that it’s must be my fault, I lost my job. I did something to lose my lease.
When it happens to them it’s a cruel horrible happening. They all lift each other up when it gets tough.
When it’s been me, it’s all just an attention asking narcissistic made up bull shit thing.

I have just made a standing order with the Salvation Army to donate a ton of stuff. My couch, chair, end tables, coffee table, and bed. Why? Because 1, I have no one to help me move and there’s no way to afford help. 2, Chances are I’m going to have to find a studio place or worse, sleep in my truck. I can probably afford a small storage place for odd boxes and stuff. I worry about moving the tvs. Yes somehow I have wound up with 2 big flat screens. I don’t do FB so no marketplace and have no clue how to do Craigslist. There was another, I just can’t remember the name.
Even with all that being donated, I feel I still have too much. I would love to just load up my clothes and some pictures and leave in the night. Leave all the shit for the land lord. I wish I could find that man in myself. Just pick up and go, screw everyone. But where to? Nowhere. I have nowhere to go.
I wish I could be one of these “van” people. Hell, I would settle for living in the truck if I had a cap for the bed.
I’ll let you all in to a secret. I have been offered a place to stay for a bit, but every atom in my body is telling me not to. I have mentioned this person before. I know she has designs on me. She has always held a flame. It’s just, I don’t. I have absolutely no attraction towards her and as much as I would really like to take a few weeks to save up, I just see things going to shit quick here.
I can’t shake the thought that she, even knowing I am not interested,  will see this as way more than a friend helping a friend. I see this going to a very uncomfortable relationship where in the end I will somehow come out worse then when I went in.  This isn’t a ” hey I have an extra room” thing, this is a I will force my kids out of their room for you or you can use the family room thing. A, I have younger female children, thing. Way too much to go sideways thing.
Could she actually be just a concerned person who wants to help? Yes, but there’s way too much things that feels wrong to me, too many things that can go to shit, especially in this day and age. No, I’m not some user dirty old creepy man, but all it takes is a lie. I think you know what I mean.

Although my living situation is up in the air, I was offered an interview for a job yesterday. That gave me a nice shot of positivity I have been lacking.
Until this morning
The email came at 4 am, well atleast that is what outlook said. The ol’ thanks but no thanks letter.
"
419,https://www.opendiary.com/m/newt316/patience-228-6197083/,2023-02-12,Patience,"
I have never been able to be patient. In my experience being patient is just another way to miss out or lose. I realize that sounds stupid, but I patiently waited for Patty to get things out of her system and now she’s remarried and I am having the roughest time in my life. Maybe if I would have fought more or talked more….
I have been patiently waiting on hearing on this apartment and I feel like I’m out of luck now because I should have pestered the shit out of them. Yet if I pester then it becomes annoying.
I’m off track here. Thing is I have a countdown. I have about 15 weeks left on unemployment and I have a little less than 2 months before I am homeless. Looking at it, it seems like a lot of time to most people, but I have never looked at time that way. I am in panic mode, which is even worse being on my own, and that is making my already anxious brain worse.
There was a time that it seemed like I got everything I set my mind to. Jobs, relationships, possessions just seemed to come to me. I don’t remember being any different then I am now other then 90lbs lighter and a somewhat full head of hair. Oh and also 20+ years younger.
I guess the whole “thanks but no thanks” email from the job I was told I would have an interview with is causing a panic in me along with the week of waiting to hear about this apartment.
"
420,https://www.opendiary.com/m/newt316/the-carrot-and-the-donkey-6197470/,2023-02-13,The carrot and the donkey,"
I had an extremely horrible weekend with the thoughts and feels. The boys went to my sister’s for the weekend to celebrate their uncle’s birthday. So I pushed through, alone, with no one to talk to. I thought about calling the crisis line just to have a conversation. So yeah, that’s how the weekend went.
I woke up today to a email about the studio apartment. They wanted to do background and credit check. Dumped $20 for it and explained to them my credit sucks due to the divorce fall out. They asked for my last to pay stubs to see if I could afford a $475 place. I don’t have pay stubs. I have a letter from unemployment. I almost make the same amount on unemployment as I did working. I pay over $715 here and still have everything paid.
They haven’t responded.
I wrote a heart felt plea. I told them I needed this place. I told them I wanted to be there for my boys. I told them they could trust me and I would do anything.
 
The shitty thing is all of this happened after the tele-session with my therapist. When I talked to her, I had thought it was all set. I made the small talk and told her that I was doing great with the possibility. Then what seemed moments later afterwards, I get the email about the stubs that I couldn’t provide.
I know that silence doesn’t always mean something bad. I know people get busy and they don’t sit waiting on my answer. But, I know how this world seems to hate me enough that it dangles hope at me and pulls it away when I grab. Its been that way for 4 years.
I’m tired of waiting for things to turn my way. I have done nothing for 4 years but wait. That whole “it gets better” thing has yet to happen, but the “it get worse” shit happens on an almost daily basis. Now I have heald somewhat contrary of my writing and I am at a point where I know kind of what I need to be this new person. I can’t get there. Every single time in the last 2 years I made a plan and worked towards it, everything goes to shit without any reason or missteps from me. The job and apartment loses all happened way out of my control. I’ve can’t even get a break with a place the size of my current living room for almost $300 less then I can pay now.
It’s really one thing to keep the faith when you have support around you. It’s a whole other chore when you are alone. Maybe I am not meant to be fixed. Maybe I have out lived my usefulness to anyone. All I know is I really feel like this is a final straw moment.

Today I had an interview. It went well, my hopes are up. But, I don’t want them to be. I don’t want to fall anymore.
Yesterday morning was awesome. I was told I still had thus interview and I was right there with the apartment I wanted, or so I thought. By noon it seemed that it all crashed down. Again…
He hasn’t reached out at all about the place since I explained my circumstances at the moment. I explained and promised I can pay for it and there would be no issues whatsoever.
Why should I even think that someone would give me a chance? I have gone through 4 years of people leaving, people refusing to talk to me, people more or less making light of my pain. I busted my ass for a place that laid me off with a phone call and that was that. I pay rent on time and I am close to being a model renter, didn’t matter, I was put out like trash. Friends never call, never respond. Same as my siblings.
Why should this be any different?
 
I just would like someone to explain what It was or is that I’ve done. I don’t understand.  Years of therapy hasn’t made it make sense.
I’m just tired of losing and being so alone why I do.

422,https://www.opendiary.com/m/newt316/not-knowing-21-6197822/,2023-02-15,Not knowing,"
I truly believe there’s something very wrong with me, that several therapists nor I can figure out.
What did I do to people? Seriously, I need to know…
Why is it that Patty seems to hate me so much? I did nothing to make her so resentful. I admit I was bad with money. I admit she was the only one I could talk to. I admit that I was sad and depressed that I couldn’t give her a better life, but she was the one who cheated and ended it all. Not some, time away put it in prospective thing, but an all out, burn it to the ground, and salt the Earth thing. Why?
I don’t expect to be friends. Hell I don’t expect to put on a show for the kids. I just want to understand what it was that I did or didn’t do. Why a person who for 20 years had a pretty loving life together turn around and do this like she did.
Do I ask her? It’s never worked in the past, so no. Do I ask anyone? Not one person stepped up for me in any of this.
Really, I can understand hate when it comes to a murderer. Someone that did such an awful terrible thing. I can’t understand why people would hate the victim though.
Is it a defensive thing she did and it has somehow become real in her head? Is it 4 years of him and her yenta friends filling her head with nonsense?  Sure she has reason to be angry at me. I have had a tough time keeping up on child support. I didn’t help out with Jonathan’s college stuff. She was left with shity credit, same as me. But this?
Yes. I know I should just wash my hands of it all. What’s done is done, but I have gone through miles of shit over these past 4 years because of this without even knowing why she “fell out of love” or why she seemingly hates me so much. I have watched as the people who “love” me and “support” me all turned from me and won’t even talk to me now. I realize that everything doesn’t have an answer.

Yes, hope. Something I screamed to the heavens that I would no longer have. Yet, here I am sitting outside of a possible new job, new career. The interview went good and today is what called “shadowing” where I sit with someone for a hour or so and see the job in action.
More to come…

424,https://www.opendiary.com/m/newt316/hope-2-0-6197888/,2023-02-16,Hope 2.0,"
So the “shadowing” went well. Tried to ask the sort of questions one would when wanting to be hired.
The man I was 10 – 20 years ago would say this job is as good as mine. The last few years has taught me that I shouldn’t make the assumption.  So here’s to the next few days and hoping the call comes.

Like everything for me, things just come out of nowhere all at once.
So the apartment is mine, for $1050 by the 1st. I have $350, was $600 but my car loan servicer was supposed to take a half payment but took a full one. It sucks, but it’s done.
Now the asking and begging begins.
The job seems to be happening and probably will be smack dab in the middle of the apartment drama. I was hoping to be in the new place before the job kicks in, but I have never had something just go easy for me
Ok, I know, these are good things and I am totally happy about them, but even too much chocolate at one time can be too much.
So anyway,  I’m going to need to borrow some money and the options are limited. Do I ask my sister and listen to the guilt about having to or do I take the offer by a friend who will see it not as a loan, but as validation of her interest in me? She is a nice person, but I have no interest other than friends and although her offer may just be that, my instincts tell me not to. Especially since I am going back to a small village where everyone is up in your shit.

So everything is kind if in a weird holding pattern. Waiting on money to hit the bank, waiting on background results, waiting on getting the last little bit of the security deposit and 1st rent so I can actually move things which either way has to happen before next Wednesday.
I don’t have anyone I can borrow the last $400 I need, so that will come down to the last minute.
Now will the weather hold? Will I find stone to help move all this stuff? Will I have utilities the same day? Is this all a huge mistake? Can I do this and stay sane?
I have to older boy who can helped and one 10 year old who thinks he can. My oldest won’t be home in time, the others are all back in school next week so I wont have help until the afternoon and I not sure if the weather will hold.
So yes I am allowing all the what ifs to cloud my head with anxiety. Well that and the usual things that eat my sanity away.
It’s a horrible thing when you can’t stop yourself from thinking, remembering,  and dwelling. I am working on it, for 4 years I’ve been working on it. It all sounds so silly to everyone. People have all made me feel worthless for my feelings and thoughts. Yes, I have paid several people to understand and allow me to repeat the same shit over and over, day in day out, and every single time we talk. I had one dream, one hope from the time I met my ex. All roads led and ended with her. I don’t have anything close to hopes and dreams for me, just for the boys, and I don’t even know if I can fulfill those. And because of that, just that, I am throwing myself back into the fire I never started, but have always been blamed for.

I am always in panic mode. Sometimes it’s the loneliness panic, others it’s the future panic. Worthless panic, happy panic, lost panic, and hurt panic.
I haven’t had a moment since it all ended where I was just calm. Where I could just sit there and watch the world go by for a day or even just an afternoon. Even the things that have gone right for me cause me to panic.
Yes, I got a new place, pretty quick after losing this one, but that comes with the panic of moving, not having help to move, not having money to hire someone to move me. Then the panic, it’s way smaller then what I have now, will I constantly “bump” into her or him, with this being mostly about seeing my kids, will they come over and stop by?
Yes, I found a new job but the panic is will I be able to learn it, will they let me go if I can’t quickly enough, will this become yet another job the I am laid off from when things get slow.
 
Ugh

I received a text from my son today. He was asking for some beeswax. Yes, that is odd. I call him and I’m told oops sorry that was meant for Ed, the step-father.
Now, I’m not naive, I realize there’s a relationship between the boys and him. What hurts though is how quickly and completely that relationship happened. I’m not kidding when I say I feel like everyone, everyone thought this was the best thing Patty ever did instead of anger that see cheated and broke her family up.
Now it leads me into the thoughts. Did she ever love me? Just what did she say about us or me to everyone? How can a person be with someone for 20 years and now treat them as if they never existed?
These thoughts are the killer that I am so tired of fighting. Try as I may, I can’t just say fuck everyone’s opinions of me.

It’s been too much too soon. It’s essentially made me sick. It funny what your brain can do to your body and health.
There’s more, I just don’t know how to put it in words. It’s sadness, happiness,  worthless,  needed but not needed, and confusion. Lots of confusion.
I miss my family. I miss her. I don’t know why anymore. I can’t remember her face, her touch, or her smell, but I miss it so much.
My head hurts so bad right now.

The boys just stopped over with my sister. They had all gone out to a restaurant somewhere. My birthday is tomorrow so they came with the usual no thought behind it gifts a father gets. This year’s socks, not just ordinary sock but arthritis socks that go up to my knees.
Anyway, I asked them to stay and they didn’t want to. Even the little 2 didn’t want to.
This has ripped my heart out. I can barely see what I am typing as I sob writing this. Have I not paid enough for all this? I didn’t do anything but here I am 4 years in and they all just have dismissed me from their lives and see and treat me as an occasional thought.
I don’t know how to live this way. I have talked to countless therapists, psychiatrists, and even you guys on here about how to handle it all. Nothing wants to stick. My own boys don’t want to see me as anything more than a distraction.
I never had big dreams. I didn’t want to be a astronaut or a doctor. I just wanted to have and raise a family like my parents did us. Why was it taken away? Finances?
I’m so lost right now. I have no one near to turn to. No where to go. I’ve just decided to walk right back into the oven by moving back to the village. I chose to go and surround myself with liars, cheaters, non-supportive ass clowns as friends, siblings who just see me as the last born who ruined the good times they were having before I was born, and rumors. In reality I’ve made myself more of a prisoner to it all by doing this. I will see them, I will bump into them. Whatever she has said to make herself the victim will make everyone look at me as “he’s the one”.
I’m going to be 52 years old tomorrow at approximately 6:30 pm and I don’t remember how to be happy or relaxed or secure or even how it feels to have love ones around you with cake and companionship.

So I’m 52 now. Not anywhere in life I wanted to be.
No party
No phone calls
Yeah, I guess the boys said something yesterday,  but I thought I would get a call today.
Oh well, just another Sunday
I do this every year since the end of my marriage. I look forward to my birthday only to be disappointed and reminded that  alone.
For 48 years, there was a party, a cake, or something. These last 4 years have been waiting for a call, visit, or message and never receiving any. I get it, people said something a day or two ago, so why say it again. It’s just I keep building myself for the inevitable disappointment and now I’m sitting here trying to convince myself I’m not hated and I mean something to someone.
I’m not doing that good at it

Why is it that I seem to feel better after talking to my therapist yet when I really thunk about it, nothing seemed to have been solved?
I just feel for all the talking I’ve done, Mt life would be so much different. It is, but not how I imagined it. Then again, who is living the life they imagined?
I feel if I live for me everything and everyone will suffer, eventhough they don’t live for me at all. I’ve all said that no one has ever lived or died for me as I seem to for them. I mean here I am still stressing for a woman who took all my fears, sadness, and loyalty and used them for her own gains against me and even let others know them to also use against me.
This week is so fucked up with moving and transferring stuff. It’s only Monday and I am just so anxious and tired.

The week has come, time to move and prepare for the new job. I should be excited and filled with happiness, but I’m not. All of this is proving to be just as difficult and lonely as the last several years have been.
Oh, I heard about all the help and I listened to the lectures of getting rid of things. I was yelled at when I mentioned renting an uhaul or a moving company. I was told there would be my brother in law’s truck and if she had to my sister would move my shit on her own. I was promised so much assistance I wouldn’t know what to do with it all.
Yeah, no one showed, no help, no truck, and nobody. The same as the week I moved out of my home I shared with my ex. The same when I moved here. All talk, all guilt, and no help. But, if I even say one thing about it, I become the ungrateful ass, yet again.
Because of the “guilt trip” my sister has put on me these 4 years, I can’t make a decision without spending atleast several days sick to my stomach with anxiety.  Why do I give her so much power? Because she is my only real family left. I honestly can’t tell you if either one of my brothers is still alive. I’m a mommas boy, I admit it. The women in my life hold an important place over me. I crave their acceptance of me and need their understanding.  I didn’t have a controlling relationship with my mom. She wasn’t a Smother, but she was there to listen, console, and assure me. My father taught me to respect the women in my life as he had growing up. He was the only boy in his family beside my Grandfather, obviously, but he learned to accept, honor, and respect his mother and sisters no matter what. I had always had a good relationship with my sister and I have no clue when that all went to shit. IDK, maybe when my mom fell into dementia or how I let my first ex kind of walk over me about my daughter. *Remember the respect thing I had ingrained in me, she didn’t walk over me, I did what I thought was right.
I loved Patty, still do. She was my rock for many years until she chose not to be in what seemed to be in a matter of hours. With being that rock, I gave her my “power”, my consensus, and my confidence. My actions were always to make sure she was happy and I stopped thinking of me.
I guess the whole point I am failing to say is, I can’t do anything for myself without feeling guilt, regret, or irresponsibility. Point is for all the lectures and promises of help and such, nothing has came from it. My life has become what only can be described as a dumpster fire. It is so apparent that even a stranger can see I have been put through some crazy shit, but that doesn’t stop Patty, my sister, or others from twisting me into knots if I am not doing or reacting how they want me to.
Maybe I am selfish and narcissistic, but not really once in this whole life changing 4 year rut have I ever felt that the people who should have cared and been there for me, cared and been there for me.
Yes, I know and have learned that I have to love myself.
Yes, I am the only person I can rely on to really be there for myself.
Yes, I realize at the end of the day the only opinion the matters is mine and maybe my children.
I know all this and that’s the sad thing. I still allow it all to run roughshod over me daily. Always worried how it will effect others. At no time do I believe that either my ex, my sister, or even my friends consider me or my feelings when they do anything, even if I am included or effected.

I’ve been sitting outside the new place for almost an hour waiting on the manager to show with the keys.
WHAT HAVE I DONE?
Not that I had too much choice, but this is going to suck. I am asking soo much of myself by moving back here. The love I once had for my hometown is gone, that to was ripped away from me with the divorce.
Not that I ever thought I moved on in these last 4 years, but today is really feeling like I have totally fell right down to the bottom all over again.
"
437,https://www.opendiary.com/m/newt316/moving-day-part-2-6200579/,2023-03-01,Moving day part 2,"
So most of the major stuff is in the place. How to describe this place? Small, really small. It’s in a condition you would expect a $475 rented studio to be in. Just have to get past the icky feel of it and clean. Lots of cleaning. Kill it with bleach…
Emotionally I don’t know how to feel. Although none of this was my fault, losing my place, I still feel like a failure. I lived in a comfortable failure house for years and now I am scraping what seems to feel like the bottom.
Patty called me.
The first time I have heard her voice in over 3 years. Every word was torture to hear and say. She asked me to take the boys to the dentist, her suv was having brake issues. Seeing that this is the reason for coming back, I agreed. She asked how I was doing. I lied.
I am doing everything to try to find the excitement in this, but I just can’t. To you it’s great news and a new start after months of crap. To me it’s yet another start over I never wanted or asked for. I mean, what’s the point when every time you start over it all comes crashing down.
I guess at the core of it all I am just mad. Mad that I’ve known several people who went through tough shit like I have, but had nothing but outpouring support and love. Mad that I am paying the price of others mistakes and broken promises. Mad that she has it so easy after doing what she did, how she did it. She broke her home up, destroyed her kids father, move another man in immediately, and never had once word or dirty glance come her way. I re-homed my dog and I was called a dog killer for months here.
Yes, I have wandered off the original topic, again. I just wish I had no compassion, no conscious, and no use for others, so I can just go seamlessly through life without looking back at any and all damage I leave in my wake. It feels like everything I do is a lesson. How I feel in the morning, a lesson about how to sleep. If I spend a selfish day doing nothing, something bad happens and I learn a lesson about doing something for me. I buy that thing, something breaks. I allow myself to exhale, my job lays me off at holiday time and my lease gets canceled. I fall over myself to get a new apartment,  it turns out to be an uncomfortable shit hole.
 
"
438,https://www.opendiary.com/m/newt316/the-call-114-6200597/,2023-03-01,The call,"
It’s still haunting me, talking to her after all this time. Should I say hearing her voice. I’m to a point where I hate how this still effects me,  but to force myself to not care feels worse.
I don’t want to let go. If I do they all win. Her and everyone who dismissed my hurt, sadness, and grief as nothing. I logically know that if she was to wake up tomorrow and want me back that it’s to broken. There’s whole sets of different feelings the boys are now tied to with him. Somehow if she was to leave him to come back to me, I know I will be the “home wrecker” and the bad guy that messed up his life. How fucked up is that?
Yet, I can’t get my head around a life without her. Yes, I have lived 4 years without her, but every single day, at some point it all rushes back in on me and hurts just as bad as the day it happened.
I just wish that someone will tell me what I am doing wrong, when I try so hard to do what’s right only to lose constantly.
I really want to talk at someone. Yes I wrote that right, I just want to spill my guts, again,  to someone. Why? I don’t know. 3 therapists, 2 psychiatrists, and 1 minister have never given any real answers. I just lose no matter what I do and how I do it. Since I was 17, it’s been a string of losing with the wins just setting up more painful losses.
Don’t get me wrong, my children, all 5 of them, are the greatest thing I’ve done in my life, but I was pushed out of their every day lives, while another man was brought in. Then no matter what I do, I hear the comments like he is there more then i am or he’s been a better step father than you have been a father. At no time does anyone see the facts that I was pushed away. I was left. I was put into a deep hole to have to climb out of. I get told that I’m single and I don’t have to pay for this or that when if they logically thought about things they would see that it’s all an uphill battle. I am paying for all the same utilities, car payments, and all that. By myself. I don’t have someone sharing their income with me. They live in a mortgage free house, while I am paying over $700 in rent. Even when there was a mortgage, it was nowhere near that much.
What happens to a person’s common sense when they break up a relationship for another? They push you off the boat and yell at you for drowning.  They shoot you in the heart and blame you for dying. They stick you into an impossible position and accuse you for being in that spot.
Do I think an ex should give a fuck? No, not all of them. There’s many reasons why they’re exs and I wouldn’t blame anyone if they treated an ex like shit because their relationship was a total shit show of abuse, cheating, lying, and drugs. But, a relatively stable relationship that falls apart because of finances or lost love shouldn’t be some sort of revenge thing where someone burns you to the ground and salts the Earth. Especially when you give them everything they want and don’t fight them for years for the salt and pepper shakers. Especially when they know you live them more than life itself, not a weird stalking love but a take a bullet type of love. I guess no one wants that anymore, instead it’s become a what can you do or give me to make me stay love. It’s become a selfish one sided make only yourself happy world where people are applauded for not making a choice and staying with it.
Would I have rather Patty stay with me and be miserable? No, but I believe if you make the commitment you do what you can to try and keep it. You don’t sit on hard feelings, insecurities, and annoyances only to let them fester until you’ve made yourself hate your partner so much that you literally destroy him or her, your children’s lives, and spit in the face of you extended family that treats you better than they ever did him or her. It would have hurt and I would try to do anything to solve it or change her mind, but it would atleast show you that there was some humanity and caring left, but the love has changed. I didn’t deserve this and yet she did it and everyone went along with it. I have never been “that guy”. The one who lies to cover for the real situation. When I say I worshiped her, I did. When I say I did everything I could to make her happy, comfortable, and safe, I did. When I say I was loyal, honorable, and truthful to her, I was. That alone should have had someone in my corner, but that’s all useless today. All that makes you seem weak. Makes you nothing but a sad push over, a simp, a joke.
Being that guy has done nothing for me except leave me alone, unloved, unneeded, worthless and broken.

This morning I feel as though during the night I was possessed and my body contorted into positions it wasn’t meant to. My back hurts so bad that I can’t seem to stand straight.
I know what you’re thinking, I just moved a bunch of stuff yesterday, but nothing was so heavy I had to strain to lift it.
I’m also having an issue just taking a nice breath. Starting to wonder if I maybe in the midst of a mild heart attack 🤔  I don’t think I am, but I’m at that age. All I know is I now have absolutely no time to fiddle and fuss at doctors and specialists. I haven’t shaken for almost 2 months now and went through the whole flemy stage about 3 weeks ago, yet it feels like I can’t take a deep breath and hold it.
Anyone who has followed my rants here probably know the worse is swirling in my brain. Cancer? Heart attack? Covid? Being a fat ass slob… or maybe I just need a good old fashioned back rub, a luxury I haven’t had since Patty.

Right off the bat, the noise. The old place was well away from the road so I didn’t have to hear every mufflerless car go by. The door is thin and it’s in a apartment building, so every loud talker is heard going around in the hall.
There is absolutely no storage and no room to have more. I have no clue how to make a big meal in the “kitchenette” let alone wash the dishes.
It’s for the boys, to be around the boys. I have to keep saying and thinking this or else I’m going to lose my mind.
"
441,https://www.opendiary.com/m/newt316/the-new-place-2-2-6200946/,2023-03-03,The new place 2,"
First night here. Think I slept OK. I have been feeling sick, gut stuff, for several days. It’s not helping my overall mood. I’m down to $20 and can’t tell you how I spent $200 in less than 2 days. It’s depressing really, on top of all the other depressing stuff.
I’m really feeling like I made a mistake renting here. It’s probably cozy for most, but I’m in no way comfortable here at all. Although I have a full size fridge and oven, but absolutely no room to do anything whether it’s cooking, washing dishes, or even using an one pot.
It’s wired like a building that was made in the 50s. There’s a total of 4 outlets in here and they are in the worst locations. There’s absolutely no water pressure for the bathroom sink and it took almost 5 minutes to get warm water. Shaving sucked.
I realize it’s all me. This all feels like I am falling backwards from whatever successes I’ve made these last few years. I realize I have to change my thinking and views if I want to get better and move on. I want to, I need to, but there’s just some sort of weird block in me that can’t move on.
It never fails that when I really need to talk about stuff, I don’t have an appointment with my therapist. It feels like I just want lose my mind, scream until I’m horse, and cry until I dry up and then never again think about anything. I just need someone or something to come along and make me feel wanted or needed. Make me stop feeling worthless and useless.
It’s my fault for judging me and my life on my ex and family’s happiness, comfort, and security, and never thought of my own.

I’m sitting here thinking about what the lesson I am supposed to be learning from all the shit of the last 4 years. Everything and everyone I lost. What is this “God’s plan” that I have been spiraling in for 4 years?  For all intents and purposes,  my “family” life and marriage are going along as if I was there, but I’m not. Why am I left out of my own dream I worked so hard to get to? Yes, my other place was sad and lonely at times, but it was certainly miles ahead of this one.
I should stop hating on it. This would be an awesome place for someone 35 or younger. I don’t have the patience to wait for this or that which can make this more liveable. Plus, do I really want to add more shit on top of everything else? I need a microwave cart or stand.
I’m finding myself wanting to contact her and fighting it. This is making for a very stressful and uncomfortable evening. I knew that this would happen.

Reason #246 I never wanted to live in an apartment building is this. As I left my place immediately there are 2 people sitting right there. Not being prepared, I mumbled a hello only to realize one of them has special needs and is very uncomfortable around men, which now became a thing as he began to scream.
I walked down the hall to leave, immediately enveloped by several strains of Marijuana being smoked by various neighbors. I guess smoke free only pertains to cigarettes.
I’m really starting to hate this.

I’m the guy at the end of the counter at the local dinner. As opposed to Derby, Silver Creek has two. This is Aunt Millies, the place to go here when you’re thinking of going out. My reasons, besides hunger, is to see if anyone will recognize me and actually come up to talk.
Seeing that I have now been referred to as Ed’s wife’s ex-husband twice now, I’m starting to wonder if I actually grew up here.
What I mean about the guy at the end of the counter is being that guy who intersects into strangers conversations and always says something cheesy to the waitresses. That’s my problem though, I know I’m about to do it and sure as shit I just do it and regret it as you can tell by the looks of people. Then it all rushes back in and I start to once again hate myself for being that weird guy and gow no one will ever want to be with me or befriend me.
So, there’s this rather attractive waitress that I would like to talk more to, but I’ve resigned myself with the fact that if there was something there she would show it. I really don’t understand dating anymore, not that I ever did seeing that all my relationships have ended like they have to a point where the exs couldn’t careless if I was run down by a semi.
Well I guess I’ll stick with the one thing I’m sure of in this world and how it will never make me sad.

I’m not sure why, but I almost feel like I am just a novelty to my sons. Not to be taken seriously, but kind of included out of pity.
I guess for me, life works differently. I had what comes down to a total mentaly and emotional break a few years ago without any sort of support from family or friends. I was told not to talk to the boys about it from the same people who refused to talk to me about it. What little support I managed to fund faded away as fast as it came.
Was I not allowed to “lose it”? Was I not allowed to shut down some?
So why is it these people around me who give me shit are allowed to ignore me when they choose? They can have their anxiety days and say such hurtful shit to me? They can cheat, lie, and end a marriage and people just go on as nothing happened, but the one moment I feel somewhat sorry for myself, I’m selfish and narcissistic.
“Well, you’re the one who disappeared.”
Yes, there was a very legitimate reason I did for almost a year, but no one cared. No one sat with the boys telling them that Dad lives them, but he’s very hurt. That he has abandoned them. They all wounded me and complained when I said it hurt, never once addressing what had happened and then one day bitching about me not letting it go. It’s like murdering someone and a few months later saying “what’s done is done” to the rotten corpse and getting mad that the corpse hasn’t moved or cleaned up their own murder site.
No one but me, the hurt one, has any guilt or even compassion about what I’ve gone through. I have some sort of messed up guilt about it all and every effort I have tried to do is feeling like it’s too late.
Like I said, my kids love me, I know, but it’s never going to be the relationship I always wanted from the first time I held each one in the delivery room. It just isn’t anymore. Now it’s a novelty. Spending the night at dad’s. Going for some fries. Stopping for 2 seconds to say hi. Nothing significant. Yes, make new memories. That to me still feels like the novelty. It’s not:
“Dad can you help me with homework”
“Dad come quick, Ethan fell off his bike”
” Daddy can I sleep with you, I had a nightmare”
“Dad can you teach me to shave”
She took all that from me and gave it to another. Sure they don’t call him Dad, but he’s the first to be asked, the first to be told.
If this was all because of finances and losing love, then way has it became such a vindictive push me out of their lives thing?
“Just talk to me about the boys,” she says. Then when I do it turns into the,” you owe $$$ for child support”. Not a how should we go about this or that. Not about an united front.
I’m just the guy who is supposed to pay and shut the fuck up, sometimes being allowed to enjoy their company.

So work is going good, I think. They expect my to do training and in the nicest way possible, thrown me to the wolves answering call, taking payments,  and writing applications. My anxiety is kicking in because I’m not hearing constant praise or criticism. I know, I’m crazy like that, working on it.
Jonathan is home for the week. I’ve seen him maybe 2 hours since Friday. We had plans tomorrow, but he decided to go with Mom and him instead. None of the other boys have called or visited. They’re busy and they’re kids. I’m sure someone will need a ride and Patty, him, or my sister will be too busy and put it on me one way or another. I guess I’ll have some time with Jonathan Sunday, I’ll have to drive him back to Alfred.
I’m currently sitting at Applebee’s, spending money I shouldn’t. I’m fighting the urge to play Quickdraw so there’s that. Maybe some bourbon street chicken will fill the void.

The one phrase I never wanted to hear again after all the drama of my 1st divorce and fallout is:
” You have to for the kids”
Before you take me to church on what I said, I mean hearing this and it meaning having to talk nice and act like every shitty thing Patty did to me, means nothing. Meaning I should sit with her and him and talk to him about the silly stuff my boys do.
I will never do that, I don’t care what the situation is. I don’t care.
 
"
456,https://www.opendiary.com/m/newt316/the-phrase-2-2-6204385/,2023-03-16,The phrase 2,"
I apparently struck a nerve with what I wrote. I do that a lot. Now I never meant to say that I wouldn’t sacrifice for my children. I have since I was 18 and my daughter was born. Where others can say they did something for themselves to benefit their kids, I can’t. I lived for each one. Did it seem like anyone looked at me as a good Father? No, no they didn’t. Neither of my ex’s considered my feelings and love for my children when they dumped me from their lives, nor did they care when they put new men in the children’s live immediately.
I know what some of you might think, “maybe it is you?”
Who knows? It probably is.
The point is, I do live for my kids. Hell, I live for everyone but me. My friends and family have acted like they couldn’t give a shit about me, but I just keep calling and texting.
When my daughter Kayla died, it was about how everyone but me lost something. I was told I had to be strong for the boys, while everyone else was pitied for their loss. I remember being dressed down when I had a moment where I said something about losing my daughter and how selfish I was for saying that.
What people don’t understand is I’m not some heartless bastard. I spent a lifetime being strong for everyone else and then I was totally broken by Patty and her betrayal. I needed someone to be strong for me and no one cared. The boys being young, didn’t understand, I get that, but it hurts that they never questioned why. My sister, who you would think would be there defending her brother, or at the least, have a few words to say to my ex, didn’t. She and the brother in law just went on like nothing happened. Friends didn’t gather around me and mother fuck my ex to support me, instead I was told shit happens. Yes the same friends I went out to track down the guys their exs cheated with. The same friends who I sat with countless times to make sure they didn’t make a stupid drunken decision.
So, I’m wrong for saying I will support my kids my way and not play at being buddy buddy with the ex and her new husband for the kids sake. People may see it as showing them how mature men should act. I see it more as allowing cheating and lying home wreckers to be accepted. My boys shouldn’t feel the need to be gracious to someone who flips their world upside-down, pissing on it, and dragging it through the mud. Especially after hearing that person make promises and loving remarks right up to hours before tearing you apart.
I want my boys to be pissed about the unfairness of what it means to be a man in a world that no longer allows a man to be a man. I’ve taught them to be chivalrous and respecting, but I don’t want them to be weak and allow the world to piss on them like it has to me.
So the critiques are right in my last entry, I am the problem.

It’s me.
Overthinking.
Stress.
Anxious feeling.
Racing thoughts.
Fear and anger.
Depression.
Pessimism.
Stuck in your head.
There’s finally a name for it all. Along with some other thing my psychiatrist is thinking.
I drove the boy back to school today so the 80 mile trip home alone didn’t help. I made the mistake of listening to 90s country music. I never really listened to the words. There was a song, “2 tear drops” that just about made me want to put my truck into a tree. Also a Diamond Rio song, “You’re gone” that made me hope that when I hit the tree the truck would explode…
Surprisingly though I’m home and somewhat centered. I’m not happy, nor am I content, but I’ve managed to learn how to numb myself and withdraw to quiet thoughts. Thing is, they just linger there waiting for me to let my guard down again.

I’m worn out. Thr constant mental adjustments all day to stay level headed is taking its toll. I realize most “sane” people do this everyday,  even unknowingly. I’m jealous, I lost that ability when I lost her, so now it’s one of those things that I have to be constantly aware of.
Am I doing better? Yes, but I feel as though I’ve had a constant headache these last few weeks of actively trying to not fall back into the muck. It’s like balancing on the spinning log like you see in the lumberjack games on ESPN.
I just never imagined I would be at a point where I can’t put trust into anyone. A point where I have to have suspicion about anyone and everyone in my life, knowing that at any point they can flip on me. It’s kind of torture for a man who live most of his life based on others.

Krista. My first girlfriend, first pretend wife. Time and living has been kind to her. Well at least her beauty.
I saw her and talked for a minute just today when I was out for breakfast.
All I wanted to ask is if she was still married and if she would like to go out. That would be a yes and no respectively.
We were inseparable during elementary but she blossomed in middle and high, while I stay as awkward as I am now.
Just yet another silly dream.

I’m really not enjoying being back here. The “plan” isn’t working as I thought it would. The boys don’t call more or stop by. If it wasn’t for me initiating things over the last couple weeks, I would hardly ever hear from them. I’ve been more or less, used by Patty to take the boys here and there, or pick them up, which I don’t mind, but it’s not really done with the intentions of her believing they need me in their lives.
I have been trying to be “more public”, but other than Krista the other day, no one has seemed to even notice me. I can’t shake the made up feeling of being a pariah here eventhough I was the victim in all of this. Then again, that’s how I’ve always felt since this went to shit 4 years ago.
The job is good, keeps me busy 9 hours a day, but the loneliness waits for me when it’s all done.
As you can see, I’m having a pretty low self esteem day. I know I have lost weight, but I feel disgustingly fat. I feel ugly and worthless. I know these are not who I am, but “sticks and stones”. My “bad” self is yelling the insults in my ear and it just doesn’t seem to know when to stop.
I’m missing being held like I hold my youngest. Just someone to cuddle up to and maybe a gentle back rub or a small slight tickle on the back of my neck. I don’t need sex, I would just settle for this. Maybe I am just a scared man child or maybe it’s because I’ve gone through 4 years of Hell and not had one person who was supposed to be close for me tell me things will be ok. I guess I’m not a “real man” and that’s why she and they left and I can’t find someone new.

$20 less in my account and a stomach ache. That’s where my “fuck it, just do it” attitude got me. Yeah, I flirted some. Of course the only ones to play along were married and obviously not like my ex and willing to destroy their husbands and families.
I seriously am trying to be better, be more self confident, but it seems as though things won’t change. I have been making all kinds of efforts to come out of my shell. Going out more, putting my self out there, it all feels like a colossal waste of time. No one has come up to me. No one has seemed remotely interested in having a conversation. I make a concerted effort to smile, be positive,  and not bring up the past, but I’m still left to feel like I’m no one. Unimportant. A waste of time to talk to.
By now, most people know I’m back in town. Enough people have seen me to get the mill running. Yet, no calls or texts. But, I guess I have to call and text and act as if all the shit they did doesn’t mean a thing while understanding I will never be allowed to treat them anywhere as shitty as they have all treated me.
Yes, I realize that you fake it to make it. I realize that no one will ever apologize or give a shit about what happened to me and what it has done to me. Even the “ones” who said they care haven’t talked to me since November.
It’s my fault for never learning how to enjoy me. Learned to be me for me and not for what others want from me. I guess if I want people in my life, my feelings shouldn’t matter.

I can’t listen to this without being thrown back in time. Not because the song is from 30 years ago, but because it’s just that kind of song that makes you long for a time when things were just … right.
Now I have to stay on top of everything, every thought, emotion, and choice so I no longer get overwhelmed by the shit I hold back and push away.
Life, for me, has this way of going all FUBAR if I take a moment to exhale. I’ve done a lot of soul searching and tons of forgiving and giving up, but I still can’t take my eyes off the road.
 
That song though, it reminds me there was a sweet few years where nothing went wrong and everything seemed to go my way. I haven’t had that since I was 18.

When I say I like with constant guilt, this is what I mean. I get lectured about living a single carefree life as if I left, by the ones who forced me out by cheating, lying, and blaming and somehow I have to tell myself that I’m ok.

It’s hard to. Hard to find happiness in another’s happiness. It’s seems kind of stupid to me to somehow make the one who more or less destroyed me, the victim. Hard to be happy for her,because she seems happy now when it came at the price of all of mine. I lost pretty much everything and everyone so she can have everything and everyone.

Besides the hundreds of other reasons, I found yet one more today.
I have been back to eating like a demented rabbit and trying to “move” around more. For the most part I felt like it was having some sort of difference, but one trusty scale latter and that all went to shit.
Now, it’s about 60° and I am dressed lightly and I still am tipping the scale at 265. The same 265 I was months ago when I felt like a slob. No I haven’t gained muscle weight.
What’s the point? I sit here giving up smoking, giving up pop, giving up food that tastes good. Hardly any carbs or processed junk. I am still just as fat.
I can’t push exercising because my knees are shot. Seriously, I started out walking today, thinking everything felt great. Halfway into the village both of the knees gave out. Currently I am sitting on a bench writing this and waiting for the pain to subside.
I had life figured out. I had a family to help me and I them. Now I’m alone, in pain, lonely and apparently not any skinnier than I was several months ago.

That’s all they are, comment if you must
 
I hate the fact that I no longer have friend and family support.
I hate that my biggest supporter and defender, now throws the biggest rocks at me. Bigger then I ever had hurled in my direction my whole life.
I hate that I think this way, but so far the acceptance way isn’t working.
I hate that I have tried to mend fences to no avail and then I hear nothing back. I have tried to make new friends and not one of them is interested.
 
I almost wish I could be one of these stars,  like Selena Gomez, who can fall out of the world and go to a rehab that is probably nothing more then a spa retreat. Have doctors look into my ouchies and psychiatrists listen to all my whines. Spend a month and not lose anything in the real world while away and walk out to the cheers and calls of bravery for it all.
Instead, I’m told I am not trying hard enough. Told that I have no disability so even if I do go into the hospital I can’t afford to. Told that if I miss more than a week or so, my job won’t be there. I have no one to drive me to a surgery or pick me up.
 
I came back to this village for the purpose of “reconnecting” with my sons and it’s going about as bad as when I lived miles away. I call nightly, ask nightly if they want to do this or that. I’ve been passed over for video games and trips with their Aunt.

One could say, he’s offering up some time to do something with me, but for a man who works 2 days and sits around the other 5 to also tell me he’s not interested in “hanging” speaks volumes.
I haven’t heard from the other.

Work is going well, just can’t seem to find the comfort zone I am comfortable with.
I’m told to let lose and come out of my shell, trouble is my “out of the shell” is a man 30 years younger. At my age, it will definitely come out as immature and asinine.

The job is going well. Me being me is making me feel as though it isn’t,  but it is. Trouble is, I have absolutely no money. Losing the other place, moving, and all the money to get into this one all put me back into a 30 foot hole, again, like the one that took me almost 3 years to crawl out of before.
With the other job I was bringing home almost $400 more. I’m not a person who gives my word and breaks it. I told the new one I was there for the long haul and I’m not going to work the streets trying to find a higher paying job that would probably treat me like crap.
I don’t really have anything to cut back on. Dropping OP saves me $4. I like my internet, it’s all I have for entertainment. I can drop all the +s and save I guess maybe $15 a month. I gave up smoking, so I don’t dump $ in that. I barely go out and have exactly 2 packs of tuna, 6 packs of Ramen, some oatmeal and 2 sticks of butter.
Doesn’t matter though, I’m barely hungry these days. The free ride of unemployment and free health insurance has come to an end, so prescriptions will sap the $70 savings I’ve managed to cobble together.
So, you see, everything good is followed by twice as many bad. I understand the “living day to day” thing, it would be easier not having to do it poor.

The 4th Easter without family how it used to be. Another man gets to enjoy my kids when they wake excited. Family dinner without me involved, both at home and at their Aunt’s, my own sister.

I stay strong for the boys. I see them for a couple hours, where they act as though nothing is any different being with me for a little bit. They fight and disagree, get angry and fight some more and then the visit is over before it even began. I drive them home to once again see a stranger doing what I used to do. No greeting from their mother, even though I had texted her hours ago. Quick hugs and that’s it for my Easter.

I just spent a moment at the old home I no longer recognize because all the renovating her and him have done, but memories of my Parents are still there, but as far as me, I’ve been erased from her and to a point, the boys lives.
They don’t have a picture of me to be seen, they never talk about me with her. She “conveniently” can’t remember anything about my involvement in their lives before January 2019. I can’t talk about it anymore,  no one want to listen.
I’ve lost 48 years of my life and the only memories I can share are with me alone.
 
I’m talking to a woman lately,  well texting anyway, but this has gone on for almost 2.5 years. It always ends the same, she just stops. When we do “talk” she never has time to meet and the few times she proposed it, she somehow had “something come up”. And this is the only person close to making an effort as far as I am considered.

You ever feel like you are playing the best game of something, doing everything right, only to stop and look around to see no one is even noticing. Then to top it off, when you say anything to them about it, you get a “yeah right” attitude and cold shoulders.
That’s how I feel now. Do I need a party for every milestone? No, but would it hurt to have someone say they are noticing. I could honestly give a shit about myself and smoking. I liked it. I never had the shakes or even a bad extended cough. I smoked all through covid and nothing. I enjoyed a cig with coffee or just enjoying a nice spring day on a bench. I quit for 4 boys who haven’t even said anything. I quit for those around me who bitched and complained. Nothing out of their cake holes either.
I know all these “healthy ” changes were for me, but I have no one to celebrate the “little” victories with anymore and I’m tired of being the lonely guy at the end of the counter.
It’s the same with food. I have really ate nothing but leaves and sticks. Drank nothing but water and coffee.  I still feel like shit. I haven’t smoken for 3 months and have ate this way and nothing.
Oh, and work, well that’s going to shit now too.  From day one I was thrown in the deep end and told to ask questions if I needed, mistakes happen. Except they don’t and I e been given shit every day. I have several hours of training materials that I have to somehow do without any time allowed to do it. Essentially I’m told to have fun, try something new, enjoy work, but do what I say to do. You have to be as lively and carefree as a 29 and 25 year old. They haven’t been beaten into submission by life like I have. They can enjoy their stupid outlook on shit. Sorry, I’m anxious. In the last 4 years I lost a wife, a home, all my dreams, hopes, and possessions. All my money, 2 jobs for no apparent reason and 2 apartments for no apparent reason. Sorry, when I get a feeling, it just gnaws at me.
Maybe I should have past this job up. Maybe I should have just given away all my shit and lived in my truck.

This is who I am and I guess I can see why no one would want to take a chance no matter how funny or charming. I’m 52 and I was 10x better off when I was 20. No savings, no real home, not too many possessions,  no real plan, and absolutely no retirement.  Oh I had all those, but now a man who did nothing gets to enjoy them with my ex. I’m left with child support payments until I’m mid 60, weird relationship with said children, and some odd mark on my forehead that screams loser.
I thought I had a great job, but that too was ripped away along with a nice apartment. Now I live in a closet and work for young people who talk to me like a child because I use “old” methods to get the same results. Part of my pay is commission, but because they think that I’m not performing like them they take credit for my good and chide me on my bad. Closed 2 loans totalling over 30k yesterday with all the bells and whistles and no one but me, them, and now you will ever know.
I can’t even begin to explain how bad I want to have a cigarette. Absolutely no one cares I quit. I don’t even know why anymore. One little bad habit that brought me joy gone.

I’m feeling defeated today. I told myself I would get to church, but didn’t make it. IDK, I guess I’m an old man and I believe you dress up for service and neither of the boys have dressy clothes. And yes, I know God doesn’t care about fashion.
Recently I’ve been trying to walk more and my hip is starting to hurt along with my knee. I guess I am extremely bull legged. Which I guess I am if you watch how my knees pop out to the side as I walk.
I’m a mess.
I’m trying to take care of myself, but I’m at a place where I just want satisfaction and that’s really not healthy.
The lady I’ve been chatting with is kind of neurotic and I’m back to feeling like I’ll be alone for the rest of my days.

Writing isn’t making anything better, it never really has. Most things I’ve written over the last 3 years I do with a face full of tears and an emptiness that can’t seem to be filled.
Am I personally “better”? I guess so, I don’t know. I can no longer find confidence and courage in myself. I’m just a broken animal that “jumps” and bows down to any sort of criticism or annoyances. I don’t think I can stand up for myself anymore.

WTF. WTF do people want from me? I make a man I work with uncomfortable because I talk to him like guys talk. Seriously he’s not gay, just met a very lovely girl he won’t shut the fuck up about. This homely little troll has a girlfriend and I can’t have a 2nd date.
Yes, to me he’s effeminate, sorry I’m old enough to be his Father. I don’t call him names or anything, I just say BS that 2 guy friends say. I guess there’s just one more person I can’t call friend.
I’m told to “be part of the team” but chided at every twist and turn. Even the job, told to do something and then punished for doing it.
For example…
I took an application for a person and I know I asked everything right. I have been beaten into submission to do so these last 3 weeks. Anyway, she shows up, can’t prove her income, that SHE TOLD ME and proceeds to throw my ass under the bus about. Guess who just had a 15 minute bitch session about how I don’t correctly do my job. Much like fighting a woke person, nothing is believed, facts don’t matter, and they can’t be wrong.
I more or less have given up on my 60 day bonus check. I guess I have to conform and be a whiney little effeminate bitch boy too. One that just keeps quiet and bends the knee to everyone.
There is absolutely no respect for me and what I have lived through in my life. When people think that me losing my daughter is equivalent to their dog passing or how my 20yr marriage falling apart with 4 children is like their girlfriend or boyfriend leaving after a year. Why can’t I find a job where I can just be alone, deal with who I need to and be left out of this silly ass shit.

So…. I have no clue how to deal with work. My boss is my age, but seems to want to hang with the younger 2 here. I am totally censored in what I can say because it disturbs the 33 year old man child who himself says some buckass crazy shit. The 26 year old girl has a personal issue with a customer that came in, didn’t even go to her, so she leaves and proceeds to have a liquid lunch and is given the rest of the day off to nurse her “bad feels”.
Seriously,  is that generation that sad we allow this shit? I saw my ex drive by the other day, could I have left work to nurse my “mad”? My boss cow tails to these 2 constantly. Now I know I’m new and still having issues with everything
 
I realize I’m an asshole, but I worked through a total mental breakdown because if I hadn’t, I wouldn’t have had a job. I also understand trying to be understanding and friendly with your employees, but as I said, I wouldn’t be able to do what these two get away with.

I guess I’m just meant to be alone now. Patty was my last chance and I blew it. I’m the guy at the end of the counter. I’m the warning parents give their children that they will become if they do wrong.
All I had to do was not be fucking weird, all I had to do was make the conversation about her more.
It’s always the same. What will be the brush off? Total ghost? The we’re at 2 different places? The I guess I’m not really looking? Or maybe she will come right out and tell me I suck.

That was the excuse. No get to know me. No meet up. Just not feeling it.
Fuck Patty. Fuck her for what she did and what it’s done to me.
Sure, it’s all on me to pull myself up, but she put me in a hole with smooth walls and no hand holds. Why? I did nothing to her, but 4 years later here I sit dealing with the fall out. She gladly collects over $500 from me as I scrounge together $3.50 for a pack of a Ramen and live in constant fear of losing what little I have.
And all I want is a friend. Someone to hug and make me feel like there’s a light somewhere,  but no.
Sitting outside of work wanting to give up. I don’t want to face another day with these people. Not face another day of backhanded “critiques” and being talked down to even if it’s said to be helping me learn.
I shaved last night so now I’m as ugly on the outside as I am on the inside.

Well, after all the BS about “it takes time” to learn the job, apparently the caring and team atmosphere turned against me. I guess I should have acted like a man half my age. I had a banner week, in my opinion,  last week, but I should have figured something was up.
So here I am, unemployed again, only this time I’m screwed. NY being how it is, I probably can’t get back on unemployment.
I don’t know what to do other than what I shouldn’t do. I’m a burden, a joke, and the farthest thing from a useful human being. I take up space and pull people down.
There’s a reason Patty left me. There’s a reason why the boys did seem bothered by me going. There’s a reason why my family and friends abandoned me.
This whole live for myself shit has me even wanting to leave me. It’s hard to not feel like a failure when that’s all you do no matter how hard you try. Getting back on the horse ended years ago. I can’t even get up from the ground.

Some people say it’s life and others call it change, but I see it as being replaced. Everything about me and who I am or I was has been replaced.
Patty replaced me, work replaced me, he replaced me as “dad”, my sister replaced me with her in laws, and even my friends replaced me.
I have to somehow accept the fact and no one else does. I have to change what now feels like every 4 months, lose everything all over again and be told that it’s all in my head.
I can’t afford my therapist who made it pretty clear when I said I needed to talk, but I didn’t think I could afford to with a heartfelt 🙏 and silence.
It’s bad enough everyone else thinks I do this all for attention. I deliberately lose jobs and break me myself so people “see” me.
I guess I hate me too.

487,https://www.opendiary.com/m/newt316/love-1910-6216462/,2023-05-20,Love,"
I miss having a relationship, eventhough I have learned over the last 4 years I never really had one. Well not how a person should anyway. I don’t think I’ve ever had one how a person should.
So I don’t know what I am missing at all. I think I know, but I honestly don’t. Chances are I never will.
All my “big” dreams of fatherhood and being a perfect husband are gone, replaced with doing the best I can for my kids and a head full of empty meaningless memories of a relationship that wasn’t.
I long for the return of these relationships where I was left, destroyed, and hurt because it was better than the loneliness I live in now.

If you can’t tell I’m back in a spot in my life where I’m doing everything in my power not to hate myself.
One would think this wouldn’t be a hard thing to deal with, but it is. Tonight’s a rough one for me. Especially after this week.
I hate being single, but there’s no one out there I want to be with. I want to be with someone who made every effort to keep that from ever happening again as quickly as she could. One person who took everything from me and permanently changed everything else.

I hate I’m back in the endless no sleep nights and days again. I just want normal without this being it. But, that’s the thing, this has become the “normal”. Not sleeping, stressing every night, over eating, and just hating the dawn of a new day.
For 4 years I’ve had to “restart” several times over and over. Some people think that it’s a great thing to be able to start fresh, they already have all they need. They haven’t lost everything that matters and more, over and over. What little faith I used to have about the “better tomorrow” is long gone after the 4th better tomorrow I’ve had to endure. By the 6th and 7th it stops being a wonderful thing.
What little faith I have keeps the razor and noose at bay. Keeps the pills in the cupboard.
I love my kids, but I can’t tell you the last time any of them or anyone has just shown up or called. It’s been me calling, begging for a relationship and for attention.
 
EDIT: I really don’t know why I keep writing. It’s not helping and going back to read stuff makes me realize I am what people think of me. Longing for attention. An attention whore.
Truth is, I’ve hated myself for so long, I don’t know any other way. As much as I try and do all the things my therapist and psychiatrist ask of me, it just doesn’t seem to work, which is more of an example of me not caring then them being wrong.

I know what I do and what’s wrong with me, but it doesn’t help to curb the feelings. I catastrophy. I have no idea how to spell that, but I see the worst in everything.
There seemed like there used to be a time where people would come up to me to talk or women would flirt, now it feels like I’m avoided no matter what my mood may be. Yes, I understand the concept of being happy to attract happy and all the hippie dippie stuff. I doesn’t  work for me. I’ve become all that I never wanted to be. I’ve become the man I always said I hope I wouldn’t be.

Fuck people are stupid. Then again so am I.
I waddled down to the shit bar in town, still not sure, I guess maybe I thought I might bumped into someone. Instead it’s a room full of sad loud talking drunks confessing their love to stupid shit, dirty looks at me for saying hi to someone who doesn’t even return the greeting.
Each one of these people are sad human, but I’m the saddest. They atleast have each other. I can’t even find a spot at the bar, so I am sitting off to the side by myself. How sad is that? I came here to feel not so alone and I’m more alone then when I walked in.
Sad thing is I will just have 1 beer and will walk home like I’m drunken because my knees are bad and cause me to stumble anyway.
