Yup, that’s right, I’m starting off this diary with a TMI. I don’t why this happens. I used to have an issue with my kidneys when I was younger and one doctor said that I would have a problem with bladder control when I’m older but other doctors didn’t agree with him. Anyway, I left my aunt’s house and was driving home and could nottttt hold my pee. It was an immediate sudden urge to pee and I tried and tried to hold it but I couldn’t. Luckily I was alone in the car. I drove home, got in the garage, took off my hoodie and wrapped it around my waist. We keep some cleaning supplies in the garage so I cleaned up the car, before walking in. I was surprised to discover my husband sitting upstairs in the office, so I didn’t have to face him or lie to him. I ran to the bathroom, took off my pants, and threw them in the washing machine. Then took a shower and put on a clean pair of pajama pants–good thing I didn’t put the laundry away yet.
So why am I telling you this… Well. My goal for this diary is to be vulnerable. I’ve spent so much of my life trying to please other people, trying to not get in trouble, and trying to make other people like me that I lost myself. And in the past few years, I’ve discovered that I’ve put on this mask and that’s how people see me. I want people to see the real me. I want to see the real me. So I’m writing it all down, holding myself accountable, learning and growing. Hopefully, the next few entries will be much more insightful: maybe a look at who I am and how I got here… I’ll try my best. I’m putting it all out there. This is me world. I just started knowing what it feels like to love myself, and I want to be the best person I can be.

Writing only because I’m holding myself accountable. I said I would write today. I didn’t get the WiFi from my friend so I’m writing from my phone.
it’s nice to be here with everyone. But weird at the same time. It’s like, a different me. When I lived in Colorado I felt like I started to find myself. I was away from my family and in a new state for the first time in my life. I found people who don’t even question who they are—they are sincere through and through. And knowing I can have people who are so open in my life, people who can get to know me and like me without the games or the drama helped me feel more human.
I feel like so many of my friends in my home state don’t really know me or understand me, or they have these preconceived notions of me and even when I don’t act accordingly, it’s hard to break those opinions.
kicked off this trip by me feeling like myself. What a gift. Going to sleep smiling tonight.

I got the wifi password, so here I am today typing away. Proud of myself for not missing a day yet. Halloween was fun. The party was weird, i was scared to drink too much. Idk why, i usually have no problems drinking too much. I think its because I’m not home, I’m not next to my husband. I take care of myself when I’m drunk but sometimes I get drunk anxiety. I usually brave and it spend the entire night trying not to have a panic attack and then spend the whole next day tired. But the last time I was having really bad drunk anxiety, I decided to wake up my husband. It was 100x better than I would’ve imagined, he talked me through my anxiety and then held me until I went to sleep. Then, when I would wake up mid-panic attack, he’d wake up with me and calm me down until I fell back asleep. I don’t think I’m going to get drunk anxiety tonight. I typically don’t when I’m around these friends. They’ve seen me at my worst and they know me so well (my anxiety is usually about something I said or something I did when I was drunk). But… idk… I just didn’t feel like drinking. I missed being home with my husband, even if it means doing nothing while he works. I didn’t even get to talk to him on the phone today because I was too busy.
But I realized something today. One of my friends is really sad, like if i wasn’t in Colorado he’d be sending me texts telling me how sad he is. He’s not over his last break-up. And while I hate seeing him so sad, and being this way for so long, I realized (and this is selfish, hard to admit, and difficult to type out), that I’m really happy. I spend so many days not being happy and I don’t know how I let myself live like that. I’m so happy with my life and where it’s going and I just want to enjoy my happiness. How lucky I am. How happy I am.

Okay… this whole “all lives matter” thing literally BAFFLES me. First of all, the people screaming “all lives matter” are the same group of people who are for the death penalty EVEN THOUGH THEY KNOW INNOCENT PEOPLE GET SENTENCED TO DEATH ALL THE TIME!!!! But, it’s not even about that. Discussing a certain group doesn’t diminish another one.
If all lives matter then you can separate all lives into different categories and each category of life will matter! If I say I love all fruits, then I can also logically say I love apples… It can be separated. Here’s a better example: Imagine my mom is sick (she’s not), and I’m telling you the story about how my mom is sick and while I’m telling you the story I say, “I hope she gets better my mom is so important to me.” Would you feel the need to correct me? Would you feel the need to say “isn’t your dad’s life also so important to you?” Probably not. Because saying my mom is important doesn’t mean my dad isn’t important to me. So if a Black man gets brutally murdered by police with bystanders watching with people recording with people all over the world as a witness and we say “BLACK LIVES MATTER” we’re not dismissing other races or other “lives” We’re simply saying Black lives matter as much as any other life. Also, since when is being anti-fascist a bad thing?! I’m so tired of this country man. So tired.
Okay, one last thought in my rant before I go to bed. Have you guys ever had a friend who claims you’re cheating when you’re not? I have a friend and if I play a card game or a board game with him and I beat him he always says I cheated. I never cheat at games, he knows that (he even accused me of cheating on a game of electronic chess), but he uses the excuse to make himself better. That’s always what Trump’s doing: “oh i’m losing, they must be cheating” only now its at the cost of our democracy. And people are protesting, I repeat, PROTESTING democracy. I hate to say this because it sounds so offensive but I’m going to say it anyone (if you’re reading this please don’t take offense, I literally don’t know you). I feel like so many people are so stupid. And maybe it’s because I went to law school. And I don’t mean that in an arrogant way. I mean, in law school you pretty much spend all your time with other law students, who are more intelligent and logical and open-minded. We can discuss and learn from each other and we also use facts when we speak. I’m not used to being out of law school. I’m not used to being around people who believe whatever they want and don’t want to be corrected.
In Arizona, sharpie-gate is going on… or was I guess people got over it. Someone spread a rumor that if using a sharpie on a ballot will cancel the ballot. Now this rumor originated because when you check your ballot status in arizona, if you go to the mail in website, and if you voted in person the mail-in status will say canceled. This is to ensure your vote doesn’t get counted twice. Sharpie is actually preferable on ballots because the ink dries the fastest so it has less of chance of smearing. Anyway, someone posted something about a protest and demanding getting a second vote and calling people to stand up with her. I responded her with articles and facts and information about tabulations and also debunked sharpie-gate. She responded by telling me I’m not respecting her freedom of speech and I should just leave her alone to believe whatever she wants since she doesn’t tell me what to believe. That’s great. So much for valuing self-growth and education. Another group of people told me that because arizona was “confirmed” and then removed as a blue state it’s proof that arizona was cheating. No. CNN never called Arizona. Fox news did, because they wanted an estimate on election day. They messed up, CNN said there’s too many uncounted votes to call Arizona. So in some news stations, Arizona went to a confirmed blue state to an unconfirmed state because the counts were suddenly getting close. No cheating going on, just premature reporting. Another person I know compared Trump to King David in the bible. Another is claiming that Hillary and liberals did the same thing 4 years ago. People were mad that Hillary won the popular vote but lost the electoral college but no one was screaming that there was voter fraud from tabulations or that Hillary shouldn’t concede. I’m so over people. I want to go back to Boulder and live in a Boulder bubble with all my law school people.

Seriously, how did i get so lucky?
We met in high school. And it took us a while before we began date–years. But it was love at first sight. I remember the feeling I got when I met him. It’s so hard to describe other than this intense happiness, so strong and so filling. Like nothing I’ve felt before. He felt it too, although I didn’t know it at the time. He told a group of my friends that he was going to end up marrying me. Everyone laughed. I laughed when they told me. But part of me felt happy.
Whenever he was gone that happiness would fade. I didn’t know that that was love.
He does so much for me. He works so hard to make sure I can reach my goals. He does everything he can to make me happy. I want to do something special for him for our anniversary (socially distanced, of course, we’re quarentiners because we believe in science). I just don’t know what to do yet.

If ya’ll don’t already know, I’m very liberal. I have a lot of family that is not. A lot of them, unfortunately, are very racist. Some live out of the country. Lately, they’ve been trying to pick fights with this unlicensed lawyer (bad idea, keep walking).
A much older cousin of mine who lives in Canada tried to throw me on the trump train a few months ago by sending me a very racist article. I called her out on her racism, very respectfully, with statistics and facts, laws and reasons, and a Biden plan for immigration. She responded with something along the lines of “respect your elders.”
So I responded too. I told her that I’ve lived in America longer than she has, so technicallyyyyyy I’m older in the facts of the situation. She didn’t like that. She called me stupid, said my parents failed at teaching me respect, and told me I should be ashamed of myself (for talking to an elder in that way).
Today, I had another distant family member, send me something completely false and extremely racist. I, again very respectfully, told her that her argument is false and based in fear. She told me to respect my elders.
I really really really wanna respond: “Respect your smarters.”
I’m tired of being nice to people who won’t listen to me.

I was watching Queer Eye today, and referring to politics someone said, “people wanna talk but they don’t want to listen.” I think part of the reason I get so upset is because I DO LISTEN. In fact, I ask questions, I try to understand the logic. But when it’s my turn to talk people don’t listen. I had a guy who spouted Qanon bullshit at a lunch I went to, and every time I would try to respond he would walk outside for a “smoke break” then come back and spout the same bullshit. I learned the listening lesson a while ago. Back in 2015 I had a conservative friend who was trying to argue about the wage gap (a male, who basically saying it doesn’t exist). After spending a long time arguing about why I deserve the same pay as him, I realized something. He wasn’t saying I don’t deserve the same pay as him, he was arguing that he thinks I would get the same pay as him. In other words, he was arguing there is no such thing as a wage gap. So I changed courses. I asked him to pretend him and I, with the same degree (technically, I had two at the time and he had one, but the poor male ego…) were up for the same job. I asked him to imagine that our resumes were identical. That we answered almost the same answers in our interviews, and that we had the same previous work experience. Then I told him to pretend we both got the job. Hooray. Wooo. We’re smart we did it. We get the same job, doing the EXACT same thing in identical offices right next to each other. We both work just as hard and do great work that is again, identical. Then I tell him that he gets paid $100/hour for his work. And I get paid $70/hour. And I had to stress this multiple times: ignore the real world, okay. this is the world i’ve created. this is a scenario. Now in this scenario… IS THAT RIGHT? IS THAT FAIR?
No. He said. He didn’t even hesitate. Now, convincing him that the wage gaps exists is a whole different thing. But, in that moment it was nice to know that his argument was based on ignorance and not sexism.
You can’t argue against something if you don’t know what the primary principle behind that argument is. I think it’s the philosophy major in me.
If we disagree about something important, then I believe that there’s a fundamental flaw in your logic. If I can’t find the flaw, I should reevaluate my own opinion. In order to find it, I need to ask questions, listen, and ask if it’s worth it to respond. Because you should always ask yourself what it would take to change your mind, and what you think it would take to change someone else’s mind. I’m open to change; I’ve found that most people aren’t.

I’m so proud of him!
I met my husband when I was 17, and we started dating when we were 21. Me, with my life all mapped out and him, completely going with the flow. If you would have met him then, you probably would’ve thought he was lost in his career. But he knew exactly what he wanted to do, he just didn’t know how to do it. One day, early in our relationship, I asked him where he pictured himself in five years. He said married to me (mission accomplished). But I asked him where he pictured himself working. He paused. For a really long time. And then he said he didn’t know. He couldn’t picture it. So I asked him, if he could do anything in the world, what would he want to do? He said engineer. I was not expecting that at all. He never really showed an interest in engineering, and I didn’t know that was something he’d even consider. And that’s how I knew he wanted it. I opened my laptop and started an application to the college I was already in. He was terrified.
“I can’t afford it”
“I don’t have time to do it”
“I’ll be in school forever”                                      and then.
“I’m not smart enough”
You don’t understand. My husband is the most confident man you’ll ever meet in your life. Seriously. He’s over-confident. Hearing those words broke my heart.
So I stopped filling out the application. I told him: “You are smart enough. You are smart enough to do anything. You are smart enough to do everything. And if this will make you happy, you owe it to yourself to do it.”
He didn’t argue, he just listed more objections. Mostly about how he can’t afford it, no matter how bad he wants it. I asked him if he could afford the $60 application fee. He said yes…. Then that’s the first step. We worry about the rest later.  We filled out the application together and I told him to sleep on it. Decide in the morning if he wants to submit it or not. He hit submit that night.
That was the easy part of this story.
So he gets in, and realizes he’s too young to get a loan without a cosigner, and he didn’t have a cosigner. This man worked 4 jobs and held a full-time schedule. No joke: he would go to school at 7am and not get home until 4am. Any free time he had he spent it with me, and both busy in our lives we spent our time mostly doing homework. He reached his breaking point more than once. He was so stressed and so overwhelmed and he would tell me he’s quitting. That’s it too much. That he can’t handle it. That he’s not sleeping. That he can’t even think straight.
I would love to say that I was supportive and told him to quit if he wanted to, but i wasn’t. I pushed him harder. It’s how I’ve always been raised. Honestly, I kind of regret it now. He needed support, not a push. But I pushed. I admit it. I would ask him if he still wants it. Ask him what he would do if he quits. Remind him how hard he’s worked. Talk about how amazing the future will be with us established in our careers. And then I’d tell him that I want him to finish. That his hard work means a lot to me. And on the days he can’t do it for himself, to do it for me. I think that was mean. I think I would’ve done it differently now. I would’ve been more supportive. Listen more to how he felt. At that time, I was overwhelmed too. Triple majoring, working two jobs, studying for the LSAT, applying to law schools. I couldn’t complain. In my family we don’t complain about schoolwork. In my family, education is the only way you’ll get anywhere in life, so you treat it like you love it, like you’re doing something fun, and you suck it up. Also, my parents were paying for my college, so any complaint was an insult to them. I didn’t have the time or the energy to give him the compassion he deserved during that hard time.
I graduated a year before him and went off to law school. His last year was easier. He was able to get a loan, and had moved up in one of his jobs where he could support himself. The long distance was hard. His graduation was the day of my Con Law final. I missed it. I still upset about it. He’s never brought it up. I can’t believe I missed it. I hate that I missed it. He did it. He endured so much and he graduated A YEAR EARLY! I’m so proud of him.
There’s more.
So right after he graduated he moved to Colorado and moved in with me (shhhh don’t tell my parents). The job hunt started. You see, he didn’t have any experience in the engineering field since he worked to support himself through school. He had worked in restaurants, bars, department stores, schools, any place that would hire him, so that he could actually go to school and then when he got out, no one wanted him because he didn’t have enough experience. Even entry level jobs wanted 3 years experience. We reached out to anyone we knew, every acquaintance, every acquaintance of acquaintance. We went to job fairs, he took an internship with undergrads, he emailed all his old professors begging for a contact. We applied to 50 jobs a day for a month. Then 10 jobs a day after that for who knows how long. Nothing. NOTHING. How can someone work so hard and not be recognized. He worked other jobs, but every rejection broke him a little bit more. We moved back to our home state, we got married, and still we were applying and still nothing. And then… Suddenly, a hit. An interview. High paying, high position, okay this is good. During the interview, he ran into one of those acquaintances we’ve reached out to. He said he’ll put in a word for him. A second interview. Then an offer later. After 2 years of relentlessly applying, he did it. Wow!  I was so happy! The big break we were waiting for! I wasn’t working, and it couldn’t have come at a better time! It wasn’t in the exact field he wanted, but it was a step.
And then…
A month goes by…
Enter. COVID.
He was fired.
I couldn’t believe it. I was always the hopeful one, but I lost hope. It destroyed me. He deserved this. He worked so hard for this. He finally got there and nothing. He remained hopeful. He kept applying. Two months ago, he applied to his dream job. They hired him almost instantly. I’ve never seen him happier! He absolutely loves every minute of work and he’s doing it all from home. Today, he got a promotion. He’s only been working there for two months and he got a promotion!
God, I’m so proud of him! The journey was tough, but he got there!
Did I mention how proud I am?
 
Okay I’m all typed out.
 
Sincerely,
WowThatWasWayTooLong

I’m trying to get in the habit of writing everyday but I don’t feel like I have much to say today. Husband had breakfast ready for me by the time I woke up. I spent about 6 hours studying. Working on building up my bar exam confidence. The major anxiety comes in waves and I’ve been doing a good job fighting it since I still have over 2 months to study.
My older brother and my niece came over a little bit. She’s two. It was her first time coming to my new place. She walked in and yelled “WOW I LOVE IT!” Her cuteness doesn’t help my major baby fever.
I need to go Christmas shopping but haven’t had the time. Money’s been tight, and we’ve been on a strict budget, and I know we have a little bit of room for family gifts, but it’s hard not to feel a little guilty for breaking the budget.
Haven’t talked to my twin in 10 days. Feels like forever. Even when I was in a different state we talked everyday. We’re not fighting or anything, she just needs a little bit of space. Even if I lie, being around me is a constant reminder she needs to leave her boyfriend, but she’s not ready yet. I wonder if I’ll see her for the Holidays this year. Probably not.
My younger brother was exposed to COVID at his work, so he had a test done and we’re waiting for the results. He has a little bit of a cough, but my mom is in denial that he could ever have it or give it to her. He doesn’t like my husband. He never really has, and he doesn’t try to hide it. In fact lately he’s just been pretending my husband doesn’t exist and not talking to him and pretending not to hear him. That’s gonna make Christmas fun this year 🙄
My grandpa’s dementia is getting worse. He forgot who I was the other day and then had tears in his eyes when he realized he forgot me. It’s hard to watch. What’s harder is watching my mom yell at him all the time. He’s not the easiest to be around but she doesn’t know how to handle him at all and it’s really sad to see.
I miss my grandma. Her and I were really close. It’s been 8 years since she passed. Lately I’ve been missing her more and more. I feel like she never got to see the real me. I’ve been dreaming about her more and more lately. I’ve been craving the sound of her voice. I used to have a voicemail of her on my phone but my asshole abusive ex made me delete it. I put it on a CD and it’s somewhere at my parents house.
I have a bunch of old home movies though. I ordered a VCR so I could watch them. She’ll be in them. I don’t want to forget her. The purest love I’ve ever felt. She held this family together. And weirdly enough, after she passed, that responsibility fell on me. I get, maybe, 60 phone calls a day from my family members, all with different problems, different drama, different stresses. And I have to know how to approach each one of them, and how to help each of them. It’s hard sometimes. Some days I have to stay up late and study or push off my schedule for a day because I get interrupted too many times.
My diet’s not working at all. I can’t starve myself and study. I just can’t. I’ve even cut alcohol. I love alcohol. It makes me happy. Even just a glass of wine before bed. But I haven’t drank in a couple weeks. Mainly because I don’t want the extra calories. But it isn’t helping. I’m eating unhealthy food and snacking way too much. I haven’t cooked in a couple weeks. I know if I go grocery shopping and cook I’ll start to lose the weight because I’ll start eating healthier. But I hate cooking. I guess I can make some chicken and vegetables tomorrow. My husband would like that. I also have been procrastinating ironing so now I have a huge pile to get to. I’ll try to do all that tomorrow, and study, and maybe Wednesday I’ll have time for Christmas shopping.
I hate going to sleep. I’m such a horrible insomniac. Apparently, I have been since I was born. Lately I’ve been completely unable to sleep. Also I’ve been sleeping a ton. I need to work on changing all these habits.
Maybe tomorrow. We’ll see.

Everyone says “treat bar prepping like a full-time job.” You get filled with stories of a strict 8-5 schedule that these people put together, where they show off how they work non-stop, take a lunch break, work some more, go to the gym, come back home and review.
I can’t do that.
I wake up and clean the house. By the time I’m done cleaning it’s my husband’s lunch break, so I make him lunch and sit with him for an hour watching tv or chatting. Then I clean up the mess we made eating and start studying. A few hours later, my husband’s off work. Lately he’s been staying in the office and watching tv so he won’t distract me. But soon enough its dinner time and then my day is just gone.
I don’t even have any kids. I just lose time doing so many things. Or maybe I am studying a lot, but the time goes by so fast I don’t feel it. I’ve hit my study goal every single day, so that’s something. I just feel so unproductive.
Today, I ordered a bunch of stuff on amazon but I still have more gifts I need to get. I’m going to put off studying and go shopping. I’ll do it tonight, or catch up tomorrow.
It’s not even that I need a break from studying. I haven’t hit that wall yet. I just need to get out of the house. My exercise has been me moving from the couch to the dining room table (my husband has taken over the office).

In other news, my brother’s covid test came back negative yay!
I texted my twin today. We’ve been chatting throughout the morning.
I’ll try to provide an update on how productive my day was later.

I actually ended up doing some bar prep today. I did a family law essay. It went okay. Generally, I’m pretty good at family law but this essay had a lot of civil procedure in it, and CivPro is my worst subject. If any lawyers are reading this and wanna explain the difference between PJ and SMJ and when I’m supposed to use each one or if i need both or how CivPro works in general feel free 😂If you don’t know a rule on an essay you’re supposed to make one up, so half the time I feel like Im just bullshitting an essay. Enough to pass? idk. I passed every class in law school including civpro (with a B-). They just announced that we’ll take the bar at home, which honestly is SO STUPID. They refused to do anything for the July bar with people begging for accommodations with COVID running rampant. Then my state ended up offering a shorter at home online optional October Bar with a state license only (I’m in UBE state, meaning my score is transferrable to other UBE states). That was a disaster. Had a 44% pass rate here. Now, they’re keeping the 2 day test, and the same time constraints, and the same everything but making us take it at home. My husband has to request work off those days and leave the house. The major problem is I handwrite everything. Not the actual essays–I type those–but my outlines to the essays. Even on the MBE (multiple choice) I make myself a roadmap in the margin. Like for contracts if it says something like a coffee shop owner contracts to buy 300 coffee mugs from a manufacturer, I’ll make a little image on the side so when I read the rest of the question I don’t get confused for who is who. In the MPT (one type of essay), i start from the end and flip through the pages quickly. How am i supposed to do that if its all online?! Ugh I’m annoyed and upset.
Anyway, an update on my day. After studying, I went to the mall for the first time in a year. Dousing myself in hand sanitizer every 10 seconds I officially finished Christmas shopping. I spent wayyyy too much money but I got everyone something I think they’ll like.
My twin and our dad are fighting. We didnt really talk about it, but I got the details from our mom today. I’m guessing she won’t be at Christmas. Probably also the reason she canceled our plans two weeks ago and I haven’t heard from her until I reached out today.
We might be transferring my grandpa to an assisted living place. Honestly, its for the best and we should’ve done it a year ago, but my mom was super against it. He lives with my aunt, my uncle, and their two daughters. Ever since my grandma passed he’s been a completely different person. He constantly thinks we’re plotting against him. Like, he thinks we made up COVID to keep him from leaving the house. He’s had multiple strokes and has aphasia (i think) so he can’t communicate very well. He did a lot of speech therapy but English isn’t his first language so it didn’t help much. He hasn’t been taking his medication correctly so my aunt started monitoring his pills, and giving it to him everyday. He threw a fit and claimed she’s trying to poison him. He has so much love in his heart but feels like a burden in his own home and feels like no one wants him there which just makes matters worse. After my grandma he found a “girlfriend” or “companion” as he liked to call her. She passed a few years ago and now he has no one. After his last stroke, his driver’s license was revoked. He took the test 3 times and failed, only to pass the 4th time. No one wants him driving, but no one can stop him. Whats sad for me is it’s hard to remember him before. Him when my grandma was alive. He was a totally different person. It was like when we lost my grandma, we lost him too. But really, all of us changed. She held this family together in a way I’ll never be able to.
She met my husband once. Before we were dating. When we were just friends in high school. I remember when he left she said “he’s so handsome, be careful with handsome men.” I wonder what she would’ve thought if she had gotten to know him. When she died I was dating my abusive ex. Everyone hated him. In her last days in hospice told me “if you marry him, he’ll take everything from you.” The relationship only lasted two months after that (well three, because he clung on that last month and refused to let me go). He didn’t want me to mourn. He compared it to his last break up. He drove me to the cemetery one day after we had a huge fight and kept me in the parking lot, and told I’d never be allowed to go to her grave again. That I needed to forget she ever existed. But then, he used to try to use her against me leaving him. Saying that he promised her he’d take care of me, and that he knows how much she loves me and blah blah blah. He really was a cruel man. As far as I know, he’s been single ever since we broke up. Thank God he’s not torturing another woman.
You know, there’s this writing challenge I saved years ago that I never did. A letter to a specific person in your life everyday for 30 days. You don’t send the letters, you just write them. I think I have a lot of people I have things to say to. I think I’m going to start the challenge on here tomorrow. To help me find some clarity.

To my twin.
Dear Soph,
I remember growing up when you used to tell other people your best friend. Different ones throughout the years. One time, I asked you why you didn’t say me, and you said “you don’t count, you’re my twin.” I misunderstood those words. I felt like you were saying your friends were more important. You always had so many, always in with the popular group. Always with the cutest outfits, best hair, best makeup. I remember sophomore year a random girl came up to me and said “I didn’t know Sophie’s your twin… she’s so pretty.” And when I agreed she said “no, SHE is so pretty.” But throughout the years, I learned that you meant I was your number one. I was in it til the end with you, and those others were just your friend, whereas I, was your family.
Forever, you will be the one person that understands. Our guilt and our hurt. Our secrets and our feelings. You’ve walked in it, everyday, in my shoes. I’m glad we still tell each other everything. That the days we see each other we just can’t shut up and spill every secret, and every feeling, we’ve been holding in from everyone else.
But Soph. I fucking miss you. The you before him. The strong you. Remember that hot guy you matched with on tinder years ago. Remember he canceled your date because he had to watch his dog. Remember what you said? “Can’t be with anyone who puts his dog before me.” And you blocked him.
I know Liam broke you. Unexpectedly, out of no where. I think maybe that was the first time you’ve been in love. I know I didn’t take it seriously. But Soph, you never let a guy walk all over you. You guys were so casual. And when he started treating you like shit, I thought you saw that. I didn’t think you’d fight so hard. He was an asshole. He didn’t invite you to the party. What would you have told me “fuck that, don’t give him the pleasure, lets go out that day and have the time of our lives, and he’ll come crawling back.” That’s what I thought you’d do, hell thats basically what I told you to do, but you went, and saw. There was no party. It just what he told you, so he could be with her. I’ll never understand how that broke you. How that led you to Richard. How you were weak with him from the start. He doesn’t even want you talk to me. I know. You won’t say it, but I know. I know by the way he doesn’t leave your side. By the way you sneak over here on your lunch breaks. And when he’s not home and I come see you and he calls you always have an excuse “oh she was in the area and just stopped by” or “oh she’s dropping off some groceries for me.” Why should you need an excuse to see me? How do you not see his isolation? You have no one left. You don’t see anyone, you don’t talk to anyone. I hate what he did to you. I hate how he changed you. You call me for advice on how to be strong. You’re the strong one sis.
Last time I told you all this you told me not to bring it up again. That you’re happy with him. Like this. If you’re happy, I want you to be happy. And I’ll be here, for whatever the future holds.
Because we’re in this together. Best friend.
 
 
God, you would hate this letter.

You are one of my biggest regrets.
Quiet girl meets popular guy. A full year of flirting, met with an acknowledgment of a crush. It really should’ve been very cute. It really should’ve ended there. It’s funny how much you changed me. How much you manipulated me. How much you hurt me. And yet, I never really knew you. Maybe your intentions weren’t as bad as I’ve filled in. Maybe you were just a regular teenage guy. And I, at 14, was too easily fooled. I had  no one to talk to. I started lying. I hid every piece of me from everyone. Soph, well because you flirted with her too. And my parents, because they would never approve. So I hid my feelings, first happy, then hurt, then confused, then heartbroken. When I look back on those days, I remember that you got decide the good days or the bad ones. If you would talk to me, I’d be happy, if you wouldn’t, I’d be obsessing. And I was gorgeous. Even though I didn’t know it at the time. I shouldn’t have wasted it on you. You never deserved me.
Really, the problem was with me. But if you were a nicer guy I would’ve had a much better life experience. You found every weakness and extorted it. You used ever bit of me. There’s still a little bit of an ache when I think about it.
Hiding myself filled me with anger. Not talking to anyone kept me lonely. Lying made me feel guilty. Your words made me lose my confidence, my shine, my smile, and myself. But I rebuilt. And while you were the first in my destruction, you weren’t the last.
I hope you forgot I existed. I hope you don’t even remember me. Because the me you knew, doesn’t exist, and should’ve never existed. I’m unbelievably strong now.  Self-confident, self-assured. I couldn’t tell a lie if I wanted to. My feelings come flooding out of me even when I try to keep them in. And I’m happy.
 
& one day, I’ll forget what you did to me.

Dear mom,
I originally started out this letter by talking about my childhood, but that doesn’t need to be relived.
I don’t have much to say, honestly. Our relationship is so strong. We talk about everything, we keep each other’s secrets.  I will forever be so grateful to you. You help me with everything, and try to decrease any stress I feel. I know we have a very special relationship. I know how deeply you love me. I feel it—I always have.
 
Dear dad,
People say girls turn in their mother when they grow old. I turned into you. I have every single of your traits. Your strength, your fearlessness, your anger, even your love for alcohol. We think exactly alike. It’s weird to know what you’re thinking all the time, but it’s great too. I know you see through me, too. You can tell when I’m having a horrible day even though I don’t say anything. I hide my emotions from you the most because I don’t want to disappoint you, I don’t want you to see me as less strong. But you see it. You don’t comment, you just take me out: shopping, a restaurant, followed by maybe a drink or two. My favorite thing about you is you’ve always valued my opinion and you’ve never questioned my choices. You make me feel worthy. Even if I were to ask you for advice you’d say something like “you know better than I do, you’ll do the right thing.” You’ve always let me speak my mind, even to family members who would judge the family for it. When I break norms, or say something controversial, or respond to a sexist comment someone said. You defend me. You defend me and my opinions. It feels really good to know you’ll always have my back. And that you ask me for my advice on big decisions in your life, and that you brag about me to everyone you know and encourage them to seek my advice, too. It’s nice to know you see me.

Nothing like the holidays to remind you how fucked up your family is… Or how fucked up you are. Lol. I’ve been off social media for 6 days. Today was a clean up my mess day. Tomorrow it’s back to studying.
I blacked out on Christmas. I don’t usually black out. I usually can drink all day and remember everything. But not eating does not help. Thankfully, it was just family. I guess I found my way to a bathroom and puked until my husband found me and took me home. Oh wellllll. Husband says I have a bad drinking day about once a year. Sounds pretty accurate. Honestly I feel like I just got back from a vacation. The work I’ve been putting off buried on top as well as some family anger I need to let go, and some family drama I’m desperately trying not to be a part of.
Apparently dad called my twin on Christmas (I was only at my parents house for like 2 hours before I took too many shots lol so i missed it). Apparently she yelled at him. He told her he didn’t call to fight, just to wish her a Merry Christmas. She called him today and they had a normal-ish conversation. She’s still not really talking to me. She’ll respond if I reach out first but keep it short and move on. I hate how she has this ability to act like nothing’s wrong and that she’s just busy when she knows I know the real issue. It’s fine. I’ll text her tomorrow. See if we can plan something for New Years. I doubt it, but I’m trying to be the bigger person. I watched an old home movie today. We were two. It’s funny watching us. We both barely talked to each other and just communicated through our actions. And we were both copying each other’s every move without realizing we were both doing it. I was more talkative, I would answer questions mom would ask her if I thought she didn’t know the answer so she wouldn’t embarrass herself. She was more of a daredevil, challenging me to break rules and then covering for me if I was caught.
I have such bad baby fever. But we need two incomes first. And a bigger house. Maybe next year.

I’m picking my younger brother for this one (I have an older brother, a younger brother, and a twin–I already wrote one to my twin on day 1).
Dude,
I feel like we couldn’t be more different. Even growing up. I was honestly such a bad older sister. I’m sorry. I’m sorry for putting you through my shit my whole life. I’m glad we’re closer now. But the closeness seems fake. Maybe it’s not fake. It’s just that I still don’t really understand you. I was like, the biggest nerd in school and you were… whatever the opposite of that is. I cared about everything and you didn’t care about anything or anyone. It’s easy to listen to you, it’s easy to give you advice. You always ask and mostly always listen… You’re just opinionated and aggressive. I never want to give you a reason to get mad because you take so long letting it go. I’m happy we’re closer. I’m happy you come to me and talk to me… You used to only go to Soph. Her you could understand. That’s so funny actually. You two understand each other and she understands me, but you never did.
I’m proud of you. You’ve come sooooo far. You pushed your way through battles. You learned so much. You worked your ass off. Don’t give up on your dreams, kid. You excel at everything you do. You’re already rocking this adulthood thing better than I am. I think the older you get, the closer we’ll get.

16,https://www.opendiary.com/m/vulnerableme/letter-5-to-my-dreams-2-5946182/,2020-12-31,Letter 5: to my dreams,"
Dear Dreams:
Why did you have to choose me to be so ambitious? Why did you have to make me want kids? Why did you have to make me competitive? At two, I knew the alphabet, the days of the week, the months of the year. I could count to 100, skip count by 2s (evens and odds and I knew the difference), by 4s, by 5s, and by 10s. Bilingual me would translate a word from language to another. It’s all on video. Admittedly, I don’t know how normal this is. I have a two year old niece and thats my only comparison. Even the gifted program was too easy for me. I desperately wanted to skip a grade, but my parents were afraid of what would happen if I skipped. College was a joke. People get mad when I say that, but I’m serious. I could not believe how easy it was to pass a class in college. Triple major, minimum 18 credits a semester, an internship and a job, and my transcripts are riddled with A+s. I used to seek the classes that gave out out +/- grades because an A wasn’t enough.
Dreams, you scare me. And yet I slowly accomplish you. So what are you? What are my dreams? I dreamed of going to law school. Check. Of getting married. Check. Now I dream of having kids (I’ve always wanted three but I want two girls and my husband wants two boys so we might settle on four if I ever get the chance), but at the same time, I dream of changing the world. It’s daunting thinking about my dreams. It hasn’t even been 6 months I’ve graduated but I miss the courtroom. And when I look back at my time as a student attorney, with actual clients, I remember the excitement, the fear, the amount of trust I’m given, the enormous burden I carry.
I dream to be a criminal defense attorney. People don’t like hearing that. Even my own parents. People told me I’d change my mind in law school–that everyone does. I didn’t. So much of our current justice system follows a retributive theory of punishment. I believe in a rehabilitative one. Our justice system is a vicious cycle and its so sad to see how many lives it’s ruining. I can’t sit by. When I tell people I plan on practice criminal defense they always ask me “so you wanna defend guilty people.” My answer is simple: “we’re lucky to live in a country where every individual has the presumption of innocence. That means all of the people I’m defending, will in fact, be innocent (until proven guilty beyond any reasonable doubt).
I’m going to get to change lives. I’m going to have the opportunity to change the world. It’s so close. I just have this massive test in the way.
When I started dating my husband, I instantly knew he was the one. I knew it but I never thought I’d get to marry him. I thought my dreams were too big, I thought I’d have to choose. I’m so lucky to get to have the opportunities  to accomplish everything I could ever dreamed of. And I can’t wait to start working.
 
P.S. If any attorneys are reading this in my state, I need help getting a job. All of my contacts are in Colorado, and this is another hurdle I’ll need to climb.

This year has been truly horrible. So many lives lost, so much pain and suffering, so much fear.
But it doesn’t come without its joys and accomplishments. Here are some things that have happened, and some things I learned.
This year I got married, graduated law school, moved, deferred the bar, started studying for the bar. I’ve gotten some extra time to spend with my family, my husband got his dream job, and got to work from home. I’m so blessed to have someone so caring and kind, someone who loves me so deeply and understands me so fully.
I learned that I’m human. And that’s funny thing to say but in a sense it’s true. I learned that I’m allowed to express my feelings and my thoughts, and that my voice has value. But more-so, that I have feelings and emotions. I’ve always pushed aside all my trauma, and felt like I could get rid of the past without having to look back. I’m learning that I shouldn’t be ashamed of my past, or the emotions that come with remembering it. And in exposing parts of myself… to myself… I’m learning to love myself.
This year, I learned that I don’t have to go through life alone. That I can wake my husband up in the middle of the night if I’m having a panic attack. That I can call my friends when I’m feeling overwhelmed. That it’s okay to show people I’m not put together. This year I’ve found many broken parts of myself, and I found that self-reflection can lead to growth, and that I can put myself back together instead of living in the brokenness.
I’m opening up more. And I’m learning to be vulnerable.

Well. I just finished my bar studying. I’m exhausted. I have so much to study tomorrow. I still don’t feel like I’m doing enough. It’s so stressful.
Still gaining weight. I can’t control my hunger while I’m studying. It’s like I don’t get full, and like not being full is a distraction to studying. I signed up for 3 months of Noom. So far they’re just having me track my calories and take stupid quizzes about which foods are better to consume and which ones keep you full longer. Reviews for Noom are good sooooo hopefully it’ll pick up. Cuzzzzz reading that I ate 2000 calories just makes me sad and I always track my calories anyway.
My twin called me the other day. She planned a full twin-date for the two of us, which we haven’t done in over a year. It was fun. We went out to a bunch of different places and just laughed and talked. Her boyfriend crashed our twin-date, but with a boyfriend like that, I expected it. At least he stayed out of the way and let us do our thing and took pictures of us whenever we asked him to. Her and I are back to talking everyday like we used to. Her twin-date was a kinda apology that she knew I would get without it being weird for anyone else. There wasn’t really a need for an apology I just wanted more contact.
I started watching Headspace on netflix. I’ve never really meditated before and I feel like it’s giving me a lot of clarity and helping me release my stress and feel happier throughout the day. My husband is extremely supportive but because I’m not with all my law friends who are either on the struggle bus with me or concurred the bus in July, I feel a little lonely. Like, the people who understand what I’m going through are far away and the ones around me are just cheerleaders and that doesn’t help as much. I told my husband I need more support so he did a bunch of housework for me today so I would have fewer things to stress about. And he poured me a very big glass of wine, and he made me food.
I feel a little bad because I got annoyed with him today. He talks to me about his engineering stuff all the time, and even though I don’t understand any of it and I really really don’t care at all, I still listen and try to understand and ask questions (he said he loves when I ask him questions about it). Well today I had two practice MPT questions, and when I finished them, I was telling my husband that one of the laws in the MPT defined arson as something that one can’t do to his own property and I totally missed it (MPT is in a fictional state that borrows laws or makes up its own or changes court rulings that we then have to synthesize into an argument), and my husband clearly wasn’t listening and clearly didn’t care and wasn’t even pretending to care. It annoyed me. Even though I knew he didn’t care and it’s not really his fault for not caring. I just wish I had some law friends over here who I could complain to and who understand the struggle.
 
Hope y’alls New Year is going well,

Dear Stranger,
When Covid first hit, I started writing letters to people who live in nursing homes. A lot of nursing homes were doing penpal programs because the residents couldn’t have visitors anymore, so I’ve written to strangers before. Here’s what I hope for you dear Stranger:
I hope you feel happy, and I hope you take moments out of your day to reflect on the things that make you happy.
I hope you remember how resilient humans are. Whatever you’re going through, you will get through, it will be a distant memory until it fades into nothing at all. You are strong enough to get past it.
And in case no one told you, you deserve happiness. You deserve to live a life you love. You deserve to be a little selfish, to take care of yourself, to worry about yourself, to talk to others about what you’re going through, and to fight for the future you want. You can put your happiness first, you should put your happiness first. So smile more, and never let anyone take away your worth.
 
Love,
A stranger.

Dear Nathan,
Whats wrong NayNay? Scared of me now that you can’t push me around? Can’t shut me up? Want me to tell you how I feel about that? FUCK YOU. Oh hate it when girls curse do you? It’s unlady like, right? Go to FUCKING HELL YOU BASTARD.
How dare you… No. How FUCKING dare you. You’re a foot taller than me, and yes, physical stronger you weak ass man. “You bruise easily” I wouldn’t bruise easily if you didn’t fuck touch me you asshole. I know you still “check up” on me. We noticed that you liked and unliked my husband’s super old tweet a couple months ago. And you know what, he’s everything you’re not.
He’s strong and compassionate. He believes in me, and encourages me, and wants me to be the best person I can be. He wants me to be strong and beautiful. He would never tell me what to wear or how to speak or give me weight goals. He loves me unconditionally. He won’t throw a fit if I make more money than him or cry if I beat him at bowling (which I never will because he rocks at it) or break a controller if I beat him at a videogame. He’ll never tell me not to spend money on clothes or not to wear makeup.
He’s a real man. And he loves being married to a real strong, independent woman.
After we broke up you stalked me, and almost hit me with your car. And after that you spread lies about me, lies that I cheated, and whatever the hell else you said that I forgot now. And I still let you talk to me, and after you told me you’d change, and after telling me how you now realize what a precious gem (I think you called me) I am, you asked me to give you the one reason we broke up. There were many. I didn’t notice the abuse at the time believe it or not. I didn’t notice the abuse until I started dating my husband and I realized what you had done to me. But you said something, you said if you could get away with murder you would kill that couple who cut you off. And at that moment, I realized you were a hateful person. Now, I realize it meant you might’ve killed me one day. You probably planned it, maybe you still are, who knows?
So thank you NayNay (I know, I know, you hate it when I call you that), for showing me my worth. For making me realize how strong I am. Because of you, I will never let another human being treat me badly.
I didn’t even touch on the emotional abuse you sick fuck, I swear that was so much worse than the physical abuse. But you didn’t tear me down, you didn’t have a longing effect on me, in fact knowing you made me stronger.
So here’s my hope for you. It’s been what, 8 years since I’ve seen you… I hope you’ve gotten help. If you haven’t, get help. You don’t need to be in your late twenties spreading rumors about some girl you dated for a year when you were 20. Find yourself, and don’t let it be at the expense of anyone else. And maybe, just… don’t date anyone. I don’t hope you hurt. I don’t hope anyone hurts. I hope you grow. And I hope I never see you again.

I’ve been MIA for about two weeks now. It wasn’t purposeful. I’ve been extremely stressed out from my bar prepping and I haven’t been finishing my class until super late. I also did way below average on my first practice test anddddd one topic put me about 10 days behind schedule. My neck is so strained from studying I can barely turn my head to the left. Passing this stupid test is going to be soooooo hard.
My Colorado friends are visiting me the day after the bar exam (they all took it in July), so at least that’s something to look forward to. My husband picked up a second job. The extra money will be helpful but its mainly just to get him out of the house. He works from home and finishes work at 4. He doesn’t make any noise or anything because he knows I’m studying, but I’ve been on edge lately and seeing him trying to stay quiet makes me feel guilty. He also hates watching me cry at my lectures and tries to help but I don’t want his help, I just want to cry it out myself, not hear his solutions of waking up earlier or changing where I’m sitting or whatever else he suggests. Not because his suggestions are bad, just because when I don’t understand a topic nothing he says will make me feel better. I just need to cry it out and call my friends and struggle through until I get it. I feel bad for being so upset lately, but I also feel like I can’t control my emotions right now. He gets it. That’s why he got the other job.
I don’t get why the bar requires us to memorize everything. We didn’t have to memorize shit in law school. We make our outlines and use that on the exams. Attorneys don’t even have to have everything memorized. I worked as a student attorney for the public defender’s office. I had my own clients. I did consultations alone with them. If they asked me a question I wasn’t sure about I’d tell them I’m not sure, that I’d have to look up the relevant law and then when they left I’d do some research and call them and explain everything to them. Of course I have a base understanding of everything going on, and I did research about the case before I met with my clients, but we can’t be expected to know every single law in the world. Plus the bar (the UBE) is all about federal law. When I practice, I’m going to have to look up the state laws anyway. Why can’t we just use notes? Because they want to torture us? Law school was already its kind of torture.
I don’t even know what I’m going to do if I don’t pass this test.
Anyways, I’m still alive. Struggling through 2021.

I’ve written you a letter before. I’ve sent you that letter.
I can honestly say I would not have gone to law school if it wasn’t for you. Sure, it was always part of the plan, but you saw it in me. Your story inspired me. You were there for me.
Thank you for believing in me. For seeing what I couldn’t see. For pushing me. For helping me. For calling me the day I texted you and told you I didn’t feel like I was smart enough to be at that school. You reminded me: school is just the beginning of a greater journey.
You care about your students more than any teacher I’ve ever had. You approach their questions in thee most creative ways. You emphasize growth, but you let us find it ourselves. I owe you so much.
If it wasn’t COVID times, I’d sit in on your classes. We’d get another dinner with our families. I’d listen so intently, and I’d come out of that dinner a better person.
 
Thank you. For changing how I think. And who I am.

So before we were married my husband moved to a different state for me. And while I was soooo happy that we were going to be together, the thought of living with someone (anyone) scared me (parents if you’re reading this, he totally didn’t move in with me don’t worry he lived in his own place and your good old fashions ideas are safe and sound).
Anyway, I’ve never had roommates and definitely never lived with a boyfriend. Okay, getting to the point. I was diagnosed with OCD a while back and I really like things a certain way. I like things cleaned a certain way, placed a certain way, in a certain order. My husband knows this and has learned my ways so he can take over for me when I’m stressed. But, that wasn’t the main thing I was worried about. I really enjoy spending time alone with myself. I’m a little introverted in that way.
Sooooo to accommodate that, since Husband sleeps early, I have me nights. Where I open a bottle of wine and watch a movie or a funny show alone for a few hours before I go to bed. It really helps me relax. I’m having one right now. I love it.
Idk why, typing it sounds mean lol. But I’m having so much fun and trying really hard not to think about the bar. Back to tv and wine.

27,https://www.opendiary.com/m/vulnerableme/my-dad-has-covid-5955683/,2021-01-22,…my dad has covid.,"
I’m really frustrated. My family has been so good since the beginning. My mom has some underlying conditions and my 86 year old grandfather spends everyday at my parents house.
We’ve been very careful with whom we see. We’re not going out. We’re doing a really good job quarantining. Not perfect. But good. Sometimes there’s slip ups. Sometimes a family member who isn’t quarantining comes by. Sometimes we go to an outdoor restaurant. Sometimes we hug my older brother who works with a lot of people who don’t believe in masks. I see my parents at least once a week (I only live about 20 minutes away from them).
My dad does see people. He has business meetings pretty much every day of the week. But for the most part. We’ve been good.
Anyway, last Friday I went to my parents house. My dad mentioned how he hasn’t had an appetite all day and hasn’t eaten anything. That’s not like my dad but no one thought anything of it. Yesterday he started feeling sick. Today he’s worse. He got a rapid test today and it came back positive. He has a fever and he’s super congested and really tired. Nothing horrible but still scary.
My mom got a rapid test with him today. She’s negative. But the person administering her test told her that she’s most likely going to get it. I’m worried about my mom. She’s sleeping in the guest room until he gets better and she’s taking a bunch of precautions but that doesn’t mean she didn’t get it, or that she doesn’t already have it.
I haven’t been feeling great today but I’m chalking it up to stress. I got a covid test today, not the rapid one, so it’ll take a couple days to get my results. My grandpa gets tested tomorrow. I’m so worried about everyone.
"
28,https://www.opendiary.com/m/vulnerableme/negative-for-covid-5956366/,2021-01-25,Negative for covid,"
My dad is doing okay. He says the symptoms change every day. First day body aches, second day chest pain and oxygen drop, third day (today) sore throat and fever).
I’m negative for covid. My mom is negative for covid. My grandpa is negative for covid.
My husband and I visited my mother-in-law today. She has recently decided that she no longer believes in modern medicine and would like to take a wholistic approach. She stopped taking all of her prescription medication and is relying solely on vitamins.
I’m not really sure how to deal with any of that. Husband and I haven’t really talked about it yet. She doesn’t want our opinions or our information. She’s already made up her mind.
So that’s how my day went.

29,https://www.opendiary.com/m/vulnerableme/a-very-very-long-survey-5956375/,2021-01-25,A very very long survey,"
Maybe it wasn’t that long. Maybe it was just thought-provoking so it took me long. Anyway, here it is.
Survey stolen from @soldis
What do you think about most?
 The bar exam. Getting a job. Getting a house. Having a kid. If I can accomplish all of things or if I’ll die from covid first. Or if one of my family members will.
What does your latest text message from someone else say?
“Awesome, me too. Those look so cute”
What do you wear to bed?
My husband’s T-shirts and socks hahaha.
Ever had a poem or song written about you?
So in high school, this one guy started to ask me out and then he chickened out… And then he sang a song in front of the entire school about how he tried but failed to ask out some girl. I really thought it was me at the time but it could’ve been someone else for sure. Other than that, I write poems and my husband changes the lyrics to songs to make them about me.
When is the last time you played the air guitar?
Well, while I was thinking about this question I thought, maybe if  I play an air guitar right now it’ll help me remember the last time I played it. It didn’t, but I guess now is the last time I played one.
Do you have any strange phobias?
Frogs. But if you wanna get more serious it’s that this entire life is a simulation and its different everyday but I’m just implanted with memories to make me think it’s real. Or even more serious, that this is all for nothing and I wasted my life regretting the past and waiting for the future.
What’s your religion?
I believe an omniscient, omnipotent, omni-benevolent God would not punish people for not believing in Him.
 But yes, I believe in a God. I do not believe in a Hell. And I believe it doesn’t matter whether or not I believe in God. That’s about as clear as I can make my religious beliefs.
If you are outside, what are you most likely doing?
Smoking. Or taking walks. I’ve been taking a lot of walks lately.
Do you prefer to be behind the camera or in front of it?
Neither? I suck at taking pictures and I usually hate how I look in pictures, but as I get older I like how i look in past pictures, so I guess in front of? But I don’t prefer it until the pictures become memories. Wow, I’m a really weird person.
What was the last lie you told?
Sat here for 5 minutes trying to remember. I truly cannot remember. Probably someone calling me on a study day when I’m on a study break and me telling me them I’m studying even though I’m on a study break.
Do you believe in karma?
I don’t think so. To quote Hamilton (actually Burr, but from Hamilton), “life doesn’t discriminate between the sinners and the saints it just takes and it takes and it takes and it takes.”
What does your username mean?
It’s my goal for using OD. Allowing myself to be vulnerable.
What is your greatest weakness; your greatest strength?
Lack of self-confidence in everything; ambition.
Who is your celebrity crush?
Zac Efron.
Have you ever gone skinny dipping?
No, I’ve actually always wanted to. We had a private hut tub for our honeymoon and totally skinny dipped in that, but it was private, so i don’t think it counts.
How do you vent your anger?
I scream. And I’m working on being better about screaming. But it’s hard.
Do you have a collection of anything?
books.
Do you prefer talking on the phone or video chatting online?
Depends on the person. If its to people I talk to often, then on the phone. If it’s my long distance friends, then videochatting.
Are you happy with the person you’ve become?
I’m happy with the person I’m becominggggg. But I’m still struggling to forgive the person that I used to be.
What’s a sound you hate; sound you love?
The like holographic notebook things (or folders) If you scratch on them. I fucking hate that sound. I’m getting goosebumps just thinking about it. I love music. I love hearing my husband sing to me.
Do you believe in ghosts? What about aliens?
I believe in both, although I believe in aliens more than I believe in ghosts and i think that’s weird
Stick your right arm out; what do you touch first?
MBE lecture handouts book (one of my many bar exam books)
Smell the air. What do you smell?
My nose is a little stuffy right now because it rained and my allergies are acting up, so nothing.
What’s the weather like right now?
If it’s under 80, it’s too cold for me. Update: just checked the weather. It’s wayyyy under 80.
Do you tend to hold grudges against people who have done you wrong?
No. I forgive way too easily.
What is your astrological sign?
Capricorn.
Do you save money or spend it?
I’m really good at saving.
What’s the last thing you purchased?
Food. I’ve been too lazy to cook and I need to grocery shopping.
Are you in a relationship?
I am happily married.
How many relationships have you had?
Actual relationships: 2.
 If I include serious dating with people I thought I was in a relationship with, it would 6. My dating history is short yet long and oh so complicated. But it’s all good now.
Can you touch your nose with your tongue?
No, but when I was young I always wanted to so I would do tongue exercises hahaha
Where were you yesterday?
homehomehome all day studying
Is there anything pink within 10 feet of you?
A pink hand sanitizer bottles, pink headphones.
Are you wearing socks right now?
Yeah those stupid no-show ones. I hate them but I wear them a lot because my shoes need no-show socks.
What is your secret weapon to get someone to like you?
No fucking clue. Why would you even want a secret weapon? Wouldn’t you just want someone to like you for who you are? Okay but realistically if I had to give someone advice for this I’d say… Ask them lots of questions about themself. People love answering questions about themselves and studies have found that they think the conversation went better when they answered questions. Second, have a really interesting piece of information about yourself but don’t give it all away. Something like “I actually almost got bit by a shark in a beach in the Caribbean” (obviously think of a real story, don’t make one up), but then leave it at that and ask them another question about them. It’ll keep them intrigued. Also idk if any of this works I met my husband in high school lmao.
Where is your best friend?
In her home, hiding from the pandemic.
What were you doing last night at 12AM?
Uhhh I think i was watching the night stalker.
Are you the kind of friend you would want to have as a friend?
Honest, caring, understanding, not very needy. Knows how to party. Yeah I think so.
What’s a song that always makes you happy when you hear it?
I’ve Just Seen a Face.
What is the single best decision you have made in your life so far?
Idk. Ask me this in 10 years. I’m currently making important decisions and I don’t know which one will be the best.
Favorite color?
Pink. I’m a cliche sometimes and I love it.
What is your current desktop picture?
Awwww it’s a wedding picture of me and Husband. He’s kissing me on the forehead. Our wedding pictures rotate for my wallpaper. Wait, I don’t have a desktop. Hopefully my mac background is what you’re asking about.
What would be a question you’d be afraid to tell the truth on?
What hurt you the most?
You just got a free plane ticket to anywhere.
A warm island on a beach with my husband.
Do you have any relatives in jail?
None that I know of.
What will you do after this?
This took wayyyy too long. It’s almost 3am. I’m still not tired but I’m gonna try to sleep.

30,https://www.opendiary.com/m/vulnerableme/feeling-guilty-65-5956546/,2021-01-26,Feeling guilty,"
Ever since Husband got his promotion he wakes up earlier. Because of that, he goes to sleep earlier. I usually stay up in the living room until 2ish and then go to bed. He’s a super deep sleeper and never wakes up when I go in. I’ve always been an insomniac, so even when I go to bed I tend to stay up trying to sleep for awhile.
Some nights I feel bad for not going to bed with him. Some nights I do. But then I lay in bed for HOURS and my sleep anxiety keeps getting worse and worse. He also wants me to wake up earlier. But i don’t want to wake up earlier. I love sleeping in. Most of my life I’d get 3 or 4 hours of sleep a night and then wait for the weekend to try to play catchup. My dad also never let us sleep in on weekends because he thought that would make us lazy. So now, that I don’t have school, or a job for pretty much the first time in my entire life, I’m taking advantage of getting 7ish hours of sleep a night. It’s nice. I know that it’s not going to last, so I’m just trying to enjoy it.
What Husband doesn’t understand is that even if I were to go to bed at the same time as him, I won’t sleep at the same time as him. So going to bed earlier doesn’t mean sleeping earlier. And he knows that because I go to bed at the same time as him a couple of times a week (he stays up late with me on weekends). And he knows that he sleeps and I don’t. And he knows that I still wake up around 10.
But he still makes me feel guilty. I’m going to go wake him up and talk to him about it, before it’s too late to wake him up.
 
Update:
He was still awake when I went into the room so I didn’t wake him up. He said he was joking and didn’t think it would make me feel bad and that he understands why I stay up. I stayed in bed with him until he fell asleep. I still feel guilty. Gonna guilt clean the house now.
"
31,https://www.opendiary.com/m/vulnerableme/a-breakup-story-5956764/,2021-01-27,A breakup story,"
I felt like it was time to get a profile picture but I didn’t want to use one of myself so I picked an octopus. I love octopuses. I think it’s crazy how little we know about them and how intelligent they are. Plus, they’re masters of disguise. My Octopus Teacher was such a fantastic documentary.
Tonight was better. After my husband went to bed I snuck into the room so we could have a little fun before he went to sleep, and then I snuck back down stairs lol.
We are very good at communicating. I’ve had trouble communicating my entire life. Probably because I was a middle child, also a twin, but my twin was very good at being the center of attention and I was more just the person everyone went to with their problems. I still am like that with my family, they need me to be. But with my husband, we hide nothing.
We actually broke up for a short period of time when we were dating. I hate thinking about it and I hate when it comes up because it was such a bad time in our lives. I was really overwhelmed. My anxiety was so bad that my doctor prescribed me anti-anxiety meds. My schedule started at about 9am everyday and ended at about 10pm. I was taking 21 credits, I had a job and an internship, and I had night classes for the LSAT.
Around that same time, my twin dropped out of college. That’s a big no-no for our family. Everyone in my family went to college. I’m zero-gen American (wasn’t born in the US), and every single in my family, even my grandma, has a college degree. So her dropping out was a huge deal.
The stress of everything consumed me. I didn’t know where I was going to go law school, or if I would even get in anywhere. I was having daily panic attacks. I wasn’t sleeping. And the medication that the doctor prescribed me made everything so much worse. My husband (boyfriend at the time), was also in school, working his million jobs and getting no sleep. I felt like no one was there for me, I felt unhappy. Not with him, I even told him that. I felt unhappy in general. I felt like I needed a whole new life. I didn’t want to be there anymore. Not in my family, not in my relationship, not in my life. So I broke up with him. I focused on myself. During that short period of time, I realized how much I loved him, how much I wanted him in my life. How much better he made my life even when it felt like shit. I realized that I put my unhappiness on the wrong person. The issue was with me, and I sabotaged the good in my life. So I went to a bar with one of my best friends and I spent that time telling her how I made the biggest mistake of my life. How I needed him back, but I didn’t know if he wanted me back. I knew I hurt him. I knew the breakup destroyed him. While we were at the bar I was looking through social media and I saw that he was at a bar close by. So I sent him a snapchat of the bar I was in and asked if he wanted to join us. After the bar, we decided to get a hotel room. We stayed up all night that night talking. I told him everything. How lost I felt, how alone I felt, how I pushed him away, how much I love him. He told me everything too. All of his feelings. We made rules.

We’re not allowed to hold in a feeling to the other person. If we feel a certain way, even if we don’t understand it, we have to talk about it. We have to explain it. No holding back. Ever.
Every fight, no matter how big and no matter how small, has to get resolved. We don’t end a fight and ignore it with the other person feeling hurt. There has to be a resolution.
After the resolution of a fight, that fight is over, when we have another fight, we don’t bring up it up when we’re having another one, because that means it’s not resolved.
We have to listen to other person’s thought process when we’re communicating, so that we can know why we feel the way we do.
We have to ask each other questions. If you spend a day with us you’ll hear us say “are you okay? is anything bothering you? are you stressed about anything? are you upset about anything? are you feeling sad? are you feeling happy? is there anything i can do for you?” We ask each other those questions every single day.

And 5 1/2 (I don’t like the number 6 and I have OCD so we couldn’t end the rules at 6). Once a month date nights. We take turns planning.
After the night we were back together and better than ever. We acted like the breakup didn’t even happen. And while I still feel guilty for the pain I put him through during those short few months, I know it strengthened our relationship, and our love for each other.

32,https://www.opendiary.com/m/vulnerableme/my-brain-is-gone-5959079/,2021-02-02,My brain is gone.,"
I’ve been really anxious this weekend. I study and study and study nonstop and still my scores are lower than average. The multiple choice is just sooooo draining and the MPT section is so frustrating. 80 minutes to read laws and cases and create a motion or a brief from an obscure set of facts and we can’t even have a piece of scratch paper. I’ve been scoring well on my essays (all except my property ones UGH so many rules I can’t memorize them all). And today I had to go through a whole new topic that I didn’t take in law school where they’re basically cramming a semesters worth of stuff in 90 minute lectures and then expecting you to not only understand it all but to also have it all memorized. My brain is so exhausted. I’ve had the same migraine for 3 days and I just want to scream and punch something.
If I stayed in Colorado I would’ve had a job. Most law students get a job before they take the bar. Some work part time while studying for the bar and they just take off the two weeks before the bar. I moved states before my last semester. My goal was to get a job here. Before the bar. The bar in July. Then a pandemic hit and there were no jobs and no one knew if they were canceling the bar or moving it online or giving us diploma privilege or making us sit in a room with 1000+ people for over 8 hours 2 days in a row, so I deferred my bar to February.
So here are my fears:

I get a job after I take the bar. I fail the bar (we get results in May). And I lose my job.
I take the bar and I don’t get a job.
I take the bar and I pass the bar and I don’t get a job.
I fail the bar and can’t deal with the guilt of failing.

I’m a perfectionist because my parents are really hard on me. If i fail the bar I’m going to get yelled at. And it’s not the yelling that bothers me, it’s the words. They’ll say:
“You didn’t study hard enough” “You didn’t learn enough” “You weren’t focused” “You always panic” “Why did all your friends pass and you fail? All they all smarter than you? Are you stupid?” “If you tried hard enough you wouldn’t have failed” “We spent so much and helped you get to this point and you didn’t even care enough to pass.”
 
Ugh. Why am i taking this stupid test anyway.

The bar exam is 2 weeks from tomorrow. I’m freaking out. I feel like I’ve forgotten everything I learned. My scores aren’t high enough. My brain isn’t really functioning. I just want to stay in bed and cry until it’s over, but I have so much to learn. So much to memorize. I hate this. I hate it I hate it I hate it.
I hate everything and everyone. I don’t want to do this anymore. I don’t know how I’ll going to get through this. I don’t think I’m going to pass. I just want to cry.
Today’s my older brother’s birthday. I haven’t called him or anything. The family is supposed to go to dinner with him tonight (we’ve all been tested and are all quarantining and we’re going to my parents’ house please hold your covid comments for a day I actually give a shit). I’m going to try my best to make it. My family always does family dinners for birthdays. But my older brother’s wife (they’re not married technically and I’m the only one in my family who actually likes her) makes birthdays like the biggest deal in the world and I just don’t care about anything right now. Boo hoo it’s your birthday. I’m taking the bar in 15 days. I shouldn’t take it out on him. He hasn’t done anything or expected anything from me. I’m just upset. Upset at myself for doing bad on practice questions and wanting to give up on everything.
My brain doesn’t feel like it’s working anymore. It feels full and like it can’t process information. I had a larceny by false pretenses MEE today (I’m generally pretty good at crim and better at MEEs than MBEs) and I was like there’s no larceny, the guy lied to get him to buy to his computer, so he didn’t deprive him of property. Well I failed that. BECAUSE WHEN YOU BUY SOMETHING YOU GIVE AWAY YOUR MONEY, so owner deprived him of property by depriving him of his money through false pretenses. I feel stupid.
Back to failing MBEs. Bye.

I have really severe test taking anxiety. I actually got extra time on exams in law school because of it. I didn’t get it my first semester but my professors noticed how I reacted to having a final and a few of them told me I should request extra time. I was hesitant at first but I realized the extra time when I actually got it because I used up all of the time. Usually I would spend the first 30 minutes completely panicking and then I would start the test. I don’t have extra time for the bar and my anxiety has been consuming me.
Last night at around 1:30am my husband called me from the bedroom. He sleeps early because he works early. I went up and he told me about how he was up for another promotion at his work but how he didn’t think he was going to get it. We stayed up for a couple hours talking and he said that he wishes he was doing more with his life even though he’s doing amazing.
This morning he found he didn’t get the promotion and he was sulking in self-pity about it. I started trying to talk to him about it but he didn’t want to listen and just wanted to vent about how it’s not fair and how he should be in a higher position. Instead of being supportive, I got mad at him. I know it’s not fair to him for me to get mad but I couldn’t help it. I don’t want to always be the supportive one. Sometimes I need support too. I told him I’ll be supportive after the bar. But right now, I don’t care. He’s come so far from the last year. He has a job, in his field, doing what he loves. It’s not the end of the world. I’m the one who is so anxious and depressed over a stupid test I don’t think I’m going to pass.
I told him I’m the one who needs support. I don’t want to care about anyone or anything until I’m done with the bar exam. I don’t care. I just don’t have the brain capacity to care. I feel bad but I still don’t feel supportive. I always got straight A’s. I always accomplished my goals, so everyone thinks it’s no big deal. That it’s just another thing I’m going to pass with flying colors. So they ignore my needs and instead need something from me.
Anyway, my husband apologized. Told me not to worry about anything.
 
I went to a coffee shop close by (outdoor seating, I disinfected everything and kept my mask on), and studied there. It was nice to get out and study somewhere else. Pre-covid I hated studying at home and loved studying in libraries. Now libraries are closed so I found the next best thing. I got a lot done but still feel like I’m gonna fail. I came home 10 hours later to a completely clean house, everything done including laundry. I know I should feel worse about getting mad at my husband but I don’t. I don’t care about anyone right now. I’m never the selfish one. I just want to be alone until this test is over but that’s not even possible.
Besides my law school friends who I fucking love to death, no one else gets it. 3 of my best friends from law school are coming to visit me the day after my bar. Because they said if they’re not here I’m gonna spend a week in bed crying because everyone who comes out of the bar feels like they failed (they all took it in July and they all passed). One of my best friends has to work 12 hour shifts every day for next two weeks to get those days off. We were each other’s emotional support in law school. One text and we’d find the other person and drag ourselves to the bathroom to have panic attacks. Followed by skipping a class to get a couple drinks and reminding each other how fucking awesome we are. I sent her a distress text yesterday and she told me to get on skype. She was still working, but beer in hand she told me to pour myself a drink and let me vent for a couple hours while telling me how much better the actual bar will be. She gets it. My other best friend lets me send him long texts complaining about my anxiety and how I feel like I’m not working hard enough and he tells me to take a long break and sends me bar jokes which I object to using the rules of evidence. If I have a law question, they drop everything they’re doing to call me, even if they’re in the middle of work to explain a rule to me. I miss them so much. I miss my emotional support people.
It’s not that my husband isn’t supportive, it’s just that “you got this, babe!” Doesn’t always help. Or “the more you read the more you’ll understand” or “everyone passed you will too” Followed by “do we have any food? Can you make me something to eat?” Or “just wake up earlier and study harder” or his subtle hints about how much more money we’ll have once I start working too and “will you lose your job if you fail the bar?” It just adds to my stress.
Not as bad as my non-law school friends with their “What day is the bar again? OHHHH you’re so close it’s almost here” That doesn’t help at all. I dont want to be reminded how much I have to do.
Or my aunt who texts me everyday with a “did you pass your practice test?” Followed by “Oh no what are going to do?” Followed by “I’ll pray for you”
Or my mom who says I’m not even allowed to think about failing the bar or say that I won’t pass in front of her. Although she has been more supportive by going grocery shopping for me and helping me clean my house.
Or dad who just says “work hard, this is for your future.”
My twin understands that she can’t understand so she waits for me to text her. Her responses make me feel better because she knows I don’t need the extra pressure or stress. I’ll send her a text that says “I’m gonna fail the bar” and she’ll reply with “It’s okay, you can just take it again but I have a feeling you’ll pass”
—
Venting about all these people who care about me feels SO MEAN. Everyone really wants me to do well and I’m grateful to have all these people in my life but also I’m annoyed that the people who get it are far away and I feel alone and depressed and anxious. I have another practice test tomorrow. After that I’m going through all of the rules that I’m missing.
I can’t picture myself passing. I really can’t.

I just talked to someone who was thinking about deferring the bar to July and wanted my opinion. They’re scoring higher on the multiple choice than I am but doing worse on the essays. My advice was this: if you pass in 12 days, you never have to think about it again. If you fail, the bar will still be there in July.
I’m going to focus all my energy on that advice. I want to pass, and I’m going to keep fighting for it. But if I fail, I have another shot.
 
That is all. Goodnight world.

I took Valentine’s Day off studying. It was really difficult to do at first. Actually, I didn’t want to take the day off and I spent some time staring at my bar class but not clicking anything. I was in a shitty mood, I didn’t feel romantic, and I honestly didn’t feel like doing anything but studying or crying.
I made breakfast, Husband got me flowers, chocolates, and a card. Then, we went window shopping at an outdoor mall. Picturing our future home and decorating it in our heads. We were planning on ordering in and having dinner at home but as we were walking back home we stumbled upon this really romantic looking restaurant. It’s Valentine’s day, what are the odds we get a table? Well, they had a table open, outside on the balcony, perfect for us quarentiners.
The food was amazing, the drinks were amazing, and we talked and laughed for hours. The waiter noticed how happy we looked and bought us a round of drinks. For the first time in months, I wasn’t thinking about the bar.
I’ve been trying to fix my sleeping schedule, but even when I’m going to bed early I’m not falling asleep, and when I finally fall asleep, I’ve been having horrible nightmares, and then sleeping in wayyyy tooo late. Waking up exhausted and dreading the day. Last night I slept well, and decided I want one more day like Valentine’s day. So, I took the day off again. Made my Husband breakfast and we watched TV literally all day and then I made dinner. I haven’t been cooking or cleaning. Just the idea of doing something other than studying would stress me out. Husband’s been picking up the pieces so I have less stress. He’s so amazing.
I actually feel refreshed. Like I’ll be able to focus on my work. I needed a break awhile ago. I’ve been burnt out for weeks now. Tomorrow’s going be super productive. One week (from tomorrow) til the bar. I passed all my law school classes, why should this test stop me from my dreams. Lets do this shittttt.
 
 
Note to self for tomorrow:
Practice test, write out all wrong answers, review videos, practice questions. Write out all essay sample answers, review essay topics.

Sometimes I feel like I see the world more clearly than others. I used to think I was more intelligent than others, but that’s not true in the slightest.
I was born in a foreign country to immigrant parents. I was taught to keep secrets at young age. I was the backbone. I held my family together. I became what people needed me to be. And growing up, my parents didn’t understand my needs, so I learned to hide it from them. I read people easily. Not all people, obviously. But I pay attention to mannerisms, a person’s eye contact, body language, voice. And while I’m watching, I’m methodically controlling mine. How I’m sitting, where I’m looking. English is my second my language (I speak 4) and growing up I would have to think of the sentence before I said it, to make sure it was in the correct language, that it was portraying what I meant. After I perfected that, I never dropped the habit. I think carefully before I speak, and I change the structure of sentences. I edit them in my mind until they’re perfect, then I focus on the speed.
My favorite thing about creative writing is sentence structure: throw in a long sentence–with lots of punctuation–and the reader spends a lot of time on it (dissecting it, whether she means to or does so subconsciously). Follow that long sentence with short ones. Speed up the pace. Run through the story. Or, instead… Use short ones. To slow down. Your curious reader. And throw in a fragment. Or some other grammatical error. To really drive your point home. Now do this, with a plot so juicy that makes it nearly impossibly for the reader to peel her eyes from the story. If the plot’s good enough, the reader will read it like you intended.
I do that with my voice. With my body.
I don’t tell anyone I do this. I’m afraid it’ll sound manipulative. But that’s really not it at all. I’m not trying to be manipulative. Every person has a story. And some are less self-aware. But their stories are the reasons they speak a certain way. Think a certain way. Hold that controversial opinion you just can’t get behind.
I want to learn from that person. Challenge my own beliefs. Become more self-aware. And maybe, just maybe, help a lost soul find his way too.
 
Edited to add just a tiny bit more because the realization came to me after I posted. It’s more than helping someone, more than self-growth. It’s truly getting to a know a person. Wholly, absolutely, and unselfishly, understanding another human being.

well i don’t feel like writing considering i spent all day writing essays. People have asked me how difficult the bar really is. And if it really is as hard as people say. I look like a zombie right now. Basically, you have to memorize all of the laws of all of the jurisdictions for civil procedure, constitutional law, contracts, criminal law, criminal procedure, evidence, property, torts, agency, partnerships, corporations, conflicts of law, family law, secured transactions, wills, and trusts.
You take a class. No, sorry. You pay thousands of dollars for a class. The classes used to be in person but now they’re all online. You study 8+ hours a day for months, then you take the test.
I’m in a UBE state, a uniform bar state. There are 3 different sections for the test: MEEs, MPTs, and MBEs. The bar is two days.
In my jurisdiction you have 6 MEEs and 2 MPTs day one. That means 6 essays. Some essays have multiple topics, some essays have subparts you have to answer. In the essays they give you a long hypothetical. You need to identify all of the issues, all of the applicable rules, analyze those rules with the situation they give you, and then give a conclusion. Approximately 30 minutes per essay.
In the MPTs they give a booklet in a fictional state with real or fictional laws and you have a case that you have to draft a memo/brief/motion or something for. 90 minutes per MPT.
Day 2 is all multiple choice.  6 hours.
 
All that studying and the essays felt impossible. They were so hard. I did not do well. I keep having to remind myself not to think about them, about what I wrote or what I missed.
Please please please let tomorrow be easier.

The last day of the bar was horrible. I have been describing it as the worst day of my life. It was worse than actual torture.
Call me crazy, call it an exaggeration. I don’t care. I was tortured.
A lot happened during the last day of the bar. I could write it out and explain it but that would hurt my post traumatic test disorder I’m currently experiencing. Every person in my life has been instructed not to ask me any questions about the bar. So far just subtle whispers and 2nd hand comments creep through.
After the bar I spent hours crying and screaming. I wanted to break shit but Husband didn’t let me.
When my friends took the bar in July, many of them messaged me after they finished and told me they can’t stop crying. That the bar is over and there’s supposed to be this wave of relief but it’s not there, all that’s there is pain, hurt, exhaustion, confusion, and more pain. To be honest, I didn’t understand it. In my head it was “well, there’s nothing you can do now, so enjoy your freedom.”
.
.
.
I understand now.
Husband was expecting relief too, and the crying and screaming threw him off. He wanted to understand. He wanted me to explain it. But all I could say was “this was the worst day of my life.” I tried to explain that the bar broke me. It broke every piece of my body and I’m completely broken now.
My friends knew this would happen. They all went through it, but they went through it together. So they flew in right after the bar, and we spent the past 4 days binge drinking (shoutout to the best husband ever who stayed sober, continued to work, and drove us all over the place). They couldn’t keep up with my drinking, but that’s not new. Also, they’re not broken as I am. Time has started to put them together. Although, when I asked if them if they’d rather take the bar again or be tortured, they all instantly picked torture.
And to answer your burning question: I don’t get my results til May.
Let the torture continue.

Well it’s my first official day of not studying.
So far today I cooked breakfast and lunch, cleaned the kitchen, did all of the laundry, reorganized my closet and my purses, cleaned the rest of the house, paid all of the bills, worked out, took a shower, did my hair and my makeup.
Oh yeah… and updated/reformatted my resume.

It’s been a week since I’ve smoked weed. It’s legal here, but a lot of jobs still drug test. I don’t smoke very often and have a super low tolerance, but I’m a huge insomniac and it helps me sleep and it also helps my anxiety. The only time I’ve missed it was the first couple of nights when I couldn’t sleep and once when I was having really bad anxiety, but now I don’t miss it at all. My friend even smoked at my house the other day and it didn’t bother me at all. Husband doesn’t partake at all. He used to smoke once in a while (and by that I mean like once or twice a year) but it makes him paranoid. He didn’t notice I stopped smoking until yesterday when I told him.
Alcohol, on the other hand, I love. I drink maybe twice a week and I have a really high alcohol tolerance. I can drink everyone but my dad under the table. Husband doesn’t drink much either, a beer here and there or a drink at a party with friends. I guess I’m the one with all the vices. I just really enjoy the feeling of being drunk. I don’t get bad hangovers either so there’s nothing to deter me lol. Anyway, I was doing really good on my diet since the bar but my friend came over last week and I drank almost 2 bottles of wine and gained all the weight back plus 2 pounds. I really want to lose weight so I decided to go on a diet with one month of no alcohol. I haven’t had a drink for a couple of days but today is my first official day of my diet. Lets see if this helps me lose those pounds I keep putting on… I hope I can do it.

When I started applying to jobs, I applied to my dream job. They’re only hiring one person, they prefer someone already licensed, obviously, and I don’t get my bar results until May. It was a shot in the dark. I thought it would take a couple years of experience; I thought I wouldn’t hear back.
I spent today revising my cover letter. Realizing it was going to take a lot more effort to even hear back from a job before being licensed. Talked to some friends and researched some tips for applying before being barred.
And then. I heard back.
From my dream job.
They like me. I have an interview scheduled in a couple of weeks.
Obviously an interview doesn’t mean I’ll get the job but I really really want this job. I’m excited and nervous. But that’s enough for now, I don’t want to jinx anything.

Feeling down today. My husband and I started a diet last week. His diet of choice. One I’ve never done. And it put me in a bad place. Eating very little and feeling very bad all the time. I lasted 7 days. Today I broke it. I really didn’t have to. I really could’ve pushed harder but I didnt want to. I felt miserable. I felt sad. I was in a bad mood all the time with no energy. Filled with hunger pangs and lightheadedness and not losing the weight I wanted to. After crying about Husband told me to break it. He told me it was okay, that he would keep going and I wouldn’t hurt his progress. That my happiness was most important.
It wasn’t the alcohol I craved. It was Chickfila. It was bread. It was cheese. But after it was broken, I still felt sad so a little wine didn’t hurt. But now, after a couple glasses, I still feel sad. I have no reason to. Somedays, I just feel the weight of being human.
I’ve long learned to mask my emotions. Don’t cry, don’t show you’re hurt, don’t react, don’t let that person know your feelings. I hid everything so well that I was drowning in pain. Suffocating in it. I felt like I was buried in a ton of paper each with my thoughts written in them. Paper that binded heavy books, larger than encyclopedias. Thousands of them lying on top of me. I couldn’t breathe. I longed for the pain to stop. Wished for it all to go away, I didn’t carer the cost.
Then one day–and I remember the day (in fact, I remember the moment)–the pain vanished. It went from pain to numbness. And the second the numbness hit, I missed the pain. Now, I’m engulfed in the numbness. It’s so hard to feel anything. The only way is to open one of those giant encyclopedia-sized books and confront those feelings. And with every page I confront,  a human emotion. But the sting is so deep, my body retracts, and the numbness takes over. I want to feel again. Even if it’s pain. But I don’t know how to tell my body.

I spent time with my twin the other day. At first it was with the whole family. They’re used to our twin thing but we still get these “I can’t believe that” looks. Little Bro asked us what food we were craving, we both said the same two restaurants at the same. According to our family, we only half talk to each other. We say half a sentence but don’t finish it. I never noticed but I guess it’s true. It’s hard for people to keep up so they just let us be. We showed up in almost identical outfits (unplanned), it happens a lot but it’s actually not cute and really annoying. We’ve both been having this weird pain in our left ear. I think its from grinding my teeth, Twin agrees. So yeah, I suppose we have that twin thing. Sometimes, not often, something very coincidental happens that it surprises us by the similarity, but this is very rare. Anyway, everyone left and me and Twin sat alone for the night laughing and talking and reminiscing about our lives. We both saved the same quote we wanted to show the other: “anxiety does not empty tomorrow of its sorrows, but only empties today of its strengths.”
I told her I’ve been wanting to go to therapy for a while, but mom and dad don’t approve. I brought it up to them once and they shrugged it off  like it’s something I don’t need. Apparently she’s brought it up to them too, and they told her to go if she feels like she needs it. I wondered why they had such a different reaction. She said it’s because I’m the put together one and she’s the mess. Funny because she was always the strong one. I learned to mask my emotions by copying her. And now emotions flow out of her constantly, and I’m just sitting her. The “put-together one.” A complete mess. Totally numb.

When I was in elementary school, there was a man who killed a bunch of people hiding out in my city. My school went on lockdown. Everyone was safe.
When I was in middle school, there was a shooting at the gas station my dad was at. He was safe.
When I was in middle school, a boy in my class had a hit list and a knife. They found it in his locker. He was expelled. Everyone was safe.
When I was a freshman in high school, I was at a school dance. A fight broke out and there were loud pops. Someone yelled “gun.” We ran as fast as we could, thinking there was a shooting. Turned out it was just a fight, balloons were popping, and everyone freaked out. Everyone was safe.
I have at least 10 more stories like this. But I’ve always been safe. I never felt safe though, until I moved to Boulder. There, I felt safe. And I hate all the people saying that these things happen in Colorado. Not Boulder. The Boulder bubble is real. Everyone has the same beliefs, everyone wants to be friends with everyone.
Today, there was a mass shooting in Boulder. In a grocery store. In my grocery store. I lived right next to it. I walked there all the time. 10 people are dead.
Let me tell you something about Boulder: it’s the friendliest city in the  world. When I first moved there, someone on the plane offered to show me around, an Uber driver wanted to show around, someone at a bus stop wanted to show me around. When I went to a cafe alone when I first moved there, a table saw me sitting alone and they invited me to play cards with them. Every time I went somewhere, I met other people. Friendly people, kind people. People who are sincere and honest. Who truly want everyone to be happy and have fun. There’s a sense of community. And a feeling of safety. I used to walk around the city at night without a care in the world. My safe place… no, my SAFEST place experienced the worst tragedy. A mass shooting at a grocery store. I don’t think I’ll ever feel safe again.

I’ve been feeling depressed for a little while. Not sure why. I should be enjoying the freedom of not studying but instead I feel pressure to be better and do better and I just can’t relax or be happy. I feel like life is just completely pointless. I need more of a purpose. If I’m working, I feel like I’m working too hard to enjoy my life. If I’m not working, I feel like I’m wasting my life away. I wanna drink but without the calories. Weed would help but I haven’t smoked in almost a month in case future employers are drug testing. It’s so dumb. I’m allowed to drink alcohol as long as I’m not drunk on the job. I should be allowed to smoke weed as long as I’m not high on the job. They can tell the difference between active and inactive THC. I know, i worked DUI cases.
Life just feels pointless. I’m just going through the motions til I die. Life is just distracting yourself from the fact you’re going to die at some point.
I told Husband I was feeling like this. I’m guessing he’s going to try to make tomorrow a day worth living for. I feel bad whenever I tell him things like this because I feel like he feels responsible. Like he feels like it’s his fault, like he’s doing not enough. It’s not him, it’s me. It’s my fucked up mental state, that I know he can’t fully understand. I don’t want him to feel like it’s his fault he’s feeling this way. But it’s also not like I can stop feeling this way.

Because of the ocean 

What do you do on a rainy day?
Tell the rain rain to go away

Coffee

Who is your favorite sports team and why?
The Cardinals.  Football makes me happy. I want Fitzgerald to be my friend. I’ve been following them since I was little and we’ve been through the good, the bad, and the ugly together. Superbowl next year! I always believe! 

When do you write in Open Diary?
Late late at night when everyones gone to sleep 

Where do you keep your keys?
In my purse, my husband leaves them on the side table when he uses my car 

How do you like where you live?
I would like a bigger house (and maybe one that I own). I love the state but I wish it had more liberal-minded people.

Do you like cottage cheese?
I… think so? Not a food I eat often, but I’m not a picky eater and don’t remember disliking it.

How would you describe yourself in 5 words or less?
Scared. 
Anxious. 
Unconfident.
Misunderstood.
Kind. 

Are you a fan of surveys?
Yes. They help me get to know people, and make me question myself. 

If money was no object, who would you donate your money to and why?
Money’s no object? Oh god, you guys aren’t prepared for this. First, clean water should accessible to every single person. No person should go hungry. Year-round open homeless shelters, with a focus on helping people get help, and homes, and some sort of income. Rehab centers, lots of them. Programs in prison focused on rehabilitation to lower recidivism rates. Resources for victims of domestic violence. There’s a lot of laws I’d like to see refined and I’d donate money to help get grounding on reforming some laws (mainly death penalty but i can name a dozen easily). Innocence projects or the equivalent in as many places as possible–no innocent human being should be behind bars. Other things? I’m really passionate about reducing and helping to heal large homeless populations like emptying skid row. I have a whole plan on how I’d approach it as well. Mental health programs in schools. Cancer curing research. Research for other diseases. The ocean, mainly stopping whale, dolphin, and shark hunting. Climate change. Okay you get the point… I’ll take some money now.

Someone from work. 

What is your dream automobile?
Not sure. I quite like mine.

How do you change a light bulb?
Ask Husband.

What is spring weather like where you live?
Perfect. I’m obsessed with the weather. 

Do you like dogs or cats and why?
Doggies. Cats scare me. They smell my fear and then pretend to be nice to me and then try to murder me. Also, a dog’s love is so pure. I think being loved by a dog makes me a better person. 

How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?
None. Just because a woodchuck could chuck wood, doesn’t mean the woodchuck would chuck wood.

Today is worse.
I only have two more projects to complete for this job. I’m hoping they don’t assign me more. I don’t really want to apply to other law jobs right now. I still have 30 more days before the bar results are released.
I really want to finish these two projects and then work somewhere else. But where? I have no clue where to even apply. If I’m not applying to law jobs, what am i doing??? I’m feeling really overwhelmed. Sometimes, I feel like if I can just get my life organized, I can think more clearly. But the more stressed out I am, the harder it is to complete anything.
It also sucks because since I’m not licensed, I’m not getting paid very much, but the work is tedious and stressful. My pay would go up if I pass the bar, but I don’t think I want to stay with this firm. They don’t want to put the effort into training me. And being at a job where you don’t know what you’re doing where there’s a person life (or livelihood) on the line, is absolute hell. I’m going to spend a little bit more time researching jobs and then I’m going to try to finish both of these projects today, and then I’m going to clean and organize my house and my life.
Maybe when my head isn’t so jumbled, I’ll feel happier.

I’ve been really down for a while. It just felt unshakeable… everything felt pointless. I could lie in bed all day if I wanted to. On Friday I let out all of my tears. Just let myself feel all of the pain and everything that’s pushing me down. I seem to operate between too much emotion and no emotion at all. Sometimes, I can’t feel anything, no matter how much I want to,,  how much I beg to. Other times, I feel too much, more emotions than I can handle and its crippling and I push them all away til I’m back to the numbness.
Saturday and Sunday I got a bunch of work done that I’ve been putting off. And I remembered this funny trick life does. Sometimes there’s no time  in a day, and sometimes there’s so much.
There are days where I wake up, sit on my couch, watch tv, finish a season or two of a new show, and then go to bed. There are days when I can finish all my work, clean my entire house, do all of the laundry, and hang out with people.
Sooooo. I’m consciously choosing to busy up my days. Today, I’m meal prepping, making Husband lunch and dinner, going into the office (I can work remotely), finishing a project and accepting two more, and then going to the gym. I need to motivate myself to get stuff done so I can forget about the sad feelings and create new happy feelings.

Another survey I stole from Tracker!

Winter is the worst. Keep the cold away from me.

Night. Staying up all night is easy. I hate mornings. I wish I could sleep in every day. 

4. Do you like tacos?
Yummmm. 
5. Are you an Introvert or an Extrovert?
EXTROVERT. I used to be incredibly shy and would have to force myself to have a conversation. Probably because English is my second language and I was scared I’d be laughed at. Now, I can’t stay home for too long. I love being around people, and I feel like I learn so much from others.

16. Who was your favorite Disney princess as a child?
Ariel. I still want to live in the ocean.

Math and English.

Nah. I’m usually too honest.

54,https://www.opendiary.com/m/vulnerableme/writing-challenge-update-letter-9-6000546/,2021-05-12,Writing Challenge update. Letter 9.,"
Back in December I started a writing challenge (can be found here: https://www.opendiary.com/m/vulnerableme/30-day-writing-challenge-5938899/). Anyway, I got through the first 8 letters before the pressures of life got the best of me, but I’ve always intended on continuing. So here goes.
Letter 9: to someone I wish I could meet.
Dear ED,
Funnily enough, I’ve wrote this letter in my head a million times. You don’t know I exist, but I feel like you’re a friend. I’ll start at the beginning, at how I discovered you. I have very severe insomnia. In high school, it was at its height. I basically refused to sleep… and I was going through a lot. When I turned 16, I got my license and a car. I would wake up at the crack of dawn and force my body to make me face the high school that was making me miserable. My high school was a whopping ONE mile away from my house, and, while I would take that harrowing journey, I would look for music on the radio to put me in a good mood. There’s not a lot of music on that early in the morning, and so, frustratedly flipping through the stations, your voice popped on. That’s all it took… fewer than one mile for you guys to hook me. Your show was so funny (still is), but more than that, it was your intense honesty and sincere kindness that captivated me. I needed your show in my life. You often joke that your job isn’t important, and I’m sure you’ve heard this before…
Your show changed my life. I was feeling so alone, so lost, so different. And you taught me to look at things in a different perspective, to choose kindness… to choose happiness. And in the worst of times, when I was having multiple panic attacks a day, feeling lost and alone, I would turn on your show and laugh and laugh and laugh. It’s been 12 years. And I never miss an episode. I binge listen. From where I left off until I’m caught up. You are my friend and you don’t even know it. You are amazing. Thank you, from the bottom of my heart, for always being there. I’ve never been to New York, but one of the items on my bucket list is to get drinks with you at Walkers and, maybe, just maybe, you’ll see that you have a friend in me, too.
 
Love,
Your loyal listener and friend.

56,https://www.opendiary.com/m/vulnerableme/i-failed-the-bar-6002240/,2021-05-18,I failed the bar,"
Just like I thought. Got my results on Friday and my score today. The good news is I get to quit my job. The bad news is I have to start studying again. The worse news we’re back to being a one-income family. My husband has a good job but we’re basically paycheck-to-paycheck. We put a little aside each month in hopes the housing market will drop and we can swoop in and be homeowners. My extra paychecks for the month and a half I worked there, although not much, felt like a nice cushion of extra cash for us. I wish I could be one of those people who can work and study. I can’t even pass without having a job. The pass rate was REALLY low for this stupid online bar. It’s not enough that I have a JD… ugh. I’m so tired of this.
I wish I could be a writer. One of my degrees is in English (creative writing), and I love writing. My Capstone was in poetry. On the first day of law school orientation I met a professor who asked me about my undergrad. When I told her about my English degree she said she feels bad because law school is going to take that type of creativity away from me. I’m not sure if she was right or not. I don’t write as much anymore, but I think that’s mainly because of burnout. And because I’ve been away from it awhile, and it takes time to get back on the horse and remember the commands the horse likes. It’s also hard to write when I’m not constantly reading. The voice in head is different when I’m reading. I used to be always reading. My mom would ground me from books. Of course that stopped in law school. Hard to read for fun when you’re always behind on your reading for school… It’s also not as relaxing… Your brain is tired from all the casebooks and it doesn’t want to read more words. I just started reading again. But back to studying I go, so back to the shelves the books go.
Maybe we’ll win the lottery. My husband just handed me a lottery ticket before he went out and told me check the numbers. He said “if you’re not here when I get back, I understand.” God, I love his humor.
Overall, I feel okay. Tired of being tired, and stressing about all the future stress to come.

57,https://www.opendiary.com/m/vulnerableme/nothing-new-292-6007253/,2021-06-11,Nothing new,"
It’s been a while since I’ve been on here, but not much has changed since my last entry. I’m trying really hard to not feel so down all the time. Setting alarms to keep me from sleeping all day. Studying my full 8 hours. Even going to the gym. Today Husband took me to the movies for the first time since before covid. It was nice to get out. But idk how to shake my feeling of emptiness. I’ll keep trying.
"
58,https://www.opendiary.com/m/vulnerableme/having-fun-learning-about-secured-transactions-6018414/,2021-06-25,having fun learning about secured transactions,"
I skipped a study day today. I don’t have days off but I just couldn’t do it. I know I’m behind, but man some days are soul crushing. Like yesterday, I was doing secured transactions (if you don’t know what that is, have no fear, because I don’t either). It was a solid 12 hours. 12 hours of me sitting at my desk trying to figure out how to attach, then how to perfect, then what the hell a purchase money security interest is. (it’s when you give collateral in the thing you’re using the loan for… I think? Or it could for credit, too. Whatever the hell that means.) And how a PMSI is different when it’s for inventory versus for goods. And how the fuck can you get a secured interest in proceeds? Seriously though, if anyone knows please feel free to explain. And then there’s priority. Arguably the most important part, and the part I understand least. Twelve hours, guys. Twelve hours. At the end of it, I couldn’t remember my own name, my body was shaking, my head was pounding, and one eye wouldn’t open all the way.
That was considered .4% of my class. There’s no typo there. Not even a half a percent. I’m supposed to do 2% a day. So, I finished my day still not understanding Secured Transactions, and feeling like absolute shit.
And my next topic is Civil Procedure. My worst subject (I have a lot of worst subjects, attorneys generally specialize in one topic, the bar exam has ALL THE TOPICS and makes me hate the world so much).
I just couldn’t study today. I really felt like I was losing my mind. I still kinda feel like that, but today helped. I stayed in bed until 1pm and then Husband brought me coffee in bed (he’s the best). So I got up and decided I can’t face the day and decided to take an edible. After that I made lunch and then organized all of my kitchen cabinets, cleaned out my fridge, and reorganized my pantry. Husband bought me a new coffee machine, which arrived tonight (he’s the best), I’m obsessed with my new coffee machine. So, at 8pm, I drank a bunch of coffee and binged watched mindless trash tv.
 
And now its 2am and I’m word vomiting into OD to avoid going to bed because (1) I’m not sleepy and (2) I don’t want it to be tomorrow because I have to study and i dont want to.
 
I hate so much of my life. I can’t wait to stop being so depressed.
"
59,https://www.opendiary.com/m/vulnerableme/unknown-114-6020346/,2021-06-30,unknown,"
I just typed a whole bunch of nonsense and it made me realize something… I don’t like the unknown. I feel like I’m going through one of the hardest times in my life. I’ve always had something to look forward to. A goal I was reaching towards. Law school is over now and I don’t have a job anymore and I hated my last job even though I thought I would love it. I failed the bar once already and now my days are filled with anxiety and stress as I try to navigate going through this torture again.
I’m not making any money. We’re barely paying our bills. Even if I pass the bar, I won’t get my results til October. I just don’t know what to do with my life, and I hate that. I hate not knowing. I hate not having a job lined up, or knowing if I’ll find a job, or knowing if I’ll find a job that doesn’t make me hate everything. I can’t see the light at the end of this very long tunnel, and that makes me so incredibly sad.
I don’t know if I’ll have money to get out of this rental and away from my mean neighbors that cause me more anxiety when I come and go. I don’t know if I’ll ever have kids even though I want kids so badly. I don’t know what the future holds.
I know that no one else does. But it’s hard for me. Maybe it’s my OCD. Maybe, it’s because I’ve had my entire future planned out since I was a kid and now this is as far as the plan goes. Idk. I don’t know how to be happy. My mental health is slipping and it’s all because of the bar.
Fuck this test. And fuck me for choosing this path.
I’m not as brave as I pretend to be, or as smart as I pretend to be.

I’ve been feeling better lately. Much more optimistic. Much less depressed. Maybe it’s because I’ve been studying less. Or maybe it’s because of a job interview I just had. Or maybe its because I know it’s almost over. I’m not taking the bar a 3rd time, so knowing I get my life back in a week and a half feels really nice.
I haven’t had time for any self care, really. All my gray hairs are coming through because I cancelled my hair appointment. I have a to-do list so long for after the bar. Our fridge is basically empty.
Ha. In undergrad one of my creative writing professors used to tell us that before we start writing, create a character, and write out what’s in that character’s fridge, because what they keep in their fridge says a lot about them. My fridge has some carrots, some fruits, some eggs and bacon, cheese, and tortillas. Now you have a little peak inside my mental health and I can be a character in your book. Lol.
I’ve been trying to fix my sleep schedule but it’s not working. Starting Tuesday. One week til the bar. That should do it.
"
61,https://www.opendiary.com/m/vulnerableme/day-1-complete-3-6032599/,2021-07-28,Day 1 complete,"
Finished day 1 of the bar. I don’t want to jinx anything but I’m feeling okay. The software for the remote bar crashed on a ton of people. They got locked out of their test and were on hold for HOURS to get back into the bar. I’m hoping tomorrow goes smoothly. Today was essay day. Not really sure how I did, but I feel better than last time. I knew the first question, knew NOTHING for the second one, not really sure if I knew the third one but I got stuff down and it felt… okay. Fourth essay is where I shined, I wish all of them were like that one and wish I had more time to spend on that one. Fifth essay was kind of a shitshow but I got answers down. Sixth essay actually went okay, not my strongest, but I felt good about half of it. We also had two MPTs and I usually run out of time on them but I forced my to keep writing and I think I did decent on both, but it’s hard to know. Those are the hardest to do online because it’s a big packet and you have to organize your thoughts. And usually you would have it in front of you, so you could underline and take notes in the margins and flip back to and forth through the pages, but all in all, they felt okay. I’m guessing I did pretty average on them.
Tomorrows all multiple choice. At least I know what topics to expect. Hoping for nothing too crazyyyyy. Praying it’s not like last time. I keep telling myself that I’m half way done. That I never have to do those stupid essays again. That after tomorrow I never have to answer a bar question again. I know I’m going to feel like shit after the bar. I know it. It just sucks the life out of you.
In other news, my dog died and my apartment has no electricity. Fun stuff. Stuff that I’m not letting myself deal with right now. I just want my life back. It’s been a year of SHIT.
"
62,https://www.opendiary.com/m/vulnerableme/bar-monster-6042684/,2021-09-02,Bar monster.,"
I jumped back into regular life a little too quickly. Gym routine plus diet, appointments plus seeing all the people I’ve ignored while studying for months on end. It all led to darkness. & I gave in. I thought, since I’ve spent days and nights studying, I can take the time off. Relax. Enjoy. But there was no enjoyment. Instead, hopelessness consumed me. I don’t want to do anything, but I don’t want to be doing nothing, but I don’t have any energy to do anything. And when I do have the energy, whatever it is I’m doing seems pointless. I’ve spent the last few weeks watching tv, painting, cooking. Feeling intense feelings to feeling numb. That’s not new. But usually I’d go weeks feeling nothing and then weeks feeling feelings. Now it switches in a matter of days. Feelings too intense to face that my body fights off until the feelings peak their way back through. I finally booked a trip to see my law school friends. They get it. They get me. I need them. Sometimes I think about moving back but UGH I can’t stand the cold. And I don’t want to be away from my family. The job market fucking sucks right now. I applied to a bunch, but only two worth it. One in a field I hate with amazing pay and horrible hours. The other, in a field I like, part-time with less pay. Anyway, I got instant responses from both jobs. Interviewed at both, and now I get my pick. Except I’m not even sure I want to work at all. Maybe I can be a writer instead. Since emotions have returned, I’ve been filled with images and ideas, but I haven’t put them on paper yet. Maybe I’ll muster up the motivation. Maybe one day.
In other news, Husband and I have been taking lots of trip. We’ve been spending much more money, but with the housing market being shit, why save anyway? I’m just trying to find a sense of purpose in my life.
I’m in an abusive relationship with the bar exam. It strangles me, cuts off circulation, making it impossible to breath, to think. And it lures me in with its compliments, promises of a prosperous future, of success, of fulfillment. And then it strangles me some more. It stopped strangling me when I was taking it. Instead, it buried me alive, slowly, meticulously, as I tried to find my way out. But even now that it’s complete, it keeps throwing the dirt in, and I stayed in the hole it dug for me, letting the dirt fall. I get my results in 37 days. Maybe I can find my way out then.

63,https://www.opendiary.com/m/vulnerableme/my-love-story-13-6042688/,2021-09-02,My love story,"
I met Husband in high school. I remember the exact moment. I went to a fairly large high school, and being the huge nerd I am, I didn’t have any classes with him. I had actually heard about him from a friend who had a crush on him. She really wanted me to meet him, so she invited our group friends for a movie night, and invited him too. At lunch, we decided to go to the movies instead, and since I was the only one who could drive at the time, I volunteered to drive us to the movies. After school, I waited for my friends in the main hallway. And there Husband comes dancing down the hallway. He came right up to me and hugged me and started talking to me like we’ve known each other our whole life. Listen, I didn’t used to believe in love at first sight. & if you would asked me right after I met him if I was in love with him, I would’ve laughed at you. But the second he spoke to me, I felt this warmth in my heart. I felt, what I could only describe at the time as an intense feeling of happiness. One that would reappear whenever he was around, and fade when he left. I remember my mom asked me what I liked about him, and I know she was asking me to describe him, but all I could say was “he makes me happy.” That happiness was love. It was like, before I knew him, my soul knew him. Like my body chose him before my brain could.
Anyway. We went to the movies. And he flirted me the entire time, and I tried my best to ignore his flirting the entire time, because my friend had a crush on him. Apparently, immediately during the movie, he asked my friend if I was single. She lied and said I wasn’t. In the class my friend had with him, he used ask about me. He, too, knew he found his soulmate. At 17 years old, he told my friends, “you’ll see, one day I’ll marry that girl.” We went on a few dates in high school, but nothing ever came from it. Our cultures are very different. And I wasn’t really allowed to date. But we became friends. I even switched electives senior year to take a class with him. High school came and went and even though we drifted apart, we still had a connection. I’d get a text or a phone call or a snapchat every once in a while from him, and I’d feel that connection. It was like, the timing was always off for us. Until one day, we went out together. And that was it. The feeling I had when I was with him. It was like, holy shit how can someone be that perfect?! How did we wait this long?! And that same day, I met his entire family, and he met mine. His sister asked us if we were going to run away together, because she could see the connection. We were attached at the hip. School, work, then every single day together. I would count the moments until we could be together. I was trapped inside a fairytale, and I never wanted to leave. My perfect husband. I met him over 10 years again. Started dating him 7 years ago. And we had our fairytale themed wedding almost 2 years ago. He is the best thing that’s ever happened to me.

Im going to go visit my best friend this weekend! Husband is coming too! I’m so excitedddddddddd! She is the best person in the world and we’re always baffled that we’re surviving life in different states. I don’t care how co-dependent it sounds, our catchphrase is “I don’t know how to do life without you.” We used to take turns traveling to each other ever other month but her work and my bar got in the way and I haven’t seen her in person since March.

1. What was your first stuffed animal and did it have a name?
Kuku. It was a girl. I miss you Kuku.
2. Would you rather go on the swings or climb the monkey bars?
In elementary school I was so obsessed with monkey bars. I’d come home with blistered hands. My mom had to ask my teacher to keep me off. Now, I can’t even hang off them. Stupid shoulder. Still love the swings though.
3. What is the first think you would do if you suddenly woke up and discovered you had rabbit’s ears?
I would go to a field and listen to the bunnies. We’d be friends. I would tell them how me and Husband name them things that rhyme with bunny every time we find one. I’d ask if we can stay friends and I’d learn as much as I can from my new friends.
4. Would you lie in court?
I’m an a lawyer (18 days til I find out if I’m licensed). No never. I absolutely love being in court and I use the truth to enlighten people about our justice system and the ways it could change and create a better life for all of us.
5.  For me?
No. Look, the truth is all we need. Imagine the person that’s hurt the most. Imagine a full explanation of that person’s mental state followed up with a sincere apology. You will get farther with the truth. People will understand. I will help you through it.
6.  What is the last homemade gift someone gave you?
A lovely letter from Husband.
7. Did you appreciate all their hard work??
Always.
8. Did you know that salmon get really fugly when they are spawning?
Did you know that the color you see in your salmon is a dye. And that salmon fishing is hurting our oceans?
9. What’s worse: spider bites or fire ants?
Aren’t some spiders deadly?
10. What did your beloved Granny call you when you were young?
Ladybug.
11. May I call you that?
No.
12. Why not? 
i’m not your ladybug.
13. What are you vain about?
Wrinkles. Started botox at 24.
14. What is your favorite brand of coffee?
There’s this coffee called Cult Coffee and I’m obsessed.
15. If someone were to name a day after you, what would they name it?
I don’t know. But if I have a say in it, I’d like it to be called something like “Selfless day.” A day where we devote ourselves to others. Maybe we can make care packages and meals and deliver it to homeless people. Or go to nursing homes and meet with people who’ve had no visitors. Any act of kindness. Selfless act of kindness be done on that day. Sky’s the limit.

In December 2020, I started the 30 day writing challenge (I’ll post it below), and I still haven’t finished it yet. It’s more of a 30 letter writing challenge. I don’t want to write one everyday. But I do want to finish it before the end of the year. So, without further ado… here’s letter 10: a letter to someone you don’t talk to as much as you’d like.
A,
I’m so thankful for your friendship. You stood by me in my toughest days. Kept me grounded. Helped me find myself. We’ve laughed and cried together. You sat by me through my panic. And you, too, grew from my friendship.
I know you’re scared to reach out since seeing I’ve failed the bar… again. I know you’re waiting for me to come to you. But it’s hard. You were so sure I passed. You practically guaranteed it. And I know you were only saying those things to make me feel better. But I don’t want to face you now. Because all the statistics you threw at me make me feel like a bigger failure. I want you to be the one to reach out. To reassure me that a test cannot determine my worth. To tell me I’m still smart. I’m still capable.
I tell myself, but it’s not the same as when it comes from you. You know my anxiety. You know my test-taking anxiety. You stood by me for every exam. And I just can’t face the world right now. But still, you’re just following the rules. Don’t reach out to someone who failed, they’ll reach out when they’re ready. I don’t think I’ll ever be ready.
I’ll bite the bullet and reach out tomorrow. I know we’re both not where we want to be in life. That we both feel stuck in vastly different ways. I think we need each others help to get un-stuck. I miss you.

Welllll, I just spend a couple hours applying to jobs. The main issue? I have no fucking clue what to apply to. Can’t work as an attorney… soooo paralegal? That works sucks and pays like shit. Also could’ve done that without spending my entire life in school. It’s so frustrating because I have so many skills and qualifications that I can’t use. My degree is a doctorate degree, yet I’m over here applying to super low paying jobs that I’m way overqualified for and probably won’t even get a call back.
Looks like we’ll be stuck in this apartment for.ever.

69,https://www.opendiary.com/m/vulnerableme/nighttime-stuff-6060453/,2021-10-28,Nighttime stuff,"
I’ve been having trouble sleeping lately. I think it’s because my indica pen is out. Mom says I was born an insomniac. I went through life sleeping a few hours a night. I even developed a fear of going to sleep. It’s still there, I’m not perfect. Everything has to be done perfectlyyyyy before I can go to sleep. Husband calls it “nighttime stuff.” He’s allowed to do the nighttime stuff because he’s learned the routine. Most of the time I do the nighttime stuff because I always have to be the last one asleep. If we go to bed at the same time, I’ll force myself to stay up until he’s asleep.
I don’t know. I have no rhyme or reason. Just a random OCD thing. Husband doesn’t usually stay up and he knows how I am so if he’s up and I ask if he’s ready for bedtime, he’ll usually move to the bedroom. A few times I’ve tried to sleep while he stayed up but I can’t. No matter how tired I am. I just lie in bed anxious until he comes to bed.
I wonder where this stems from.
Weed has helped my insomnia tremendously. I don’t smoke every night but if I can’t sleep, a few hits from a pen and I finally feel sleepy. Or if I wake up in the middle of the night.
I’ve functioned most of my life sleep deprived. In fact, I hardly ever feel actually sleepy. I don’t really get jetlag when we travel. Even going to Europe, even when I was younger. I’d just stay awake until around 11pm and then wake up the next day on a new schedule.
Staying awake is easy. Sleeping is difficult.

70,https://www.opendiary.com/m/vulnerableme/new-plan-59-6063566/,2021-11-03,new plan?,"
Days have been tough. Weeks have been tough.
I have been averaging about 4 interviews a week. There was one job I actually liked, and that was the only job that hasn’t given me an offer.
But that’s not why things have been tough. I’m great at interviews. I enjoy them actually. I never turn down an interview because I like learning different interview methods. It feels like I’m in court–I have a plan, but sometimes I get a curveball and the way I respond to the curveball shows just how perfect I’d be in the role…
It’s just that… Every job sucks. The pay sucks, the work sucks, and when I try to negotiate pay, they tell me there’s no room for negotiation because they can pick a college student off the streets who will happy to do the work. The problem is, they can’t do the work well as I can. Even if they have YEARS of experience. Years of experience doesn’t teach them what law school taught me. I can do the work better and faster and every attorney who interviewed me knows that, but they also aren’t willing to pay me what I deserve. So I’ve turned down job after job.
Yesterday, I had a little breakdown. Why am I doing this? What’s the point? It’s not a career. There’s no room for growth. And I’m going to be overworked, underpaid, and unappreciated.
I’m doing it because I need money. Because Husband and I want to start trying for a baby and we can’t do that on just his salary, at least for the time being. I’d also loveeee to get a new place before I have baby, but the housing market is shit right now, so we’ll probably just switch to a two-bedroom apartment in a slightly better complex. My complex is okay. It’s in a great area, love the layout of our mini-home. Hate our neighbors and the maintenance people, and there’s no room for all the baby stuff I want.
Anyway, I kind of spent today coming up with a new plan. There was this job I interviewed for and loved before the bar results came out. It doesn’t require a license but still requires legal knowledge and it has a focus on helping children. And it’s part-time which I love. I didn’t take it because they wanted a 1 year commitment, and I was waiting for my bar results. I didn’t know if I could give up being an attorney and stick to a part-time position for that long of a period.
They’re still hiring for that position, and I want to reach out to see if they’ll still have me. Then, I could still study for the bar part-time and take the bar next July, and I could still get pregnant and have a baby. That’s my new plan. I haven’t run it by Husband yet, but he’s always been so supportive 💖

Now for my secret . . .
. . .
I am officially OFF my birth control! Only Husband knows. It’s baby time!
I’ve always wanted a baby, but I’ve never been pregnant, and I’ve never tried to get pregnant. And it might be naive, but I have a feeling I’ll get pregnant reallyyyyy quick. I hope so. We’re ready for a baby (just have to figure out how to navigate my unvaxxed in-laws), but I’ll have 9 months for that.
"
72,https://www.opendiary.com/m/vulnerableme/no-title-this-time-5-6064851/,2021-11-11,no title this time.,"
I cannot wait to get pregnant. I think about it ALL the time. But I keep trying to read things on the internet and it’s so disheartening to read about how long some people have been trying. I have no idea how hard or easy it’ll be for me.
I got off of my birth control one week ago. And I used to use my birth control to skip periods, so I would take 3 packs continuously before taking a 1 week break. But most of the time when I would take that one week break, which is when women get a period (not a real period but “withdrawal bleeding”), I wouldn’t get a period then. So, I got off my birth control and I didn’t get any withdrawal bleeding, so I haven’t had a period since I’ve been off my birth control, and I don’t know when I will get a normal period/when my body will go back to normal. Which means there’s no really no way for me track when I’m ovulating. But so many doctors say that when you get off birth control is when you’re the most fertile…
I guess I just have to be patient.
I keep reminding myself that it’s okay if it takes longer because we can’t have a baby in this apartment, and I’m stuck in my lease for another 7 months. Our plan was to buy a house after this lease is up, but because of the housing market, it looks like we’ll be renting forever. Maybe when this lease is up, we can at least rent a house. That way we can have some of our own space and be away from our annoying neighbors.

In other news, my job’s been fine. It’s not stressful at all. And everyone is super nice. I’m just not used to this new routine. The hours are a little strange, and I thought I’d have more time to get things done in the morning since I get out of work late, but I’ve been sleeping in everyday. I guess I just have to get used to a new routine. It’ll be more fun when I actually get pregnant and have something to look forward to.

Well since I’ve gotten off my birth control I’ve lost 7 pounds.
This entire year, I’ve been killing myself with diet after diet after diet and I haven’t been able to lose weight. I even told a few doctors about how much I’ve been working out and cutting calories. They checked my hormones and my thyroid and said everything seemed fine and it was probably just because I’m getting older. But that doesn’t even make sense because new studies show that the metabolism doesn’t actually start slowing down until the age of 60… I’m not even 30.
It’s funny because I don’t even care about losing the weight right now. I just REALLY want to be pregnant. Fingers crossed that I already am!!! 😃

I love him so much. My heart just glows every time I think about him. We’re approaching 11 years of knowing each other, 8 years together, and 2 years married, and I just fall deeper in love with him every minute.

I don’t want to jinx it, but I’ve put my hopes in OD before, and had success. Been off my birth control for 5 weeks now… and still no period. And I know there’s a chance that I didn’t even start ovulating yet. There’s chance that my body is still adjusting from being off the hormones. But… there’s also a chance I’m pregnant.
Took a pregnancy test this morning and it was negative. But… I feel pregnant. Is that weird to say? It’s hard to explain the feeling, and I know it might just be in my head but I’m just really hoping I’m already pregnant.
I scheduled an appointment with an OB next month. I don’t like my gyno, so I called a different office and I’m hoping to switch to another one. Maybe 2022 will start with pregnancy news… FINGERS CROSSED

I’m pregnant! 😍
It’s so crazy! I made a diary entry about getting off of birth control and about how I felt like I’d get pregnant right away. That was last month!
Then, last week, I posted about how I felt pregnant. THATS BECAUSE I WAS!
I found out on Friday. Husband and I were going to a comedy show and I wanted to have a few drinks, but I didn’t want to have a few drinks if I’m pregnant. So I decided to take a pregnancy test just to make sure I was okay to have a drink or two. I was expecting it to be negative since I took one on Thursday morning and it was negative. BUT BAM! POSITIVE!
I told Husband right away! I know some people think of  a cute to reveal it to their spouses, but I couldn’t wait! We’re both so happy and excited! I told my mom also because I knew how happy she’d be. But no one else knows. And it’s crazy! I just want to tell everyone but I’m also excited about having a little secret!
I called my OB this morning and I have first ultrasound on January 6th! I wanted to wait until after my first ultrasound to tell the rest of my family. But they’ll immediately know on Christmas and New Years when I’m sober lollll. So I think we’re going to tell everyone on Christmas!
OH MY GOODNESS I’M SO HAPPY!!!!

77,https://www.opendiary.com/m/vulnerableme/the-housing-market-sucks-6077799/,2021-12-28,The housing market sucks,"
Wow, it’s been a couple weeks since I’ve written anything.
I’m starting to really stress out about my living situation. Our lease is up in June and baby is due in August. The problem is… we can’t fucking afford ANYTHING right now. It’s not because we’re not making decent money. It’s because the housing market is INSANE and since 1200 sqft homes are selling for over 500k, rent prices are crazy too.
I wanna buy a house. I feel like that’s the best course of action. My parents want us to rent a house. They want us rent because they want us to stay in this area so we can stay close to them. Don’t get me wrong, I love this area and love being close to them but there’s not a single house in this area selling for less than 600k. NOT ONE. There’s a couple homes to rent but those are renting for 3000/month. We cannot afford that. My parents said that they’re willing to help us and pay for half of the rent… That still doesn’t make sense to me. Sure that’ll help us afford it, but we’re still going to have the expenses of a house without owning a house, and when our lease for that is up, we’re going to be screwed too. Also, looking at places to rent NOW doesn’t make sense since I’m likely stuck in this lease until June. But looking later doesn’t make sense either because homes to rent are extremely limited and each one has a bunch of applicants already, so there’s no guarantee we’re going to get it, not to mention house prices KEEP GOING UP.
I don’t want to rent another apartment. First, we got ours in the beginning of COVID while everything was shut down so we locked the rent in CHEAP. Which mean, any other apartment we try to rent will be at least double the price of this one. And I don’t want to stay here. Not only is our place too small and very impractical our neighbors are extremely annoying. One of them plays guitar with an amp at random ass hours and our place SHAKES. We’ve called the complex, security, and the police and nothing has been done. We’ve also politely asked them to turn it down and offered to buy them headphones. Our other neighbor’s boyfriend has threatened us with physical violence and left threatening notes on our door. This also resulted in us calling the police and the complex and security. And yeah, he’s left us alone mostly since then, but I still don’t feel comfortable living next to him. Our maintenance people are garbage and one threatened to fine me when I called because our AC broke in the middle of summer. So basically we just keep to ourselves, we don’t talk to anyone, and we’re just patiently waiting until our lease is up.
So to recap: It doesn’t make sense for us to stay here. It doesn’t make sense for us to rent another apartment for more money and possibly the same issues. We cannot afford to buy a house. We cannot afford to rent a house. I don’t know what we’re going to do.

It has been quite a crazy time. It’s been tough to come on here and write because I’ve been dealing with so much emotionally.
My grandfather recently passed. He was a strong, independent man, who had so much more life to live. He was in the beginning stages of dementia. But he fell and broke his hip. One fall. And he couldn’t recover.
To be fair, he fell and had surgery and was recovering fine and quickly, but then he fell again at the rehab and hit his head. And then he dislocated his hip. Moving from place to place was not good for his dementia. Soon after, he caught COVID. He was fully vaccinated and no one really knew how severe of a case he got because of everything else going.
Since his fall we were looking for caregivers and nurses; nursing homes and  memory care facilities and everything in between. He needed extra care at the rehab centers because they were short staffed. He needed overnight care at the hospital because he would get confused. He needed a care plan for after he left because he could no longer live alone.
But he didn’t make it. His kidneys began to fail. He dislocated his hip again. He got pneumonia and his lungs were filling up with fluid. We hit the point of no return and he begged for it all to stop. So he ended up in comfort care where he lasted almost a week.
The hard part for me is not getting to see him. Everyone got to see him but me. Omicron was rampant and I was in my first trimester. My doctor warned that testing positive for covid would increase my risk of miscarrying. And he was healing, getting better every step of the way at the beginning. And i was waiting until he could be somewhere safer for me to visit him. Then he tested positive for covid and I knew it was too risky for me to try to visit him and then he never recovered.
I don’t think I’ve processed it yet. I still don’t feel like he’s gone.
Funeral’s tomorrow. I’ll be saying the eulogy. And reminding everyone what a wonderful life this man had.

for rent. Not to buy in this crazy market.
It’s a beautiful home, in the area I wanted to be in. About 10 minutes from my parents house and 10 minutes from Husband’s work.
The only issue is… it’s double what we’re paying now for rent. I’m not working. Husband is making enough money but it’s going to be tight. But we could not find anything cheaper. Good thing we have some money saved up when we thought we would buy. And I was able to get us out of our current lease immediately so we’re not going to be paying for this place.
We get our keys tomorrow. Husband’s only seen pictures and videos of the home because he didn’t have a chance to view it before we signed for it. But he trusts my judgement and agrees it checks all of our boxes. Honestly, I can’t wait to get outtttt of this place. But packing has been miserable. I just want to move and be done already.

Do y’all know what rights the substantive due process clause of the 14th Amendment protects? I’ll list them for you.

Contraception
Marriage
Abortion
Family relations
Sexual Orientation
Private Education
Obscene Materials
Right to die (to refuse medical procedures)
Right to travel (freely from state to state)
Right to vote
Medical records

Did y’all know that in today’s opinion (which I read in full), Justice Clarence Thomas wrote in his concurrence, “we should reconsider all of this Court’s substantive due process precedents.”
That is a direct quote. 
So, no matter which side of the abortion line you stand on, those are the rights you stand to lose from this decision. And it’s not an exaggeration, it was said by a SCOTUS Justice.
In the dissent [Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan] write, “one result of today’s decision is certain: the curtailment of women’s right, and of their status as free and equal citizens.”
They further write, “And no one should be confident that this majority is done with its work.”

Hello Pro-lifers!
Do you believe abortion is murder? You do? Okay, then I have a question for you!
I want you to imagine that you have an issue with your kidney. And you need a transplant to live. And the only match in the entire world is my kidney. I will (most likely) live if I undergo the procedure to give you my kidney and you will (most likely) live if I undergo the procedure to give you my kidney. If I don’t give you my kidney, you will die.
I decide not to give you my kidney. DID I MURDER YOU? 
 
——-
You are undoubtedly a human being. You need my body to live. But LEGALLY I have a choice whether to give you a part of my body or not. You can’t make me. The government can’t make me. No one can make me. Or prosecute me. Or prosecute the doctor for failing to make sure you live.
——
And if you said yes, I did in fact murder you in this hypothetical, then what you’re saying is if someone in the world needs your body part right now to survive, and it won’t kill you to give them that body part, then not giving it is murder. So you’re a murderer.
 
have a good day. 👋

I just read back all my diaries for 2022, which didn’t take very long because I didn’t write much. This year, one of my goals is to write at least 5 days a week. Some diaries may be private, but I’m going to try my best to keep up with that goal. I am going to be 30 years old in 5 days, and I’m ready to rock my 30s!
The last year of my 20s consisted of me being pregnant, and having my wonderful beautiful baby boy. Being a mom is the best thing that’s ever happened to me. I don’t think I knew what love was before they laid him on my chest. I had a relatively easy pregnancy. And a very difficult labor.
BabyBoy was due on 8/27, and my contractions started at 3am that morning. They were kind of all over the place and hard to track but I felt like labor was coming. At 5am I woke up Husband and told him I think we should go to the hospital. The hospital was empty and it took us 30 minutes to find L&D. They sent us to triage. I was 4cm dilated. They told me to walk around the hospital for an hour, which was difficult because of my contractions. After an hour, they checked and said I was 5cm dilated. They brought me a yoga ball and told me to sit on it for an hour. That was when the contractions started getting really bad. Husband kept telling me to breathe but I swear they just tell you to breathe to stop you from screaming in pain. After an hour they told me I’m 6cm dilated and they can now admit me. I asked for an epidural but they told me I needed to go through 2 IV bags first to make sure I was hydrated. They were the slowest IVs ever. After we finished the IV bags, they transported me to my birthing room. I again asked for the epidural but they told me the anesthesiologist was busy and I waited another 30 minutes before he came. I remember, his name was Kevin and I told him he was going to be my best friend.
The epidural only worked on the right side of my body. I found out later, it’s called a half-epidural and it’s from the epidural not being placed correctly. The nurse kept having me lay on my left side so the drugs from the epidural would cover my left but every time I went back to my back I could feel everything on my left side. Then BabyBoy got stuck on my left hip and I couldn’t lay on my left side anymore. It was so painful. Everyone kept asking me what would help and the answer was MORE DRUGS but the anesthesiologist took an hour before he came and gave me something. I didn’t even ask what he gave me, but it worked. I only pushed for 30 minutes, which according to the OB, was fast. BabyBoy was born at 5:05pm, weighing 8lb 4oz and was 21 inches long.
I honestly don’t know how well the epidural worked because while the OB was stitching me up I could feel everything, she kept pushing on my stomach and I kept screaming in pain. I had two tears, a 3rd degree tear and a 2nd degree tear and I couldn’t walk for over a week. Recovery was tough.
But BabyBoy is 4 months old today and it has been the best 4 months of my life.

Today is my last day of being 29 years old. So let’s look back at the last 10 years.
2013: Wow, it’s hard to remember that far back. I was really enjoying my busy life. In fact, I felt like such a grown up. I was a full-time student with a job an an internship. It was my first year working in the legal field. I worked at boutique practice, and I learned so much from that place, even though it was super stressful and exhausting. I had so much motivation–it hadn’t been sucked out of me yet. I was bright-eyed and ready for the world. I would wake up early and drive to school, go from class to class, paying attention, taking notes, and grabbing food and coffee in between classes. I would leave and go to either my job or my internship, and then come home and study for a few hours before going to sleep and repeating.
Fun memory: that summer I went to Hawaii with my family. I remember all the chickens everywhere we looked. Getting on a small plane and island hopping. And the road to Hana, which I will never do again, lol.
2014: WOO finally 21! I went to Vegas for my 21st. What a fun-disaster. I couldn’t drink til midnight, but couldn’t get to a bar until 3am because of the crowds. When I finally started gambling the next day, not a single person IDed me. This was the year me and Husband starting getting serious. We would go to bars every weekend and spend any free-time I had together. I was definitely busier than him. He was also going to school and working, but his schedule wasn’t as busy. We went to a ton of concerts and football games this year! We also took 2 more Vegas trips this year.
Fun memory: I went on a Canada trip to visit some family and it was so much fun!
2015: Another year surrounded with lots of friends, parties, and family time. 22 was a great year. My last year of undergrad. A serious relationship and ready for the world ahead.
Fun memory: we went on a Caribbean cruise and Husband came along. We went snorkeling so far into the ocean with my fearless dad and I started panicking and I made them turn back.
2016: My birthday this year was a 3-day party. I graduated from undergrad. God, that feels like such a long time ago. My anxiety really started peaking this year, and I started struggling with plans for the future. On one hand I wanted to go to law school out of state and on the other hand, I wanted to get married and start a family, but I was very career-focused. I decided to take a year off of school so I could focus on improving LSAT score and figure out law school plans. I worked at the worst job ever. A law firm, but man they really milked my work. I was working 12 hour days in an office full of drama. Yuck I hated that place. I hate it more looking back at it now.
Fun memory: Twin Disneyland trip.
2017: The first half of this year was horrible and I hate reflecting on it. But it was filled with growth and helped me become who I am today. I picked a law school and started this year. A new adventure to begin. I did not how difficult law school. I mean, I was warned that it would be difficult, but I didn’t think it would be THAT difficult. It was a year filled with figuring out life on my own. Away from family, in a long distance relationship. I spent many nights stressed and crying. Many nights studying and crying. But I learned my own value. I learned the value of friendship. And I learned how to ask for help when I needed it.
Fun memory: The first time Husband came to visit
2018: Another year of law school. And while school isn’t getting any easier, life was. This year I learned to balance work with family. I learned how to truly rely on my friends. And I learned that people like listening to me, and consider me a leader. This year I spent two weeks in Spain, and I got engaged to the love of my life. Husband moved to the state I was in this year, and made my life so much easier.
Fun memory: riding camels in Morocco.
2019: The wedding prep year. Also the year I learned I don’t have to be good at everything. I spent my focus at school on what I enjoyed. I was nominated for an award I didn’t even know about and I won. I also won a scholarship for my excellence in trials. I started mentoring other students and joined the mock trial national team.
Fun memory: Vegas Bach filled with way too many strippers!
2020: Before COVID i got married and moved back to my home state. I graduated from law school. My niece and nephew were born. Husband and I got our first place together. It was a slow year, but it was a good one, nonetheless.
Fun memory: honeymooning in Puerto Vallarta.
2021: Lots of studying for the bar. Being sad about the bar. Studying some more for the bar. Trying to figure out my future. And finally getting pregnant.
Fun memory: New York trip with my love, never wanting to leave Central Park.
2022: Here we are. This was truly a wonderful year. I spent the year pregnant, and delivered end of August. I felt a love I never knew existed. I took and failed the bar again, but I found my true happiness in my son. I can’t wait to watch him grow over the years.
My 20s were mostly great, but I feel like my life is just beginning. Bring on the 30s!

I’m typing this on my phone because BabyBoy is asleep on my lap.
Earlier today I was sitting between my sleeping husband and my sleeping baby and I just kept thinking about how happy I am. I love everything about my life right now.
Today was busy. I don’t know how you working mamas do it. I cleaned the house, did the laundry, and cooked. And in between i breastfed, pumped, washed bottles and pump parts, changed and bathed BabyBoy, played with BabyBoy, and put BabyBoy down for 3 naps (this is the third). I wanted to go grocery shopping but I decided it can wait. Husband has dinner ready, and breakfast and lunch packed for work tomorrow.
and I loved every minute of today, every second of it. This is exactly how I want to spend 2023.

I love to read. But not in the same way other people love to read. I’m very picky with the books I chose to read and, even then, I read slow. Pen in hand, underlining, circling, boxing words in a code only I can understand. Rereading phrases and paragraphs and chapters. Speaking sentences loudly so my ears can feel the ways my eyes do.
People often recommend books to me, and feel disappointed when they hear I didn’t like their recommendation. This problem started my senior year of high school, when the books I read filled a hunger in me I didn’t know I had.
Imagine every time you eat, you eat at a five star restaurant. Each bite meant to complement a different part of your tongue, throat, stomach, heart. Imagine how bad McDonald’s would taste after eating at Gott’s. You’re eating your art, and I am eating mine.

I am freaking out.. I don’t even know if I want to write this down because I definitely don’t want to remember it.
My parents have a cabin in the woods, and I used to go with them all the time. It’s very relaxing, and usually when I go there, I don’t want to leave. I haven’t been since I was pregnant. I’ve been so tired lately, and Husband has been working so much lately they we both wanted to go for the long weekend. My parents have been there since yesterday. Great, they can help with BabyBoy and we can relax!
There are a few issues. The road to the cabin gives me horrible anxiety. I’m in a huge panic from when we leave until we park at the cabin. Also, BabyBoy has never spent a night in a different place. He’s 4 1/2 months now and he’s sleeping 10 hours straight a night. BUT we have a very specific bedtime routine that we do every night. Another issue is my breastfeeding, but that deserves its own diary entry, honestly. This shit is hard. But basically I have ti figure out how many bottles to bring, when to pump, etc. it’s just stressful, and I’m struggling to leave the house because of it.
Anyway, we decide we’re going to go to the cabin. We spent hours this morning packing everything, including a portable bassinet. In fact, we spent so much time packing, we didn’t eat anything.
The drive there wasn’t as bad. BabyBoy slept the whole way, and there wasn’t any traffic and Husband drove slow to keep me from panicking. When we got there, we were both starving. Husband is on a special diet this month, so while he was unpacking and setting up the bassinet, I made him food. I ended up just snacking because my parents were going to make food for everyone. BabyBoy got hungry, and I decided that instead of using a bottle, I’ll breastfeed so I can save the bottles for night time.
When I breastfeed, I use my pregnancy body pillow. I wrap it around my waist and place BabyBoy on it. The room we were in has a king bed a bunch of huge decorative pillows. So I threw a large heavy pillow onto the middle of the bed and put my body pillow on my side of the bed and breastfed for around 30 minutes. BabyBoy fell asleep on the boob and I tried to put him in his bassinet but he immediately woke up.
I gave him to Husband, who laid on my side of the bed with BabyBoy on his chest and patted him for around 30 minutes. We tried to put him in the bassinet and again he immediately woke up. At this point my poor boy was so sleepy. So I put him back on the boob (in the same place on the bed), and let him eat until he slept and then I left him there on me for almost an hour. I tried to get up to put him in the bassinet but he started stirring so I decided to put him down on the bed instead. It took another 30 minutes of soothing him to get him in a good position, with the body pillow wrapped around him (I’m doing this all in a dark room, by the way). I decided I wanted to set up the baby monitor, so I pick up the big heavy pillow they I originally threw in the middle of the bed and put it on the head of the bed so I can angle the camera on it. Finally, he’s asleep… and he sleeps for about 45 minutes before he wakes up crying and Husband goes into the room to bring him out to us.
Now is the part I’m freaking out about. A few hours later I’m ready to put BabyBoy to bed, so I take him into the room and lay him down on the bed, the same place he was sleeping… AND THERES A DEAD MOUSE RIGHT BEHIND HIS HEAD!
I screamed grabbed him and ran out so fast I didn’t even know if the mouse was dead or not. Husband and Dad said the mouse was dead for awhile. Our theory is that the mouse was already dead on the bed, and when I went in the room, I threw the big heavy pillow on top of the dead mouse, and then I moved the pillow in the dark and didn’t see the mouse.
We’re on our way home right now. I couldn’t stay the night. I’m so upset. I can’t believe I let my baby sleep next to a dead mouse. I’m so scared he caught some sort of disease from it.
Im upset. Im so upset. I had to leave. I couldn’t stay. Even staying in a different room I’m just so worried. My poor baby boy. Im so sorry BabyBoy, Im so sorry.

I should be writing my book right now. I have a lot of thoughts but I haven’t been able to sit them down and put them on paper. Instead, I’ve been the perfect housewife. Listen, I am somehow an amazing cook, yet I hate cooking. Every meal I make tastes better than the ones I’ve had at restaurants. Husband says it’s because I’m a very patient person. I take my time and make sure put my all into every meal. Even when he’s on his special diet and I don’t have the right ingredients, I still take time to make sure what I’m making him tastes great. I can go months without cooking though. Or at least making simple meals to not have deal with it. But lately I’ve been doing it all. I’ve been taking care of BabyBoy and keeping him on his schedule (naptimes, playtimes, mealtimes, feedings, etc.) and cleaning the entire house until it’s spotless, and cooking meals for Husband.
It’s not that i don’t want to do all of this. I love being a housewife. It’s a lot of work but it’s fulfilling, and it’s not stressful in least. Not like law school. Not like being a lawyer. But I still have this passion. I still feel like I could help so many people. I still picture myself in a courtroom. But then again, I don’t want a job. Especially not that job. Not in and out of the jails. Not getting death threats.
I can’t imagine myself working. I can’t imagine myself being away from BabyBoy. But then again the beginning of every  month when it’s time to pay the bills the stress starts. Obviously we would benefit from being a two income family. I found a house I love but it’s not even close to our budget. None of the homes are. We will rent forever… Or until I can make some money somehow.
One day I’ll have this whole thing figured out. For now, it’s time to put BabyBoy to sleep.

Writing feels strange sometimes. I have all of these thoughts in my head but getting them out of my head is difficult. But when I was younger, writing when I felt like this provided such relief. So here’s a stream of consciousness diary entry that might end up not making sense. Let’s see if it still makes me feel better, getting the words out of my brain.
—
Being a mom has come with so many new anxieties. I never knew I could love this much. And I expected a lot of anxieties and most of them make sense. One that I didn’t expect: a newfound fear of death. Before I had my baby, I never really thought about death. I mean, I did, sure, as much any other person I suppose but death was death. Of course, I don’t want to die, but before I had my baby, if I died, the world would go on. Now, I’m scared of leaving my baby. Of dying and him not receiving this love. Yes, my husband loves him tremendously. But it’s not the same as my love. I don’t want him to have to grow up without my love. I don’t want him to grow up not remembering my love.
—
I’ve also been thinking about my own childhood quite a bit. When I was around 12, my entire life changed. Before that, my childhood was really rough. Moreso, no one knows about it. Not really. Mom knows the most, because we were in it together. But there are so many things I harbored, so many secrets I kept to myself, so many things I pretend I forgot. It’s over now. There’s no point in letting my mind go back there. But lately it has been and I’m realizing how much my childhood shaped me.
There was a time, when I was a child, where I told myself to be invisible. That I need to be invisible. Because I held onto a lot of guilt. So many things were falling apart around me and I felt like it was my fault. All my fault. I stayed up at night crying, blaming myself for things I could never have changed. Things I should not have been exposed to. But, because I felt like everything was my fault, I felt like if I could be invisible—if I could just not contribute to anything—I couldn’t ruin things: I couldn’t cause hurt. So I tried to be invisible. I would try not to speak, not to contribute to a conversation, not to answer something even though I knew what the answer was. The world would be better without me. That’s how I felt.
Now, as an adult, I feel unimportant. Maybe that’s why I chose law. Maybe that’s why I chose criminal defense. I can make a difference. I can see the difference I make in people’s lives. I can feel important. Doing something that I’m truly passionate about, albeit a little controversial. But in every step, the universe keeps reminding me, I’m not important. I can be invisible. The world doesn’t need me. Law school was hell. The only thing I was good at was litigating (and I don’t compliment myself often, but in the courtroom, I was incredible). That part, I loved. But it’s not good enough. Not good enough to pass the stupid bar exam. Not good enough to be able to litigate. Now, if I want to do that, if I want to try to be that person, I have to give up time with my son, and I don’t want that. And I’m constantly reminded that there are other people who do that. People I know, people who are doing it for the right reasons, who advocate for their clients, who passed the bar, who are smarter than me, and are doing the work better than I probably could. I don’t need any of it. I can stay invisible.
What am I doing with my life? I spent the majority of it in school. Faking confidence, pretending to be intelligent. Working my ass off for a future I don’t have or know if I want. I have no job. No license. No career. And nothing to show for my hard work except a fancy piece of paper hanging in my husband’s office and my dwindling memory.
I don’t know who I am, or what I want. Only that I need to make money, and I’m not making any. Only that I don’t want to work a 40+ hour week. Only that I don’t want to leave my baby with anyone ever. And I’m not satisfied.
I’ve always been a people-pleaser. I’ve always been the good girl. Doing what I’m supposed to do. College, straight A’s, jobs, internships, law school, more jobs. The people pleasing started as a child, again in those dark memories I try to stop my mind from visiting. And now, I don’t know how to please everyone and myself. My parents want me to retake the bar, and regardless of the results, to get licensed (I can still get licensed in another state because I passed in a bunch of states but not mine). My husband wants the same thing. I want to make them happy. But I want to be happy as well. I’m tired. I’m tried of trying. I’m tired of not feeling good enough. I’m tired of working. That sounds stupid, I know. I still have more than half of life to work. But it seems so pointless. It seems like a waste. I feel like I’ve already worked too much. My whole life, I’ve just been waiting for the future. Waiting to finish school, to graduate law school, to pass the bar, to get a job. Then what? Work nonstop? I don’t want to. I’m still burned out. I still haven’t recovered. I still have nightmares about being in school, or taking tests, or being forced back into one of the jobs I hated and couldn’t get out quick enough.
I’ve always faked my confidence. I don’t have the energy to anymore. I’m not a confident person and I don’t want to pretend to be. People like to throw their controversial opinions at me. They want to hear my opinions. I try to be very logical, and I enjoy presenting things in a different point of view than they might have heard. I am opinionated, especially when it comes to politics. Another reason i went to law school. I was tired of my voice not having weight. Now i have a degree to back up my arguments, my thoughts, my opinions. But I don’t feel like arguing anymore. It feels pointless. It’s so much effort to try to change someone’s mind. Lately, I’ve noticed that I just smile and nod and let them have opinions I don’t agree with without telling them my own. Me telling you why capital punishment is bad isn’t going to make it go away. Me telling you why we need gun control isn’t going to make any pass. Me telling you that banning abortion will only kill more people won’t make abortions legal again. My opinions won’t change anything.
I should just stay invisible.

BabyBoy always gives me a difficult time napping. I actually did a really good job sleep training once he was born, and he’s great at bedtime. But we go out so much that it feels impossible to keep a consistent nap schedule.
I’ve always had to rock him or push him in the stroller to get him to take his naps. But the last couple of days he’s figured out the nap thing all on his own and when it’s time for a nap I can put him down with his bottle and he’ll fall asleep all by himself. It’s really nice because it takes less time and stress but also made me sad because he’s growing up.
I spent the day at my parents’ house today and for his nap, he went to sleep completely on his own. For his second nap, he was super tired and I was laying in bed next to him. He would fall asleep but then open his eyes and look at me, then close them, then open them again. All of a sudden, he pulled himself up and leaned over, falling on me as he tried to reach his face to mine, and gave me a big sloppy kiss on my arm (he just leaned how to give kisses). It was the sweetest thing and I immediately scooped him up and put him on my chest and he had the biggest smile on his face as he cuddled with me. I love my baby boy so much!!!!
