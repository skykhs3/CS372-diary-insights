Hello everyone! My name is Kandace and I just found this website a few hours ago. I just created my account a few minutes ago so I’m still very new to this.
I’m looking for some helpful advice on this website. How it works, things I should do or not to, whatever advice I can get really.
Thanks in advance! I’m so excited to be starting this journey!

Today was a great and lazy day for me. I woke up early, around like 6:30 am. Since it was getting to be light out, I got dressed and took my stuff outside.
My stuff included my card table, writing supplies, and a big bottle of cold water.
Since I didn’t have anything to do today, I got to spend the entire day doing one of my favorite activities: copying stuff from my phone to paper by hand. It’s how I practice my handwriting.
I copy things like journal prompts, conversation Starters questions, lists of ideas for bullet journals, etc.
I’m currently working on a list of 365 journal prompts. I’m on number 121, but I thought I’d take a small break and post something on here.
