I was once happy and optimistic and willing to fight until the end for what was right.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
They stole my life.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
All my friends of a life time,people who apparently were supportive when I was in a dark place, disappeared.
I remember crying at night as I was so unhappy in my previous relationships and my so call friend advise me to break up and moved forward.
I did so and I paid a great price.i lost my house and I found myself alone.All those people who I helped through the year suddenly disappeared as they decided to side with my ex.There was no anger between us but our friends decided to start this witch hunting which cost me my self estimateAnd my trust on other.
I was financially ruined as I had to get a loan to rent and find a safe place for my son to carry on living.At 40 to start again is not easy.on the plus side i met a guy who is lovely to me and we got married.we have now a baby girl as well.
This is what make me so depress actually. We leave in a 2 bedroom rented cottage in 4.
We try to buy a house but we can’t.
I feel dead inside.
I have no fight left on me.
They took away my life, my soul.
Can’t write anymore without tears rolling again down
