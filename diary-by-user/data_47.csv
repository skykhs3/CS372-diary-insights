What a crazy weekend!  To start off the challenges, my cars engine froze since it overheated.  I was crossing a bridge and couldn’t stop.  How frustrating.  Not to mention the money still owed on it.  Thankfully someone was found to take the car and do what they wish with it since there was no place for it to go.
I finally got a van!  I am so thrilled.  It’s not as fancy with all the bells and whistles I’d love to have on it, but it’s perfect for now.  My machanic will be putting on a transmission cooler this weekend.  Tomorrow I take it in to have all the fluids checked and changed. 

I bought it yesterday and today I drove it to the DMV to have the title changed.  Hauling in three little kids into the DMV, waiting, then arriving at the counter to find out I need an emmisions test.  Loaded everyone back up into the van and headed off to emmisions.  Complete that and back again to the DMV.  Unload everyone and try again, haha.  THANK GOODNESS I brought the double stroller.  It sure made things much simpler.  It holds the carseat for the baby, as well as the front seat holds my wiggly near 2yo so she can’t possibly squirm out of the straps (until she learns how to unbuckle them! lol).  I am so paranoid of transmissions now.  I hope that this one lasts for quite a while, in the meantime I’m going to be sure to have enough put away to fix the transmission if needed, when the time comes.  It’s milage is 98,000.
I very much want to be doing more outdoor activities with my children, mainly bike riding.  I am looking for a double jogging stroller that also converts to a bike trailer.  I think I found one, depending if the guy is negotiable on price or not.  I made an offer.  It’s a nice one too!  Then comes finding a bike for my daughter and then one for my son.  I may have found one for myself.  I also will need a bike attachment seat for my near 2yo daughter.  Along with bike helmets for all! LOL
Tonight on my way back from the DMV, I stopped to visit a dear friend at work.  I sure miss her, I rarely ever see her anymore.  Maybe one of these nights I’ll be able to grab a movie in some sort of capacity.  In the meantime, I’m thankful for the connection I know I will always have with her, the incredible amount of patience and understanding she has shown as I’ve gone through my own wackiness and growth over these last three years.  She’s changed a lot too.  We all have.  It’s rare to find those that are there unconditionally – truely so – through all that may occur.  She was there when my youngest was born, an experience that I’ll always cherish.  This was her and my youngest, still wet…. I love this photo, one day I’ll have it framed.  Two beings who mean a lot to me.  One my friend, the other my daughter.

A few nights ago I invited a friend over to pamper with a cooked dinner.  Mmmm!  Well, I learned how to cook asparegus.  I know, I should know how to cook by now, and I can for the most part, sorta! LOL  Tonight I finished cooking the rest of the asparegus, and since the kids didn’t like it I delightfully ate it ALL by myself! 😛   Yummy!  The kids enjoyed vegetables, pasta, eggs, and got ready for bed.  It’s getting easier to put them to bed, and they’re falling asleep quicker, which is nice.
I got a call tonight from a friend of mine who is taking one of his friends into an abortion clinic tomorrow, to be there as a support person for her.  He  needed someone to talk with, poor guy.  The initial fear was that it was his, but after explaining dates and womans cycles to him, there is no possible way.  How come children are forced to take the brunt of adults choices?  Something I so strongly disagree with – and these people come to me to talk *sigh*.  I am glad though that they feel comfortable, I am sad for that baby.
I miss riding, terribly.  Where the majority of the team horses are located, kids cant be unsuperized.  So I can’t ride.  I might have someone willing to watch the kids Sunday nights though, to come with me while I ride, that would be wonderful.  This is one of my favorite pictures – Zoe – my princess 🙂  The love I feel for riding is unbelievable.  Nothing compares.  I am so lucky to have three children who all love riding just as much.  Jonah took a step back for a while, but continues to now ask when he can start showing again.  Alyssa begs to spend time and ride her pony more often, and Katherine just asks to ride, pet, and love on ANYTHING that resembles a horse, hahaha.  She’s hallarious.

I am so sleepy tonight.  I enjoyed two Mikes since the kids were down for the count.  Mmm – they have this new apple flavor out also.
Ok – my eyes are way too exhausted to hold themselves up anymore.

Whew, what a day!  I attempted to make it a goal to get the house cleaned today, and for the most part that occured.  My daughter accidently peed on my bed (lovely), even on the top cover, but as murphy’s law would expect, it went through all the sheets and blanket, down through the bottom sheet.  So, above all the rest of the laundry, my bed became the goal today.  Each blanket is BIG, so each one is a load in itself.  And then to dry each one, you have to stop it, put it out, and it back in again so the areas that are still wet can be exposed to the heat.  But, I got ALL the blankets done!  I was able to accomplish the rest of the laundry, as well as just put in the last BIG blanket in the house.  Tomorrow though, I do need to wash a few blankets and sheets from the kids room.
The house is clean and vacuumed, counters and tables wiped off, a load of dishes going, and kids are in bed.  Well, bed and kids aren’t matching tonight, but that’s ok.  They’re in their rooms anyway.  I tried something new tonight – I fed them at 5pm and had them finished and ready to begin getting ready for bed when the little girl I watch was picked up at 6pm.  It was smoother time wise for me, but didn’t help them any.  That’s ok, I’ll try again.  Regardless, they’re heading towards bed around 7:30pm, at the latest 8pm.  I like that!   Katherine though, does NOT like it.  Thankfully, both girls head to bed together, so she’s not alone in there. 
I sat down to begin working on the teams newsletter and couldn’t focus, I HAD to finish cleaning the rest of the house first.  It’s strange how that occurs sometimes.  Now though, I can focus.  I hope I can pretty much get this done tonight, if not then I should finish tomorrow night.  The girl who normally does the newsletter – I’m not sure what’s going on with her.  She seems to be taking a break in a way, which is ok I suppose.  Just would be nice if others were made aware of the need so they can prepare to pick up the slack.  It’ll all work out fine, I am sure.
I started talking with this one dad of a 4yo girl online a while ago.  He has this girl who was a friend, then they sort of have been dating, and she’s now desiring to only be friends.  For a number of reasons, but basically he doesn’t understand her way of thinking, he is questioning even being friends with her.  It makes me sad when I see this, people giving up and walking away from a friendship that use to be so close just because they don’t opperate in life the way THEY think they should.  Or they don’t understand.  I wonder what he’ll decide to do, he obviously cares about her.  I guess I can’t phathom just turning my back on someone.  I suppose I tend to fight for friendships, unless they themselves completely turn away from me…. as did occur with my friend who founded the rescue team with me.  Life is strange.  I still find myself missing her – mostly missing the potential she had.  She sure is quickly back tracking into her old (negative) ways.  I hope she does ok.
The girls seem to be waking up around 3am and crawling into bed with me at night.  I love this time.  I always wanted them to have the freedom to crawl into bed with me if they really wanted to – I use to be able to do this with my mom when I was little.  Last night I was up late working on the computer, and finally went to bed.  I already heard Katherine wake up and fall back asleep twice, after calling for me (this morning Alyssa told me she would pretend to be me, hold her hand, and she’d fall back asleep – aww!).  After I started drifting off, she woke up again.  This time I went and opened the door and welcomed her to come lay down with me.  Alyssa asked to come in also, at first I declined, but the sweetest most angelic way she attempted to compromise caused me to easily welcome her also – what a sweetheart.  I woke up with my two princesses on both sides of me 🙂
Today I did find myself getting a bit frustrated, which thankfully I was able to hold it in and smile, making a silly comment rather then snarling.  I was attempting to clean the house, and felt like each step I took I was tripping over a child.  Each time I turned around there was one under foot and another creating a mess in an area I just cleaned.  The baby would either be on my back, in arms, hungry, tired/fussy.  A few times I purposefully stopped, took a breath, and started again.  I LOVE being a stay at home mom, and am extremely thankful to be able to be so, but my goodness.
I decided to go ahead and order pizza for dinner, and invited Jennifer and her baby, Luke.  ANOTHER BABY!!!!!  Another opportunity to get my baby fix 😛  I can’t wait until he can start having sleep overs with ""Auntie Suzie"" – – – although supposedly I’m, ""second mommy"", lol.  He is so dang adorable and so kissable!  It was fun to have him over for a bit.
Oh!  The guy accepted my offer for the double jogger/trailer.  I’m so thrilled!!!  It’s PERFECT, and although the price was a bit spendier then what I wanted to spend on a trailer, it’s well worth it.  New they run close to $300.  He was asking $195 for it and I offered him $140 – which was the very most I wanted to spend for the type of trailer design I was searching for.  He accepted it.  I’ll be picking it up Friday afternoon.  The reviews on this model are VERY high, and the design is exactly what I was looking for, unlike the cheaper model designs that are a jogger/trailer.  I also found a mountain bike and will be picking that up tomorrow afternoon.  I’m now on a hunt for a princess bike for my 6yo daughter, a bike seat for my near 2yo, and a mountain bike for my almost 10yo son.  Slooowly I’m finding the right ones 🙂 
Ok – now that it’s 10:15pm, the house is clean, I’m able to finally start on this newsletter… and I’m exhausted.  Oh well, I hope this’ll get done quickly – I can hope anyway 😛 LOL

What a fun day today!  The baby arrived, and following a full bottle that she drank, she fell asleep.  This gave Katherine time for the cuddly time she craves.  She does an exceptional job tollerating my time with another baby, but when that baby isn’t in my arms, SHE wants to be – but of course! LOL
I was scheduled to go pick up the bike trailer/jogger tomorrow afternoon, but got the call today asking if I could come.  Loaded my two girls plus a sleeping baby up into the van (VAN – I like that word, lol), and headed out.  The Blue Angels were flying today so one main freeway was closed, leaving the other backed up.  Ahhhh, time stuck in traffic.  I realized though, as I looked down at the speedometer, that when you’re crawling at 15mph, you’re actually going fast! haha.  It’s when you come to a standstill that it is grumblesome.  I also was quickly reminded of the pleasures of having children when living in a city…… the carpool lane…. passing by all those that are lacking forward movement.
I did have to deal with tail gaters again, well one main one.  Do people not understand the dangers of tail gating???  When the truck flipped across the freeway, no one was rear ended because NO ONE was tailgating!!  I have a severe issue with someone riding my ass, most especially when my kids are in the back.  I ended up needing to tap my breaks a few times to remind them to back off.  Seems to become a habit for some people.  If I can’t see the road out of my rear view mirror in front of your tires, you are TOO CLOSE!!! and therefor you place MY CHILDRENS LIFE IN DANGER, not to mention others on the freeway also, that will also be involved in the accident that you caused ’cause you were TOO CLOSE.  Ok, tailgating definitely gets to me.  It is SO dangerous, and it brings out the mama bear in me when it’s my ass that’s being near tapped by some car behind me that thinks he’s in some sort of hurry to get to where he’s going and the flow of traffic is just going too slow for him.  
I have seriously been considering installing a trailer hitch on my van.  At first it was to pull a small trailer to pick up hay and grain, but now the reason for it would be to place a bike hitch on.  WHY?   Because when one rear ends me it’ll smash their car and NOT mine, since the axel would take must of the impact.  This was reconfirmed to me by one who had just that happen to him, as well as my mom.  Being rear ended is actually quite a fear of mine, but one I try not to pay much attention to.
Anyway, the bike trailer/jogger is PERFECT!!  Well, I haven’t tried it out yet, but that’ll happen tomorrow.  It’s exactly what I’ve been looking for, as well as the design.  I travelled a few road paths to see how long they were.  I have a 3mi (2), 5mi (2), and 7mi paths.  Now, when to get out with it?  Probably in the mornings.  I am so dang thrilled I could babble jiggerish (not jibberish), haha.
Today when pulling through Starbucks (ohhh yes, I couldn’t help myself), I placed an order of a venti caffe vanilla fappachinio, and of course a mollassas cookie.  The guy who served me at the window was ADORABLE!  He asked me if the cookie was for the kids (ohhh no, ME!) which struck up a pretty funny conversation.  He made sure my frappachino was perfectly filled with whip cream, smile and thank you, and I was on my way.  Ok, Starbucks needs more servers like him!!!  😛 haha
Tomorrow I pick up my new (used) mountain bike, as well as travel out in the evening to see if a middle row of built in child safety seats will fit in my van in place of the row I have in their now.  I sure hope so 🙂
Today as I pulled out of my apt complex with my kids in the car, I was hit with a rush of pride and deep love for them.  Amazing how kids will do that to you.  Alyssa has been an incredible help with the baby when we’re on the road, making sure she has her bottle when she’s hungry and entertainment when she starts to fuss – which she does an amazing job at creating laughter.  Some days are like every other, and there are those days when you are so overwhelmed with adoration for them that you want to completely smother them in hugs and kisses…. if they don’t get to you first 😛
Tonights schedule for the kids went wonderful.  As soon as the baby was picked up, they were scooted into the tub.  Tortolini’s (however you spell that word) were cooked, spaghetti sause, and parmassian cheese … (omg I am sure my spelling is far into left field tonight).  Katherine had her hair pulled up out of her face, and Alyssa had braids done up.  both girls looked SO CUTE!!!  I was smart tonight and made sure both girls had their water and well as had gone to the bathroom (yep, the excuses were enough to teach me).  8:30pm and they were both sound asleep.  Ahhhhh …. the silence.  
I sit now in front of my laptop (another excellent purchse that I’ve put to many a use), watching some sort of investigation movie that’s on, working on the newsletter and agenda.  I am seriously considering turning the light off and going to bed.  Wow, bed before 11pm… 12am…. 1am or even 2am…. 😛

What a day yesterday!
On Saturday afternoon I called to confirm with both of my lessons that they’d be there.  The way I have my riding program now, everything is laid back.  No problem if a student can’t come or they schedule family time instead.  I often have drill events happening that keep me from teaching also.  So, come the weekend I always call.  One student was had back stage tickets to the zoo with her mom, and the other was going to go see the Blue Angels.  I took a moment to find out more about it, the cost, the location, how to get there, etc.  I was just talking with another friend of mine about maybe taking the kids.  I asked if I would be able to follow them there.  Absolutely, she said.  I needed to be ready to go by 10am.
I got up early the next morning, Sunday, and got the kids ready to go, hair brushed, breakfast fed, clothing that was heat appropriate, and met up with a friend of mine who had never seen the Blue Angels before either.  I called the family we were following and asked if we could meet at Starbucks – – major craving 😛
I was sure to bring my new jogger with me, besides, the kids wanted a chance to try it out.  After finding parking on the road I unloaded the jogger and set it up.  In went Katherine (Alyssa walked with the other family), and I immediately fell in love with it.  It was SO easy to push and control, it floated!  It was about 1/2mi to the park.  For the next two hours the kids played and the adults socialized.  Alyssa came up once asking for money for ice cream…. suuuure.  Katherine turned on her charm to other adults close by, and I decided to take a moment and play like a kid with the daughter of the family I followed.  We played with hand stands, back flips, round offs, cart wheels, and full out running races.  Fun fun 🙂  Then came the time that they opened the bridge and everyone walked down onto it.
The ""opening band"" of planes that flew around was neat, it was a good warmup for Katherine who is afraid of things flying in the sky.  They were somewhat quiet, and she came around to understand that they were ok, and she’d clap while yelling, ""YEAH!?  A few times she stood there (in my arms) with her mouth completely gawked open. hahaha.

The Blue Angels arrived – how cool!  One skimmed so close over the bridge that it completely excited the man in front of me.  ""That was sooooo close!!!"" He bounced! Men, LOL.  Katherine did become afraid a few times, but did exceptional holding herself together.  She also learned how to hold her ears.



I decided to leave early to get ahead of the pile of traffic.  I only missed 20min of the ending.  We got back to the car, loaded up the kids into the van as well as the jogger, and back to my hometown.  I had received a call from a guy friend of mine there I hadn’t seen for a while, who wasn’t working (he works ALL the time) and did I have time to stop and say hello.  Of course 🙂  He was playing pool at a bar – handed the friend who was with me $20 to take the kids over to Mc.D’s while I quickly said hello.  He sure seemed agitated – bordom he said, which makes sense.  I invited him over sometime when he’s free.  He and his work buddy know the pool is open whenever they would like to cool off after after a hard days work.  He hasn’t taken that up yet, although is work buddy did… and was handed a plate of food after he was finished, since I was cooking dinner at the same time.  I need to cook more often.
On I went out to work Zoe, my princess horse.  It had been a real debate that morning whether to go ride or see the Blue Angels.  I never get to ride since I always have the kids, and here I had the opportunity since I had someone with me.  What a decision, kids and their delight took presidence 😛 LOL  My work with Zoe went very well, I sure miss working her.  Came back, completed horse chores, fed kids, and got them into bed.  I collapsed, it was 10pm.
This morning I woke up SOOOOO sore.  What in the world???  I couldn’t for the life of me figure it out.  Certainly the 1/2mi walk to the park and back wouldn’t do that to me, I surely hoped anyway.  It wasn’t until I sat down to type out this entry that I figured it out… it’s from playing as a kid for a change.  Races, hand stands, etc.  My body definitely hurts 😛 LOL
I’m off now to load everyone up and get a few errands done.  I wanted to walk this morning, but it’s now a bit too hot to have the kids out in it.  Maybe tonight, or later.  I am absolutely thrilled with my jogger purchase though 🙂  I scored!

MOTHERHOOD
Motherhood is a challenge, single motherhood is even more so.  
I absolutely love being a mother, I wouldn’t trade it for anything.  My three children mean everything to me, although there are those times that I wish I could take a break – have a night to myself, sit in the hot tub alone, or even curl up in a Starbucks on one of their big fluffy chairs with a good book for a few hours.  But, since I am a complete full time stay-at-home single mom, 24×7, this is not possible.  It’s exhausting, while at the same time it is everything to me.  They are my joy and my world.  I even think so when I am a jungle gym, or accomplishing the feat of feeding one baby with a bottle, nursing my near 2yo who likes to switch regularly ""more, please"" she says, and typing a paper I’m working on with my remaining hand.
I feel as though my parenting abilities are getting so much better.  When my voice attempts to be firm out of frustration, I have remembered to take a breath and talk quietly without the frustration, explaining the situation to them and why I need it to be a certain way.  Today I was full of praise, even though things weren’t going too well.
I get down on their level so much more, act more child like.  Not childish, but child like.  I have seen such a difference in the kids since allowing myself to step out of the adult-no nonesense roll, and allow the child in me to come out.  
I picked up an easy bake oven for Alyssa last night, which she LOVED.  But the thrill of cooking quickly moved over to the kitchen.  This morning when I came out of the bedroom, a lovely mess was left for me to clean up.  She baked the most thoughtful cookie, consisting of soy sauce and an interesting mixture of herbs from my cooking cabinet.  That wasn’t quite a problem, but what I was frustrated over was the disaster of a mess that was left.  She worked on cleaning up the kitchen while I cleaned the livingroom…. but then said she had the ""itches"" and couldn’t do it anymore.  So we swapped.  I did what I could to praise her along the way, what a wonderful job she was doing clean, how well she did one item or another.  This seemed to give her a lot of drive for striving for more.
My praises to both girls is growing.  I smother Katherine with verbal and physical loves, and have stalled on doing the same for Alyssa because she’s so much bigger I think.  I have worked on changing that, continuing to tell Alyssa, almost 7yo, how beautiful she is, what a wonderful daughter she is, how lucky I am to have her as my daughter, how smart she is, and what an amazing sister she is.  I let the praises flow out.  Katherine, out of no where I’ll say, ""Katherine!""  ""What?""  ""I LOVE YOU!""  ""Thaaank you!"" from her sweet not yet 2yo mouth.  She now says ""I love you"" back, for not reason, and plasters me with a hug 🙂
Tonight I took both girls to McD’s for a treat.  After we came home and they finished eating, I rolled around with them on the floor being silly.  Alyssa said that it was the ""best day"", aww!
I think as parents we can always strive to do better.  I feel as though I’m a great mom, but I could certainly be so much higher quality one, which I continue to work towards.
HOMESCHOOLING
I made the final decision to homeschool my son this year, he would be entering 4th grade (recap of last year, he basically for what it’s worth, failed 3rd grade).  Once that decision was made though, fear set in.  Will I be able to do this?  Am I going to fail him?  Is this the right choice?  I have no doubt it is, but O-M-G.  He is still down visiting his dad in Oregon, I pick him up this Saturday.  He is going to be so excited!… although he says that my description of what homeschool is going to be like for him sounds worse then school itself 😛  Bet your backside!  No slacking with me! *crack whip* LOL  Unfortunately his dad firmly disagrees with homeschooling.  I have gone back and forth with the choice of telling him ahead of time, regarding the plans Jonah and I have decided on, or waiting for the first series of WASL tests and other testing items he will have completed, and then showing his dad the results from last year vs this year.  I am leaning to the second option.  He will handle the news better when he sees the results of his sons learning having improving, not stalling as he believes would happen (saying that I am not a licensed teacher), as well as the strong social aspects he will be involved with.
I called the homeschool coordinator in this area and will be receiving the papers I need to sign shortly.  I need to talk with the public school to see what programs he can be involved with.  I’d love for him to be part of the before school chest club.  He wants to remain in art class.  I am going to check more into home school groups in this area.  There is the school I taught at last year, but I’m looking more for actual groups where the kids can play and parents can each work with the kids that matches an ability that they have, a few times a week.
I will be signing him up for:

Piano (Starting in November, private)
Swimming (Starting in April, semi private)
Cooking & Sewing (already set, 1 on 1)
Foreign Language (in addition to ASL, group)
House Paining (****)
Computer (learning to build one from the bottom up, group)
Art (Checking into the school system for this, group)
Chess or Go (group)
Baseball or Soccer (some sort of sport, group)

***A guy friend of mine is co-owners of a local painting company, and I’ve cleared with him already that when he’s in the area and things slow down, Jonah will be able to spend a few days experiencing the painting field.  He’s a very hard worker.  He can work this into research and a report also.  
The base program I am using in the Robinson Curriculum, with Saxon Math.  I wont be following it to the T, since they say no TV as well as it being a bible curriculum.  It’s been the very best program I have found, and have been prepared with it for the last three years.
Ok, I admit it, I’m nervous.  LOL
Katherine was spouting off names of colors tonight.
  I love working with her.  I really think she too will flourish as a homeschooled child, but we’ll see when the time comes around.  In the meantime I’ll continue working with her.  Alyssa though, craves the public school atmosphere and so far is flourishing there 🙂  She is SOOOO excited for school to start!  She’ll be in FIRST GRADE!  OMGgoodness.
FRIENDS – Dont conviently forget about a date with a friend, just because you have a date with a girl = potential girlfriend.  When it happens multiple times, it starts to hurt.
Today, I suddenly got a lump in my throat.  I felt hurt and upset and couldn’t figure out why.  I mentioned it to a friend of mine, Jen, a while later and she says, ""It’s not from me!!  Ask David!""  Oh the joys of picking emotions up from other people.  David certainly does this too, when Jen started labor a migraine hit him and intensified as her labor progressed.  I spent the evening with him until I headed over to her house at 1am, and he was absolutely miserable.  He certainly was pleased when it was all over, LOL  Anyway, turns out that he is going out on a date Friday.  I am thrilled for him, but what about our plans?  It’s not the first time a date took presidence over a ‘date’ we’ve set, but today was the first time I said anything.  My feelings were most certainly hurt.  The lump in my throat?  Seems to have occured at the time when the date was set.  Atleast I figured out where it came from.  He attempted to reschedule, F that.  I am so done with taking second to potential girlfriends, when we have something already planned.  I had set up childcare, it’s a rarity for me to step outside of my door without little feet right behind me.  I was looking forward to adult interaction without children in tow also, and he is someone I rarely get together with but enjoy my time around.  
Jen and I will still be going, along with a few other friends.  JC (a very dear friend of mine) may be able to make it!  Whoo hooo!!  So, yeeees I know it all happens for a reason, but goodness.  I was careful with the phrasing of my words to him, I didn’t want to guilt trip but wanted to let him know how his choice of actions left me feeling, especially since this is not the first time, while I can also understand his excitement over potential girlfriend dates.  It does though, leave any desire to set up another ""date"" and set the kids up with childcare much lower.  Oh well.  Everyone has their own quirks.
MISC
I picked up Alyssa’s new bike a few days ago.  She is in heaven!  It’s pink with purple tires, a purple seat, and purple handles with a little purple/clear backpack.  I though she was going to pass out when she saw the bike, lol.  Now, just to get her out on it!!!   I do though, still need to pick her up a bike helmet and she’ll be good to go 🙂
Jen and I were talking about putting in a handbuilt wooden garden out on my back porch for Jonah.  I am seriously considering that.
All the horses are doing well.
Tomorrow I meet up with a friend who I haven’t seen for a while, to braid her hair in some sort of funky pattern with yarn.  I love braiding hair.  
I’ll be picking up a sandbox for Katherine afterwards, to put out on the back porch.  After seeing her play in one a few days ago, I fully agree that she needs one 🙂

I couldn’t begin to get my mind off of Garlic Jim’s Pizza tonight… the more I tried, the more it screamed for me.  Much to my thrill – NOT – my van key disappeared, leaving me scratching at my windows trying to will the door to unlock so I could retrieve my debit card.  The key will turn up, but in the meantime my craving was HORRIBLE!  I broke and decided to write a check.  The pizza arrived, I got my fix 😛
Katherine was quite excited over the delight of having pizza for dinner tonight.  ""YUMMY!"" she says, as I asked if she’d like pizza before it arrived.  That girl downed two big pieces plus a bit of root beer.  Yeeees, I know soda isn’t that good for younsters, but gotta have just a teeeny bit with pizza!  She looked at me as I was walking into the kitchen, this plate of cut up pizza in front of her and a BIG grin on her face…. ""Thank you mommy, yummy!""  AWWWW!!!!  My sweet little thing!  Alyssa had already fallen asleep, waking her up was a bit of a chore.  Technically her bed time really could be 7:30pm, since this is when she tends to fall asleep no matter where she is.  It’s so much fun suprising the girls with something they love (such as this type of pizza), although I think she was tired to the point of not really being hungry.  She only ate one piece and went back to sleep.
Here are two pictures of Katherine, not the best.  The first she had just woken up from a nap – look at those curls!  I love her hair.  My sleepy princess.  The second was taken by a friend while I was teaching a lesson and Katherine was hanging out watching me.


And Alyssa!  She has been having a field day with the camera, taking pictures of anything and everything!  She has REALLY been impressing me with the photos she ends up caputures.  I may just have to purchase her her own camera also.  She appears to have quite a gift with it.  Anyway, she was hanging out in the tree and asked her friend to take a picture of her.  Not the best quality, but it’s a picture! 🙂  My new up and coming photographer.

The girls enjoyed the afternoon playing with two of their little friends, Nia and Eden, while their mom sat in front of me while I worked on braiding her hair.  She’s going to ""Burning Man"" this year and wants to have her hair completely pulled up and out of the way, so it wont be destroyed by the ultrafine sand storms.  I really really wanted to go this year, but other things came up.  Mostly cost was a factor.  It would have ended up costing me well over $3000 to go, after the cost of tickets, air fair, food, lost wages, as well as a nanny for the kids for the two weeks.  But, I suppose fate plays it’s own part in life.  I have the most exciting event happening over Labor Day weekend *hop hop hop* and if I was gone at Burning Man I would have missed it completely *ear to ear grin!*
Doesn’t this look interesting?  She’s coming back Friday for me to continue working on it.  The girls want a few in their hair, and I may just go with some in mine.  What fun!


I’ve been having HORRIBLE PMS this month, AF is right around the corner.  Ugh.  I feel like biting someone’s head off, even today.  Yesterday I snapped at poor Mark when he called.  ""How are you doing today?""  ""OMFG Let me tell you how!!!"", and off I went on my rant, LOL  My whole world seems to revolve around him when he calls, since I rarely get to chat with him, guess not when I’m preoccupied at being pissed, LOL.
This is sweet little A, I watch her during the day.  She’s now 7mo and has been with me since she was six weeks old, and can easily see her staying with me until she starts kindergarden – should neither of us move.  Talk about keeping baby envy in check….. sort of.  I absolutely LOVE taking care of her, she fits in so well with the family.  I really am very very lucky.  Katherine and her adore eachother.  Katherine has started sniffling at the door when her mom picks her up, poor thing.  Although, once that door is shut she EAGERLY climbs into my lap.  ALL of mommy’s arms are ONLY hers then 😛  

Tomorrow, Ryan from up north, comes down to visit for a few days.  I haven’t told the kids, it is the most delightful thing to see them scream in excitement and jump into his arms.  He’s like a big buddy to them, it’s precious.  He started Katherine into her passion for books (bad bad mommy, doesn’t read them), a love I know I’m going to pay for now as she grabs any book she can find and ""reads"" them, lol.  Walking by a bookstore with her is just as horrible as attempting to walk by a shoe section with Alyssa!  He went out of town a few weekends ago to the Oregon coast, and picked the girls up a surprise.  Alyssa recieved a gold necklace with her name and a diamond looking stone.  Katherine received a horse on a chain, which she LOVES, especially now that she has one like mommy’s 😛  I received a beautiful necklace with three amythist (sp) stones within a circle, on a chain.  It rests right in front of my heart. He said his sister thinks he picked it up, subcontiously thinking the three stones stood for my ""three children"".  OMG I’m too sentimental, lol.  I have a huge thing for necklaces too, although since I rarely purchase one the only way I receive them is if they are given to me as a gift.
I look at all he does, all he is, and OMG he can keep up with my CRAZY schedule, kids, horses, lessons, drill team, hours on the computer working until late late, and I certainly have shown him no mercy with my schedule.  If you’re a friend of mine and you choose to tag along, better be ready! LOL  What sucks is that to me he feels like a brother *thumping self upside head*, but no matter what I do I can’t change my feelings.  He knows this, and says that he doesn’t want to loose our friendship, that it’s most important to him.  Awww 🙂  Now, to find that man a kick ass girlfriend.  He needs one!  How come I keep finding guy friends of mine, girlfriends?  I’m a matchmaker, while I stay single 😛 LOL
Friday is movie night!  JC called today and said she’s pretty sure she’ll be able to make it.  Whoo hooo!!!  I can’t wait to see her again.  I am still seriously consid
ering taking Katherine with me, she’ll love all the dancing.  That girl can really get into moving!  If I ever figure out how to post a video here, I’ll do so.  It’s absolutely adorable.  Her eyes get to twinkling and she starts wiggling, haha.  Today she and I were skipping, twirling and dancing, back to our apartment from the mailbox.  I am such a dork, lol.  
A few days ago my mom said that children who don’t see their fathers start to forget.  That a short period, is a long time for a child.  I worry about this, very much.  The girls father has so many wonderful qualities about him, I want them to remember him regardless of how long it is in between visits.  I’ve asked for a photo of him with each of the girls, so I can hang it above their bed, but that hasn’t happened yet.  Katherine has grabbed an anniversary photo of ours where she is in my arms as a 3-week-old, and carries it around.  Alyssa only really has a photo of when she was first born.  I tend to keep it on my mantle in hopes of keeping it from getting ruined, but occasionally she pulls it down to look at it.  When I let her take some pictures, I found she took a photo of it, it was her before we brought her home from the hospital…..

I hope I can update this soon, giving each girl a recent picture of their very own – just them with their dad.  I asked Alyssa yesterday, what type of things she use to do over at Daddy’s.  She sat thinking for a bit, and said she couldn’t really remember (has it really been that long? – six weeks) but said that she remembers going to Chucky Cheese alot.  HOW SWEET!!  Those are memories that kids carry forever.
I remember as a child, ""special time"" with my mom.  She was going to nursing school full time and working what seemed to be the rest of the time.  I rarely saw her, but she made it a strong point to always have a ""special time"" date set that she refused to miss.  Tuesday was my day.  She would pick me up from preschool and take me to a special place.  One time we went to a shoe repair store, and I was able to see how that was done.  I still remember the machines and the old man, as well as the shoe sole he has set up for me to attempt to sew 🙂  Another time to the fire station, I saw a donald duck wheel movie on how to escape a burning house.  To feed the ducks.  Play on the playground.  Visit the book store, sit down for an ice cream cone, visit the sweet store, experience large birds, play dress up, etc.  Goodness, I must have been 4yo or nearing 5yo.  I was a youngster, but these times really made an impression on me.  These events are what enable me to know what is important for my own children.  And in turn they’ll repeat those events with their own children, and it passes through generations.  
I pray, and wish upon that stars outside, that eventually he finds the time to start spending more time with his girls.  To come over for a swim, go on a walk with them, to bring his car over so they can help him wash it, ride bikes together, take them for ice cream, to the movies, to the skating ring, anywhere.  Just time.  Even if he doesn’t have the time to have them over for a whole weekend, that he finds the time to occasionally spend moments of his week with them, doing something to create a memory, to encourage and continue that bond that they have with him.
This is what I pray for.

AF showed up today, four days early, but just the same.  These last few days I’ve felt so bitchy, short, teary at times…. and then tonight the nausia started in as well as the cramping.  Walla, she was here!  I feel like a whining baby tonight, although I’m keeping it to myself.  My abdomen huuurts.  Here I am now laying on the floor watching Charmed, and placed the laptop on my tummy.  Ahh – natural heatpad 🙂  Ok, I can lay like this for a while.  I hope this passes quickly.  It’s not usually THIS uncomfortable!
Last night I couldn’t sleep.  I fell asleep just before 2am, and woke up a little after 4am, with almost a panic feeling of having to clean the house.  I couldn’t go back to sleep, I got up, poked around on email for a bit and started cleaning.  Sat back down and started taking care of drill emails as they were coming in (finishing the corrections needed for our non-profit with microsoft, old past owner to a truck we were given, etc), and back to cleaning again.  I had the livingroom and porch completely reorganized before 8am.  I cannot WAIT until the apartment management is ready to have the floors cleaned – they are most certainly in need of it. 
A few days ago when I picked apples with the girls, Katherine played in the sandbox.  She’s never really done that before, we’re just never around sandboxes.  She absolutely loved it and didn’t want to leave, finding complete thrill in pouring sand into a little fish and watching it flow over.  I had the idea we could possibly fit one on our back porch, I double checked and today picked her up a sandbox.  Tomorrow I need to go ahead and buy sand.  She is SO excited!
Although I’m stalling giving away the rocking chair, I am most likely going to sell the BBQ and build Jonah a place for him to have a garden he’s asked about having for quite a while.  The bikes I am sure can be stored on the master bedroom.
Tomorrow the house gets gutted – well, cleaned.  I want Jonah’s room ready for him when he comes home.  I need to go through all of Alyssa’s clothes and finish tidying up their room, and finish folding and putting away the laundry.  I am not happy with how things look right now.
Jonah has reached an age where he needs his own room, so the only thing left to do is move out into the livingroom.  I am picking up a loveseat sleeper tomorrow.  This way the girls have one room, Jonah has the other room, and I have the livingroom.  Works well, lol.  Not like I really need a room with a closed door for any reason, lol. 
Jonah’s dad decided to keep him for an extra week.  So, this weekend I may actually get a chance to ride!  I can’t wait 🙂  So, NEXT Saturday I pick him up.  
Mmmmm – Charmed is one.  Speaking of charmed, I really want to get that second tatoo.  As things are going, it doesn’t seem I’ll be able to for quite a while.  Oh well.  I do appreciate having the time to be sure the design I create is absolutely perfect.  I love my first one.  There are two more I want.
Ok – going to lay down and watch this show.  I have the series here, first and second.

Well, I completely failed in taking a mommy’s night tonight.  Here I had the opportunity, someone very willing to watch the kids, and I failed.  I was off taking care of horse chores and just HAD to come back and take Katherine with me.  Along with that I had two guy friends here waiting in their truck to follow me, it was great to see them again.
Jennifer and Luke (her son), Donny and Shawn, Nicki, as well as myself and Katherine, all went to see Step Up.  It was yummy 🙂  Katherine was hallarious, when music starts that girl can’t keep her body still! HAHAHA  I ended up handing her to Jennifer and taking Luke.  I adore that little guy, I’m so lucky to have such a close friendship with his mom, and in turn him.  It’s absolutely unbelievable how quickly they grow!  He’s just a little butterball now, lol.
Arriving home, and having seen Katherine had fallen asleep, I took a moment outside to breathe.  The quietness was wonderful.  Although not the ‘no kids’ as I thought it would go, I am glad I took Katherine afterall 🙂

I know – I need some serious help on my titles.  Maybe soon here I’ll be able to spat out some sort of thrilling title for each entry.
I talked with someone shortly ago who made me aware that they still read my diary and it’s the only way they know what’s going on in my life, and how important it is to them.  Aww, wow.  So, I’ve been trying to type more. 
Today didn’t go as planned at all.  I had full intentions on gutting the house, basically, going through absolutely everything.  Tossing things, organizing, etc.  Upon rising, and going through the morning routine, I loaded everyone up so I could go feed the team horses breakfast and pick up grain for everyone.  The horses were fed first, and off to the grange.  When pulling in, I was quickly made aware that it was customer appreciation day.  Ooookkkk… everyone out, it looked like fun!  We all climbed up into the cart pulled by two draft horses, Alyssa was so excited, Katherine half clung to me.  While Alyssa had her face painted, Katherine took great excitement in riding around on the ponies.  She didn’t want to leave, lol.  Both of the handlers (she rode both ponies) were just in awe with her – she asked the ponies if she could ride them, and said ""thank you ride"" with a pat, when she was finished 🙂  That’s my girl!  Alyssa won some cute prizes, and the horse head that I received Katherine quickly snagged as her own.  But of course 😛
While there, I think I figured out what my next pet is going to bed  – – – – quite a few years down the road of course.  A wallaby.  Ohhh my goodness.  I cuddled with a year old baby who still adored his pouch, carrying that guy around 🙂  I drilled the owner with questions, which he delightfully answered.  He most certainly could talk!!  I also found out that he is the one who will be adopting a colt that was given to a (ex)friend of mine, who was foaled out of the girls dads mare.  Small world in this area 🙂  He was so in love with the colt, who is now 2yo, that he started crying and had to come give me a big long hug 🙂  I am SO delighted that he’ll be in a home deeply loved and cherished 🙂
Grain was dropped off on the way home, and horse chores done.  My whole desire was to arrive home and clean until 10pm when I couldn’t run the washing machine, dishwasher, or vacuum cleaner anymore.  I arrived home, only to receive a call that I was welcome to come pick up this free loveseat hide-a-bed.  I was hesitant, I just picked one up yesterday.  But, decided to go check it out anyway.  It was BEAUTIFUL!!!  I loaded it up and brought it home.
The girls room is now cleared out and tidy.  The new loveseat is set up in the livingroom, things are coming together.  Unfortunately, although I have care for the kids, I didn’t complete the house today as I needed to so I doubt I’ll be able to ride tomorrow *whine*.  I need to get this finished 🙁  Maybe if I’m lucky I’ll get the house finished, and still have time to ride before the BBQ – If I go to that 🙂
Looooong day, but quite delightful 🙂   The zzzzz-s are already starting to overwhelm me.

As I sit here right now typing at my dining room table, a friend is sitting on the other end working on their own laptop, with Katherine hanging over looking at the screen pointing out pictures that are coming up on the screen.  Katherine has become a strong book-a-holic, begging for books to be read to her, or for her to go through and point out animals, colors, and items to you herself.  She LOVES reading, it’s so incredibly precious.  I was reading at 2 1/2yo, I wonder when reading for her will click.  For Jonah, he staggered through reading, finally having it click for him when he was in second grade.  Alyssa is entering first, and hasn’t quite picked up reading yet.  I’m sure she too will be in reading help, as Jonah was.  Katherine though…. with her love for books being overflowing, I doubt that it’ll be another five years before she’s reading.  I have no doubt that in another year, by the time she’s turning 3yo, she’ll be reading.  I love watching my kids, and observing the passions in life they hold, and watching how they transpire 🙂
The biggest thing Katherine is learning right now, is her colors.  ""Yellow bus, green car, blue truck, brown dog, orange book, purple ball"".  She’s learning her numbers, simple counting from 1 to 10.  Once she has that we’ll work on counting backwards and simple addition and subtraction.  She almomst has it.  We count walking up and down the stairs.  I was taking notice at the similarities of Jonah and Katherine vs Alyssa.  Alyssa has the wonderful quality of make believe role playing.  She is incredible with it, something that Jonah never did and something I’d like to encourage Katherine to do, although with a sister like Alyssa I’m not sure how she’ll get away not playing make believe 🙂  Alyssa also completely lets herself go dancing, she’s an incredible child.
Alyssa met a new friend today, a child who is also entering first grade who lives near right next door to us.  She met her today on our way out the door feeding horses.  I sat there watching the two of them interact, finally calling Alyssa over to the car.  I explained that we needed to go feed horses, but when we came back she could play.  She excitingly told the girl.  When we arrived back, I smiled as the sweet nextdoor child, said, ""Hello there girl!!!"".  They played from 1pm – 6pm, dressup and tea party.  Alyssa was in heaven.  She came up at that time and asked if she could go swimming with them.  I went down to talk with the childs grandfather.  What a wonderful family.  The mother of this child is a single mom, she’ll be home on Tuesday, I look forward to meeting her.
While down there, the witch lady who has chewed my kids for playing with a volume level much lower then normal children, screamed from her balcony at the two girls.  She yelled at me, and it gave me the opportunity to face her back – letting her know that if she had a problem with the kids she needed to talk to the office.  She threatened to call the police.  *Shrug* That’s fine, what are they going to do?  6pm, the terrorizers are quietly playing tea party.  Ugh.  She yelled that they have been screaming all afternoon, and she’s already once told them to be quiet.  This is a lady who has no children.  She also came over to the pool a few weeks ago, yelling at both of my girls as well as a few other children who were part of the group, for being too loud.  I’ve already been in touch with management about it, only to also find out that she’s been harrassing the neighbor that lives below her, also threatening to call the cops.
I learned more about her tonight.  She is an author, co-authoring a few books with a good friend of hers who lives below her, who also has yelled at the kids but has also shown a very sweet and kind side to her.  I decided that the best solution would be to sit down with her, with the other parents here, and come to a compromise.  As even the office said, the kids can’t be kept locked inside, it’s summer time and need the freedom to play.  Obviously, any kid noise at all bothers her.  Kids need to play, while at the same time she needs her peace too.  My hope is that we can agree that the kids can freely play until 6pm at a respectful kid volume.  If she is having a day where she needs quiet, then she can call me and I’ll pull the kids inside or we’ll go elsewhere.  I can understand someone needing quiet.  She said there were four other people that are upset….. I would like to find out who these people are and talk with them also.  Was she just white lying?  It’s very important to me that everyone and their comfort is respected, while my kids are also able to be kids.
I suppose I’m fighting more for this now since Alyssa has a friend who I am sure she’ll be playing much more with, and will be in that back area behind my building.  They live on ground level and here on the corner.  I want to be sure we catch this now so the kids can freely play.  When she yelled at the kids, Alyssa ran inside crying, coming out with coaxing while she asked, ""Is the scary lady gone?"".  I don’t want that to happen again.  While at the same time, I don’t want to continue to keep my kids locked inside with concern that their talking will bother this lady.  I do all I can to respect all around.  If my kids are throwing a tantrum, are loud, or fighting, I shut the windows and doors.  I’m not going to have it bother others.  I was told today by this family, they didn’t even realize kids lived here, they’re so quiet.  I do my best.  I hope that a comfortable compromise can be made.  I will be talking to the management tomorrow though, to let them know what happened and what we are doing to solve the problem.  What I worry about, is that although they may have lived here for a while, the property is now under new ownership and management.  The complaints the office has received is all they know about these two ladies.  I’d rather we come to a peaceful agreement before either are considered for eviction for yelling at tenents children and harrassing the parents.  I most certainly am glad that I am not the only one.
I can’t wait to pick up Jonah.  Six more days!  I miss him SO MUCH!  It’s been almost seven weeks.  This is the longest he’s spent with his dad.  I am happy for him 🙂  He isn’t ready to talk to his dad about his desire to homeschool yet, he knows that he strongly disagrees with it.  He agrees with my decision of talking to him in December, when Jonah sees his dad again.  He will have had four months of homeschooling at that time, as well as one or two testings having occured.  I plan to bring with me all the work he’s accomplished, his schedule, as well as his scores for last year vs this year – – – – showing to him the incredible progress he has made.  I have no doubt this will occur.  Jonah still dreads his dad seeing his scores from last year, basically he failed 3rd gra
de.  He feels horrible, and doesn’t want to appear as a failure in his dads eyes.  Poor guy 🙁  But, it will be important for his dad to see the direction Jonah was heading in, and what homeschool has provided for him.  I feel so strongly about this, that should his dad argue with me, I will fight him.  Something I normally wouldn’t do, but not when I see the incredible negative results that were occuring.  Should Jonah not flourish in the homeschool program, then I wouldn’t hesitate placing him back into the public school system, but based on his personality and the way he learns best, I have no doubt that he will progress very well and VERY quickly.  I’m excited to start with him.
These two pictures were taken by a friends phone.  The first one is Alyssa on her pony, myself, and Katherine in my arms.  Alyssa was so proud to show off her pony, Sierra.  Sierra foundered last year so has been on the recovery.  She’s MUCH better, and almost ready to be ridden regularly again.  I love having Sierra in our family, she’s been with us for 8 1/2 years now.  She one day will pass onto Katherine, but for now she’s Alyssa’s pony.  I have no doubt that she’ll one day be teaching my own grandchildren to ride 🙂  Doesn’t Alyssa look beautiful up there???

This next picture was the one taken yesterday at the local grange’s, ""Customer Appreciation Day"".  Katherine was on one pony and then begged to ride the second too.  The saddle was crooked, but Katherine didn’t notice.  I can’t imagine my kids not being a part of horses in some sort of way.  I need to be sure to offer them more time to ride.  Jonah was close to entering his first horse show when he was Katherine’s age.  I would LOVE for the kids to all have their own horses one day, but not sure about that.  We have two right now, Jonah’s horse and Alyssa’s pony.  Good enough – spendy suckers are more costly then kids! LOL

Well, that’s about it.  I seem to be venturing to this diary to type much more often.  The entries are turning out LONG!  Sorry 🙂

OMG, another entry!  So unlike me to be writing like this, but good too.  Since I have to write daily elsewhere, I find myself venturing over here also to write.  I have been told by a few that this diary is there only way of knowing what’s going on with myself, the kids, our lives, so I am glad I’m finding the time to write more.  Well, making the time.
As I type this, Katherine is laying in my nap nearly asleep.  She’s been quite the cuddle bug lately.  Alyssa is in her bedroom watching a movie, almost ready for bed.  She has had a cold for these last few days, there seems to be quite a heavy summer bug floating around.  Thankfully she’s the only one that has gotten it so far, and hopefully will be the only one.  
I am so grateful I bought this van.  I absolutely LOVE the roll out seats, although I can do without having to remove those suckers again.  Tonight, yet again, I hauled them out in preporation to haul the bunkbeds over to the new owners house.  They fit perfectly, with LOTS of room to spare.  Tomorrow morning I drive to Renton to pick up a beautiful pine bookcase.  It has six adjustable shelves, Jonah will be thrilled!
Jonah tends to be completely engrosed into medical books, although I wouldn’t be surprised now that he’s reading even stronger that he’ll start diving into history books too.  These books he ends up with though are thick and normal textbook height.  They don’t fit in normal shelves.  We’ve had an issue with his excyclopedia books not fitting, although he’s made sure they’re well hidden so his sisters can’t find them.  He’s asked about a book case, and has been extremely patient as his books are transferred from the top of the shelf, to a box, to under his bed….. now, he will have a bookcase.  And in addition, I will have a place to put my own books also.
The girls love their room and their new sleeping arangements.  They also now have a TV for their kid movies or Jonah’s video games when he gets back. As all parents do, they continue to search for the key to keep things in order.  My hope this way, is now that the girls room is organized and simple, it’ll be easy for them to keep it clean.  In addition, toys stay in their room and not allowed to come out.  We’ll see how it goes.
I’m excited to finish getting Jonah’s new room put together, and certainly before he arrives home Saturday.  He is still sharing the room with me, persay – my items will still be in there, although it will be his own room.  Me?  I get the livingroom.  I absolutely LOVE the loveseat hide-a-bed I have now.  It is soooo comfortable!  I’m pleased.  He will have his computer in his own room, finally, with a BUNCH of new educational games downloaded onto it.  They are completely fascinating and very in debth.  He will not have internet though.
That’s it!  For this lovely Monday night 😛
Off to lay this near 2yo child down, in hopes we don’t have a repeat of last night.  She got a crazy wind of energy at 3am – ugh! LOL

I met Alyssa’s new little friend’s mom yesterday – what a great lady!  The family though, all of them, talk REALLY LOUD.  haha.  The cranky ladies are going to have a coniption fit if they’re all outside 😛  Our conversation went great, while the girls danced off and played dressup.  They’re so cute!!
This morning well all were suppose to go to the movies, although I’m seriously contemplating letting Alyssa go by herself.  I woke up this morning with a sore throat and sneezing…. given to me by the lovely one, Alyssa, herself.  She’s pretty much over her cold, just is left with her normal caughing now.  I started her on her nose spray last night.
I’ve gone ahead and found a new home to move my gas grill onto.  It’s being picked up today.  This will open the back porch up so I can build Jonah’s garden, and can lay the sandbox down for Katherine.  When I have the funds for it, it looks as though the small electric grills will be perfect to have out there.  They’re cutely small and work very well.
Yesterday I picked up a pine bookshelf for Jonah’s room, so he has a place to put all of his books.  While I was there, there was also the CUTEST little pine dresser, which I felt would be perfect for Katherine.  Sure enough, she loved it.  She can open the top drawer and peer into it with just her nose grazing the top of the drawer.  Katherine is quite into clothes, this will allow her a way to learn how to fold and keep her own clothes in order.  This will also give Alyssa the closet.
Well, just a quick throw together entry.  Hope all is well today.

I drove down to Salem today to pick Jonah up from his dads.  His dad kept him nearly all summer, I was quite impressed.  It is certainly wonderful for Jonah too, who rarely gets to see his dad through the school year.  I asked when the next time was that he wanted to meet, he said he wasn’t sure and he’d be in touch.  Christmas?  He doesn’t know.
The trip down was quiet.  Both girls fell asleep.  I had invited a friend along with me who also fell asleep.  My mind was heavily preoccupied with thoughts that have heavily weighed on it for these last few days, so I was in my own world.  I’m glad he didn’t take offense.  I got sleepy and changed with him, and immediately crashed until we were almost there.  On the way back I drove the whole way.  That’s one hard part for me driving, I get sleepy.  Thrilling.  That’s why whenever I can, I bring someone along with me to switch if needed, or atleast to chat with.
The trip back up was uneventual.  The three kids are incredible travelers, unlike how I use to be as a child 😛  No fighting, no begging for the bathroom, no ""I’m hungry"" or thirsty.  Katherine was thrilled to have Jonah back, although besides giggling and talking to him, she found quite the delighting in kicking the back of his seat to get his attention, especially finding great humor in doing so as he was trying to fall asleep, lol.
I am very happy Jonah will have his own room now.  He’s excited too 🙂  I am certainly going to be expecting a lot of him as he starts school this year under the home school plan – speaking of which, I need to call the home school department in the morning to find out why I haven’t received the paperwork yet that I need to fill out and have filed with them.  I was talking with Jonah today about an income – he wants to open up his own savings account, and has been talking about coming up with a business of his own.  Hmm, I wonder what he’ll think of.  I did this as a child too, pondered ideas and searched for what clicked with me.  It’s interesting to see him doing it also.
Alyssa seems to have suddenly grown up these last two weeks.  I look at her and see a child with absolutely radiating beauty.  She’s matured.  My baby is almost 7yo!  She starts her first day of FIRST GRADE shortly.  She continues to talk about this birthday party she wants to put together, her birthday is the third week of October.  She’s doing quite the job planning it out, LOL.  So far she wants a princess themed party at chucky cheese 😛  I’m so proud of her and all the growing she’s done.  They sure grow up quite fast right before you’re eyes.
Katherine too has suddenly grown!  Today she had me laughing as she’s skipping/hopping/bouncing across the subway store, giggling.  She is SO DANG CUTE!  Curls bouncing away 🙂  Her humor leaves you boggled.  She is quite the angel 🙂
Today when I picked Jonah up from his dad, I gave him a hug.  ""What’s that for?"" he scowled.  ""Because I like you!  Hug me back turkey"".  He pulled away from me, ""No.  I don’t want to.  I don’t like the things you’re doing right now"".  Ah, two things – one being homeschooling, neither items that effect his life.  I was a smartass and remarked right back, ""Right – the world doesn’t revolve around you"".  Glad he took that in good humor and said, ""It should!"" LOL  
How come people are always so quick to judge other peoples decisions in their life, even though it doesn’t even directly effect their own?  Seems silly really.  
Last night I cleaned out my closet.  Two half naked girls trying on clothes, must have been an interesting sight, lol.  I am moving thing out that I wont be wearing for quite a while, that I can’t fit into, and that just doesn’t fit my style anymore.  It’s nice to do that occasionally, it’s so easy for clothes to pile up – ones which you don’t wear anymore.
Today I pulled out my long black (with large dark purple flowers) skirt that drops down to the bottom of my ankles.  I don’t wear dresses normally, but love this thing.  I have a turquoise colored top, where the sleeves barely cover the shoulders, and has a V-neckline that drops down leaving cleavage to be shown – along the V there is the same colored sequense (sp).  Together, along with the long necklace that was given to me that drops right between my breasts, with three purple stones on it within a silver circle – it’s gorgeous.  I was quite pleased with how I looked today.  I need more clothes that have this type of feel.

Well, that’s what this entry started out as today.  I had quite a bit typed and then something happened and everything was gone.  Oh well.
It really was a peaceful day today.  When I started that entry my son was on the computer playing a game, daughter watching a movie, and both little ones sleeping.  Everything was quiet 🙂  In the background I had some beautiful soft music playing – ahhh.
I took Jonah and his bike into the bike store today so his bike could be fixed, only to realize as he was pushing it in that it really was too small for him.  A worker there confirmed this, and said he is now up to a 24"" bike by placing him on a bike he fell in love with – $300, not quite ready to pay that price yet.  I brought his old one back home and took the next size up bike, a 24"", to be fixed.  $90, ouch!  But, the nice this is that there is quite a list, so it wont be ready until next Wednesday.  I am strongly debating looking for a ""new"" bike for him, that is less then that.  I’m browsing, hopefully I find one.  If I do so before Saturday, then I can pick back up his bike at no charge.  
It’s been wonderful to have Jonah back home, he’s quite the little helper.  He’s extremely independant, and although he does the normal brother poking to antaganize Alyssa, he also does a lot to keep the peace.  He’s remarkable.
I have some visitors from out of town coming to stay this Friday, I’m so excited!  I haven’t seen them in ….. wow….. 15mo?  Regardless, it definitely has been quite some time.  We’re all having a girls night, Jennifer is coming to stay also with her little boy.  I am VERY glad I decided to go ahead and get loveseat hide-a-beds.  It’ll be very easy for everyone to have a place to sleep 🙂  I am skipping in excitement!
I touched back in with the management today regarding carpet cleaning.  My carpets are in serious need, thankfully they will be done soon.  A complimentary one came with the resigning of the lease.  While I was there I also talked with them regarding how rent was going to be come this next resigning.  Right now, for a 2br 1bth apartment, I pay $895mo.  $100 more then last year, and still $100 off of normal rent.  Next year there will be no more discount and rent will be atleast $1045.  I am glad to know this, I will be scouting out ideas on where to move.  I will most likely be staying very local, but at that price I should be able to rent a house, atleast a small one.  I’d rather pay just a little bit more and not have to deal with apartment issues.  Although, I really do enjoy it here.  Hmm, who knows.  I’m glad to be able to plan ahead though.  I’d love to move into a 3bd house 🙂
My income for these past few weeks have been severely cut, living on 1/3 of what I normally receive.  It hasn’t made budgeting too easy.  Thankfully this is the last week of that, and it’ll move back up starting next week.  Whew!
My patience has strongly been tested lately.  I’m having a REALLY hard time with the clutter in the house, and am glad it’s slowly been getting moved out.  Also, tonight for example, when I’m trying to cook dinner I’m dealing with Katherine clinging to me and Alyssa under foot, whining about Jonah.  I am certainly glad my patience level is HUGE! LOL  Although I was getting kinda short, which I’m not too thrilled about.  Rather then waiting for a situation to already be taking place like that, I need to plan for it and take steps to prevent it before it starts.  Next time 🙂
My hair has finally reached a length that I can’t just leave it hanging down anymore.  After last week where I had to sit and work through a rats nest at 3am (although the hour doesn’t have much to do with it, I couldn’t sleep and had to get that thing detangled), I have now left it in a braid.  It’s working well so far.  I hope I don’t reach a point of just chopping it off, although it sure becomes quite tempting.  It’s decent looking in a braid, which I’m glad for.  I’d love to learn more styles to do with it.  It hands down to my pants waist line.
Ohhhh birthdays are starting now.  My two younger/oldest brothers had their birthdays in July and August.  Next comes my youngest brother, David, then Katherine, Mimi’s dad, Alyssa, Jonah, Mimi, girls dad, Nicki, and multiple other people that are skipping my mind.  Wow – not sure if I prefer everyone grouped together or spread out more, LOL.
Tonight as Amandine was being picked up by her grandparents, a white truck rolled in.  Donny!  Mmm – hug, and introduction to his friend in the passengers seat.  I love that friends of mine feel they can just show up out of the blue.  They asked to use my computer for directions to get back home taking the back roadws (transmission went).  They asked if they could use the computer *cringe, dirty house!*  They laughed when they walked in, asking, ""Where’s the mess???""  Whatever 😛  Maybe I’m getting much more picky, which is good I suppose.  I still feel I have far to go.  They sat down, his friend started laughing as I leaned over the couch, reached around the side of Donny, running my fingers along the mouse pad on the laptop which sat directly in his lap, and typed in what they were looking for.  It’s cute to see his eyes gasp – the last time was when I was on the phone with JC, who said hello to him and other comments, and as I continued with her I reached in the truck and placed my hand high on his theigh to say goodbye.  Meant nothing by it, exactly, but he went wide eyed and started grinning with silly remarks.  Donny is too funny, and quite cute to tease 🙂  Nothing will ever come of it, he’s a great friend though and quite the delight to have around.  I’ve been very proud of him, to see the great steps forward he’s making in his life and getting himself together.  He started with nothing, literally, and is making quite a base for himself.
Well, not much else to say really – gotta scoot these kids to bed.  Night all!

A cold has seemed to pass through the house.  I still feel it hovering with me, Alyssa still has her cough, and Jonah woke up with a very sore chest and a difficult time breathing without it hurting, this morning.  I set him up into a hot bath and fixed him a strong cup of tea.  He fell back asleep, sleeping for quite a majority of the day.  He woke up feeling MUCH better, and fixed himself another cup of tea.  He’s bouncy and fine now.  Sniffly noses still remain.
Ryan came down tonight to visit.  Tomorrow is a huge day for me, and really was able to use help with the kids, and it seemed to time up perfectly with his schedule.  I am helping to drive an older lady around tomorrow who has no transportation – a good deed I felt inclined to do, I suppose.  Along with a few stops she needs to make, she also needs to pick up a beast of a goat about an hour away.  Good deed – good deed – I remind myself, lol.  I am quite thrilled the seats so easily come out of the van 🙂  She also sounds like she’d enjoy someon to talk with.  I’m glad I could help provide this to her.  I’ve seen her twice before, I look forward to seeing her again.
So, he’s playing with the kids during this time, and then I am back to watch the baby I care for during the day.  Following, I have to run 2 1/2hrs up north to take care of a few things, and back.  I should be home around 2am.  Quick sleep…. and … I think I get to sleep in Friday!  What’s on the to do list???  House cleaning!  (as always) and a horse supply pickup run.  I tried to do that today and they were out of many of the things I needed.  Have I mentioned how much I LOVE this van?  I am able to haul gobloads of bags of grain and stall pellets 🙂
Friday night, is going to be special.  Ryan is hanging out with the kids once again, a treat – I thank him dearly.  I will be able to step out of the house, childless, and attend estatic dancing.  Something I haven’t done for quite a while.  With luck Jennifer will be able to come also.  I have been online talking with an online friend of mine tonight, who I’ve been chatting with for almost three years now, but have never had the opportunity to meet.  I’ll be picking him up along the way, and taking him dancing too.  Right up his alley it sounds like 🙂  And no, it’s not some strange man, another friend of mine knows him well and actually introduced us through messenger.  I’m quite excited to finally meet him.
Having Ryan in my life has thrown a challenging situation into my hands.  Here is a man the kids LOVE, he is patient, respectful, very willing to get down to their level, freely reads to Katherine when she asks for a story, plays computer games with Jonah, just what Alyssa needs, supportive of my horses and can easily keep up with my busy schedule, definitely has the touch…. and I can’t seem to fall for him, any more then a friend.  What’s up with that???  He is a wonderful friend though, and am very glad to have him a part of our lives.  I have been very upfront with him so there was no misleading.  I am glad he is understanding.
I have quite a handful of guy friends, each one with very unique qualities and all excellent ones even though each are very different individuals in themselves.  Each one though, brings something unique into our lives, each carrying qualities in which I’m glad to have my children around.  All, fully excepting my children – to where they are not a burden nor ""in the way"".  It has been wonderful for them.  I’m very choosey on who I have around, both men and woman.  My children are to never be left feeling pushed out of the way, in any regards, where another person takes priority ahead of them.  It’s worked out very well.
The drill team is going exceptional.  It’s like a dance for many of us, running it while also taking care of the rest of our lives.  I have no idea how we did it before, and have any life.  We all seem to be pretty understanding as another needs to take a break and take care of personal issues or even just a breather.  This has been nice 🙂
Alyssa has been dancing around as Snow While today – not wanting to remove a dress she put on.  I have found her occasionally changing out of it and into a ""church girl dress"", as she calls it.  She is SO BEAUTIFUL!!!  I hope to get some pictures of her soon to post.  She really is quite a remarkable child, growing up SO SO fast.
Sometime this weekend I’ll be taking her, by herself, mommy and daughter time (If I’m able to make such a feat happen), to pick up her supplies.  She’d love this 😀  First grade… *sniffle*…. 
Jonah is well set to start homeschool.  We all are very excited for this.  I have also been asked if I am free to provide morning care to one child, and have been asked if I was available for one afterschool child as well as care for a 2yo.  I don’t really know how it’ll all come together, leaving it to fate really.  It’ll be perfect, I am sure.  And I’ll end up the children I’m suppose to care for during the day.  I have been completely and utterly blessed with the one child I have in my care…. what wonderful parents she has, as well as a great child to watch grow up and be a part of her daily life 🙂
I had the most delightful and much desired phone conversation tonight with someone special.  Many many things are going in such a great direction, my life is growing quickly!  I am so happy.  I have a group of wonderful friends – men and woman alike, three exceptional children, college that sits on the horizon for when I’m ready to start which will be soon, a great drill rescue organization that is growing slowly but surely, another dream in the process of being formed, and so many other things.  I could hug life!  Although… occasionally I want to throttle it also 😛 LOL

It’s almost time!!  Almost time, almost time *completely excited jig*.  Waiting for Jennifer to show up and we’re off.  I don’t think I could be more excited, while nervous at the same time! LOL
We have a horse on the drill team who is having a bit of attachment issues.  I had a feeling what the problem was, but took a trip out today to see him to get a first hand in person feeling.  He is an amazing horse, gorgeous, full of potential….. EXTREMELY withdrawn.  And with that, overly sensitive, doesn’t want to be touched, caught, even looked at.  I spent 1 1/2hrs with him today, talking.  We ended with him contently standing next to me, quiet, peaceful, and thankful.  I will be going and having lunch with him tomorrow – just he and I.  It’s mostly just the time he needs to trust he can connect to someone.  That someone really does care about him.  Since I always have the kids, it is a rarity that I am able to ever go work the horses anymore, so I’m thankful for this time.  The horse I’ve boasted about on here, Zoe?  My pride and joy, the one I started myself and have trained from the beginning?  My absolute princess?  She has to be assigned to someone else because I can never be out there.  Oh the joys of single motherhood.  One day the team will own it’s own property and I can work with the kids beside me.  In the mean time, the barn rules must be followed.  No children unsupervised (standing next to their side) – and I can’t be in two places at once.
I sure miss working with them.  It was so wonderful today, to stand there quietly and experience the pleasure of getting through to a horse who had turned away from everyone else.  That is what I do best, and I’m excellent at it.
Last night while talking to *J* online (the guy who’s tagging along with me to dance tomorrow night – – oh!  oh!  Tomorrow!  I can’t wait to move again, and this time, NO KIDS!  *twirling* Oh… back to what I was saying)….. 
…..we were talking about all that was going on in our lives, he just got back from Japan, a girl he met and was drawn too, talked about a mutual friend and how great she’s doing, what’s happening in my life, and then commented that I had quite a bit going on between the kids, horses, and a few other things – what would I like more of in my life at this point?  A partner.  An answer quickly given, and without doubt much desired.  Someone to curl up with and wake up next to, to pamper, love, give my support, and receive it too.  Maybe I’m dreaming, maybe that will never happen, but it’s the one thing in my life I’m missing and I hope to find one day.  I learned a lot in my marriage, one being what a horrible wife I was – something I easily admit to – and what I can do differently if I’m lucky enough to ever find someone I match well with, who’s willing to take on three kids (not easily found), as well as my life.  Someone where we both compliment eachother and bring out and shine the best in the other.
Nothing can take the place of this, but I enrich my life with friends.  I grasp dreams and head their direction.  I learn all I can in life, taking lessons from each experience, each person I meet, each event that occurs each day.  Life is an incredible learning experience, if we’re open to it.  Everything happens for a reason, everything.  It’s up to us to find the positive in each event, and to learn from it.  To learn in the effort to grow spiritually- it’s not always easy, but to feel life is out to get out, out to distroy you, everyone else is at fault for your position…. is only going to drown you in missery.  I have a past friend who sits in just this position, and she continues to loose friends along her way, never really finding happiness.  Life continues to place her in amazing positions, and she destroys them with her negativity and hatred.
True happiness sits in our own hands, hearts and mind, if we allow ourselves to feel it.  To grow from it.  We can reach amazing potential.

Wow – something I never wanted to feel tonight I felt.  Anger and bitterness.  As I sat in the passengers seat, I felt the emotions of ""How F***ing dare you"", when in reality what occured didn’t even matter.  I fell asleep.  Upon arriving, I sat and vented to the person that drove with me.  I don’t like feeling such anger in a response to someones emotions, they shouldn’t effect me like that.  I could feel it through my whole body 🙁  I took a breath and I could feel the release, but would tense back up again and fume inside.  How sad, that I’d respond like this.  I much prefer to love, feel peace towards, and accept others just as they are, regardless of what is aimed my direction.  I was challenged tonight, and I failed.  Ugh.  Next time.
It felt so wonderful to wrap my arms around a friend of mine tonight that I haven’t seen in quite a while.  I miss her terribly.  We had a wonderful talk, lots of laughter, and another long hug goodbye.  What better to do then meet up at some crazy hour at night for a midnight snack and laughter 🙂  The pleasures in life, lol.  The ride back home was long, drawn out by the hour, the trip though very well worth the time.  The kids enjoyed their time also.  Pancakes at midnight?  😛  Glad we’ll all be able to sleep in for a bit in the morning, although I still have to be up somewhat early for horse chores (picking up a heckload of supplies), working with a team horse (lunch date with a big gray man), and cleaning of the house – again.
Its September 1st already!  This is nuts – time flies so quickly.  I am going to try to have my act together to start school in the spring.  Just a few classes, online anyway.  I can do this, at some point I just have to take the jump and just do it.  There’s a few more things I want to have taken care of first….. yeeees, excuses 🙂
It is 3:45am and my youngest daughter is bouncing around.  Lovely! Hopefully she’ll fall asleep here shortly.  I know, I asked for it.  The other two are crashed.  Jonah is still feeling the cold in his chest, and fixed himself a cup of mint tea before going to bed.
Dreamland is almost here, greatly needed.  Tonight as I drove home I felt so much peace, gratitude, thankfulness, and love.  I am glad for this, and to have been able to not return back to how I felt tonight.  When I’m that way my kids can feel it, I’m snappy and cold.  I rarely get there anymore.  Tonight I feel a sad sorrow for the person who caused me to step into that emotional state tonight.  He has so much potential in this life, but he’ll never find it surrounded with the bitterness, coldness, and hate he allows himself to feel towards people and situations.  He really is a great man, I believe this and always will.  I wish him peace, I hope he finds it one day – although he’ll have to find it within himself first, no one can hand it to him.

17,https://www.opendiary.com/m/stardreams/another-day-1618-6214216/,2006-09-01,Another Day…..,"
I just got home from a day full of errands, and am glad to finally sit down and take a break before cleaning the house.  I’m exhausted.  I am doing my best to keep up on the diaries that I have, for the people that read them and also for myself.  I talked with the girls uncle a few weeks ago, who surprised me by saying he still read my diary, and that it was the only way he knew what was going on with the kids and myself.  Where I originally kept the diary for the girls dad to know what was going on with them in between his visits, their growth and development, he said that he didn’t really read it.  It was nice to hear that the diary was of benifit for someone, and it gave me the drive to keep going with it and not only just here at there entries, but rather regular ones.
Last nights dance was absolutely amazing.  It was the first time in two months that I’ve had a night to myself…. where I was able to go out without the kids in tow.  It meant a lot to me.  Jonathan met me there, the first time I’ve met him in person after talking to him online off and on for three years.  It was wonderful to see Scot again, the leader, as well as Skywalker.  I was impressed with myself, how freely I danced.  Skywalker welcomed me to dance at one point, and I shocked myself as I found myself on the floor in a ""prowl"" stance that was a part of my dance – I haven’t done that before, but was glad to see myself moving more 🙂
The circle around the cloth that’s layed on the floor, where we all share food at the end is something I look forward to also.  It’s a time to talk and share thoughts, feelings, events occuring in our life, challenges, spiritual lifts we’ve faced.  Although I haven’t talked much, I enjoy the time.  People are often touchy-feely, and the first time I attended it caught me by surprised.  Now it doesn’t.  During coolout/regrounding, I chose to sit on the floor with my eyes closed.  Someone (later I realized who) came and laid her head in my lap.  I placed my hand on her head.  In the circle, Scot layed in my lap.  I placed a hand on the side of his head, and one on his chest – playing with energy again, and expressing through touch how much I cherish our friendship, even though the only time I interact with him is at dance.  I am so thankful to be a part of such a wonderful dancing group, an exceptional leader, and for the friends I’ve developed and all I learn as I observe myself dancing and how it relates to life.  I really need to try harder to get the kids and myself dancing on Friday nights.  Although I use to go on Monday’s, and miss the group of people that attend that dance, Fridays there are less people and the atmosphere is much more appropriate for kids.  They loved it the last time we went 🙂  Next week *repeat to self* – it takes quite a bit of effort to get them all ready and into the car by 7pm, after working until 6pm, to get there by 8pm.  But, it’s well worth it. 
For those who don’t know what estatic dancing is, it’s free form.  As I sat and watched it the first time, it’s like a group of 4yo’s without a care in the world, dancing to their hearts content to music.  No worries about what others think, the perfection of any moves, nothing.  It’s wild, wonderful and refreshing 🙂
The kids had a wonderful sleep in morning.  Katherine woke up first, Alyssa next, and the normal – waking Jonah up my lifting him up in bed had to occur, lol.  That kid sleeps like a rock!  Right now, at 7:45pm, they all are getting ready for bed.  Bed time is at 8pmish, but lights out by 9pm.  They have gotten a bit out of their sleep schedules, and with school starting on Thursday for Alyssa, and Jonah still having to get up at a normal hour, this is starting tonight.
Alyssa was ADORABLE last night with her new friend, they both are leaving me smiling to myself 🙂  She heads over to play whenever she can, yesterday I went to check on her to find the two girls in tu-tu’s, with hair pulled up in a bun, fancy black shoes on, and twirling around – it’s was so precious!  This morning her friend came up to ask if Alyssa could come out to play and for a tea party…. immediately Alyssa left, both girls giggling and chattering away as they walked over to her apartment.  I’m so thankful Alyssa has such a special friend her age that she’s bonded with 🙂
Katherine vocabulary is growing so quickly, as well as her scentance structure and phrasing.  This morning as I was laying down on the couch, I asked if I could have a bite of her donut… ""sure!"", as she looked over towards her plate.  ""I’m sorry mommy – all gone, in my tummy"" … awwwww 😀  She also has become quite the smartalick 🙂  This morning her hair was ALL OVER the place – those curls sure create a wild looking head of hair when it’s not pulled back, lol.
Jonah – is quite on my list today.  A near 10yo one who is not staying on top of his obnotiousness very well.  This adjustment back from his dads to the rules and ways of being here at my house, can sometimes be difficult for him.  *Scowl*.
It’s hot!  Sure has brought my tollerance level down.  I am eagerly awaiting bedtime for the kids.  All should crash easily.  I have a few more things here online to do, and then will be ready to work on the house.
Oh – one more exciting thing for me today.  I finally signed up for wireless internet through verizon.  It’s a cute little card that goes into your laptop, allowing you to pick up wireless anywhere you would receive mobile service.  It was roughly the same price as the cable and internet together here at the house.  Now I can take my laptop ANYWHERE (dang near) and still work online 🙂  I realized the importance of this yesterday, and how much more I could get done if I went ahead and did so.  It’s NICE!  As I drove today, the passenger in my car browsed the internet.  Oh this will be nice for roadtrips 😛

*Yawn* – I just climbed my backside out of bed.  I think I slept well, so did the kids.  I do need to go get them up here shortly.  It’s been so easy to fall into a ""go to bed late, get up late"" mode.  Katherine has taken the delight into braving the struggle and go wake Jonah up, lol. Actually, she’s the best person to wake him up since he absolutely adores her.  me, I’d get the fake dead sleeping and Alyssa would get snarled at, lol.
Did I mention that I FINALLY after near 15 years of searching, FINALLY found my closest childhood friend?  I was so worried about her, what had happened to her, if she was even still alive.  I wondered about her brother too.  I found her on MySpace, a place I had continued to check each time I got on.  Finally, one day, there was an account that popped up with her name.  The age was right, even NM could be right since that’s where she moved to when she was a teenager.  I nervously emailed her and waited for a response.  All I had asked was if she used to live in Ashland Oregon.  She emailed back in disbelief, listing off things we use to do together, memories of my first horse she use to ride, and hoped it really was me.  I could have died here in my chair.  After all these years of searching, here she was emailing me (through myspace).  I asked if she had any online chat programs, and yesterday we sat and chatted online.  She sent me pictures of her and her 8yo daughter (!!!) as well as pictures of her mother (who of course I use to know) and her grandmother.  It was incredible to be doing that.  Her cell number is now locked into my phone.  She’ll be moving back up to Southern Oregon in about three years.  My backside surely will be driving down there each summer to drop Jonah off with his dad.  Ohhhh I can’t wait to visit with her again.  I wouldn’t be surprised if I found myself heading to NM eventually, lol.
Last night I had full intentions on going to a party I was invited to.  Scot had called and said he had a few people he wanted to introduce me to, one person in particular, and did I think I was going to be able to make it.  I had been given an invite by the host directly, and certainly was going to try.  The kids were more then welcome, and a lady I knew was going to be able to watch the kids if I wanted to dance or socialize without them.  As the hour drew nearer, and Alyssa started melting down, I realized it wasn’t going to happen.  I loaded the kids up into the van to take care of horse chores, and didn’t actually made the decision until after chores were finished, based on the kids moods and needs.  I drove home, stopped at the store along the way for dinner supplies.  It’s alright, we’ll go Friday.
***The parties I mention are not normal ‘parties’.  They are get togethers of like-minded people, adults, to socialize and enjoy eachothers company and music.  There are no drugs or alcohol***
Last night I cooked these delicious egg baritto’s for dinner.  I found mixing the beaten eggs with whipped cream cheese produce a delicious rich scrambled egg that is excellent.  I also add in sliced green onion.  MMMM!!!  I rolled this up in a tortilla, and served it with a few little california sushi rolls (my kids favorite), and a couple of cookies for dessert.  We all settled down and watched Charmed afterwards, and went to bed.  
This morning!  Katherine is up, Alyssa is rising, and I think Jonah fell back asleep.  Time to get everyone moving.  Lots to do today, well, here at the house anyway.  Horse chores, and back home again.  The baby comes tomorrow at 8am.

Tonight I am frustrated – not upset in any regards, more disappointed I suppose.  As school supplies were purchased for my daughter, I wished her father desired to be a part of this big event for her.  I considered calling him tonight and inviting him to do something – anything – so the kids could enjoy his company, but I resisted.  He will call when he’s ready.  The two months mark has been crossed now.  It’s sad.  Especially when Alyssa asks me about her dad and where he is.  Although the comments don’t come too often, I know they cross her mind.  ""He’s really busy honey, he loves you A LOT though"".
Tomorrow she has school orientation, where she’ll be meeting her teacher.  Wednesday she starts her first day of school of FIRST GRADE!!! **mushy heart**.  She looked absolutely precious today, with her long black sports pants and a beautiful pink/white shirt that tied in the back.  She was down playing with her friend and ran back up to change clothes (from her snow white costume into the above clothes).  Quickly dipped her hair into water, brushed and braided it.  She takes my heart away.
I have to accept it though.  Everyone lives life differently, priorities are different (I surely know mine are vastly different then others).  It doesn’t make them wrong, just different then your own.  All you can do is live life in the way that is right for you – taking into consideration those that are directly effected.  I still couldn’t imagine going so long without seeing my children – but maybe that’s just me.  My children are my everything.  And I know that who I am as a parent to them, is a part of their success in life as a person, partner, and parent.  I may not always be perfect, but every day I do my very best.
Tonight Jonah’s dad called.  He started talking about homeschooling and blew when I explained my main reason for doing so now.  Jonah asked me not to say anything, that he didn’t want to appear as a failure in his dads eyes.  I thought it would be ok – I was wrong 🙁  Jonah got on the phone (I prewarned him what I did) and faced his dad.  He held back his tears, and then after hanging up he wrapped his arms around my waist, buried his head into me and just cried.
His dad felt lied to, when nothing was just ever said.  It has to be so hard for a child to want to tell his dad something but be unable to because he knows what will result from it.  To censor himself.  I always hope my children feel as though they can come and tell me anything – anything at all.  So far I’m doing pretty well in that department.  His dad wanted to know why he was never told – that was why – that reaction.  He didn’t see that as a reason.  Jonah seems very cautious what information he offers to his dad.
Jonah and I sat and talked.  Again I reminded him how much is dad loves him and just wants what he feels is best.  Jonah said he just wants to make his dad happy.  This is what our main talk was over.  You can’t live life to make another person happy (maybe the better term would be to not live your life in fear of disappointing someone, or to gain or keep someones approval), otherwise you’ll end up having a very poor and unhappy life.  You can’t ever make everyone happy, and living for one person is a miserable way to be.  I reminded him of Juliane, and how I jumped through hoops for years to keep her happy, facing constant disapproval, and where was she now?  Not talking to me.  I reminded him of his dad, and how he bent over backwards to please his father, but never got anywhere.  All he wanted was his dads complete approval and praise, and rarely ever got it.  Every day he worked to please his dad – Jonah’s dad still feels like a failure, and his dad died feeling so.  
With reminding Jonah of these events, I reinstated how important it was for him to live for himself.  No one ever is going to always agree with him, and not everyone will.  I reminded that even with me, I wasn’t going to push him one way or another on anything, but would like a solid reason as to why he wanted to do something…. and not for the reason of someones approval.
Basically, be an independant thinker.  Believe in your thoughts and reasons.
He called his dad again, to say he loved him, and bursted out bawling 🙁  Telling his dad how much he loved him and how sorry his was for letting him down *I could have cried*.  I was proud of him though – although he tried to be careful what and how he said something to his dad, he also stood his ground.  What an amazing child.  
His dad began ranting how I took him (Jonah) away from him, and how he wants to be a father to him, and can’t so far away.  He wants to spend more time with him but can’t.  Jonah excitedly told him how with homeschooling now, so long as he can meet me half way (where we usually meet – near 250mi for both of us) he can come down almost anytime so long as his schoolwork is completed.  An open door to solve the situation, and his dad stalls and ‘reminds Jonah’ that he has a restaurant to run and wont always be able to have him *sigh*.  He definitely is a hard worker.
What’s unfortunate for both of these fathers, although very different, is that they ARE roll models in their childrens lives, whether they realize it or not.  Both in how they act and how they treat situations.  Jonah looks up to his dad, Alyssa looks up to hers – while wondering where he is.  I do what I can to provide strong male role models in their life, but nothing will replace their own fathers.  
When talking to one guy friend, he told me about his girlfriend and her insecurities of not being good enough or the man she’s with staying around.  I asked if this stemmed from childhood, and he said yes.  Her parents seperated when she was young and her father was never around.
I can understand where both fathers are coming from, but what about the kids?
But I keep these thoughts to myself, wish both men strength as they do what they feel is best for their children, and always remind the kids how much their father loves them – – – which is very true.

20,https://www.opendiary.com/m/stardreams/meet-the-teacher-day-2-6214219/,2006-09-05,Meet the teacher Day,"
It was a beautiful day here today, which I was reminded of as my daughter ran down to her friends house barefoot.  Ah, being barefoot, a delight I have refound again.  I use to run everywhere barefoot as a child, disliking any type of shoes.  Luckily, Alyssa absolutely loves shoes, any type – the sparklier the better.
I needed to get her friends moms full name and number for the school records as an emergancy contact, so asked Katherine if she wanted to walk with me also – but of course!  She took my finger and counted her way down the stairs.  Two, three, eight, nine, eight, nine…. well, atleast we have the two in their now 🙂  I smiled as she darted ahead on her little almost two year old legs, mound of curls bouncing as she hopped along.  She immediately found the delight of ""borrowing"" one of the friends baby dolls, which she has yet to give back.  She toted that thing everywhere today.  To the grocery store, to school,…. ""no sweety, the baby doesn’t go into the bathtub"".  I think it’s time to buy her another baby doll 🙂
1:50pm rolled around, marking the time to start scooping all the kids up and place them in their respectable places.  The double stroller was hauled out, both little ones being buckled in, and Alyssa running ahead.  Jonah asked to stay behind.  We headed on down.  Alyssa found her classroom, and as soon as her teacher opened the door, the very first things out of her mouth were, ""Wow!!  You’re SO pretty!!""  That’s my daughter 🙂  I have no doubt that she will be picking flowers for her new pretty teacher, on her way to class each day.  It was a moment that her kindergarden teacher loved.  Alyssa is such a happy and bouncing child.  
Alyssa excitingly emptied her school supplies into each of the baskets, found her desk and marvelled over it, and headed over to find her cubby.  She started bouncing when the correct one was discovered, and began exploring the classroom.  Only one of her kindergarden friends is in that class, although it’s not a child she associates much with.  Actually she isn’t that thoughtful of a child, and last year caused me heart to break for Alyssa the first time. 
Alyssa headed out with me to walk down to school and saw Diamond walking slowly.  ""DIAMOND!!!"" and started running towards her, and Diamond took off.  ""WAIT! WAIT!""  Alyssa started crying, asking why she ran away.  I explained how mean that was, and next time explain her feelings to Diamond.  When it went to happen again, Alyssa did just that.  I think it caught Diamond by surprise, because she stopped, appologised, and they walked to school together.  I beamed 🙂
Jonah fell asleep early tonight for a change, as I sat reading the ‘teacher materials’ I need to go over his homeschooling.  He said he loves listening to me read, and sat curled up with me, occasionally giving me a kiss.  As I type this right now, I have an over excited first grader who is too eager for tomorrow to arrive to fall asleep.  Ohhhh she’s going to be exhausted tomorrow!  I’m actually going to start family reading time each night to help prepare the kids for sleepy time.  
I tried to prepare them early tonight.  Before the baby was even picked up (a child I care for), I had the girls in the bathtub.  Once the baby was gone, I washed the girls hair, dried them off, dressed them in their night-night outfits, and prepared dinner.  Dinner was fed, teeth brushed, and they were in their rooms before 8pm.  Katherine fell asleep – – – – *peering behind me*, Alyssa just fell asleep.  
This morning, as most mornings she does this, Katherine caused me to turn all mushy inside.  She was nursing, and wrapped her arms around me and pulled me close to her in the sweetest nurse~hug (awwww!).  For multiple reasons, I am purposefully cutting nursing times back, but not leaving her in the position of feeling hurt.  I basically distract her elsewhere, sometimes she’s insistant that she really does want to nurse, ""Mama, murse – pleese?""  Other times she forgets about her request as she bounces off to do something else.  What a delight 🙂
Early morning tomorrow – for these turkeys that love to sleep in anyway 🙂

As I sit here and type, the house is erie quiet.  Katherine is playing contently under the table, the baby is mumbling to herself in her excersaucer, and I just got done setting Jonah up at the table with the first part of his schooling – Math.  I am having him work out of the Saxon Math 5/6 book.  Like all though, some rave and others don’t like the program.  That’s ok, we’ll give it a try.  So far I like it.
Normally you complete one lesson per day, but along with completing those lessons I’d like to see Jonah catch up to where he should be.  I have agreed that he would have 15min of computer time for every one lesson he completed, including the first lesson of the day so long as he completes atleast one more.  He immediately went to work.  This is what I love to see – his mind engrosed into learning.
Alyssa bounded out of bed this morning, with much surprise to me since she didn’t fall asleep until almost 11:30pm – her excitement for the first day of school was overwhelming her.  We cooked breakfast together, and I attempted to drag Jonah out of bed.  She certainly showed her ""style"" side, and she kept commenting on what she didn’t want to wear vs what she did.  She also didn’t want her hair pulled up today, and I was unable to convince her otherwise.  A pony tail?  Something?  Nope.
Wednesdays always confuse me on the start time of school.  Here, yet again, I has my mind set that it started at regular time, and was all set to be there early, to start the school year out unrushed.  With ten minutes to spare, it dawned on me that it was WEDNESDAY!  Crap!!  ""Alyssa, grab your shoes!"", the baby was buckled in her backpack, and down to school we went.  She arrived early, and gave her best friend a huge hug.  The chatted for a bit, and then the doors opened.  She gave me one last BIG hug and kiss, an ""I love you"", and she headed in, hung her backpack up in her cubby, and went to sit down at her desk.  What a big girl *grins*.

22,https://www.opendiary.com/m/stardreams/the-princess-7-6214221/,2006-09-07,The Princess,"
Alyssa sure has developed a mind of her own in the clothes she wants to wear to school, as well as how her hair should look.  Yesterday she wanted it left long, today she wanted it up on a pony tail but…. ""don’t comb out the waves mom!""  Her independance is growing so quickly, SHE is growing quickly!  Her appetite doubled.  She finished her dinner tonight and asked for another round.  I remember when she would barely eat at all, going in waves of near nothing it seemed, to eating a large amount.  Soon I’m sure she’ll be growing out of her clothes again.  Saturday we buy new tennis shoes for her.
Jonah – that kid has also doubled in size.  He just needs a whole new wardrobe.  Yet another one who will be getting new shoes.  His feet have grown into flippers overnight it appears! 
And Katherine, still my petite little one.  Her whole appearance chances when I pull her hair up out of her face.  In the morning it’s dangling curls everywhere – my wild haired child.  These last two days I’ve realized it’s long enough to completely pull it up into ap ony tail, leaving the cutest little bob of hair, gorgeous grin and sparkling blue eyes.  This afternoon I was talking to my mom, ""Want to say hi to grandma?""  …. ""Ok! – – – Hi Gam-ma!""
""Hi sweetheart, how are you doing?""
""Gu""
""Are you having a nice day?""
""Yes"" (at this point I needed to finish up the conversation)  
""I uv oo!  Bye""
""I love you too.  Bye sweetheart""
It was exciting to find out where her curls really came from.  They certainly could have come from her dad, who had curls as a youngster, but mom explained to me today that she had a head full of curls as a child, and that it still has a wave to it.  When it’s long it’s wavy.  Ohhh I hope Katherine keeps those curls, they are just so dang cute!
All the kids had a blast in the pool tonight, what a roudy bunch 😛  I went ahead and changed into shorts and a t-shirt, and completely startled the kids by diving in myself, lol.  Katherine came in with me too, we had quite the laughter of an evening.
Jonah’s doing great in school.  Very much one to get right down to business and get things done.  He’s very adiment with himself that there’s no reason to complete only one lesson in math – he’d rather do a minimum of four.  Wow, if he keeps up that pase he’ll be through the book in two month.  I would bet as things become tougher he’ll slow down a bit, but it’s neat to watch him set his own goals and work quietly to complete them.  Again, he read, and today we added in writing for manuscript work.  Monday we’ll add in history.  What I’m finding is the hours in the day are going by too fast.  I am quicking seeing myself detour from the original outlay of this homeschool program, and using it rather as a base, while I add in things I feel are important for him
Yesterday there was another in with the cranky lady here.  Today, Charis and I talked with the apartment manager as to what can be done.  She is talking with ‘cranky lady’ tomorrow and calling us.  Really, this lady should move.  She can’t tollerate ANY kid noises.  There’s four families with children living right here (between both buildings) and the kids stay inside because of her yelling at this, and yelling at the parents for their poor disciplining, that the kids should be locked in their room until their quiet, and that she’ll just call the cops.  Ugh.  The last resort solution will be to move to another building where the kids are able to freely play outside, but I’d rather not if at all possible.

23,https://www.opendiary.com/m/stardreams/frappachino-fairy-6214222/,2006-09-08,Frappachino Fairy,"
I had my very own Frappachino Fairy, as she’s been dubbed, show up today.  It was so wonderful to see her again.  She came bearing delicious offerings, a frappachino for myself and vanilla cream for the kids.  It’s always a thankful moment when life offers the opportunity for a quick hello, as happened today.  I miss all we use to do together.  She also came bearing a $25 gift card to Starbucks with the sweetest writings on it, although *rasberries* 9+ is …. well….. 
We have certainly been through our trials in our friendship.  I remember how defensive I would get, and would so quickly close up to her.  She’d openly listen to me snarl, and well as quietly took me spitting daggers in her direction when our friendship hit it’s last painful head.  She took it all, quietly, as painfully as it may have been, and waited for me.  That, there, is a true friend.  One who understands that individuals go through their up and down growth process, who willingly waits quietly until the caos is over, and the friendship is able to pick back up again – however long that may take.
I remember her telling me once, the type of person she saw that I was.  Who I was inside, and who I so fearcefully fought from allowing myself to be.  I can now see how hard it most likely was for her back then, how simple it was and how the answer layed right there in front of me, waiting for me to take hold.  Waiting – for me.  
I watch someone else I know, struggle in his own negativity and animosity.  A place where I use to be.  Where I blamed everyone else for my dark emotions and where I stood in life, as well as my inability to do certain things.  It was always someone elses fault.  It was easier that way.  Even though, now, I see the latter was so easy, it was so difficult.  It was terrifying.  It’s hard though to watch someone you care so much about, suffer so deeply, when the solution is so simple – a happier life is right there at your finger tips.  But, all you can do, is sit and wait.  You’ve shown it by example, now you wait for them to find it also, if that time should ever arrive.
Life is so short.  You never know if tomorrow will actually ever come.  We each were lucky to have a today.  Yesterday ""someone"" was lost, and today was spent filled with regrets.  I never want to stand in that position, to wish I had done something different.  Wish I had just  made that call, taken just a simple moment, spent a little bit of time with someone in particular.  Forgiven.  
Driving today, my BIL crossed my mind again.  I grabbed the phone and tossed it to Alyssa to call him.  She still talks so highly of him, and STILL talks about her earings that he held her hand for while she had them pierced.  Her uncle means a lot to her.  Instead, SIL answered the phone 🙂  They talked, and she then she talked to Katherine.  Last came Jonah, and then finally to myself.  I have missed so many years of time with them.  I didn’t realize how old my little niece is.  I talked with SIL about how fast the years are going by, and planning a yearly get together, or twice a year.  Something to where we drive down (13+ hours) for one day visit, and drive back.  It is SO worth it to me, as well as for the memories the kids will continue to build with them.  I miss both of them – all THREE of them! 
Quickly here I need to call MIL and get her address again.  I would love for the kids to be able to send pictures and letters to her, I don’t want her to feel like a forgotten grandmother.  I was lucky to be able to catch a visit/breakfast with her, a huge reason as to why I drove Jonah down to his dads a few months ago.  She’s not going to live forever, isn’t in the best of health, and don’t want to regret not taking the time.
Time.  Time is so simple.
I know all happens for a reason, I do believe this.  It doesn’t always take away the feeling of loss and pain though.  My grandmother meant a lot to me.  I regret not spending more time with her, not taking just a few simple hours of the day to go and spend time with her.  Two weeks before I was going to drive down to visit with her and have generation photos taken, something to hang on my wall (I could feel the end coming), I received the call.  I knew what it was before I picked up the phone.  My grandmother had died in her sleep.  I sobbed, the only one since when my best friend died eight years ago.  I still miss her horribly.
One of the special things, is that Alyssa holds her birthdate.  I love that, I always have.
Don’t live life as if tomorrow will come.  That there will always be time to mend a friendship, to visit with someone, or to embrase that particular person again.  You may never have that chance.  Embrase all you can today.
Back to the Frappachino Fairy.  Thank you.  For being there back five years ago when I first met you, back when I fell apart, being there now…… and being a part of what will be in the future 🙂

24,https://www.opendiary.com/m/stardreams/ahhh-peace-2-6214223/,2006-09-09,Ahhh – peace,"
1am, and I sit exhausted but enjoying the peace completely.  The fishtank filter is running, in a tank where there’s no fish, but creating a nice sound effect.  I really do need to take the kids to buy a few goldfish to put in there.  Katherine fell asleep first tonight, after a late night snack.  Both of the girls appetites are increasing.  Since Jonah has taken on the pleasure of drinking a cup of tea at night to fall asleep, so has Alyssa, although tonight she fell asleep before the cup of tea was cool enough for her to drink.  I am certainly not a tea drinker – I almost regret now getting rid of ALL the piles of tea I use to have.
Jonah has always had a difficult time falling asleep.  I found a key in reading to him at night, but was reminded that we can train our bodies off of a trigger.  Reading or book or being read to, is not a trigger I would like for him to have regarding sleeping, if it’s going to happen during the day also.  So, I’m hoping for the tea.
It’s been somewhat of a quiet day today.  The majority of the day was spent cleaning the house.  Working with Alyssa on cleaning her own room, Jonah cleaning his (he did a great job).  I had the rest of the house.  ""Charmed"" has been playing for a good protion of the day, mostly for background noise.  Mid afternoon we walked over to the grocery store to purchase groceries as well as snacks for Alyssa during the day at her school.  I have been on this huge roll for purchasing as much food as I can for as little of a price tag as possible.  I’ve been pretty thrilled with how well I’ve been doing.  Today was $57.36, and even got snacks for Alyssa to last for two weeks.  Although I still may have to purchase another gallon of milk, I think we’re set until this next Friday 😀
Budgetting is not always the easiest.  Food, electric, insurance, gas, and then comes the extras of clothing and shoes for kids who grow SO quickly, haircuts, activities (before/after school sports), and then SCHOOL PICTURES!!  Yes, the time has arrived yet again.  I have to budget that in too, since I refuse to let a moment like that pass by again like last year.  Not always the easiest thing though.
More to say, but I’m exhausted.  Tomorrow is somewhat of a busy day, with the purchase of a vacuum cleaner, a team meeting, horse chores, horse feed/supply run, and house cleaning ( the never ever ever ending chore ).

*Yawn*  It’s 10pm and I am so ready for bed.  Hmm, that’s unusual.  Jonah, who has had a very difficult time going to sleep these last few nights, fell asleep at 9:30 tonight.  The girls asked if he’d read them a story, and they both fell asleep to that.  I reminded him that he needed to head into bed himself, that he can’t keep doing this to himself.  ""Read a book, something, but nothing else can be ok except for the light"".  Poor kid.  Not too long had passed before I went to check on him and he was asleep.  I leaned over, brushed his hair back and kissed him, telling him how much I loved him.  ""I love you too mom"" he whispered back.  We have to find a way for nights to be easier for him.  I can completely relate to his inability to fall asleep though.
I am very proud of ""Cranky Lady"".  Sounds like the manager said something to her.  Yesterday the kids were playing and I saw her standing on her balcony looking down at them for about 10 sec and then went back inside without saying anything.  Today, Alyssa excitingly told me that she said what a great job they were doing trying to be quieter.  AWWWW!!!  Alyssa said she said Thank You 🙂  She now wants to make her a card, lol.  Knowing Alyssa, she’ll find a flower to give to her also.
Alyssa is absolutely loving school, eager each morning to get out the door.  She loves her friends there.  Jonah is doing excellent with his homeschooling, and I’m seeing a wonderful attitude change as he is receiving 1 on 1 time, even though I have the two little ones with me.  He said yesterday that he’s trying really hard to be respectful.  I thanked him, while also suggesting he really work hard on doing the same thing when his sister is next to him also 😛  
Those two.  Just tonight, I’m in the kitchen cooking dinner and Alyssa is in the livingroom whining that Jonah is hitting her.  I’m lecturing him, and Alyssa keeps whining.  Finally Jonah steams, I quietly snarl at him, only to find out that Alyssa kept pushing the pillow cushions onto him.  She wasn’t getting popped by Jonah, she was ganging up on him!  The little turkey 😛
Katherine was as CUTE as always today.  She has started this new thing where she would like an owie kissed.  I am so not into all of that, but she picked it up from somewhere.  Her thumb would hurt, or her cheek, her wrist, her arm…. and all would receive a sweet get better kisses.  She popped me accidently on the brow today, and after saying owww!  She asked if she could kiss it better.  My heart just melted, again 😛  It always does, lol.
Today I played ""good deed"" again.  Remember the lady who I hauled the goat for?  Ok, first, let me say – NO MORE GOATS IN MY VAN, atleast during breeding season.  Those males STINK!!! – anyway, she is without a car.  She asked if I would be able to drive her to pick up some hay and grain.  Three kids in the back, three hay bales in the middle, and three bags of grain in the very back, and we were heading back to her place.  I always enjoy our time chatting, and I realize how lonely she is and enjoys the time too.  I looked at the request and looked at my laundry today, and with a sigh chose her.  I’m sure it’s for a reason, our subjects are all over the place, and I’m sure she needs the visiting time.  What I’m not too sure about, is if she will be depending on me all the time.  How often?  It doesn’t sound like she’ll be getting a car anytime soon.  She’s a sweetheart though, loves the kids, and always pays for my gas.  So, what am I fussing over?  Maybe cause it always takes up a good half of the day 😛 LOL  I’m glad to help though 🙂
Sleepiness is creeping up on me, quickly.  One more load of laundry, and I’m off to dreamland.

….turns TWO!!!
That’s right, Katherine turned two years old today.  She absolutely loved the attention of the responses she received when she’d say it was her birthday, and as she attempted to get out that she was two 😛  She was able to talk to Grandma today (my mom) and had a great conversation with her.  Last night I watched her birth video and was just in awe.  What an incredible birth – what an incredible child!!  She now has a very strong mind of her own.  Tonight Jonah came up to her, took her head between his hands, and in a very brotherly way, moved it back and forth.  She yelled, ""STOP!!"", and decked him 😛  hahaha
Jennifer, a friend Katherine is quite bonded with, is on vacation right now.  When she gets back in another week and a half, I’m going to put together a birthday party for Katherine.  Although, as I think about it, it appears it’ll be more of an adult social time while kids play, lol.  Of course there will be cake, candles, ice cream….. and atleast one baby doll.
Katherine is absolutely HOOKED on babydolls.  Tonight, while at a friends house next door, she attempted to say goodbye to the babydoll she was holding…
""Goodbye Baby"", as she gave her first attempt to playing the baby in the chair, before bringing it back to her shoulder again.
""Goodbye Baby"", she said as she attempted to place the baby down again, before it was brought back up to her shoulder again like a magnet.
""Goodbye Baby"", she stated as she turned around with the baby held to her shoulder with one hand and lovingly craddling and patting her head with the other, as she made a beeline for the door we were attempting to exit.  ROFL
Alyssa is doing GREAT!!  Maturing by the day it seems.  She absolutely loves her new best friend, and her moms and my friendship is growing quite well too.  We now are having Saturday movie nights, which gives us a chance to socialize, kids to play, and to watch a movie.  Not like we don’t already see eachother throughout the week as it is, lol.
Jonah has been an incredible help out at the horses during chore time.  He’s a very thorough child and determined.  Today we had a carwash, and he was wonderful help in between holding the signs on the corner and scrubbing car, to spraying cars down.  He’s also doing great with his work 🙂
I had the wonderful opportunity of seeing JC today for a very quick hello, how are you visit.  She had me chuckling this evening over memories and events.  I sure have enjoyed our friendship.  Tonight I was explaining more to the next door friend, Charis, over the type of friend she was.  ""Know how events can occur and things can be said that can cause friendships to crumble?""  I explained my sinario a few years ago, how I was really not who I am today emotionally.  How JC never faultered in her friendship, never changed who she was, always stood and waited, while I went through what I needed to go through… waiting for me.  She never turned away, even after some of the hurtful things I said.  Charis was in awe, and said, ""That, there, is a true friend.  They are a rarity"".  Absolutely!!!
Here are a few pictures.

 

 
Ok, before I move onto more photos, I have to share this little creature with you.  Hmm, maybe I should have named him!  He was at the carwash today as Jonah was hosing the cement down when we were cleaning up.  He went to spray and suddenly stopped and said, ""Mom!!!""  Of course, I dived into save the little guy.  I can’t handle anything being killed if it can be prevented.  I took a picture of him, but it wasn’t long until his body was vibrating and he was moving hella fast up my arm…. he was placed down VERY quickly after that.  I can only handle THICK sharp little claws that are MOVING for so long, lol

 
The kids about had a heart attack today when Charis killed a spider that was in her house.  ""Don’t tell mom!!!""  hahahaha!!  I have a hard fast rule that no animal is to be killed in my house.  Seriously, it breaks my heart if I ever have to squash something, LOL
Ok, back to the pictures 😛


 
And now for pictures from today, the birthday girl!!!!!


 
Jonah snuck a photo of me today, the turkey…


My pride and joy on the drill team, Spirit.  A blind morgan filly.  One day she’ll be competing with us, so long as she heals completely from her injury.  She loves Jonah.

It has been very enjoyable homeschooling Jonah.  He walked with me today down to the school to drop Alyssa off with a check for pictures since today was picture day.  I could see a bit of ""missing"" in his face as he looked around and said hello to those he knew as he passed by.  I have always left the decision to homeschool vs public school up to him, and he’s always been strong in his reasons for homeschooling.  Today though, I reminded him that he could go back if he wanted to.
We walked down to the office so I could fill some papers out, and he asked if he could talk to the principal.  We all went into the office, and he asked the questions he had.  I expressed to her my concerns and desires for him.  The decision was left up to him.  As we headed out of the office to walk home, I asked him about his thoughts.  He explained them to me, and said he wanted to go ahead and come back (although he was both directions).  We went back into the office and I resigned him back up to start Monday.
He’s excited and nervous.  Curriculum night was tonight, so was able to meet who his new teacher is going to be.  She wasn’t who he hoped and requested, but as she ran over the curriculum with everyone she sounds PERFECT!  I love her already.  Jonah was immediately set back the moment he saw her – she is older, and he said she reminds him of his first grade teacher who he didn’t care for too much.  As she ran through the things they do in class, you could see the excitement in his face.
When he left the room, I talked with his teacher about my concerns and how he was left feeling last year, and how important it is to me that his slipping is caught early so he doesn’t end up in the hole again.  I also talked with her about how his dad is going to want to be in touch with her, and how he certainly loves Jonah and wants what’s best for him, but as I explained how his dad reacts when Jonah isn’t doing well, she said she will be careful.
I LOVE THIS TEACHER!
The decision has been made for him to start tomorrow.  He is presently in the shower getting ready for bed.  The one thing Jonah does not like, is that his computers, hand held games, TV’s, and game cubes are all going up except for the weekends.
 
 
Right behind our apartment complex is a Rite Aid.  I have been checking the place out more for rebates that they have for the month and playing with that.  Occasionally they have something that in the end will save me money.  Such as last month I bought an item that was $10 (normally $15) and came with a $10 rebate.  So far for this month I only have $15 coming in the mail when I request my rebate to be sent, but still, how nice!  
The thing that makes this SO easy is the online rebate ability.  Just to sit in front of my computer with that receipt in hand, enter the information, *enter*, and my rebate is there 🙂
Anyway, I was browsing through their online site a bit more tonight, and saw that I can upload the photos I would like to print, and walk over and pick them up.  HOW NICE IS THAT????  I have heart wal-mart does that too, but this is a store right next door to me.  I’m going to have fun with that!!  19 cents a piece 😀
 
 
I was over at a friends house a few days ago and saw them burning a candle in their fireplace.  It was so peaceful looking walking up to the door, as well as inside.  My fireplace has sat unused since I moved in…. what a wonderful idea to do with it!  I placed two of my candles into the fireplace, and for the last two nights have enjoyed the quiet flicker of the flames.  It’s so beautiful and relaxing.
 
 
I sent my mom a gobload of photos taken a few days ago, so she could see how much the kids had grown, as well as see Katherine’s mound of curls.  She was so excited, and said she has her hair 54 years ago, lol.  She explained how her mom use to comb her hair into ringlets and how to do that.  I’ll have to play with it sometimes 😛
This morning for picture day, Alyssa chose a black dress and I took off my horse necklace for her to wear.  She was so happy that I let her wear my necklace.  It hasn’t been taken off since I bought it almost a year ago.  I split her hair down the middle and pulled both sides back into part pig-tails (is that what their called?).  When we were finished she went to put some socks on, came back and crawled into my lap and just hugged me.  ""What a sweetheart"" I thought, and wrapped my arms around her and placed my cheek against her head and half rocked with her.  I told her how proud I am of her and how beautiful she is.  What a precious child!
She said pictures went well today, although when I asked how she smiled she showed me her ""no teeth"" smile.  She is into this immitation of ""Prue"" from Charmed.  Ohhh well.  I’m excited to see them though, just the same 🙂

There is a little girl I watched for a few hours six months ago, who is the same age as Katherine, my daughter.  Aubrey never really warmed up, but considered it towards the end when her parents picked her up.  Her dad stopped by my house night before last and asked if there was any way his daughter could come for a period of time the next morning.  Of course!  He showed up this morning and asked if she could stay for the day.  Tonight he asked what my weekly rates are, that she might need to start coming on a regular basis.  
What’s sad is the cost of childcare, and unfortunately it’s the rate.  I am low, at $7hr.  I have one little girl in my care full time already and am looking for another, but not putting a huge amount of effort into it yet.  I want the perfect one.  Parents who are relaxed, who trust me.  Children who fit into our family well.  I adore Aubrey, she’s a great little girl.  She’s quiet and withdrawn in a way, she’s incredibly sensitive.  At the same time though, she can just shine in her beauty and energy, which I saw as she and Alyssa danced across the house today.  I offered to her dad that if they’re interested in her coming weekly, to let me know what was affordable.  I know this completely opens the door up to a huge difference if figures, but it’s ok.  It may not be as much money in my pocket, but it’s a wonderful child who I know I’d make a difference to.  Someone she can curl up with for the day.
Today I sat feeding Amandine, who’s 9mo, and watched as two little girls, Aubrey and Katherine, go giggling past me holding hands.  Aubrey stops to take my hand for a moment of holding while she lays her head against me, and is off again.  Alyssa finally arrived home from school, and she joined in the play.  I took a look at myself and how busy I was, and looked at the scene I sat in – surrounded by children, and smiled to myself.  I LOVE being a mom, and love caring for kids.
… Then Amandine spit up and I had to change her clothes, and Aubrey needed a diaper change.  Katherine asked for some water, and Alyssa began throwing a fit so was asked to sit on the couch for a while where she ended up falling asleep.  Amandine began getting fussy and was placed on my back where she fell asleep, while I fed Aubry and Katherine another snack – – – and of course Katherine then needed another diaper change.
I have profusely been grateful these last two days that I bought the baby pack that I did (an Ergo Carrier), as well as the double jogger.  These last two mornings I’ve had a brood to get ready and out the door.  With both older kids dressed and ready, diapers of all three babies changed and coats on all, Amandine was placed on my back, double jogger carried to the bottom of the stairs where Katherine was placed in the front and Aubrey in back.  Off we go!  FIve kids… 9mo, 24mo, 24mo, 6yo, 9yo… and one mom, heading down in one little cluster to the school 😛
And the best thing I love, is Alyssa has not yet been even slightly late for school.  Always on time, always arriving just ahead of the first bells ring.  Jonah starts school on Monday (not earlier), and it will hold the same for him too – – it better 😛
Tonight, against Katherine’s desires, I stripped her down and we headed towards the bathroom.  She wasn’t too keen on the idea, but slightly cooperative.  Alyssa crawled in too, as I finished up with Katherine, and then washed Alyssa’s hair.  She climbed out, got dressed and headed into bed, while I tried to coax Katherine out of the tub.  I pulled the plug and waited.  Surely she’d want to get out after it emptied!!!  Instead she layed on her tummy slidding back and forth and squeeling with delight, LOL  OMG she was SO CUTE!!!!
Well, time to lay this little munchkin down to sleep.  Alyssa is already asleep as well as Jonah.  Yes, Jonah… finally starting to get a handle on that kids sleeping 🙂

""Another fun filled day!""  
I think this is a line people use to try to ignore all the challenges that presented itself.  Actually, my day was pretty delightful – minus the explosion of a diaper that left me wiping down a wiggling naked baby and dressing her in new clothes, LOL  I did have to settle quite the aruments between the two older kids today.  My goodness they can squabble!!
Alyssa came home from school today telling me all about the new science project they have going on.  She has her very own caterpillar, and explained the process of watching it and releasing them all together when it’s time.  How exciting for her!
Jonah starts his school on Monday, he’s excited.  Still not too thrilled that I’m taking away the TV’s and computer except for the weekends.  He is addicted, and with only a few hours left at night after he gets home from school, I need him to focus on his work.  Those will be left for the weekend.
The kids have enjoyed borrowing my camera to take pictures.  I have noticed though that it’s not working as well as it use to.  I do need to actually get them both their own camera so mine is left off limits.  Here are a few pictures they have taken.  Jonah is very excited that in his class he will be doing photography throughout the year 😀
Alyssa, ready to twirl

Sibling love, lol … tsk tsk

Wow, these last few days have been busy!
Friday afternoon I received an email from the girls dad, asking about taking Alyssa to the movies the next day, possibly around noon.  How fun for her!  I mentioned it to her and she was quite excited.  I have been quite exhausted lately come the evenings, so chose not to go to dance that night.  I haven’t been do dance in a while now, I sure miss it.
Saturday came around, and finally a beautiful day!!!  I taught a riding lesson in the morning, and since it was a bit after 11am I piled the kids back into the van and headed out to pick up a new vacuum and steam cleaner I had found on craigs list.  $80 for the two, and basically brand new.  I was THRILLED!!!  Only thing?  Had to be picked up before 1pm, so I was hustling my backside.  I steam cleaned part of my carpets last night and am going to do the rest tonight if possible.  It’s a bit of a challenge to time the cleaning with the kids along with when no more loud noise is suppose to happen (10pm).
Alyssa enjoyed her time with her dad she said, and arrived back full of excitement for movie night over at her friends house.  Movie night was fun – I am loving getting together to chatter girl talk while the kids play.  We switched it from Sunday night to Saturday night so it wasn’t a school night as well as no restrictions on time.  I wondered back to my place at 3am!!! LOL  The kids all fell asleep pretty quickly 😛
Sunday morning came quickly.  I got the kids fed, horses fed, and headed down to work with a horse on the team.  That went well.  I finished off by going into another pasture to see Zoe (my princess horse on the team), and ended up being double barrelled by another horse, twice!  I was knocked hard to the ground and left barely able to breath.  I was fine after a bit, but was sore – very sore.  I was kicked twice, leaving three marks…. on my arm (lovely bruise today), on my leg, and on the left side of my back.  Ouch!
Today is going great.  Jonah is off to his first day of school 🙂  After dropping both the kids off I headed home, pushing the double stroller with Katherine and Amandine in it.  I went to turn towards home, and Katherine started whining about how she didn’t want to go home yet, so I turned the opposite direction and walked a near two mile loop back to the house.  Amandine eventually fell asleep, early for her!  And Katherine enjoyed reaching her bare feet out to opposite sides and feeling the wet bushes tickle her feet.  When we reached a brick type wall, she reached out and let her hands glide across as we passed.  I slowed down so she could feel it 🙂  Katherine still whined when we got home, but I was quite tired.  I sat in front of her and went to kiss her hand, asking what it said when it touched the wall.  Kissed her foot and what it said when it touched the wet bush, and did this to both hands and feet – she loves this 🙂  She walked up the stairs, and I carried the touble stroller up.  Placed that in the livingroom for Amandine to continue sleeping and went to lay down with Katherine who fell asleep herself.  I woke up 90 min  later to the tiny movement of a baby just barely waking up…. gotta love mama instincts.  It was SO NICE to sleep!
I left Katherine sleeping, she woke up at 1pm.  Wow, THREE HOURS.  I’m glad she got a nice nap in 🙂
Katherine loved the walk home – so long as the weather stays decent, I’m going to attempt to walk back ever morning from the school that way.  It was quite enjoyable for all of us.  Katherine’s favorite part were the ducks she got to see next to a pond that had a water fountain 🙂

That’s me tonight, cranky but trying to hide it.  Basically I’m just dead exhausted.  The first trimester of a pregnancy usually slows me down quite a bit.  I’m not that far along really, almost six weeks, but enough to leave me crawling to my bed at night and catching my breath as queesiness rushes me.  It’s funny to be so full of energy, to be up til all hours of the night, and then with such a small change – be left begging for the bedtime hour before 8pm.  I’m thankful I have such GREAT kids, as well as a wonderful little one during the day that I care for.  The pregnancy?  I’m just babysitting 😛  I’m a surrogate for some very special and dear friends.  I have an almost 4yo surrogate daughter already, who … oh I could go on and on about her *prideful beaming*.  I most certainly have been blessed by these two families.
*prying eyes back open*
Jonah is LOVING his school.  Have I said that yet?  He talks about his teacher and what they do in class, and just beams with excitement.  He said to me yesterday, that this is the first time he has ever been so excited to go to school, that his teacher is absolutely amazing 🙂  I am so happy for him!
I find such great joy in taking care of kids during the day.  I love it!  I am still choosing to keep the 9mo as the ""baby"" for quite a while longer, until her desire to be in my arms consistantly disipates further.  I want to be sure my arms are there for her when she needs them.  I very much enjoy it when Luke comes over though, a friends 4mo son.  He is such a sweet little guy, with quite the head full of hair 😀  For the next eight weeks he is coming over Tues and Thurs night for six hours.  I am so thrilled to have him here!! 😀  The kids have a blast too, they really adore that little guy.
Tonight – – – often times, I am so thankful for friends that step in and pep back up a night.  I was eagerly looking forward to getting the kids back upstairs, fed, bathed, homework and into bed early so I could finish steam cleaning the carpets as well as get myself to bed early.  Friend next door arrived home, we sat in the grass, and eventually we were laughing.  Alyssa, my daughter, started it.  She walked over to us with a bug holding container, laid back on her back with the container on her tummy and the tiny lid open, saying she’s going to catch a bug 😛  It was way too cute, the way a child thinks 🙂  We eventually fell over to jumproping, after Jonah brought mine down…. the old school type with plastic inch long pieces.  The kids learned how to jumprope as well as songs to say while swinging the rope, and I was left in awe at how good Jonah was!  I’m on the hunt for two long ones so we can play double dutch.  We were invited to stay for dinner.  
Tonight was a night that I could really use fun company, and it was there.  I’m so thankful for wonderful friends.

Well, not as long as some take to update, but long enough.
I am seven weeks pregnant today.  I’m feeling great, except for the mornings when I can’t seem to figure out what to eat that will stay down.  Thankfully nothing has come back up – yet – although this morning it almost did.  My first midwife appointment is next Saturday, so close!  The mom and her daughter will be making the drive down here.  We’re all hoping that we’ll be a rare lucky one and be able to hear the heartbeat by doppler.  I didn’t hear Katherine’s until 13 weeks, but Mimi (my 1st surro daughter) we heard at 8 1/2 weeks, so I’m crossing my fingers 😀
Tonight I have 4mo little Luke for the night!  The WHOLE night, his first sleepover :D, while his parents have a night to themselves.  I have looked forward to this since the day he was born.  I adore this little guy 🙂
Today was a busy one for me!  I had two new girls who I am caring for today and Monday.  One is 2yo and speaks no english and had never stayed with anyone outside of mom and dad, and the other is her sister who is 6yo and in 1st grade.  I also had the normal 9mo baby I care for, and my own three children.  Today was the first time my car was stuffed to the brim – well, six kids took up all six seats, only one wasn’t in a child restraint of some sort (10yo).  Towards the end of the day today, the 9mo who came with a stuffy nose ended up getting a little fever.  Poor thing, its either the teething or she’s got a little bug.  I hope she feels better.
Errands were certainly interesting to run today, and then came the trip to McDonalds after all the kids got out of school.  To top it off, all three young ones had to have their diapers changed as soon as we arrived.  Wow – thank GOD for my son, who did an amazing job as we all piled into the womans bathroom.  Changed the 9mo and handed her to him.  Changed my own 2yo daughter, and then took care of the other 2yo on the potty and a new diaper put on.  Hand washing for everyone, and off to order meals and play on the play yard.  I chuckled to myself as we seat eating cones at the end of our meals.  Six children around the table…. 9mo in my lap, 2yo daughter, 2yo visitor, 6yo visitor, 7yo* daughter, and 10yo* son, and myself, quietly eating ice cream cones.  No arguing, no fighting, nothing but sweetness.  😀
Then came loading them all back up into the van.  With baby in arms and holding 2yo daughters hand while she held the other 2yo’s hand, we crossed the parking lot to the van.  Jonah, 10yo* came with Alyssa and the 6yo.  Everyone loaded, and off to head back home!!  LOL  Certainly quite the adventure 🙂
Monday I’m going to come up with a few different little crafts that we can do that should be a lot of fun.  If the weather cooperates, I think we’ll take a trip to the salmon hatchery in town also.  Nothing like seeing all the big salmon swimming up the river 🙂
I just got a call today from a friend who asked if I’d be able to watch her two daughters (2yo & 4yo) Tues, Wed, and Thurs.  No charge for them even though she offered, maybe I’ll sneak in a Reiki trade 😛
I absolutely LOVE taking care of kids during the day.  I love keeping Amandine the baby, and have had to resist the urge to bring in another full time little one – it wouldn’t be fair to her.  Normally, right now, it is JUST her and my own 2yo.  I do need to find another full time child.  Eventually.  The right one will come.  In the meantime, I enjoy these full days 🙂
—————-
Lets see, wow, if I haven’t updated for a while then I missed talking about the outings Katherine (2yo) and I had this week.  Amandine (9mo) was on vacation Mon-Thurs giving Katherine and I A LOT of time together alone.  Monday we went to the Salmon hatchery.  Katherine LOVED it!  We walked from tank to tank, and just stared at the river and all the salmon.  It was difficult talking her into leaving, but I have found ways to do it to where she just says, ""Ok"" and it’s not a struggle in the slightest.  
Tuesday we went to the pet store to look around.  She LOVED visiting the birds, the reptiles (although she says turtles scare her, lol), the fish, the rodents… she LOVES the bunnies! LOL
Wednesday she and I, just us, went to Starbucks and enjoyed time together.  These moments are so special to me.  Thursday was a lazy day, an attempt to get the house put back together.  
————
Although I love all of my children to pieces, and each care such a unique quality about them and a presense I can’t imagine my life without, Katherine is one I spend all of my days with right now – and each day she finds a way to melt my heart, repeatedly.  She has these bouncy curls that fall on both sides of her face to her jawline, and bright blue eyes that just sparke, with a grin that leaves you smiling yourself.  She also can stick up for herself to her siblings, while holding a heart that is as tender and as loving as can be.
She is 2yo – 2yo’s are suppose to be self centered and all about ""Me! and Mine!""  I always, and can’t help myself, tell her how amazing she is, how beautiful, smart, and gorgeous she is.  I’m sure she’ll have one heck of a complex as she gets older 😛
Anyway, on Monday as we left the hatchery, I said ""Katherine!""  ""What?""  ""You are the most beautiful girl in the whole world!"" *silence*  ""No"", she says.  ""Sister and me!""   🙂
She also leaves me giggling now – I often look at her in my rear view mirror and say, ""Katherine, I love you!"".  Now as soon as she sees me look at her she smiles and says, ""LOVE YOU!"" 😛 LOL
I LOVE BEING A MOM!!!  😀
My son keeps commenting to me about how much he really would like  a brother one day.  He’s always wanted this.  OMG.  I can’t even begin to phathom such a thing.  Three children is a WONDERFUL number, yes?  Yes.  Absolutely.  Definitely!  My priority for the next 16 years until my youngest is out of the house, is raising my children, so I highly doubt I’ll have a partner who’s help I’ll have in raising the kids, and I am NOT raising another one as a single mom.  THREE!  Not to mention the kids through the day.  I also have college to look forward to, and the ability to FINALLY go back to training horses full time!  Nooo nonono ….. 
It would have to be the perfect man to fall into my lap, to delightfully takes on my crazy passions of horses and kids, with a smile to boot
!  I just have to shake my head and chuckle, although they say things happen when you least expect it.  I am certainly not expecting it.  I have no time anyway 😛
It certainly doesn’t mean that I don’t crave that closeness, that partnership, that passion.
In 16 years I’ll be 45yo.  Although, I’ll be going to college then too!  Finally reaching my dream of nursing.  Oh how I crave to work in the ER.  I really do wonder where my life will take me 🙂  I’m excited to see!  And excited to see how my kids will turn out.  It’s not easy being a parent, and it’s certainly not easy being a single parent!  Tonight Jennifer, who’s son I’m watching, offered the idea of taking the kids for the night sometime soon.  OMG – how nice that would be!  A WHOLE night to myself!  What would I do with it??

33,https://www.opendiary.com/m/stardreams/a-new-addition-16-6214232/,2006-10-09,A new addition!,"
For a while now, Jonah has been asking for a puppy.  We use to have a dog named Lucus, who had to eventually be euthinized which still brings my son to tears when he talks about him and how much he misses him.  I would love a kitten, bottle feeding an orphaned one again.  I miss having a cat.  I’ve contemplated a few different types of animals, being adiment that we will only be welcoming ONE animal into our family and wanted it to be the right one.
For many reasons I have leaned against getting a puppy right now, even though my son is well ready to care for him himself.  He very much wants a retriever, not a smaller quieter dog, I’d rather wait until we own a home (which should be in about three years) before we start looking for the right puppy, not while living in an apartment where there’s not place for a dog to run freely off of the leash.  
As much as I would love to have a cat, providing childcare has led me against it.  The number of adults as well as children who are alergic to cats is quite a number.  So, for now, it’s not the right time.
What about a bird???  I use to have cockatiels as a teenager and definitely miss those.  This was a possibility, and I started hunting, figuring the right one will show itself.  It finally did!  Not as a cockatiel though, but rather a Goffin Cockatoo.  His name is Ben, and he’s on a trial run with us for a week or two.  He came home with us last night and has been quite the joy.  My largest concern is quietness, especially during the hours that one isn’t suppose to make a lot of noise.  Today he has been WONDERFUL.  Tonight he has been quite the love 🙂  He is only 4 years old.  It is suspected they live for 40-50 years, so he will have quite a long life with us 🙂
One animal – that is all I want in our house – and we have found him…. I think….. pretty sure!    I’ll have pictures of him shortly 🙂

34,https://www.opendiary.com/m/stardreams/bird-update-3-6214234/,2006-10-12,Bird Update,"
This guy is absolutely incredible.  I couldn’t let the week finish for the trial, I had to let the people I got him from (a bird rescue) know that he was staying.  He is SOOO sweet, quiet, passive, just watches over everyone, and is quite the character come night time.  He is very patient with the kids, while he doesn’t hold back expressing his opinion! LOL
The first night he slept in the livingroom, but I quickly learned that wasn’t going to work since he started squaking when noise was being made.  The following night he slept in Jonah’s room, and he did fabulous!  He screached at Jonah when he got out of bed at midnight (my own little tattle tail, lol) until he got back in bed, and then I later heard him ""mumbling"" under his cover, haha.
Quiet hour starts at 10pm here (apt complex), and because of this I very quickly learned that Ben (the bird) HAD to be in bed, tucked away in his cage, with lights out and door shut by 9:30pm.  As any kid seems to do, he squaks off and on for 20min or so, and then is quiet – beating the 10pm time.  Jonah, I have found, since his mind is on the bird, quickly falls asleep.  This in itself is a HUGE thing 🙂
Ben talks, plays games, and teases you.  Every day he’s with us his personality grows even more.  Tonight I was playing peek-a-boo with him by moving my head back and forth from his vision and it got him all riled up, he’d hop back and forth on my knees and screach, muttering loudly and then ha-ha-ha-ha! LOL  
Yesterday I introduced him to the mother of the little girl I watch.  She walks over to the cage, that he sits on all day (no caged and locked in bird here) – says, ""hello"" and in return Ben raises his hand and says, ""Hello!""  It was soooo cute!!
I am so madly in love.  He is far better then a dog, much more suitable then a cat, isn’t destructive in the slightest and tollerates the kids so well!  He is becoming much easier in going into his cage at night or if we leave the house, since he is learning that upon our return he’ll immediately be let out – – as soon as I go in to wake Jonah up in the morning, his cage is opened.  Today he spent three hours quietly by himself before calling for me to bring him out into the livingroom to be with us.
Ben’s problem with a cage is understandable.  He has spent a majority of his life locked in a cage.  He was moved to a kids bedroom where parents didn’t pay much attention to how he was being treated and it wasn’t too kindly.  He sure has come back from that well, although I am very careful to watch his requests and make sure the kids listen to him.  I hope in time I can get him a large corner cage.  In the meantime he’s content just sitting on top of his normal size big cage playing with toys during the day.
I am soooo soooo very lucky to have Ben 🙂  Spoiled thing he’ll be being the only pet!  My son who wanted the puppy is very happy we have Ben instead right now.  He knows that when we own a home we absolutely will look at getting a puppy, but not right now.
I still need to post a picture!

Today has most definitely taken it’s tole on me.  I am so exhausted – beyond exhausted.  My eyes are twirling.  Last night I was up extremely late getting business items as done as possible, up this morning and on the go.  Getting kids up, fed, off to school, being ready for Amandine to be dropped off, meeting the horse shoer at 10am and timing the two young ones naps so they would sleep through the trimmings (I succeeded), home, cleaning, more work in between playing with the kids and feeding snacks, my own kids home, more cleaning, horse chores, dinner…. and settling arguements between the kids.
This afternoon I had reached my ending point it seemed.  I delt with someone I just cannot figure out (long drawn out head banging story), and then when the two youngest started crying I lost it too.  Nice good cry, while kissing them and fixing what the problem was.  I had hoped I could have them both down for a nap so I could take a nap too, but no such luck.  As soon as the 9mo fell asleep my two oldest arrived home from school.
Following dinner tonight, Jonah had gone from not feeling to hot today, to being quite sick.  Many of the symptoms he showed had me concered, but after a few calls I am still waiting here at home.  He’s got a nice fever.  Poor guy.  Looks like he’ll most likely be home from school tomorrow, against his wishes it seems.  He’s mumbling, begging to go to school.  Nice change from last year where I was literally hauling him out the door to GO to school.  He adores his teacher.
All three kids are asleep now, and I’m hanging by my son making sure his breathing and everything else are find.  He’s doing well, I may drift off here shortly.

Like that’s any surprise! LOL  My reason this time?  Tomorrow is my daughters birthday, and I want to have the cupcakes ready for her when she goes to school.  I ran into a problem though, after the first batch I realized I didn’t have enough oil for the second.  I’ll have to borrow some from next door in the morning to finish.  She is SO excited, I hope she’ll be going to school in the morning.  Her school turned around and sent her back this morning, with a 99.8 temperature.  So far she’s staying away from what Jonah had, but it’s teasing her.
Wow, seven years old.  I was completely dying at this point in time, waiting for her to make her appearance.  With her dad next to my side, her near 3yo brother at the foot of the bed ready, her 9yo uncle watching on, grandmother, friend, and a few other people.  I remember so much of her delivery, what a special time.
Alyssa’s dad is taking her out tomorrow night – and then having a little party or something for her on Saturday.  I haven’t mentioned either times to her, just in case things change, but if it happens she should have a lot of fun 🙂
Almost 9 weeks pregnant.  The mom teased me about not having taken photos in almost three weeks, and if I’d have time to send her one.  I gawked when I saw the photos.  I’m growing just a bit on the fast side!  I measured 11 1/2cm at my appointment this last Saturday, at 8w1d.  I’m opting for an ultrasound – the parents agree 😛 LOL  I am barely able to squeeze that last bit if life at this time, out of my jeans.  Since they’re a bit stretchy, they’re working.  I’m going to have to break here shortly and just buy a couple pairs of maternity pants.
 
Brrrrr…. I just ran outside to make sure my doors were locked.  We had a car breakin here last night, a car that was right next to my van.  It’s so disappointing that we can’t just trust, leaving our car and house doors unlocked.  Or even locked, and not be concerned about the window being busted out, all to go after something in particular.  Sad that some can’t respect other peoples property.
I am almost always leaving my front door locked when I’m home now.  I do need to remember to lock it when I leave.
The bird is doing great!  We did have an issue today with him.  It certainly caused my children to think about their behavior to eachother and how it in turn effects the bird and his own behavior.  This is a good thing.  He just had his cage cleaned tonight and is heading off to bed.  Jonah just came out laughing about how he just played in his water 🙂
Often I am certain that when something disappears, such as car keys, it’s for a reason.  Is it a gardian angel protecting you?  Or?
When Jonah was a baby, I had an appointment to be at.  I went to grab the keys out of the diaper bag and they were gone.  My mom was with me, and we searched the house, emptying out that diaper bag four different times, carefully placing each item back in – I always put them in their, they HAD to be in there!  But nothing.  After an hour or so, where should they turn up but in the diaper bag.  I moved a piece of paper from the top, and there they laid.
Today I loaded all the kids up to get over to Rite Aid to pick up a camera battery for my sons camera and a few other items, before dropping Alyssa off at school.  With the three kids in front of me, I held Katherine’s rain jacket with the camera, film, battery that needed to be returned, and my keys in one hand, and the baby carrier in the other.  I arrived at the van, placed the coat with the items down on the floor board, and went to buckle the baby in.  Got the kids loaded and bucked, and went to grab my keys.  They were gone.
I searched the whole van.  Nothing.  It got to the point I just needed to take everyone back inside.  With the baby in my arms I headed back down.  I cleaned it out, carrying clothing items that needed to be washed up to the house, and garbage to the dumpster.  I felt in between the seats, looked under the seats, to the side of the seats, cup holders…. nothing.  I was hanging in the van reaching for something under the seat and heard a *clink*.  I looked back, and the *clink* was the keys falling to the ground.  Sheesh.  When these things happen, which is rarely but they occasionally do happen, I wonder if maybe I was being protected from driving because of an accident that would happen at that time.  Things disappear and then reappear.

Well, her birthday was yesterday.  She woke up, staggered to where I was and said, ""Mom?  Is it my birthday?""  As soon as I answered yes, she was dancing, haha.  She received a beautiful new dress for her birthday, which she wore to school – what a cutie!!  We had a couple little parties for her – we have a big one for all three kids, coming up November 12th.  
She received the dress, the highlight for her, as well as some cute little gifts from her brother.  Her friend gave her a barbie, she received a bundle load of hand made cards from her class, and before she went to bed last night I gave her my gift.   http://www.paintedponiescollectibles.com/figurines/crystal-figurine.htm  She was awe struck and very delighted.  She has been begging for one from the local store here, and swoons over the one I have sitting on my mantle.  She definitely was the envy of those in the house at that point.  This morning she was touching Crystal and talking sweet things.  She’s too cute.
Here are some pictures I took of her early in the morning before she headed off to school.  Sorry for the size, they’re huge!!  But, for her dad, uncle, aunt, and a few others who read, they can be saved to their computer by right clicking.
 

 
Oh what else here….
As I am busting my backside to pull myself out of debt and become completely debt free, I found this wonderful link full of many ideas and suggestions, as well as an online program (that I’ll be paying for), where you list all your debt, payment amounts, interest, etc and it calculates it for you into payments.  It lists what you will have paid in interest in the end for everything, if you stick to the minimum schedule.  It’s actually quite the eye opener.  I don’t feel I have THAT much in debt, roughly $18,000, and although my income is quite small I am able to pinch and take care of things that are needed.  My  hard part is going to be NOT going to the movies (well, maybe after this weekends movie ""Flicka"", lol), and not going out to eat (I hear IHOP calling!), leaving Starbucks and Jamba Juice alone, no McDonalds, etc.  Yep, those are the hardest ones, but it is so worth it.  I figure two years…. I want to have no debt in two years.  After that, and I work on raising my credit score, I want to finally look at purchasing a house,  I figure that will be 3-4 years from now, if not five.

I enjoy having a plan for my life.  First a foremost my priority is raising my children to be happy, healthy, secure, and successful in this life – whichever direction they choose to go.  I have seen too many people who are adults, who are left to deal with the after effects of their parents being gone when they were children, who were left feeling ""alone"" or ""shuffled around"".  Who haven’t found the strength yet to make their life NOW rather then remaining lost and living in the past. There’s more thoughts to this, maybe I’ll talk about it later.
I am exhausted.  Yesterday completely whiped me out.  The kids were cranky, had multiple melt downs, the house did not stay clean as it was suppose to, I was done before the day ended, but I couldn’t stop.  I craved the idea of soaking in a hot bath, but by the time the last child was picked up and his mom went home (11pm), I was way too beat.  I could barely hold my eyes open, my body was quitting on me before I was ready.
I am heading over to the store shortly for a few cleaning supplies that I’ve ran out of.  It seems I clean and clean and don’t get anywhere, or atleast not for very long, because the kids are right behind me messing it back up.  I suppose as parents we never stop trying to figure out how to make it all work, how to make everything as simple and as organized as possible. I continue to search.</p

Certainly how I feel tonight.  Near 2am and I am still up.  I know why, I actually slept in until 8am – tsk tsk.  I should know better 😛  *HUGE Yawn*
Kids all doing well.  
I saw my surrogate daughter this afternoon, along with her dads and brother.  As always, all the kids immediately clicked and us adults just changed spots so they all could sit across from eachother to talk.  I absolutely love how all the kids are so attached and love eachother so much.  Alyssa was asking this morning before we left, if Mimi was her sister or cousin…. ""she’s your sister, but like a cousin since she doesn’t live with us"", with a bit more details as she asked.  She seemed even prouder meeting up with her today with more of an understanding that yes, she really is her sister 🙂  Mimi and Alyssa have always been VERY close and attached at the hip when we all get together.  It was SOOOO wonderful to see her dads again too – I sure miss them.  We all seem to be so busy that we rarely meet up.
Mimi and her brother came riding for the first time today.  A little girl who I drempt about introducing to horses one day but not sure if it would ever happen.  A very precious moment for all of us 🙂  Great GREAT family!
I have a very difficult issue I’m trying to deal with, heartbreaking, challenging, disappointment and hurt.  I’m not sure what will ever come of it – I don’t hold my hopes for anything 🙁  One day I may type about it.
Halloween is almost here!!!
The bird is doing well.
The kids have LOVED their time with their dad.  Katherine continues to talk about it each day with excitement and delight – a much loved change 🙂
Ok – gotta straighten up the house and head to bed.

Hmm, imagine that.  It would probably be a good thing if I actually turned OFF the lights and laid down.  Think sleep would hit me then?  Probably 😛
As I lay here with my back on the couch cushions, I noticed how much my stomach is sticking out.  Thank GOD it’s only one, this was confirmed over a week ago.  I was terrified, literally.  All is good though, and the little critter is an active one!  11 weeks now and I keep thinking I feel tapping here and there, but nothing I’ve ran to the phone to call the parents about.  What a day that will be 🙂
Netflix has been a blast – two movies arrive, we watch them as a family, and have them back into the mail the next morning.  It has been quite enjoyable.  There are so many movies I’ve wanted to see but have been unable to!
I go up to see Diva and Beau this Saturday, two horses I had to let go of when the girls dad and I seperated.  That was one of the hardest things to do.  I couldn’t have asked for a better sinario though – they stayed where I was boarding them, with two people who absolutely cherished the ground they walked on 🙂  Beau, at 34, is still doing very well.  Diva just arrived back from training in Eastern Washington and is riding very well under saddle.  The guy/husband who owns her just pampers her to pieces, it’s the cutest thing.  I cannot wait to visit with both the husband and wife, and wrap my arms around these two horses.  I have missed them terribly.  I am always welcomed to come up and visit whenever I’d like, but with my heart still breaking as much as it has been, it’s hard to go up.  The best is knowing how much their loved and cared for though, and have the BEST of everything as well as anything they could possibly need 🙂  I also gain quite the peace in knowing that should they be unable to be kept in the future, they come back to me….. but as it seems, I really wonder if that day will ever come, and I don’t mind 🙂  It makes me smile how happy everyone is 🙂
The drill team…. as some point I will end up letting loose on this one, but waiting for my emotions to settle first as well as a few other issues.
Finances…. pinch every penny possible (except for treating the kids to pizza tonight) and have been able to take care of quite a few little debts, both personal, sitting at a collection agency, and a few others.  This has been SO NICE!!!  Two years, and counting down, and I want to be debt fee.  
The kids had a lot of fun for halloween.  Their dad took them to this spook walk thing that he feels has become a tradition for him and the kids, they all LOVED it!  Halloween was the next day, and we all went with our next door neighbor and her daughter.  So much laughing and silliness, it was cute 🙂  I have a picture, and hopefully will get it posted tomorrow.
Ok, zombie state hit.  Time for bed.

I met with JC for lunch today – what a wonderful treat!!  Enjoyed the most delicious steak strips that met my craving quite well, mmmmmm!!  We had a great conversation about whatnot stuff.  Goodness I miss her and all the time we use to spend together, life sure can change.  Our kids are growing up so fast too!  She was next to my side when Katherine was born (amazing doula!) and I’m quite excited to have her with me when this surrogate baby is born too.  Although I swore adimently that I wouldn’t be doing another surrogacy, especially TS for any other couple, she commented occasionally that she thought I would and possibly for this couple (mentioned a good two+ years ago)…. I have to laugh at how some things transpire, and how sometimes our closest friends can see what’s going to happen far clearer then we can.
Chipping away continues at my bills.  I am enjoying this!  It allows for very little extra spending, but each time a payment is made it leaves me smiling, and it’s actually getting addicting!  Good – paying off bills can be addicting – I don’t mind that addiction at all, along with the firmness that no further debt will be aquired! 😛
Two years and counting down for no debt, I can make it *set jaw* – – – then to look over my credit reports and work on building my credit score.  It’ll be a dream come true when I actually end up purchasing my own house one day, 3 to 5 years from now.  I really would like the morgage to be my ONLY debt, and for it to be paid off within 10 years.
Can you imagine….. to have no debt, completely own your own home free and clear, to own your own car, your own everything, and owe no one anything?
On top of that, I want to start chipping away at college classes when Katherine enters 1st grade in four years, through grants NOT loans – or to pay for it myself.  When Katherine, my last child is out on her own in 16 years (or atleast doesn’t need me home as much), I am looking foward with excitement at diving into nursing school.  Another dream come true 😀  Well, except the beyond that…. to work in the ER, in surgery.
I can see everything I want in such clear sight.  It’ll take quite a bit of time to reach it, but I absolutely will 😀  Only one part of my dream is missing…. I can see it, but not sure if it’ll happen, and to think of manifesting wouldn’t be right, so I only wish for happiness for this person instead.  If this person is truely happy, my dream on that end will be (mostly :P) complete too.
*delightful sigh* 🙂
Tonight the mother of *this* baby and I were talking, giggling like kids as we always do, and dreaming.  We both are still jaw dropped that he’s actually coming!  What a dream come true (for them, as well as for me too)!  I don’t think I’ll ever get over being so stunned at how incredibly perfect and thankful I am for all of this 🙂  For those of you who have the baby’s diary, I pour all of my thoughts and love into that diary so I wont repeat here.  I radiate thankfulness for being able to grant such a dream to a very very special friend.  The happiness I feel for this pregnancy, for my family, for their family, brings me to tears while smiling.  🙂
Enough gushing…..
SAFEWAY!!!!
One of the things I hate the most is having to drag 4-5 kids in with me when I attempt to go shopping.  It does NOT make the trip fun at all.  Load all the kids up, head to the store, unload, start shopping, deal with the ""I have to go to the bathroom"" and ""Can I get this??  PLEASE??"", make it to the checkout stand, load all kids AND groceries back up, head back home, unload kids and hand the oldest ones bags to carry up and try to get the rest of the little ones plus the groceries back upstairs.
I – DO NOT – LIKE SHOPPING WITH THE KIDS!  
I could handle one, even two, but three?  Four?  FIVE??
In the end our cubboards are not always stacked to the brim.  Jonah, being almost 10 and VERY independant loves to head in with the shopping list and prides himself in being able to find the best prices for the items needed (good boy!) while I enjoy sitting in the van with the kids waiting for him to come back out.  Tonight he came out dancing at how many items he got for the little amount he spent.  He’s such a cutie – he really wanted to cook a special dinner himself, so I gave him the cash needed so he could get the items he wanted.
Anyway!!  I come home, get the kids set up for bed and checked out Safeway.com.  I resorted to paying some SMALL FEE (approx $10) for some worker to collect the items I needed, bag them up, and DELIVER THEM TO MY DOOR!  This feels like heaven already!  I am sure I’ll be worshiping the safeway delivery man very quickly, LOL.
I also like the idea of online shopping, as I went through the items I noticed I could take my time, look for the best deals/prices, look over my list before checkout, and it saves impulse buying.  I LIKE THIS!  ((Have I mentioned that the benifits include NOT having to haul the kids into the store???  I would pay double the fee if needed)).  I was decently pleased with what I was able to get in the end.  Of course any extra in these next (two weeks?) can be picked up at the grocery store here.
Not to bad, eh?  
Oh yes, and that’s *my* chocolate milk, damnit 😛
~~~~~ I gave up posting the list – it was 57 items for $162, and the deals on all of it ~~~~~  My way of shopping in large amounts from now on, with little needed purchase in person.
 
I bought this tonight online for the kids, to keep their backpacks and jackets neat and in one organized spot, along with their shoes.  I’m going to be putting an additional hook on each side, one for my jacket and purse, and the other for a diaper bag for the baby I care for.  I’m pretty thrilled!!  I really wanted to have a set of four, but that’ll have to wait.  In the meantime I’m VERY happy for this to be coming.  It wasn’t too bad cost wise either!  http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.do?product_id=3609535

 
Instead of going up tomorrow to see my two horses who are now owned by a wonderful family, I’m going to spend the day cleaning the house and go up Sunday instead.  I’ll have four kids with me at that time, but shouldn’t be a problem – I’m use to it 😛
I’m faaaaading….  night to you all!

That is all it seems I’ve been doing last night and today, cleaning.  I threw up my hands in trying to keep the girls in their room at night, so am changing things around.  Jonah had my room, a nice big room, while the girls had the little room.  Last night I pulled EVERYTHING out of the girls room, got rid of the sleeping item that was in their, went through clothes and found homes for items outgrown and threw away the too worn ones.  I had gotten quite upset the day before at my son ’cause I went into the room to find my trailer title since it was selling, and was NOT happy with how I could barely move, so the ""gutting"" was well needed.  What both kids know, is when it comes down to that *I* decide what stays and what goes, and they know not to even peek into the garbage sack, lol
Jonah’s bed was taken apart and moved over into his new room, a comfortable double bed with water tubes.  All blankets hit the wash (3 washes), and I continued to go through boxes, containers, etc.  The book shelf was moved over to the new room, as well as a new black computer desk JC gave us (him) a while ago.  He couldn’t be happier, and it looks pretty good!
Since I woke up this morning, I’ve been doing laundry.  Load after load after load.  I have washed every single blanket, sheets, clothing items…. it’s been going non-stop for the last 14 hours.  Jonah laughed, saying his room smelled like flowers, lol.
I found a GREAT deal on a bunkbed for the girls, although picking it up tonight didn’t pan out since the girl was unable to be reached.  Hopefully it’ll happen tomorrow.  It has a completely railed sides for the top (I am so paranoid about one of my kids falling off) and the bottom folds out into a full size bed.  This will comfortably sleep my youngest (2yo) and myself.  
It’s been nice to go through EVERYTHING, every single clothing item, every single box, but OMFG I am so ready to be done already, but as it looks I’ll be continuing tomorrow.  I’m dragging myself, but I’m thrilled.
It’s been a while since I’ve written, there has been a tramendous amount going on.  I hit quite the emotional slump for about 1 1/2 weeks, facing things that kinds shocked me and felt a ""pain"" and desire I never expected (long story).  It took a while to come to terms with it, and understand what I was feeling.  I was also dealing with issues with the drill team, still am but in a different light.  Another area where a lot of hurt is felt and seem unable to get past it since it was a slap once again upon something already raw.  I do have a few private entries written about all that occured, I needed to write, but nothing I wanted to post.
I sold my truck last week and trailer this week, the funds going to pay off more bills.  It’s been nice.  I want to say there are a lot to take care of, but although there’s a few small ones, the main ones are quite large.  In time they’ll be taken care of.
I met up with a friend yesterday.  It never seems to amaze me how much time can go by where you dont see someone, and when you finally do it’s as though they were never absent.  Maybe its because of the ""thinking about you"" every day that occurs, maybe that’s a natural way for staying in touch.  The mother to this baby, and I, are just the same.  Mooonths if not well over a year will pass without us seeing eachother, but when the time finally comes where we do it’s as though we saw eachother just last week.  Same goes for my surrogate daughters parents.  I enjoy friends like these, we all have lives and are all busy 🙂
Uh oh, I feel the sleepiness hitting me. *yaaawn~blink blink*

Goodness.  Did I mention I was SICK of doing laundry?  I believe I did, but will stress the point again.  I am pleased that EVERYTHING is washed though, and any blanket my kids curl up with have all been washed again.  Every single little washable item in the house has been laundered 😛  All clothes gone through, tossed or packed up for Goodwill, with a few being held aside for storage for next year.
With a friend watching the kids (a rarity!) I unloaded the two back seats in the van and headed out to go pick up a bunkbed for the girls room (the kids swapped rooms).  I am THRILLED with soundness of the structure and the quality.  Granted, it’s metal, but it sure doesn’t feel flimsy.  I am rethankful again tonight that I bought one where the top is completely enclosed on all four sides.  Although it came with cute twin sheets, I bought new full sheets tonight for the bottom bed.  This is where I get to sleep now 😛  I also bought two purple soooooooo cuddly soft blankets for the girls, I just couldn’t pass them up.  I still need to finish the room setup tomorrow, but atleast all bedding has been washed and beds made tonight so that’s good to go. 
I took the opportunity to vacuum the van out before the seats went back in and wiped down the cup holders and plastic.  Back in went the seats as well as the carseats.  All’s good to go for tomorrow – – – once I have this livingroom picked back up again.
I need to go tomorrow and check out insurance abilities for the kids for dental and medical, it changed since last year.  Hopefully *crossing and recrossing fingers*, their regular dentist and also doctor accept the plans.  
Time to go shopping again, online 😛  It was SOOOO nice to just have the food delivered 2 1/2 weeks ago, and was shocked at how much money I saved in the long run too!
2:50am – I really need to get to bed earlier 😛  Maybe tomorrow night.

Oh goodness, what an interesting last few days!  It’s 1:30am, I am yaaaaaawing, so this entry will be brief – hopefully.
I invited the girls dad to come with us for Thanksgiving, the kids were thrilled that he accepted.  I dropped the off for a day he had asked for, and asked if they could stay the night.  The reason?  To clean the carpets!  It is not easy to get the carpets cleaned by 10pm and keep six little feet off of the carpet when it’s been just finished.  I am SO thankful – the hallway, dining room and living room were all scrubbed.  The bathroom and laundry area almost both completed, as well as some switching of things around.
I had family from out of town visiting today – it’s been so wonderful.  They leave tomorrow, but whatever time they were able to give has been great!
My mind is dead, off to bed…

It dumped snow here today, just covered everything.  I didn’t end up venturing out in my van at all, but rather kept the kids home and warm.  My heater’s been running non-stop … not looking forward to my electric bill this month!
I wanted to post a cute picture of my daughter.  My kids all have such incredible unique personalities.  Katherine loves to put EVERYTHING in her hair.  We were at a buffet, she ate quite independantly and quietly at the end of the table…… until she received dessert of ice cream and syrup.  Into the hair.  We were rolling in laughter and snapping pictures 🙂

I don’t even know what to write for today.  It has been one of the most hurtful days felt in a long time.  I have spent tonight bawling, now that the kids are sleeping and no one is around 🙁
 
Not much more to say right now

It is shocking to me, the severe lack of respect, consideration, and thought some have for others.  At some point you give up, don’t you?  It has been quite some time since I have felt this bitter towards anyone, this crushed, to feel hurt this deep.  And it isn’t the action taken, it is the enormous lack of consideration and care before taking that action when knowing full well the feelings another would feel, and just-not-care.  The ""I got what I wanted"" attitude with a smile, especially when it happens far more often then not.  I am certainly not cut out for turning a cold shoulder and ‘dealing with it anyway’.  Definitely not a quality I have.
I quit.  I am done.  I dont care.  You win.  
I have lost the heart, the drive, and the desire.  This was the breaking point when things were so very raw as it was.  Sad and disappointing.
Scary to feel this hurt to the point of such anger towards someone.  Anger is not good.
Such is life.  Oh well.  Life goes on and new dreams are developed, I have learned.  This in itself is not a bad thing.  Old paths are ended and new directions are formed, aren’t they?  Of course they are.  Or am I just trying to come up with an excuse and feel better….. *big sigh*

Goodness, it’s been a while since I’ve written.  Just a bit busy I’ve been!
Kids are all doing great.  My 7yo is about to loose her first tooth, my 10yo has one hanging by a thread, and my 2yo has moved to pull-ups.  She’s so proud 🙂
Surrogacy is going WONDERFUL!!!  Nearing 23 weeks – one little wiggle worm of a girl.  Her mom is coming down this weekend 🙂  About time to begin putting the birthplan together (home/water birth).  
My transmission went out in my van.  Know how expensive those are to replace??  So my van has been sitting for three weeks now.  I’ll be sitting a while longer before I have the money saved to fix it.  Oh well.
I finally bought a webcam, I love it!!  It’s a Logitech QuickCam.  My reason was to set myself up so my mom can view the birth of her grandchild from Alaska, but also so my son can talk with his dad.  I’ve had fun with the snapshot feature on it, and it looks like video recordings can be emailed.  It’s got some nice features, I love it.

Wow, it’s been quite a while since I visited this place!  I miss writing, but have found myself so wrapped up in everything else going on.  The kids are growing fast, things are moving along.
I’ll be 28 weeks along in this pregnancy this coming Friday.  Unbelievable.  Time has gone by SO fast!  This has to be the best pregnancy out of the five.  A sweet little quiet girl, although she sends the kids into giggles when she does get to battling around in there 🙂  My tummy has never received so many hugs and kisses from little ones before – it’s precious!  Her name is Cassidy, although I haven’t heard yet what her middle name is going to be – something handed to her moms best friend to choose.  Cassidy’s parents are coming down again this Saturday to visit and for the 4D ultrasound.  I think we’re all still in shock this is even reality!  Her mom and I have joked that she’ll be gratuating and we’ll still be standing with our jaws dropped.  LOL  
My first surro-daughter is doing GREAT!  4yo and quite the active one for her parents.  We’re getting together tomorrow for dinner.  The kids are all excited, me too!
My van has been out of commission for quite a while now, thankfully I live in an area where I can still get things done – sort of.  I have missed being able to take the kids to the park, visit a friend at her office, go to lunch, etc.  Most of all though, being self sufficiant.  I look forward to having this back, as well as taking the little ones to story/play/music time at the local library.  I have readded figures a few times, and I am pretty sure I have enough saved now – I think – …. I take it into the shop TODAY!!!  Not only am I excited, but so is the friend who’s driven my backside around to midwife appointments, vet appointments, and to pick horse supplies up.  She too is following me down to drop it off and bringing me home.  We’re both dancing for joy, haha.
The kids are doing wonderful.  My 10yo son sure is growing and maturing.  I’ve given him his own phone which he loves, but has also respected the rules I’ve set forth with it.  He is trying really hard to be kind in the way he talks to his sisters, even when he’s frustrated, apologising when he’s talked rudely to them and starts over.  He really wants nothing more then to please.  My 7yo daughter – I am amazed at how quickly she’s changing.  She still has her melt downs, especially after school, but she too is growing up.  And my 2yo princess – a little girl I’m so thankful 🙂  These three kids leave me smiling (when I’m not pulling my hair out) and thankful for each day 🙂
One of the things my son has asked repeatedly for is ""family dinner"".  He’s on the right track with his thinking, but definitely not something I’ve done well with at all.  Well, as I’ve seen a serious need for even a tighter schedule then I’ve ended up with, that’s just what we did last night.  He rode his bike over to the store after school and picked up dinner supplies while I started dinner.  As soon as the baby was picked up by her mom, I was setting the table and setting up dinner.  The kids were stuffed.  We had a great time talking about all that’s happening in school, but also about frustrations they feel at home, with eachother, as well as letting them know the schedule I am starting with them.
Before we ate dinner, I introduced them to ""prayer"" – ya, I know, a little late in the game.  Both older kids started giggling.  ""Mom, I don’t believe in all that stuff"" my son said – that’s ok!  I have always encouraged my children to believe what they feel is right, not what others tell them is.  My daughter started talking about what she knew about God, and that she believed in him – that’s ok too!  What it was a time for though, is to just give thanks.  For the food before us, for a good friend, for something wonderful that happened, for whatever you would like.  My 7yo went first, and I peeked through a cracked eye and looked at my three children in front of me and smiled.  This was my heaven 🙂  Tomorrow is my 10yo’s turn, if he would like.
After dinner they had 30min left to watch a video in the room (on my sons computer) before it was bed time.  My son cleared off the table, put everything away, and kissed me saying, ""Thank you mom, I love you"" – awww!!  I have the best kids.  I continue to try and pull things more together in our family, in time I’ll get it.
30 more minutes and I start waking the kids up.  Trying for a breakfast where it too is a sit down together and eat, rather then a rush – shove food down throat and out the door.  We’ll see how this goes 🙂

As I start this entry I’m sitting in the van with two sleeping kids.  You know, a beautiful sight is when little ones are showing physical adoration of eachother by a gentle hug or kiss, sharing toys, or of the sorts…. or sleeping.  Right now I am absolutely loving this moment, especially since these two have hit the ""That’s my lap!"" (mine), or wanting absolutely anything the other has.  Katherine, my 2yo, has had to work hard on how to ask for something back nicely and being patient if it’s not returned, and Amandine, 15mo childcare child, how to also respect that something belongs to another person and that my lap is not always hers.  That touching Katherine with her foot just irritates her.  
These two are just the sweetest though, I love them to pieces 😀  They sqwabble like siblings, while it’s so obvious that they adore eachother also 🙂
So there’s a new direction my life has begun heading… at some point I will explain it.  With this new addition, and everything else the kids desire, it’s faced me directly over things that have to be taken care of first such as debt.  I don’t have much, but I do have a bit.  To get a better control over our finances, such as eating out a few times a week and those quick yummies through McDonalds just aren’t ok.  Starbucks?  No more. (I know, passing out already).  I was doing well for quite a while, and then ever so easily slipped back into enjoying the money in my account, and getting whatever the kids needed and wanted.  Not the greatest way to be!
I am learning how to penny pinch at home, and how to cook YUMMY *droolable* meals with just the basic ingredients which one often has in their kitchen anyway.  Where to cut expenses at the grocery store, how to cook more cost effectively.  These last two dinners have been a HUGE hit with the kids – where they leave the table grinning carrying their full tummies, ""That was soooo good mom!!"" *mmwwwa*, and against their begging, I AM NOT cooking it yet again tonight, haha.  I am thinking of making lazania (however that word is spelled) tonight.  I also found some excellent recipes for homebaked bread that actually appear to be cheaper to make them the cheapest bread at the store. 
My closet on the porch is going to be cleared out in these next few days and turned into a pantry.  I’m going to track down different outlet stores that cater to restaurants that will also sell to the public. 
Regardless of what the future brings with this little boy, how far into the future – if at all, it was a pretty strong kick in the pants to get control over a certain area of our life that needed to be pinched down so other areas could be taken care of and a stronger savings to occur.
Busy life, but all is great.  Kids are wonderful as usual, all growing so quickly!!

I don’t have long to write, but figured I’d put something down since it’s been a while.
I’m moving Sunday – to another apartment within the same complex, but moving none-the-less.  Know how fun it is to move?  Now, add attempting to sort, throw away, pack, clean…. with three children.  I get nothing done during the day with cleaning and packing since I have two little ones, and have to wait until the kids are in bed at night to get anything done.  Quiet time starts at 10pm.  Thankfully, last night, our downstairs neighbor was gone.  I took the chance and stayed up until 3:30am cleaning out my sons room, steamcleaning, and organizing items.  His room has become the ""hold"" room.
I need boxes.
As much as I hate moving, I can’t wait to be on the bottom floor.  It’s a slightly larger apt, that’ll be nice also.  Moving with ""nesting"", creates a wonderful sinario – very little is desired to be kept, lol.  
The pregnancy is going very well.  Almost 35 weeks!  My only goal is the 37 weeks mark, that’ll place me at the time frame where I can deliver at home.  I absolutely in no way want to enter through those hospital doors.  My last day working is May 11th, Cassidy’s (the baby) mom has a wedding to be at on the 12th, so anytime after that I figure Cassidy is more then welcome to make her appearance 😀
I’m still loving the pregnancy, and shaking my head as I say so now since I also want to curl up and whine… while at the same time love this last stretch.  It takes all my effort to walk, my legs ache, my backside hurts from the pressure, my whole body just wants to drop.  But I keep going, and smile 😛  We’re so close!!
The kids raved and praised me for dinner tonight.  I can do this cooking stuff it seems.  I was going to cook cheese tortilla’s tonight but instead made something different.  Pasta, hamburger, beans, cream of mushroom soup, and melted cheese… with handmade tortilla’s.  My son was in heaven, and said it was the best dinner he’s tasted yet from me.  They also had peaches.
I’m enjoying cooking, and love just doing the whole ‘splash of this, dash of that’ as I cook.  I still haven’t picked up measuring cups.
I found a french oven, and a cast iron pot (finally!) as well as a few different cast iron pans.  Now to find a good deal on a flour mill.
Ok, brain is going…..

Goodness, these last two weeks have been crazy!  
I spent a week packing, which was not as easy of a feat.  I LOVED the fact I was able to go through EVERYTHING – I threw a lot away, but it was quite the challenge to pack during the day with a 2.5yo and 16mo since they were always underfoot and/or pulling out what I was trying to put into the boxes.  Evening hours brought evening activities of dinner/bath/bed for the kids, leaving about an hour or two to actually be active with packing.  
I never, ever, want to move again as a single mother.
Oh the good side, I LOOOVE my new apartment!!  The kids are so much happier here.  The first morning here and Jonah had a friend show up asking if he could walk to school with him.  Later that day a little tyke knocked on my back sliding door asking if he could borrow our slide, and then knocked again asking if Katherine could come play.  The kids are all able to go out and play.  Today all three of them have spent the last two hours outside the backdoor on the grass, the island/fire zone 20ft away, and the playground right outside the backdoor basically.  I love it here.  Being on the bottom floor allows them to have heavier feet in the house without me getting upset at them (downstairs neighbors).
Things could be more perfect.  
Six more days and I can deliver at home.  I definitely feel as though I’m counting down the days.  I wont care about going into labor after I hit that 37 week mark, although my preference would be May 14th on.  My due date is May 25th.
I have a surrogate daughter who’s 4 1/2yo… her parents asked me if I’d like to have a sibling for her.  HECK YES!!  What an amazing thought – I have said I wont be ready to start until next March/April though.  Their family will then be complete, mine is complete, this baby’s family is complete….. and I will then be hanging my child-bearing years hat up.  I am looking forward to that with eagerness now 🙂
…. raise my children, love and adore upon my surro-munchkins, and look forward to the next stage of my life, COLLEGE!!!  I absolute can’t wait for that time to come 😀

Much has happened, while much has remained the same.  Things overall are going wonderful.  The kids still thoroughly enjoy our new living location, and the friends have been plentiful.  I often am hearing knocks on the back door, and ""Can Jonah come out and play?"" or as this morning, ""Can I go in Jonah’s room and play a game on his game cube with him?"" as he held up a game.  My 7yo now has friends waiting for her.  My 2yo, loving the grass to easily play in, and the playground that calls to her.
I am almost finished unpacking.  I hauled everything from my sons room, which had ended up as the storage area for leftover boxes, out into the livingroom so that it would drive me nuts with my ""nesting"" urge, and it would get done SOON, rather then sitting behind closed doors.  It definitely has be scaling walls, I am not happy at all.  I have been quite tired, trying to get everything finished up, but the final bit is on my plans for tomorrow.
I am now 38w3d.  It stuns me.  It’s difficult trying to decide when to calls the parents down, and when to wait.  I fear them missing their daughters birth, and I worry about calling them down too soon.  It’ll all turn out well though.  Last night I thought of little Cassidy being born, the tops of her head showing, and the hair that appears with it… and I got teary.  What a dream come true for all of us, and her time is SO VERY close.
This is a picture from almost two weeks ago:

We went out and saw Twilight again yesterday.  I don’t recall if I’ve mentioned her yet.  She’s a now 24 day old Golden Retriever puppy that I found at 13 days old.  Far too young to leave mom, but it has been wonderful watching this little girl grow.  To be the second to choose her out of a whole litter of puppies.  The timing for her to come home is wonderful.  I am in love, the family is in love.  She’s been a much waited for puppy, and a long time in patience.  She is my sons dog, while at the same time she is the family’s.
Here are some pictures from yesterday:

I read here often, but have ended up writing little. I’d like to become better then that, maybe as I find the time. Time. That’s a concept. All single mothers out there, or stay-at-home-moms…. raise your hand if you have ""time"" to do anything, really time, such as for yourself. Whenever all the kids are gone and I’m by myself, I feel like a lost puppy. Unsure of what to do with myself! haha
The puppy is doing well, now a near 10 week old Golden Retriever. Wait, did I mention in any of my latest posts that we were getting a puppy? I gave in. My son has been asking for years for a puppy and finding a litter of puppies when they were 13 days old, being raised in a home with kids and being able to meet both the parents in person. I fell in love, and we were able to visit as they grew. Lots of pictures taken. Now we’re in the fun chewing stage and teasing – as I was typing this she grabbed the laptop cord and danced backwards taking it with her. She really has turned out to be a great dog, I adore her 🙂
I delivered my gorgeous (surrogate) daughter back on May 20th. It was an amazing labor and delivery, although it was the first labor (and the end) that I bawled. It hurt, terribly. I stalled at 8cm, the suspection was that the baby’s head wasn’t quite positioned ideally. It was the whole ""on hands and knees nipple stimulation"" that did it. I hate that. Contractions hurt enough without encouraging more pain with nipple stimulation. The midwife wanted five good contractions. It was a relief to finally get off my knees and tummy over pillows and relax back on my side again. The whole labor was great though, perfect actually (besides that whole stupid thing *points above*) . Her mama delivered her, with the midwife watching over. That was as close as I could bring her into delivering herself – her daughter she’s waited so long for. She lifted her up to me and knelt next to my side, next to us. It was amazing. I’m still just astonished, and thankful, of it all 🙂
The kids are all doing well. Katherine knows how to turn on the charm to get what she wants – those beautiful blonde curls and sparkling blue eyes and grim don’t help one bit! LOL She sure is precious! Alyssa, she is so much like me. She is magical, the only word I can really find for her. In these last few months she has really matured and grown in size. She looks at me differently, in an older way. She sure is amazing! Jonah, my little man, is now down at his dad’s for the next month. I sure am missing him already! He comes back at the end of the month for a few days, and then flies up to my parents in Alaska for two weeks. He sure is having one heck of a summer!!
My son. He had one hell of a 4th grade year with his teacher. He tried to tell me how terrible she was, how he’d try to talk to her and she’d shut him down. He’d list off things that happened and I passed it off as typical things school kids complain about. He was right though, she was mean 🙁 Basically he didn’t pass – but of course he moves on which is good. He hates school now, he doesn’t want to go. He’s lost faith in teachers. I decided to meet the one teacher he asked for for 5th grade and love him. He’ll be perfect. Now, to push my son through into his class when I know I’ll face battles on it. It’ll happen though, or else I’ll pull him.
I’ve met someone – sorta – kinda – well he has my curiosity quite peeked. He’s a teacher. I’ve been chatting with him online for over a year now and finally met him in person last weekend. He’s a single father of a 4yo daughter, and they came out to meet me, the kids, and the horses. Unfortunately I was a bit tied up working with a horse and could barely visit, but we ended up at Dairy Queen later. The kids played, we chatted. He’s a very nice guy, and if anything else, another to add to ""great friends"". But we’ll seeeeeee 😉
I finally rode for the first time in a long time, last weekend. I was working with the horse I started under saddle, on the drill team. It was incredible to work with her again, although difficult at the same time. She is one that needs lots of praise and shines with it, but her confidence was blown – – it took a bit to haul it back out. She is SOOO incredible, it’s hard not to fall back in love with her all over again and adopt her myself. She constantly tries so hard to please and do everything that is asked. I ride her again tomorrow and sure look forward to it!
Well, that’s about it… for tonight anyway. Hopefully I’ll have pictures to post soon.

Life is interesting, and for the most part quite amazing. How things happen can be bewildering, and trying to let yourself just go with the flow can often be a challenge.
This is going to be short most likely, and probably a little jumpy with thoughts, I have an 18mo between my two typing hands, my 7yo laying on the floor at my feet talking about things she wants to do today, and my near 3yo eating cheerios. I’m waiting for two little boys to show up. Me – I’m still in these comfy pajama bottoms and hang out t-shirt, both of which I’ll most likely still be in come the end of the day. They’re comfortable! The only thing I’d be in otherwise would be a pair of shorts, but don’t have a pair (yet) that fit me.
I am starting a diet on Saturday. I’m dieting with a friend, which is wonderful and encouraging. She chose her diet plan as well as exercise plan, and I chose mine. It’s wonderful to have someone to hold you accountable, to diet with, to weigh in with, and to jump for joy for the other. My diet plan is just to eat more often during the day, and more complete wholesome foots. I’d like to eat more ‘fresh – live’ foods, and drink more water. Both of which I am not good at, but both I feel are very important. In addition I am moving my backside more, although the extent I can do at this time because I have my children, is to walk. I was up at 6am and heading outside to do just that this morning (with diet buddy) with kids strapped into the jogger and puppy in tow. Although I haven’t officially started yet, I have been working towards my daily goals this last week. I have gone from 181.5 to 177.5. Diet buddy has lost 6lbs herself this last week. Last night we took front/back/side shots of ourselves and will be doing that weekly also. My goal is to be 135lbs, my ideal weight. I have 42lbs to go. I can make it! I realize I just had a little munchkin six weeks ago, but I did go into that pregnancy around 160lbs+.
I met up with my first surro-daughter and her dad (and brother) this last Monday. The kids had so much fun together, and I was just in awe at how much that little girl has grown. She is a near 5yo vivatious child, just brilliant! She would like a sibling, so we were talking about all the lagistics. Her dad went through chemo four years ago, so it may be that we’ll have to work with a clinic. We’ll see.
This possible man person I mentioned in the last entry – what a wonderful individual. He has me in amazement, and so turned on. He’s extremely respectful, and there’s just-something-about-him. Our time together has been well spent, one time with the kids still up and another after they went to bed… just watching movies, but talking and spending time together. Nothing beyond that, but the more respectful he continues to be like that, the more I am just left drooling and desiring. I do feel very cautious, but at the same time this is the first person I’ve really dated since two years ago.
I am glad to have finally hit this period of time in my life (athough I’m sure there will be many more in this regards). For over the last year there are two people I had a very difficult time getting along with. One, told me never to speak with her again – although I doubt our friendship will ever be back to where it was before (and honestly for various reasons I don’t ever want to me), it has been relieving to talk and let the past go. I will always care about her and hope things go well in her life. This other person, I need to work with to help run this organization. For this last year after we fought so bitterly and I felt left to just throw up my hands at her, ""F this all"", and let her run however she’d like with it, I have been left feeling very bitter and angry towards anything that has to do with her. At the same time though, sad. I wanted to be able to work as a team, but felt unable to. I have seen her trying very hard in the way she comminicates with others and she’s done a great job. For some reason now, I don’t really care about the past. If my thoughts and suggestions aren’t welcomed, I’m not going to fight it. We definitely think on the far opposite sides of things, but I know there is a way we both can work together even though we feel so, and use our opposite ways of thinking for the benifit. We’ll see, we met for breakfast yesterday…. it has been a long time since we’ve actually just met to talk and laugh…. to just get along. I have hope with this all, and it’s a nice thing 🙂
Ok, well it actually took four hours to write this post, in between being up and down, back and forth, and settling arguements, fixing meals, and all the other fun things that come with taking care of kids.

Here we go again, the ""how quickly can I type up an entry while maintaining my thought process, before the kids need something, LOL
Well that didn’t last long – an hour later, and here back I am again! LOL
Lets see, the diet.  I am loving it, but still certainly struggle to eat.  I am just not an eater.  I am having a field day with all the fruits and vegetables though.  The barley rice is YUMMY!!  I picked up Pita Bread yesterday, and really enjoy the taste of that as well as the more natural ingredients.  The kids are loving it also, since their favorite foods are fruit/veg.  I need to find free range chicken, although I am having a hard time with the idea of eating chicken.  This is a whole ‘nother topic though.  Beans! LOL
Exercising is going well, we’re now up to walking 3mi every morning.  Today was the first time we went from the 1.5mi with small hills to 3.0mi with larger ""work that ass"" hills.  I love it!!  I’m not too keen on things when I’m hauling myself out of bed at 5am to get the kids ready, into the jogger, and out the door by 5:45am, but when I hit that refreshing morning air I am thrilled to be out there.  It really is something to do this all with another person, it keeps you going.  I haven’t cheated food wise at all, no sugar (well, except for honey), no crap.  The nicest thing is to feel how much lighter and full of energy I feel, I’m not ""weighed down"".  My mind is clearer too 🙂
I did feel a bit of disappointment when I weighed myself yesterday, only to find I was still 177.5.  I held that weight all week, even though I had been working my butt off.  But, I did have to buy the next size down in pants, I know my theighs are starting to shrink, and working with horses I know how it takes two weeks for their body to adjust to a new eating and exercise routine before results really begin to be seen.  So, I figure after next week it should start coming off better 😉 LOL
The kids seem to enjoy the walk.  They occasionally fall back asleep, but often just stay away feeling the air and watching things also.  They are going to bed at 6:30pm, so they still get their good stretch of sleep time.
Now, the funny thing is here I’ll loose all this weight and have a HOT body back again (20lbs by the end of august, I’m determined, lol)…. only to have a sibling for Mimi (my 1st surro-daughter).  Oh well 😛  It’s still worth it completely!
Kids are all doing great – puppy still has me up to go potty at 2am *yawn*
Man – he’s doing well.  We had one questionable spot, but he talked.  We talked.  I guess it’s more about learning how we both communicate and what our body languages mean.
Whoo hoo!  I made it through the entry!  haha

Some of the most peaceful things can be the simplest while at the same time the most difficult.  For me, at this time, it’s going back and letting the past go.  Rebuilding what can be there with past friends, and letting the past go without talking about it.  Why talk?  Rehash what has already been hurt? I suppose for some it’s important to talk, I have one dear friend who I could not NOT talk to her to work through what I was dealing with.  For others, it’s best to have just learned from the past and let it go.  Two people I had the hardest time with, once I am waiting to see what will end up.  This other person, I think we were so close that we caused eachother quite a bit of hurt at our end.  It took the direct and kindness of one wonderful lady to open the pathway for the two of us – we are talking again.
I saw her for the first time today since well over a year ago.  For quite a while we quietly visited (no talking) while we went about what we both were doing.  Tonight, I stopped by where she was sleeping and asked if she was up for visiting.  It wasn’t until the end that we actually -looked- at eachother, and continued looking while we talked.  I am sure it’ll be quite a bit of time before our guards begin to let down.  I never expect to be as close as we were before, but I am thankful that forgiveness has happened.  If I never spoke to her again, atleast that has been done on both of our sides.
School is going to have to wait, sadly 🙁  I have a nice large bill I have to pay off, and a few smaller ones, that are going to take my time for the next while.  Maybe next year.  I’ll get there thought, and know the pathway will open when the time is right.
BUT!  I am going to be starting on an equestrian drill team come September – yay!!!  That is where I am right now, camping with the group at their state competition.  I love this team, always have since we were introduced.  I have childcare covered for that one night a week.  I am soooo excited!!  I have two options for horses, one of the drill coaches horse (a youngster that needs to job, but liked to fly sideways) as well as a drill members horse.
Oh goodness, here I go falling asleep *yaaaawn*
For those that remember Spirit (horse), I will most likely end up adopting her sometime around October or so.  We’ll see.  The only reservation is where else my money needs to go to instead of a horse.  But, oh my goodness, does Spirit ever have my heart…..
Ok, I’m too tired, I’ll have to finish typing the entry in the morning

Goodness, each time I come here to try to make an entry, I am pulled a bazillion different directions – which is all fine, that’s part of being a mommy 🙂  And again throughout… sheesh, at this rate I’ll never finish this entry!!
My weight loss has stalled these last two weeks.  I swore that after two weeks it would kick into action, but that’s not the case.  My diet is very healthy, I love it!  And I definitely love how I feel eating this way vs the old way.  I feel ‘lighter’ and ‘clearer’.  I do feel though that I need to go through a detox/cleanse, and hopefully that will be the key to getting things going.  Although, in reality, I should be doing that regardless if I was actively loosing weight or not.
So today is ""Day 1"".  I’m not sure at the moment how long I’ll be able to remain on it, I go and visit my surro-daughter and her family for the weekend in a few days.  But, even when I get back I’ll be going back on it again.  After that time I want to remain on it until August 9th, I am taking a coastal trip with a friend on the 11th and would rather have food to actually eat rather then making this mix.
Man – Wow, is all I can really say. 🙂

I wonder how long I’ll stay on this cleanse.  It’s been nice actually just having my bottle of juice to sip on – or in my case, guzzle.  I am catching myself at how often I graze when I’m working with the kids.  I don’t eat enough, in my opinion, so it would be a good thing, but it’s still grazing.  As I enter day 3 I’m just barely starting to miss the little things.  I am realizing though how I don’t heavily crave food (yet), and am wondering how much of that has to do with having spent these last two weeks on a 90% raw diet.
I was getting frustrated at my weight, when I was doing so well eating and exercising, only to remain stuck where I was.  And where the day before I started this cleanse, I gained 2lbs – bringing me to 179.  I was ok with it on one hand, and disappointed in another.  My system just needed a big ol’ boot in the backside.  I weighed myself tonight, 176.  Better, sheesh.  I stayed stuck at 177 for far too long.
I have decided to just pick up a scale of my own, running to a neighbors is getting old!
My first goal with this diet is 10 days, then 15, and 20.  I have nothing really set, just as long as possible.  You can go 40 days, but highly doubt I want to go that long.  I am taking a coastal trip in August, and want to be finished come that time, even if it means I go back on it again afterwards.
The hardest part of the diet is the grose salt water flushes, yuck!!!!  Bleck.  Oh well, I’ll survive *cringe*

Hmm, well I think I’ll be writing mostly about this cleanse for a while.  Mostly, it gives me something to look forward to typing, which is nice.  I don’t end up typing many of the not so thrilling details about the cleanse, but no need to type all that out 😛
I’ve been asked what type of cleanse this is.  It’s called the Master Cleanse, also knows as the Lemonade Diet.  It’s a well known cleanse that has also been used by doctors for patients with weight and/or medical problems.  I did this cleanse last year and went for 13 days, although the more I think about it I’m thinking it may have been 9.  Regardless, I failed when I licked the knife after finishing making PPJ sandwiches for the kids.  BIG mistake, as I couldn’t stop devouring things 😛  This time, although I never planned to do the MC, I had been eating roughly a 90% raw diet for the 2+ weeks proceeding the start of MC, that I have had virtually no cravings.  It’s said the first 4 days are the hardest, and they’ve been a complete breeze for me.
Tonight though, as I sat here hungry and looking at the time wondering if I should drink some more or not, I had a virtual whiff of the smell in Krispy Kream donuts (mmmmm!!!!).  Tonight walking in the back door I smelled someone cooking stew of some sort, and it smelled SO GOOD!  One thing I’ve read is that your sense of smell and taste definitely does increase.  I have to agree with that.
This morning I did the salt water flush (SWF) and the new salt definitely works MUCH better – tastes much better.  After that though, I was on the move with the kids and didn’t have my drinks until I was back home again.  So, the first time I ""ate"" for the day was roughly 3pm.  Oops!!  I ended up downing 32oz, another 32oz at 7pm and came home at 9pm only to feel hungry again and started craving food.  Finally got off my backside and fixed another 32oz – down it all went, and I feel MUCH better.  I’m sure I was dehydrated also from not drinking anything during the day.  Normally these drinks are spread throught the day, not all within 6hrs! LOL
I read today that on top of my drinks, I should be drinking 1/2 my body weight in oz of water.  So, I should be drinking an addition 87oz of water – yuck – I have such a hard time with water.  Oh well, time to get to chugging *blech*  Drinking enough water has always been a challenge of mine.
I purchased a scale today and stepped on it tonight – I know, one is suppose to weigh in the morning, but I was curious!!! – 174.5.  Not bad!!!  
7/15 – 179.5 (6am)
7/17 – 176.0 (4pm)
7/19 – 174.5 (7pm)
7/20 – 171.5 (7am) – without clothes.  With clothes, as the others were taken, 173.0
I’m going to weigh myself in the morning and start going by that weight.  I do keep reminding myself that I’m not doing this for the weight loss but to go through a cleanse, but I’m lying to myself 😉  Once I’m done with this cleanse, I do plan to go back to my normal raw diet way of eating.  I really enjoyed it.

The girls are off with there dad, and where do I spend a childfree weekend?  Cleaning the house.  How sad is that, lol.  I spent friday thoroughly cleaning the kitchen, absolutely everything is wiped off and out, and if it didn’t belong in the kitchen it was removed.  It looks great in there!  Except for the OLD counters that never will look clean – I wish they put new ones in before I moved in.  I’m hoping to get finished enough to where I can steam clean the carpets.  It’s FAR easier to do this with the girls gone, then here, lol.
I had a difficult night last night.  Not only did AF finally start, my first since delivering my surro-daughter, but it turned out that Cassidy’s parents were waiting for me in Canada.  An email that her mom sent on Saturday with pictures, letting me know they would be on vacation and looked forward to me coming up on Friday, never arrived.  So, since I never heard if it was ok to still come (plans can change), I ended up not leaving.  Not only do I look forward to seeing Cassidy again, but I also looked forward to seeing her mom.  Her mom is a very special friend to me, and I miss her a lot.  When I didn’t hear from her though, I started worrying.  She has a medical condition, and I fear the day arriving where I loose her.  As far as seeing Cassidy, I have been receiving so many pictures!  I’ll see her again soon enough 🙂
Last night I was talking to Blake (man friend), and I heard rustling outside.  I didn’t go check it out, just thought about how much commotion there was with it being midnight.  Not too long later I heard a diesel engine.  I opened the door to see fire up the side of the wall.  Someone had set a baby stroller that belonged to my friends upstairs, on fire.  It was up against the wall, which has now left the wall a bit damanged.  Thankfully a guy was outside smoking a cig and saw the flames and called the fire department.  There has been so much vandalism here, it’s sad 🙁  The pool has been closed many times because of vandalism, as well as damaged and (supposedly) stolen cars.  As this area has grown, a quite well off wealthy area, crime has risen quickly 🙁  I miss the quiet little town it was only four years ago.  Part of the reason I chose to move to this area.
This morning I weighed in at 169.5.  Two more pounds lost.  I know it’ll be a pretty dramatic loss for a bit, and then it’ll start to slow down.  I’m enjoying feeling clothes becoming looser on me.  On my front page I’m keeping a log of the date and weight – it’s interesting to look it back over.  Today is day five.  I have a minimum of five more days to go.
"
61,https://www.opendiary.com/m/stardreams/day-6-345-6214265/,2007-07-22,Day 6,"
Wow, I can’t believe it’s day 6 already – while at the same time I can’t believe it’s only day 6.  I want to be done already, at the same time I want to keep going.  I have definitely realized that as I think of food, I don’t think of it filling my tummy and nourishing me, but rather what it feels like in my mouth and the taste of it.  This weekend I’ve been thinking how tasty eating at a mexican restaurant would be, or even Subway.  This morning before waking up I was dreaming of eating a butterfinger… yuuuummy!  I definitely don’t mind the drinks, when I’m hungry it fills me up.  If I’m craving something, it takes care of it.  I can feel the ceyanne working, it’s strange.  I am loving this cleanse, but do miss the simple things such as chicken fetachinni, mmmmmm – haha, not that it’s the best for one to eat! LOL
This morning I weight in at 167.5, a loss of two more pounds from the morning before.  I am watching the scale tonight and guessing tomorrow I’ll probably weight around the same or only a pound loss.  The dramatic weight loss happens for a little while and as one gets closer to day 10 it slows down.  I would love for this 2# a day to continue, but I definitely don’t expect it.  
Tomorrow I’m back to working out in the morning.  Not much, it’s just walking, but it’s something.  I miss my morning walks!  Thankfully I have someone to do it with, otherwise I don’t think I’d be strong enough to drag my half asleep backside out of bed at 5:15am to get the kids ready and into the jogger, and ready to go by 5:45am. *yawn*  I love the morning air though 🙂
Tonight, workout friend and I took pictures of eachother.  She’s lost 6lbs since the beginning of the month.  She didn’t realize the difference until she looked at the pictures.  Talk about one very excited lady! LOL  It was neat to see the difference in mine also.  We did though agree that next time we are wearing bathing suits so hopefully we can see the difference better.  At some point I might post the pictures…
 
 
I was in such a spunky mood today.  I was lost Friday night without the kids, same with Saturday, but today I soaked in the bath without worrying about kids outside the door, cleaned the house in between ""flop on couch and check email"" – – it was definitely a very nice day today.
 
 
I don’t think I’ve talked much about Spirit in a long time.  Spirit is a blind 2yo morgan filly that was kept from heading to slaughter as a 6mo.  I created quite a fiasco pushing for her purchase, although I will always be thankful I did.  It is nearing the time when I’ll be able to adopt her from the rescue organization, I cannot wait!!!  My son absolutely loves her, we all are very excited to have her officially a part of our family.  Today I went out and spent time with her…. I am so in love with that girl, it’s crazy.  I’m excited!!! 😀
 
 
 On Monday’s I watch this adorable little 3mo baby boy named Andrew.  He is precious!  I am reminded how little I get done when I have a tiny one, while also how much I absolutely adore the babies.  He’s a lot of fun, and so cuddly.  The kids adore him too.
 
Ok, I think that is a half run down of things – time to finish up here and hopefully get to bed.  The crack of dawn comes early 🙂

What an absolutely incredible day today.  My son has been gone for 4 weeks visiting his dad, and today was our meetup for him to come home [for 4 days before he flies up to Alaska for two weeks to visit my parents].  The family I nanny for on Thurs & Fri is now swapping childcare with me on the other days.  I had their sons overnight a few days ago, they had my daughters last night while I went and visited Cassidy (surro-daughter), and when I went to pick them up this morning their mom was talking about something they had to do that night and I offered to take the boys with me.  
The boys (3yo and 4yo) had a blast.  My van was stuffed with adorable bouncing kids, which traveled very well for the 250mi trip down.  Along the way I picked up my cousin who I haven’t seen for five years.  Herded everyone into the restaurant, ate, ceased arguments before they started, off to the bathroom to change diapers and pull ups – potty time, redressed, and herded on out back to the van.  Loaded everyone on up in time for my son to pull in.
The trip back up was just as easy, but MUCH longer.  Rather then 4hrs it ended up being six with traffic crawling for a little over two of those hours.  Arrived home, herded (’cause that really is what it is! lol) everyone into the house, stripped clothes and diapers off, and dipped the three little ones into the tub.  As I was doing so, I felt so happy…. I love being a mom, and love having so many kids around (five little ones is my limit right now though).  I looked at the giggling 2yo, 3yo, and 4yo in the tub and just smiled.  What cuties!  Into diapers, PJ’s, dinner, and into bed.  They’re almost asleep.  The boys mom will be by in the morning to pick them up.
I was thinking tonight *skipping*, I can go for my foster care license now since I have someone watching the girls!!!  Both of the parents are great, the dad is AMAZING, and the girls are welcomed just like family over there (as the boys are here).  Foster care, I would love to have a child 2yo or under, and would be thrilled to welcome a ‘challenged’ child.  We’ll see what happens, required classes is the first step.
I look at my life with all of these kids and completely realize that I am definitely not done with my family.  Mimi (1st surro-daughter), we are starting on a sibling for her come April.  Cassidy (2nd surro-daughter), possibly starting on a sibling for her in 2010 depending on where I am in my life – ei. if I’m married and we would like to have a child of our own.  We’ll see, life is amazing and although I can throw ideas out on what I’d like, it’s neat to watch to see how everything turns out 🙂
It is wonderful having my son home, what an incredible child.  We had a good talk tonight on our way home about the changes that are being made.  The new way of eating (no sugar), bed time schedules, and how school is the upmost first priority above everything else.  He asked tonight about something to work towards for good grades, he’s working towards an Ipod, which was his request and hope.  I can’t wait to see him succeed this year.
Time to clean now that all the kids are sleeping.  Work starts early come 8am 🙂  I have a 3mo boy being dropped off.  I think we’ll all take a walk and head over to the park come the late morning.

I will be closing this diary shortly for a few reasons.  I have started a new one, if you care to continue reading let me know and I’ll add you to that diary.  I enjoy typing, but have for quite a while found myself sensoring what I type here because of those that have the link.  If I try not to worry about it and type my thoughts and feelings anyway, they end up upset.  I don’t type for anyone else other then myself – so no reason for anyone I know to have the link.  I enjoy reading a number of you here, as well as hearing from you, so have begun moving those favorites over.  
My almost 11yo son has been gone since the end of June, was home for a few days, and was gone again.  I pick him up tomorrow from the airport and look forward to finally having him home.  I miss him, a lot.  The second trip, he was up visiting my parents in Alaska.  He’s a handful, and although my mom sounds like she’ll miss him a lot (he’s brilliant), I think my dad has reached his end.  We have a lot to work through this next school year, it’s nice to have the thoughts of what my mom has seen and experienced and what may help give him what he needs to succeed.  Parenthood is a continued challenge.
My two [surrogate] daughters are doing wonderful.  The first one is creeping up to 5yo.  It just amazes me how quickly time can go by.  My second, Cassidy, just turned 3mo.  I was online texting her mom yesterday and odd letters started coming through – – – she was banging on the keyboard ""to say hello"".  Awww!!  I love both of these families so much, and am so thankful for these two little girls but also being able to bring them to their families.  August 10th was the one-year mark from when I contacted Cassidy’s parents (dear friends of mine) and offered to be their surrogate, and was sent the most precious thank you email – – –  Aug. 31st we met up for insems, September 9th I held the + pregnancy test, and May 20th her mom delivered her with her own hands.  How many lives can be changed one year with one little offer, the creation of a life, and a huge dream granted.  Life, it’s bewildering.
FWB has turned out the be such a dear dear friend.  I do believe people and opportunities come in and out of your life for reasons, and his entrance has brought many lessons and challenges.  He’s a good man, and I’ve learned many things in many areas.  There have definitely been humerous moment and, ""I did not just do that!"" LOL  But I’ve also learned the importance of open talking of desires, what doesn’t work, understanding, patience, and acceptance. 
Spirit, the blind horse – is now mine.  I can’t believe that day came, I love that horse so much.  My son is excited, as are my girls.  The one thing right now I dream of doing with her is taking her to the ocean.  Hopefully that will happen soon.  There’s something very spiritual to me about the ocean, and to be there together with her would mean a lot.
I have retouched back in with a friend that I lost a while ago.  We both definitely carry hurts with us based on what happened, and we both are just not talking about the past.  I certainly appreciate that.  It was been WONDERFUL to be riding with her again, as well as to be working with horses.  I miss training horses, and have the time I give really mean something to the horse – for their progression to continue.  I have a new project, and am having a blast working with him.  I put his first ride on him on a trail that even I looked down the cliffs and at the rocks and agreed that I definitely must have a death scentance, lol.  Actually, I wouldnt have gotten on him if I didn’t feel comfortable and atleast more-so safe then not.  He was remarkable, as well as the second ride.  He is going to be a quick learner.
(( I really need to start posting photos to go along with what I talk about, especially horses! ))
I have another area I started typing about but decided not to, deleted it, and figured I should just do so in the other diary.  Ugh.
"
64,https://www.opendiary.com/m/stardreams/updates-1044-6214268/,2007-10-04,Updates,"
It surprises me how long I can go between writing.  I haven’t gotten the other diary going yet, I look forward to that, so figured in the meantime I’d write an update here.
Lets see, the run down….
Spirit, my sweet and precious blind 2yo princess of a horse, became officially mine when I was finally able to adopt her from the program she was owned by, on September 11th.  That day has a few different meanings to me, and with that the perfect day for such an occurance.  She’s been under my care and training since she was 6mo.  I have always loved her very very much.  She has a very long life ahead of us, and I look forward to it.  Hopefully this next year I’ll be able to take her to the coast and have pictures taken.
Gotta, my sons horse, was euthinized September 18th.  It was a difficult day for us, as he watched a horse he received for Christmas put down.  As a mother, this was the hardest thing for me to do.  I was not just ending my horses life, which I’ve had to do before, but rather my sons horse who he loved very much.  He saw how much pain she was in and agreed, but I was the one that had to make the call, to schedule the appt, and to hold her leadrope, and to hear my sons tears.  I am grateful for the kindness of my vet, as well as the man who drove the truck that picked her body up.  I hope to not face another day like that for a long time.  She was a wonderful horse.
School is going well for the kids, my son especially.  Last year was very difficult for him and he basically gave up, his grades slipping from 3/2, to 2/1, to all 1’s.  This year he is rocking, although I am trailing that backside of his, and am in constant communication with the teacher.  The two projects he’s turned in so far have been incredible and very well done.  I’m a proud mama 🙂
Surrogacy – Cassidy is now 4 1/2mo!!  Time is flying by, and the pictures I’m receiving are the dearest of dearests.  Last week I finally received the picture I was hoping her mom would eventually send, a picture of the two of them together.  I wanted to reach through the computer and hug her when I received it (she hates cameras, but took it just for me) – see, she has a blood disorder that leaves her chance of dying quite large.  My mom asked me a question after Cassidy had left for home, the only time I cried about the situation, ""What if she died tomorrow"".  I hope I never loose her, not until she’s an old lady, has seen Cassidy through high school, married, and children of her own.  But if she did die tomorrow, she will have died with one of the most improtant dreams of hers granted.  She is no longer longing, her heart is no longer aching.  She holds her daughter in her arms, a piece of my heart.  And Cassidy?  She is the most beautiful little girl in the world 😀  I will be seeing her in November, and then going up for Christmas.  I can’t wait!
….. and on the other side.  We’re working on a sibling for Mimi.  Mimi is my near 5yo surro-daughter.  She recently came to understand that she grew in my tummy, it was adorable when she explained it.  It’s neat to see how, through time, things are coming together.  When explinations are given, when questions come up.  Our first cycle failed, we are hoping the second one works.  If not, we continue on each month and will turn to a clinic for help eventually.  The cards are stacked against us this time, with a low count and motility, but we are trying anyway.
Money – I took a hard drop in income this last week, but it’s actually worked out well (after I finished gulping and worrying).  Starbucks and Subway have been my most difficult enjoyments to cut out, but with the cut in income, I’m learning to make all meals from scratch and am having a lot of fun with it.  I bought $100 worth of basics (canned, noodles, sauces, etc) from the $1 store and the rest of what I needed from the regular store.  It’s been a week now and I think I’ve only spent around $40 at the regular store for things such as milk and vegetables.  I did pick up powdered milk today, which many of the recipes seem to be calling for.  Yesterday the kids were thrilled when I handmade (everything) tortorlinis.  Tonight I made my first loaf of bread since I was a kid (the kids were so excited!), and for dessert tonight I made what is equivalent to Frosty’s from Wendy’s – the kids about died, raving reviews I received!  I found the recipe to make ricotta cheese from scratch, so will be making that tomorrow – as well as raviolis.  Giving my hand at making yogurt too.  Basically it’s anything I can make that’s full of flavor, the kids love, that only involved the basics to cook.  It’s pretty impressive how much of it all I have in my cupboards.  What’s even more impressive, is how much money I’m saving (gobloads) and how thrilled the kids have been with their meals… and how nutritious they’ve been!
 Divorce – Well, the girls dad finally called and asked to file… it’s well past time, but I’m glad we waited.  It’s been near 2 1/2 years since we seperated, and really, how we wanted everything set up is quite different now then it was then.  We’re also able to talk like normal human beings, discuss issues, questions, put together a realistic parenting plan without seething frustration from either of us.  We’re able to express what eachother needs, as well as the kids, it’s nice.  The original papers were filed Sept. 27th…. we’ll be sending the final papers in sometime around the 1st of the year.  Although things have been ended now for quite a while, it’s strange as it’s officially ending.  I’ve learned a tramendous amount over these last few years, as well as what I could have done in the marriage.  I do have moments of sadness, which I didn’t expect.  I think, hope, we’ll always be friends in some sort of capacity though.  He’s a great guy.
Well, I think that’s just about it.  A few other things, but it’s late.  I’ll mention them later.

Well I keep trying to type an entry and continue to be distracted and have to stop.  So, now that I am barely able to keep my eyes open I’m going to try to type out a quick entry.  Ha – quick entries for me still seem to turn out like books!
 
Things have been going well – well, you know, in between the craziness, confusions, the ""what the hell is going on???"", and all the other fun stuff of day to day life of a single mom with a handful of children, three of my own and what seems to be the rest of the neighborhood.  This weekend I had a little boy stay over, a child who’s become my sons best friend.  This is the second weekend he’s slept over both Fri and Sat night.  We have an issue with food with him, complete Mr. Picky!!  Yesterday I had it, and after stewing all day I had a discussion with him.  Pickiness is not allowed here anymore, and after a ""thank you bite"", if he doesn’t like what’s been made to eat he can go home to eat.  He only lives a few buildings over.
 
Cassidy, my beautiful (surrogate) daughter just turned 5mo.  What a gorgeous little girl!!!  It’s been wonderful to continue to receive the pictures that I do, and my close friendship with her mother continues to remain strong.  Some point here I’ll have to post a new picture of her 🙂
 
Well, this month isn’t looking too hopeful at all for conceiving a sibling for my 1st surro-daughter, Mimi, (now almost 5yo).  Last month failed, and this month sure looks like it’s going to.  I’m waiting on AF to show up, it feels as though it’s right around the corner.  The parents are going to be checking into using a clinic and go through IUI’s again.  Mimi was conceived this way, it’s quite easy.  I knew going into this that the cards were well stacked against me.  The father went through chemo 4 years ago, and although his sperm went from nothing back up to something, I am working with a low count and low motility.  The chances of conception are very slim.  I am still hoping, I feel it will work eventually…..
 
… in the mean time I continue on with my normal life.  Drill practice (horses) has been a blast!  Each week I learn more and more and our team is getting better and better.  I love our drill coach and how hard she works us.  I love that the training that I am doing on the mare that I’m riding during practice is showing results.  On Sundays, it is just my day.  I get to step away from being a mom and all the mom duties, and go riding.  It’s wonderful 🙂
 
And the most interesting event…. my van is going out.  Something about the engine, and as I pulled in tonight I know it’s going to need to now just sit.  I’m not sure what to do yet, but I’m hunting out for a bike.  Yes, I know we’re going into winter, but it’s a decent form of transportation.  The nice thing is that I live close to everything I need, from the stores as well as the horses.  I have been talking about picking up excersising in attempt to loose weight and create a healthier body, guess I’m just being pushed into it now 🙂
 
So many more thoughts and such, but might as well end it here.  I’ll try to type at a later time.

Finally I have a moment to write where my eyes are not rolling and I’m ready to fall asleep, although it is 2am.  I finished cleaning the kitchen and I’m working on the laundry right now.  The kids did a great job destroying the livingroom so that’s next on the list.  Not too much, really, but with kids working the house behind me it takes a while to get it clean and then have it REMAIN clean.
The kids had a blast of a Halloween – once I receive pictures from the friend that took them, I’ll post them.  My 3yo decorated and dressed herself in what she wanted to – she looked EXCELLENT.  My 8yo chose to cut her hair, at the perfect timing to be Snow White.  It looks adorable short!  Although, I do miss it long too.  She wants to grow it back out though.  My 11yo son also chose his own makeup and costume.  I gave him $20 and everything was his choice.  He came up with the excellent idea of the QFC Satan Checker, colored his face red and put horns on.  A friend gave him the apron and then a name-tag with ""Satan"" written on it.  He was priceless 🙂
I cant believe how well my ex and I are getting along.  I’m thankful, and thrilled.  He really has been amazing.  I hope it continues 🙂  All of his wonderful qualities are surfacing, although in admitance it also has brought up some sad feelings too.  I expected those though.  Through them I had a few good conversations with him regarding where we came from before and hope to be in the future.  It’s also nice to hear his point of view on things.
 
…… and here it is the next night, 11:47pm.  
 
For the quiet day today was suppose to be, it sure got busy QUICKLY!  I continued to work on cleaning the house (as it seems the kids destroyed it behind me as I went), and went to go take a look at a 3bd apartment/townhome about 5mi away.  It’s NICE!!!!  I’m seriously considering moving there.  There are only a few more left, if they are all gone by the time I finish my paperwork and gather what they need, I’ll go on the waiting list.
We’re having an issue getting my sons dog to be accepted.  She’s a golden retriever, but their weight limit is 20lbs.  So, she is now considered a ""service dog"" and I’m learning all the ADA rules and regulations regarding service dogs.  It shouldn’t be a problem to get her in, hopefully it all goes smoothly.
And there goes my brain again.  How come I come on here to type when I’m so exhausted? *yawn*  Going to go lay down now.
Oh, quick sidenote.
I am onto my third cycle, as we work towards a sibling for my first surro-daughter who’s almost 5yo (what a cutie!!!).  I knew I had the cards stacked against me, with low count and motility, but it’s still hard.  We insem tomorrow *day 14* (since the dad will be out of town on Mon and Tues), and depending when monitor and sticks say I’m ovulating, we may do another insem on Wednesday when he returns.  I hope it works.
In the meantime I’m working hard at getting what body I can back.

Well, I come here often to read but rarely post – it’s been a few days short of two months since my last post, sad, huh 😛  I thought I’d go ahead and post my blessings and challenges for 2007, as I step into the 2008 year.
This year has certainly been one to be thankful for.  There have been challenges, difficult decisions I need to make, and some eye opening experiences.  I have faced some difficult words and emotions from my family, but all these things are so small compared to the great and incredible things that have happened.
At the start of 2007, I was four months pregnant with Cassidy – the daughter of a very dear friend of mine.  With the gift of my egg, her daughter was conceived and eight years of heart ache, six years of my own dreaming for this child for her, Cassidy was born on May 20th – – delivered by her own mothers hands, surrounded by a room full of people, including my own children and her big sister, as she entered this world and into her family’s arms and lives.  I had always seen the ache in her moms face, now I see her glowing as she talks about and looks at her daughter.  The love between the two is heartwarming to watch.
This Christmas I spent a few days with this family, and since Cassidy was sick I opted to sleep in her room and care for her during the night so her parents could sleep.  Part way through the night when she’d wake up, I’d bring her into bed with me.  It was precious to cuddle with her, and in the mornings we’d wake up before anyone else and her humor was huge.  She’d have me laughing.  I love this little girl so much!  I feel so blessed to have been able to bring her here.  
This December 5th, my first surrogate daughter turned 5yo.  She has grown to be one of the most beautiful children I know, so bright and strong.  Her dad was found to have cancer when she was 4mo, and went through chemo and well as two surgeries.  They wanted another child, but lost their ability.  In April I received a call that he had a minimal count but there was something!!!  We started cycling in August.  It failed.  September failed.  Octobers timing was completely off because the father was traveling on business, it was a shock when I saw that second line on the pregnancy test.  I had tears of happiness as well as relief.  As I step into the new 2008 year, I’m 10 weeks pregnant with a baby sister or brother for my surro-princess, she is going to be soooo excited when she finds out.  Only recently did she learn that she grew in my tummy, her questions were adorable to answer.  My first midwife appointment is this Thursday.  What a blessing, we were given such low odds, we chose to try anyway, and we were successful.  I am still in shock and just amazing.
I feel very blessed for these children, as well as their parents – my two extended families.  
There are so many other blessings that happened this year, but these two stand out the most.  Hopefully within this next year after this baby is born, I’ll be able to get all three of our families and children together and have pictures taken.  
Good luck to all in this new 2008 year 🙂

I have so much to type about, but thought I’d just come by and give a quick update.  Although, it wouldn’t surprise me as I type if my ""quick update"" turns into something long and drawn out.
I resigned from the drill team, a decision that was extremely hard to make.  I have felt for a while that the time was getting close, but I was hoping that I wouldn’t ever feel that it was the absolute right thing to do.  I hope that they will find a way to help it grow and become what it can be.  They seem to have their own ideas, well away from what the team was originally founded to do.  I hope they take their ideas and can make the team succeed, saving many more horses who otherwise would have been killed or died.  I hope.  I am sure that I will always hurt for what could have been, it’s hard to let go of a dream.
A friend of mine and I have decided to move on and start a new rescue group.  Only time will tell if it really becomes anything or not, but I am sure it will in time.  I’m busy bringing these little lives here, and she’s busy with school.  Two years, we figure, to establish the group, raise funds (even if it’s our own funds) to be sure we have a savings to start, and do everything right from the beginning.  It sounds like we’ve settled on a name, which is a starting point.  Now, to register it, get a business license, and open up an account.  I look forward to this next year or two, as we discuss and really establish how this group will be ran, and after we are active – going for our 501c3.  Time – moving slow – taking all the correct steps along the way – and we will succeed.  I really look forward to it and all we’ll be able to do 🙂  I have the knowledge for seeing what potential a horse holds, nutrition, medical treatment, and training ability.  She has the love and passion, and is learning in all the other areas.  We both are able to listen to what the other has to say, while also firmly expressing our thoughts and coming to a mutual decision.  It’s a good match.  As the website is developed and a message board started, I’ll post it here.  It’ll still be a while though.
Spirit, my blind 3yo morgan filly, is doing great!  Her shoulder has healed beautifully, and she’s been given the clear by her vet to start under saddle with no weight limit.  Although this is something I believed would be possible, I was prepared for her to remain a pasture pet for her entire life.  Since I wont be able to start her for a few years, I have found the perfect trainer for her – someone who’s small and doesn’t weigh too much, is an excellent rider and very kind while also knowing when to be firm.  I love this horse so much, and look forward to my feedings each day.  Her eyes gleam when I pull up, and she loves to cuddle close – to be scratched all over, including her ears all the way to the tips.  She sure has my heart!!
The kids are all doing well and growing very fast.  Although a cold caught my 8yo a few weeks ago, my 3yo has a fever tonight and isn’t feeling the greatest.  I hope it’s gone pretty quickly.
I’m 20 weeks along in my pregnancy today!  My sixth child, and I’m still just bewildered how a new little life can grow inside of you.  I’ve been feeling her kicking since 13 weeks, wiggle a little twice these last two weeks, but yesterday was the most amazing feeling.  I was sitting at a stoplight and had leaned forward onto the steering wheel.  Inside of me, this child wiggled and pushed, and wiggled some more – – stopped briefly and wiggled again.  I could feel her body, and arms, pushing up against me.  OMG the feeling of love I felt was amazing!  I have another midwife appointment today, and the dad is able to make it.  We’ll be up an appointment here shortly for an ultrasound – it’ll be my first seeing this baby on the screen… I really look forward to it!  We’ll also find out for sure if it’s a boy or a girl.  It sounds like Mimi, my first surro-daughter and this baby’s big sister, will be able to be there also which will be SO exciting!  She realized this last summer that she grew in my tummy, which is making this pregnancy so much more exciting.  In the same tummy she grew in, her baby brother or sister is growing too 🙂
The mom of Cassidy, my near 11mo surro-daughter, is very sick 🙁  I knew the time was around the corner at some point, and knew that when I chose to grant this dream of this very dear friend of mine.  She is the most amazing mother and friend, and everything to her family.  We received a tentative diagnosis at the end of February, and now are waiting until May for a final diagnosis.  If it is what they believe it is, she’s being given 4-5 years left.  I can’t imagine loosing her, and can’t imagine Cassidy loosing her (not to mention her husband and older daughter).  She is an amazing person.  I am afraid.  I lost one very close friend 10 years ago, and was beside her when she died.  I don’t want to loose another, and another so young also.  It is so hard for me to see her trying hard to keep going ever day, and attempt to hide the pain she’s feeling.  Last week she ended up staying in bed for a few days because the pain was unbareable.  It’s hard to imagine ""the time"" ever coming, even though you know it’s a reality of what will be.  For those that are close to me, I am thankful for every single day that I have with them.  Life is so fragile, and where today we think we’re fine, tomorrow could never come.  She beat the odds before, was told she had stomach cancer and given six months – – the cancer disappeared and left the doctors baffled.  I pray it happens again for what she’s been diagnosed with now.  My heart has never hurt so much before, as I stand beside a friend I cherish completely – – and hold a child I pray who’s mother will be allowed to always be here to raise her.
The eating in the house has gotten better.  My 11yo son is highly sensative to sugar and simple carbs, and so for the most part we eat ""raw""… fruits, veg, nuts, rice, beans, etc.  He has calmed tramendously, and is loving everything he’s able to make with all these delicious ingredients.  I still have a lot of learning to do on making recipes that include all these healthy foods but satisfy the desire of taste and texture.  It’s been fun!  I ventured tonight and made bread, but it didn’t seem to sit well with anyone really.  Maybe because of a possible bug, we’ll see.  Even my daughter who doesn’t eat the above way loved eating it but her tummy didn’t care to much for it.  Hmm.  I did go ahead and buy everyone a cooler, and snap top containers for the food.  Daily they are packed, allowing eating to happen throughout the day, which has been enjoyed.  Even for me – I seem to be on the go so much I don’t eat as much as I should nor as healthy as I should (atleast I feel so).  It has been wonderful to be able to be driving and be snacking at the same time.  Pick
up a child up from school, open another container, and continue snacking.  I love it!  I need to give a few things a try, making flax crackers (dehydrator) as well as making this ice cream (basically fruit depending on the recipe, no sugar or powder stuff though – but rather ""live"" things.  They look delicious!).
Ah, ok – see – here it was suppose to be a brief update and it turned into a book 😛  Shortly I’ll post pictures of everyone, but it’ll be a few weeks still I’m sure.
I enjoy reading all of my favorite and do come here often and do that 🙂

Wow, how time is moving.  It always seems to do that, and if you close your eyes for too long you’re left wondering where the time went.  The kids are changing so fast, growing each day it seems.  Beyond my own three, who are now 11, 8, and 3 and soon all to gain another year onto their age…. there are also my three surrogate daughters.  My first, at 5yo and so excited to start school this next year, as well as her little sister who I’m not 25 weeks with.  In addition, my princess Cassidy who turns 1yo this next month!
Cassidy – my goodness that child is something else.  As I type this I’m looking at the clock and realizing that I need to get to bed since I have quite the drive ahead of myself tomorrow.  I am up with Cassidy and her family, and loving every moment of it.  It’s precious to be able to watch her grow, but also have some wonderful visiting time with her mom.  And as it still sounds, next year we’ll be trying for a sibling 😀  OMG my excitement is beyond, and maybe in my next entry I’ll explain more about it.
This princess who I’m pregnant with now, is the sweetest child I’ve ever carried.  We had an ultrasound two weeks ago, to see that she is for sure a princess 😀  Mimi is soooooooo excited!!!!
Oops – eyes are sleepy and can’t think.  I started this too late but wanted to put something down.  There’s so much to say, but- – – next time.

I have just a little bit of time this morning, and thought I’d use it by sitting myself down and typing up a bit of an update!
I’m almost 27 weeks pregnant with Loraine now, little sister to one VERY VERY excited 5yo girl who I carried here also 🙂  It’s the most amazing thing to give life to these children, complete these families, and forever watch them grow and love them.  Two weekends ago I spent up with Cassidy and her family.  Cassidy is just over 11mo now, my goodness time just FLIES!!!  She’s not walking, talking up a storm, and is the love of the little town.  I was so proud to be able to witness it all.  I’ll be bringing a little sibling here for Cassidy, and then will be finished as a pregnant mommy.  My three families will be complete (my own, Mimi/Loraine’s, Cassidy/future baby’s).  A few days ago I hung up frames above my bed for each of my children – the children I’ve carried, who hold a part of me, and who I’ve given life to.  There are six, I just shake my head and chuckle.  To the right of my bed hang two 8×10 frames waiting to have pictures placed in them of Cassidy and her mom.  I am so proud of those two, and look forward to getting the pictures up on the wall.  I have them chosen, just not printed yet.
Loraine is one very quiet little baby.  She’s been such an easy child to carry, and a complete delight!!  I can’t wait to meet her in person and spend some quiet time with her before she forever joins her family.  Since this time we live so close (25min away), when I drop off pumped milk each week I’ll be able to see and hold her.  I’m excited 🙂
Almost more exciting, is the idea of being completely done with having children (although the thought is odd at the same time), and work hard to regain the body I use to have and get back into the saddle again.  I miss riding horses, very much.
Let’s see, what else…..
I have been busy this last week hand raising a teeny tiny orphaned animal.  There were two, a boy and a girl, but yesterday the girl died 🙁  When you invest so much time, so many sleepless nights, working hard to feed and protect a life, loosing that life hurts even more.  I bawled, and tried so hard to keep her going.  She died in my hands as I was feeding her breakfast.  I had fallen in love with both of them, and they were always with me. Even at night, they were with me.  I refused to leave them alone since the chances of them dying were quite large.  When waking up my daughter I told her, and she too just sobbed.  Her and a friend burried the little one in our back yard.  The little boy is thriving, and has picked up his eating even more.  It’s hard to know and realized reality, that the chances of him surviving and coming off the tiny suringe of milk is small, when you adore them so much.  Regardless, it’s worth each and every near sleepless night, constant every 1.5 – 2hr feedings, and being tied to a little one.  At some point I need to welcome orphaned kittens in again, I enjoyed raising the one I did quite a few years ago.
I found a wonderful training camp for our puppy and my son.  It’s a five week board/train course, that welcomes my son to be a part of the training process also after things have gotten started.  It’s not cheap, but is worth it in the long run.  They have on going camps which will be wonderful for them also, as well as one of the trainers runs a 4-H dog program also, that he can become a part of.
Ok, off to get them all ready to go – – feed the tiny tyke one more time, go feed the horses lunch, and up to a riding meeting to practice the quad.  I’m not riding, but can atleast take pictures (which I just LOVE to do!).  The kids enjoy it since they’re able to run and play also.  The weather here is beautiful right now, it’s finally sunny again!

*mommy sigh*  OMGoodness, I am so in love with this little tyke.  He is just the cutest and most precious thing!  Tiny, but just the same.  It is suspected that he is 10 days old now, having come to me when he was 3 days old.  It certainly is hard work, not easy in the slightest.
At 12:00 I had just sat down to feed him his ‘dinner’ before going to bed for the night (3hrs 😛 ), when instead my son called to me.  His dog got a bone caught over her lower jaw, and an immediate trip to the doggy ER was in order.  Little Prince had to wait, and he did great not insisting on anything while we went there and came back home.  Once home though, ""I’M STARVING!!!!!"".  He just finished eating, says he wants nothing more (and pushes the syringe away with his tiny paw while turning his head).  Now it’s time for bed, it’s after 2am and I’m very very tired.
Ok – my brain suddenly went o dead spinningness, LOL

On the 30th I tried to make an entry that didn’t go through, and I just didn’t have the energy to retype it all again since when I typed it the first time I was in tears.  James, the little tyke I was caring for, died.  I felt like when it happened, and I spoke quietly to him as he paniced and was fighting his body shutting down, my heart was being ripped from my chest.  I had fallen hard for him, and I so deeply wanted him to live even though I knew the chances were extremely slim.  I had tried to find a vet to see him the day before, I knew something was terribly wrong in his tummy/intestines, but had no luck after three different vet offices.  I woke up the morning of the 30th and immediately called the local office again and took him in at 11:45am.  What a sweetheart of a vet, James was treated so respectfully by him….. he looked at me in amazement and said that it was such a rarity for this animal at his age to have survived for as long as he did, that he was amazed at the job I had done – and what we were dealing with had nothing to do with the care I had given him…. that made me feel good, but still sad wishing I could have done something more to heal him now.  At 3:15pm though, he died 🙁  I still miss him terribly.  My heart still aches for what he could have been.
I called the Humane Society yesterday, and went in for an interview today.  The time is here for me to go ahead and foster orphaned kittens.  I did make sure that once they hit 6 weeks old and is on food, that they are moved out of my home and into another foster home that prepared them to be adopted (at 8wks).  I’m excited.  Now that all of that is finished and papers are filled out, I will thoroughly enjoy my sleep and prepare myself for sleepless nights soon 🙂
Alright, off to pick kids up from school now.

Let’s see, where to begin….  
Cassidy turned 1yo back on the 20th, my beautiful surro-daughter.  OMGoodness, I love that little one so much!  Her mom helped her call, and she babbled – – her mom said she was trying to say, ""I love you.  Thank you for my birthday"".  Talk about turning a heart to mush instantly!  I am sooooo proud of both her and her mom 🙂
Mimi is now 5 1/2yo, my first surro-daughter.  She is one vibrant little girl!  And gorgeous as heck to boot.  She is over the moon excited that she’s going to be a big sister 😀  I am now 31 weeks pregnant with that dreamed for sister of hers.  This baby has been just a gem to carry.  Although easy, it still is very uncomfortable to walk, and getting up quickly can be quite halarious as I fall forward or backwards again onto my bum, lol.
I had lunch with this baby’s daddy yesterday, wow I haven’t seen him for quite a while since life and business keeps him SO BUSY!  He emailed out of the blue asking if I’d like to meet him for lunch or coffee.  We voted on mexican, and enjoyed our time chatting.  He’s all for delivering his baby with his own hands, yay!!!  Cassidy’s mom did that and the bond is so very strong – she talks often of that moment too.  He’s more along the line of, ""if it happens great, if not that’s ok too"".  Wow, here we go again!!!
Exciting and different news for this crazy household – – – 
I gave in and hired a maid to come in and do all the deep cleaning.  For any single moms out there, or full time SAHM, this was an INCREDIBLE godsent.  I collapsed onto the couch and breathed a sigh of releaf, as three maids went to scrubbing two floors up.  I was so thankful for them.  I am thinking of having them here every three weeks.  I can take care of all the daily surface cleaning, but need help with the deep scrubbing.
Diet ~ not a diet such as restricted calories or such, but diet in regards to a new way of eating.  Since conceiving this little girl, I have not cared too much for meat, breads, or processed items, but instead my body craved fruits and vegetables.  I started looking into why this might be, and researching both the SAD (standard american diet) vs the Raw Food Diet.  What I have learned so far is amazing.  I remember crossing the ‘raw food’ idea before, but didn’t give it much thought as I took another slice of cake, buttered roll, donut, hamburger, or soda.  As I’ve gotten older though, and certainly since I’ve been dealing with my 11yo son who is highly sensitive to sugar and simple carbs, I’ve learned more.  More about what is severely deficient in the SAD, and what is prevelent in raw foods – what foods to cross, and how to cook filling and complete meals without actually ""cooking"" them.  The kids are loving it.  Jonah seems to have assigned himself as the ""dessert maker"" and made an incredible Pumpkin Pie last night.  I’m still working on learning how to make tasty yummy meals that offer the visual variety while also nutritional too.  My body sure is a lot happier right now, I’m not feeling as sick as often, and I feel stronger… which is a nice feeling.

This pregnancy is finally kicking my backside.  On Monday I broke out in a terribly itchy rash that spread over my body, leaving me with a difficult time sleeping as well as functioning.  I rarely ever take any ""drugs"", but found myself down at the local Walgreens this morning deciding which Benadryl package I wanted to buy.  Took two and got sleepy, took a nap and woke up with my nerves on edge.  My nerves remained on edge for the next six hours.  The phone would ring and all the nerve cells in my body felt like they jumped, even down to my toes.  I remember that feeling when I was in the hospital years ago, I wonder if I was on benadryl then?  Regardless, it helps tramendously with the itching, I’LL TAKE IT!!!
It’s suspected to be PUPPPS (look it up online for an explination), but just the same, I’ve requested that my liver enzyme levels be tested ‘just in case’.  If my internal organs are all dandy, then I can accept the PUPPPS diagnosis…. but shoot, that means I’ll have it for the next nine weeks atleast!  Lovely 😛
 
Whooooa – ok, can’t think.  Guess I’ll finish my post next time.
 
Edited to add:
I have a love-hate relationship with the benadryl.  I woke up a few times during the night very thankful that I wasn’t itching up a storm, but rather more of a numb tingling sensation.  My fingers weren’t swollen from bumps and pleading to be scratched, nor my hands, arms, neck, back, or tummy.  I didn’t feel like my clothes were like sandpaper/razor blades against me.  I’d fall back asleep partway comfortable, thankful.  This morning when waking up I could feel my body starting to itch again…. now it’s to my ears also.  I grabbed one of my ice packs and wrapped it around the hand that was itching, my arm, and then my shoulder/neck…. ahhhh.  My whole body/nerves about leaped me off the couch when there was a knock at the door… I hate that! but can’t help it either.  I’m trying to hold off on taking any more benadryl at the moment, since I’ll be driving kids to school.  I have a midwife appt at 10am, so should be able to take them at 11am and be ready to pass out for a nap, and not take another dose until the evening.  I can manage it during the day ok.  I’d rather take it as little as possible.  2x a day seems to work pretty well.
PUPPPS effects 1% of pregnant woman, and has no effect on the baby.  It doesn’t go away until after delivery (ugh!!), leaving you until that point doing everything you can to stay comfortable (omfg summer is going to kill me!).  Heat agravates it, so showers are to stay as cool as possible (lovely).
At the same time, this type of rash can also be caused by your liver not working quite right.  I’ve had issues with high fat and processed foods which can also point to my gallbladder.  Both are being tested today, hopefully they come out just fine.  The liver enzymes being off can give a strong warning flag to preclampsia (sp) around the corner.  That better not be the issue!!  I’ve always had such easy and healthy pregnancies, but also know anything can happen.  This baby has atleast six more weeks to bake, so she better hold on – and my body better cooperate! 😛 lol
Other then that, things are good.  I think I’m to the point again to call in the maid.  We’ll see if I actually dial the number before the end of the day 🙂

I am sooooo thankful that what I have is NOT PUPPPS!!! Talk about a sigh of relief. The blood tests came back well also, showing that my liver, kidney, and gall bladder function were great. This was one of the most worrisome areas for a few reasons. If my liver wasn’t working right, the chances of pre-eclampsia were quite increased, along with all the additional monitoring and most likely an induction that I would need. In addition to the rash, I haven’t been able to really eat anything processed or high fat, which also points to a liver issue. So, for the testing to come back normal, is wonderful. I had a list of other testing also, just to be sure the rash wasn’t from something else, and that came back normal also.
The health of this baby is extremely important to me. With that though, I have one more little one I look very forward to bringing here, and I worry about something happening and being told by a doctor, that this pregnancy should be my last. It would break my heart. The baby is Cassidy’s sibling, and for so many reasons that child is very important to me. We’ll see what the future brings though. If for any reason this child is my last, then I am very thankful for the children I was able to give life to. They are pretty precious to me 🙂
So, what was the issue with the nasty itchy rash?? Most likely, as we can see so far, an allergic reaction to the iron suppliment I was taking. I stopped taking it on Thursday, and the rash is much better. I do still have bumps, and itches, but nothing near what it was before. Hopefully this really was the reason, so we’re not left wondering any longer.
Onto other things – The kids and I were a part of a fundraising event for http://www.csrdt.org yesterday. I love this organization so much, and am very proud of them. With the pregnancy, I’m not able to partisipate as heavily as I would like (rider, trainer) and have in the past, but I am able to act as photographer which I love also. I’m also able to be a part of fundraising, and help to bring in money that keeps the organization growing. Everyone who was there today was amazing today, although I think we all were dragging our feet at the end though. The one who impressed me the most though was my 3yo daughter, Katie. From the beginning until the end, that girl was washing each car with her own sponge, and drying with a little towel. Her greatest delight, and what she kept mentioning, was the horses that she was helping. She was amazing. My 8yo also did a remarkable job, and stuck at it the whole time, while taking periods of time to play on the side. She too really did a great job, I could have hugged her!! My 11yo son, did remarkable for the first 2 1/2hrs, and then needed to go lay down for a nap. He slept until the end, 3hrs later, which was just fine.
I sure love my children, and the passion and effort that they put towards the things that they do. They’re amazing children 🙂
Choices of food…..
Here is a whole subject in itself in our house. For years I’ve struggled with the frustrating behavior of my son, while also seeing all the potential he held as well as how hard he tried. I also saw how frustrated he became in himself. After all these years, I finally figured out what the issue was….. sugar. He is HIGHLY HIGHLY sensitive to sugar and simple carbs. Now really, open your cupboards as well as your fridge, and take a look at what’s in there. WHAT POSSIBLY does not have sugar in it??? Near everything in the american diet has added sugar in some sort of form. Fake sugar also effected him. 
I also started to notice, more so since last week, the effect it had on my daughters also. My 8yo would become more emotional and lashing out, and my 3yo’s attitude would really kick in. I would be left beating my head against the wall if we all went out to eat, or I’d give them a treat (sugar) of some sort.
I have been left doing A LOT of studying of the vitamin, mineral, and nutritional content of fruits, vegetables, and nuts. What happens to the enzymes when the food is cooked vs raw. Lots and lots of studying. I started learning about food combinations, and how to ""cook"" and come up with tasty recipes for ""raw foods"". Some of the items have needed help, others have been incredibly delicious. Some I thought were great but the kids gave a thumbs down, and vise versa. The kids have been great at tasting and giving suggestions to what could help it taste even better. My son has taken up the enjoyment of making the desserts, and can make an incredible ‘cheese cake’ as well as a ‘pumpkin cake’. Even the neighborhood kids have enjoyed what he’s put together 🙂
We do still have treats occasionally, but we try to make it rare. I’ve noticed a huge difference in all three children, my son most dramatically. I still have more to learn, but it sure feels we’re on the right track for all of us 🙂

So much to say, but I’ll try to do a quick update
 
First, let me start with my kids since it all basically surrounds them.
 
Jonah – turning 12yo on Nov. 9th (son)
Alyssa – turning 9yo on Oct. 19th (daughter)
Mimi – turning 6yo on Dec. 5th (surro-daughter TSx1)
Katie – turning 4yo on Sept. 17th (daughter)
Cassidy – 16mo (surro-daughter TSx2)
Loraine – 7 weeks (surro-daughter, sibling to TSx1)
 
Loraine was born July 27th in a planned homebirth, but not where I expected to deliver.  My plan was to be at her parents house, deliver in a tub of water (ahhhh), and crawl into bed.  Not so lucky.  I went from quiet contractions to climbing the back of the chair crying (OMFG it hurt like HELL – I was NOT ready for that).  The midwife made it there, checked me and said I wasn’t going anywhere.  They quickly made do with what I had at my house and quickly set up.  Loraine’s parents made it there with 10min to spare.  Daddy washed his hands just in time to deliver his daughter 😀  She nursed like a champ, and four hours after delivering we were loading up into their van to go to their house.  As discussed before conceiving her, I stayed for a week… nursed her around the clock (including through the night where she slept with me) for the first three days, and then during the day for the next few days and she was given a bottle at night while she slept with her parents, and I pumped.  It was actually a relief to pump, she had a suck that hurt and had me cringing each time she latched on.  I love every moment though, and every moment with her 🙂  Her big sister, Mimi, was so excited!  My time there also gave Mimi and I a very extra special bonding time.  I also was able to just sit and relax, something I knew would be important to my healing body.  Last time I was in essense forced to get back to my life and cleaning horse paddocks on day 2 after delivery.  It tore my body apart, and I refused to do it this time.  Just sitting and relaxing was incredible, and my body healed SO quickly.
I am still pumping for Loraine – it’s exhausting, but well worth it.  The plan is to pump until December.  I received an email tonight from her parents saying they only had one days worth of milk left, so we’re getting together tomorrow.  I can’t wait!  I miss holding her close and just cuddling her.  I love every moment I am able to do so now 🙂  I take in everything I can…. what she feels like, smells like, looks like, her hair, eyes, how much she’s changed since the last time I saw her…. everything are memories I’ll cherish forever 🙂
 
Mimi started Kindergarten this year!  I can’t believe it’s that time already.  She is beyond estatic and loving every moment of it.  She lost her first tooth two weeks ago also.  Wow, all these changes and stepping stones 😀  When I was told she lost her first tooth that morning, I just beamed while also thinking back to when I was told she sprouted her first tooth.  Time flies too quickly 🙂
 
Alyssa is absolutely LOVING school this year.  So far she’s been maraculous at staying up on her homework every night.  I’m so proud of her 🙂  Her reading has gotten a lot better, as well as her speach.  I look at her and she just takes my breath away.  She’s so beautiful, and has such an incredible spirit.  She’s almost 9yo…. just yesterday she was a baby!
 
Jonah’s doing great in his school (homeschool – WAVA) this year.  It finally became aparent that he’s allergic to sugar.  Know how easy it is to only feed a child who’s addicted to what he’s allergic to, something when the SAD (standard american diet) is loaded with sugar and high fructose corn syrup???
 
Katie is doing great.  I’m working at getting her into a french immersion school.  If she can’t get in this year, then she should be able to next year.  I either plan on homeschooling her, or finding a great private school (such as this one) that challenge her and has strong academic expectations.  I really like this school.
 
Cassidy…. a child who still takes makes me cry and smile at the same time.  I love that little girl tramendously, and is such a dream come true for so many.  I still receive loads of pictures, and am thankful for each and every one of them.  She looks so much like Katie too, it’s great 🙂  Her mom is so much like a sister to me – I’m so thankful for everything surrounding Cassidy and her existance.  We do face one big challenge right now that rips at my heart.  Her mom is fighting a rare type of blood cancer.  She’s on her way to England mid-october for three weeks.  I pray this helps.  I can’t imagine this world without her – myself without her, Cassidy without her mom, not to mention her husband and family.  I still find myself crying about it and the unfairness, but do ok usually.  It’s nice that Samantha and I can just joke about it, while we both clearly understand the reality of what is being faced and what can come in the end 🙁  I’m afraid.
 
The drill team is ROCKING!!!  Spirit is doing great.  Everything is just wonderful 🙂
 
Ok – only one slight challenge.  I hate my weight – with a passion.  I know I recently delivered a child, and know that my body hangs onto fat like there’s no tomorrow when I’m pumping, but I still don’t like it! It’s ok though.

UPDATE
 
I do feel I owe an update, since – again – it’s been a while.
 
Surrogate Princesses
Mimi, almost six years old, is doing brilliantly.  She started kindergarden this year, and is bored she says.  Poor kid.  She’s really quite smart and already being well ahead of the kindergarden knowledge, I don’t blame her.  Her dad is talking about having her tested for a gifted school up here.  That would be great!
Cassidy, 17mo, she’s something else.  Her mom is over in England for a few difficult reasons right now.  I worry for her, she’s such a very dear and close friend.  She also is an amazing mom!  Cassidy is one very stubborn and opinionated child, and her mom can match it quite well and keep Cassidy well in check 🙂
Loraine, is almost 3mo now!!  She is so beautiful and growing so fast.  I’m still pumping for her, which is time consuming but absolutely well worth it!  She smiles the cutest gummiest smile, which reminds me of Cassidy at her age, and is a pretty easy going baby.  She doesn’t like stress though, and prefers things to be quiet…. she was just the same way when I was pregnant with her 🙂  Mimi is in absolute heaven with her baby sister, Loraine, here finally 😀
My own muchkins
Jonah, almost 12yo, just began at an alternative school.  Last year I had to pull him out of public school for reasons that were leaving me *head desk* in frustration.  He did great, and now it’s time for him to learn to work with other kids again, just not back in the public school environment.
Alyssa, 9yo, is doing great!  That girl can make friends so easily, and has such a sweet charm about her.  She’s on top of things also, being sure <repeatedly> that I haven’t forgoten something that she needs. She just went through another growth spurt again, time to get more clothes!
Katie, 4yo.  An absolute and complete sweetheart.  I have to remind myself of that when she *screeeeeeeeams* when her brother or sister does something to bother her.  A habit that we’re trying to work on ceasing.
Me, Myself, and I
And now it’s my turn.  Me.  Hmm.  Well, this is part of the reason I’m back here again typing.  Think it would be neat to type about all of this as things go along.  Since the birth of Loraine, I have been very frustrated with my body.  Although I was very thankful for all the work my body has put out to grow all these little lives, I was having a very difficult time with how I looked.  How  much extra weight I had on.  Anyone who has recently had a baby, and especially those with more then one child, will most likely understand where I’m coming from.
I am still pumping for Loraine, and will until December.  When I am lactating, my body stubbornly refuses to let go of the weight.  I’m occasionally thought about stopping sooner then December, but how incredibly selfish is that.  I’ve already given her 9mo of my life to grow her, I can give five more months to give her the best start at life possible.  I have two more months to go.
So, I contemplated on what I could do regarding a diet.  I wasn’t going to restrict calories.  I had to be cautious how much I exercised.  Both of those cause my milk production to drop.  More reading, researching, and contemplating, I’ve come up with a conclusion on the best direction to go that would provide the cleansing effect my body needed, the fiber as well as calories in needed to consume, as well as the natural fat intake that I needed.  I am all for the strong cleanses, but that’s not what was right at this time.
About 10 days ago, I ate only raw foods for about five days.  My body sure preferred it.  On the third day I tried to enjoy a McFlurry from McDonalds when I stopped to get the kids all an ice cream cone… and it tasted like plastic.  The candy tasted like plastic with a little flavoring.  It truely was gross, and I could feel it working it’s way through me, and finally to my abdomen.  I felt much better once it was gone.  Guess we wont be doing that again!  Around day 7, I started adding in little bits of cooked foods here and there.  For example, I made a stew for the kids with a vegan seasoning – it had carrots, barley rice, onions, potatos, fresh basil, and a few other things.  It was unbelievably delicious.  Although, I still don’t feel as comfortable afterwards as I do when I don’t eat something cooked.  It’s odd.
I started out at 195lbs, and quite quickly came down to 187lbs.  But, as of this morning I’m 189lbs, although I’ll give that I hadn’t pumped yet which is quite a bit.  I’ll weigh myself more accurately tomorrow.  I do it first thing in the morning after using the restroom, and usually after pumping, before starting the day.
Some of the recipes that I’ve made are truely unbelievable.  As I type along here I’ll post them along the way 🙂
If someone was to ask the type of style I’m eating, it’s mostly raw food/vegan.  I’ll go more into this next time.

Holy heck – I can’t believe so many days went by already!!!  Weeeeell, anyway…. I’ve been doing great in my eating.  Little treats here and there though, which is fine with me.  I haven’t don’t anything terribly bad though, such as eating a sandwich as Subway, or a frappachino at Starbucks.  No sugar still, for example in the form of chocolate, yogurt, bread, etc.
I feel as though I actually have figured out the key for my body to let go of the weight while I’m still nursing/pumping.  It’s taking a lot of work, but the weight is coming off.
Along with eating mostly raw foods with just a few little things cooked, I’ve also taken up exercising.  I walked 2.2 mi last Wednesday.  3.6mi two days ago.  And tonight 5.25mi.  Tonight I am sore.  I worked with some weights also, with has left my upper body sore.  It’s good though 🙂
 
Ok, can’t see straight right now, will try to write later.

Super quick entry here – I’m exhausted!
So much for writing every day regarding my diet and meals I cooked, oh well 😛  I’m still eating like that though – I’ll try to do more with the writing on that later.  Atleast I’ll mention if I’ve lost more weight when I do 🙂
I took my first foster care licensing class today, first of quite the handful.  I have classes on 11/01, 11/06, 11/08, 11/15, 11/17, and 12/06.  I think I have that right.  Then there’s the home visits.  I’m so excited.  My child of preference is the disabled child from birth to 3, only one child or two if they’re siblings.
The class went well, it was quite long though  – 9 to 5.  During lunch I ran out to my car and pumped for 15min, but since I didn’t have a cold cooler with me I had to pump and dumped.  That was fine, better then my supply dropping.  Since I’ve started exercising I’ve noticed the amount I pump daily going down, leaving me to try to fit in more pumping sessions and for a little longer length in time.  I’ve brought it back up a bit, which is good.
Mimi (almost 6) and Loraine (14 weeks), their dad sent me halloween pictures of them yesterday, talk about a [surrogate] mama’s heart melting!!  I’m so proud of those girls 😀  Cassidy (18mo) mom is in England right now, but am sure I’ll having a halloween costume picture when she returns 🙂  
I’ll try posting some pictures tomorrow 😀

Quick update here… haha, right, when is it ever quick?  Well, I’ll try!!
Mimi is almost 6yo!!  Wow, time flies.  She was my first born surro-daughter.  She is so strikingly gorgeous!  Maybe soon here I’ll do a photo post of everyone 🙂
Cassidy is 18mo now, and still remains set in her ways.  She has amazing parents to guide her and her strong will in this world, lol.  Mom is fairing alright in England right now battling the rare form of blood cancer that she has.  I miss her!  I can’t wait for her to return, Dec. 18th is the goal date.  I can’t wait to give her a big hug.
Loraine, now 4mo.  Just amazes me, seems as though she was born just yesterday.  She is growing QUICK and remains on the 95% – chubby one 🙂  I just recently decided it was time to stop pumping.  Well, basically my life became extremely busy and with that my supply dropped.  It’s ok though.  She received a little over 4mo of mama-milk – lucky girl!
 
Jonah is THRIVING in his new school, I couldn’t love it more.
Alyssa is still the queen of socialization, it’s quite adorable.  She sure is strikingly gorgeous.  Her and Mimi look quite alike 😀
Katie is the princess, who leaves people grinning often.  She’s a cutie!!
 
We have a new member of our family, Chase.  He’s 13yo and one long very difficult and heart crushing story comes with him.  He lived down the street, and asked to move in a month ago.  He is thriving here, but I have a long road in front of me.  Custody papers are being filed, with adoption a strong possibility in the future.  He’s an amazing child, but was not doing well in any possible form at home —- nor were his parents.  Now, everyne is happy.  He is thriving, our family is blessed to have him a part of ours, mom and he are able to have a relationship now, and his step-dad and he are able to tollerate being around eachother.  Win-Win for everyone.  I’m trying to keep up a blog… http://hillandhammonfamily.blogspot.com

Every time I come here I feel like I’m taking a big breath in preporation to share all that has gone on since the last time I typed.
 
Chase:  This is a 13yo that moved in with me back in November.  Long, very sad story behind him.  But, long story somewhat short – I pulled him off all of his meds the third day he was here (weaned off of the two he had to wean off of for safety reasons) and stuck hard fast to rules that I put into place the first night.  Life here was hell for him, structure he hadn’t had before and hands that weren’t hurting him but a ""mom"" that was extremely tough.  At his IEP meeting in Feb. his future was talked about, the ISEP teachers thought I was crazy for thinking he could attend a mainstreamed High School, thinking he could do things that no one has ever been able to teach him how to do.  Two months later, after requesting a reevaluation last month, we sat for the results as part of our discussion yesterday at an IEP meeting.  A child that was baaarely in the average range on IQ (78) and below average near everywhere else…… now is scoring Average for IQ (96 – a raise of 18 points!) and average to ABOVE average on all of his other testings.  The other thing he’s below average on is when he has to put pen to paper and write what he’s been told.  This has never been easy for him.
But, I had to make a decision that ripped at my heart, mainly because he had tried SO HARD these last five months.  To have him repeat 8th grade.  Not at all because he’s not smart enough, this kid is BRILLIANT, but because he really does have a chance at succeeding and he has more maturing to do and basic fundementals to learn.  This kid, in five months, has grown form a ""third grader"" to an average ""eighth grader"".
I love this young man so much.  I am so thankful for that day that he showed up on my doorstep crying, asking to live with me, and parents that didn’t want him back in the house (looooong story, but I can understand their position).  Now he has the best of both worlds, my home with the structure and guidance for his needs, and he still has his family who live right down the street – he still has his mom 🙂
 
Weight Loss – Loraine (surrogate baby) is now 8mo.  Reaching the end of her pregnancy, it was the first time that my weight really bothered me.  I pumped for her for four months, and then started researching diets/ways of eating.  I tried a feel, and observed how I responded – the benefits to each diet, but also why it doesn’t always work.  For a while I had the family on a ""raw food"" way of eating (which really was amazing, I sure prefer that way).  There was the Lemonade Clease (Nice! But I have some theories on this also).  Watching Calories.  Portion Control (biggie).  No sugar.  Watching carbs.  And the list goes on.  I have learned SOOOOO much from from each of them, as I continue to research…. I love researching.  Maybe more of my pondering through different diets is more trying to find the way of eating that I want to hold onto long term.  What does my body need?  Where are my weaknesses?
So I’ve thrown in the towel and with all of my research, I’ve come up with my own list of what I’m going to be doing for quite a while now.  My way.  That’s how it always seems to work best anyway. 😛
Food, I am working more on the alkalinity of what I consume each day, trying to keep it 80/20.  I’m not going to be a terrible stickler, if I want to taste something that is acidic I will. Such as, yesterday I had a delicious blended mocha 😛 LOL  Ok, not good, but ohhh it was soooo good!
Water, often it’s acidic.  Drinking water that has been alkanized or adding fresh squeezed lemon juice to created the same effect.  I am a TERRIBLE water drinker, so have to really work on this.  My understanding is that water intake effects the matabalism, but before I can stand behind that one I have more research to do first.
Suppliments, I still need to add into my diet a muli-vitamin.  But, for now I’m taking the acai berry (so incredibly good for you in so many ways, including fertility, brain from the omega 6 & 9, and other great benefits – – yes, I know it’s the HUGE ""wonder drug"" for weight loss right now but that’s not the reason I’m taking it), and Chlorophyll.
Exercise, I hate walking.  I do.  Walking on the roads is so boring.  I do have a jogger, and I have a baby carrier for my back.  There’s no reason I shouldn’t be walking every day.  I hate it though.  And I just don’t seem to have the time to go to a gym, which is also boring.  But, what I do love, is HIKING!  It also burs almost twice as many calories.  I loooove to hike.  We have some gorgeous trails in this area also, and have found myself spending more time out walking the trails – – even with the kids in tow.  The kids are looking forward to more hikes, and camping later this year.  I do have a friend I am trading babysitting with, so may try to go swimming on Friday’s when I’m childless 😀
This morning I weight myself after doing this for two days.  A few days before that I was 184, but went up a bit – although I think it was water retention and such.  This morning I was 182.  So, I am going to use the 182 as a starting weight.
 
 
For those that remember Cassidy, my almost 2yo surrogate daughter, we’re talking about having a sibling for her.  Yay!!  She’ll be a big sister!!  But I really don’t want to start until I am down to 150.  Besides looking and feeling better about myself, and my health being better (knees don’t hurt, not so tired, etc) this is another reason for working to get my weight down.

82,https://www.opendiary.com/m/stardreams/taking-a-break-tomorrow-6214286/,2009-04-22,Taking a break tomorrow,"
My first in a long time.  
I trade childcare with a local mom, but out of the multiple times I’ve had her daughter while she was at work, I’ve only handed her my daughter once. When I had an IEP meeting for my son, and she offered to take my daughter, Katie.
Tonight I called her, and asked if tomorrow would work for Katie to come over.  It was fine, with no time limit.
And I sit nervous.  Uneasy.
For no other reason than just because I never take a break for myself.  I’m rarely ever without at least one child.
And tomorrow I’m suppose to be childless.
*big breath!*
I almost emailed a father who needed me to babysit tomorrow, to let him know I was free afterall….. and I deleted it.
I need to take a day to myself.
But I did stall deleting the email, hesitated a few times.
This is odd….
So tomorrow morning I’m working horses – yay!!
And in the afternoon, I’m going to go sit down at soul-food books and relax.  Relax.
Relax without children to watch over.
Relax without… without anything.  Relax.
Wow – – 
So I am childless from 9:30am on tomorrow….
Still trying to grasp this idea. I really need to start taking every Friday to myself during the day.  It dawned on me today, that without any children from 9:30am – 3pm I could at least spend that time writing my book, if nothing else.  And that would be a wonderful thing 🙂

I’ve thought about OD quite often since I was last here, although I couldn’t quite remember when that time was.  I wondered over today, but not before I had to go hunting for what my password use to be…. and I ""thought"" I remembered my sign in name.  I enjoyed visiting a few in particular who I think about often, and wondered how they were doing. 
 
My update:
 
I’m not with CGS anymore, a horse rescue organization.  It’s a long story, so one I wont get in to.  I am though, finally living on property again with my horses.  My children are loving in, and I’m restarting my riding business again.
 
My surrogate children are growing so fast.  Mimi is almost 8yo, her sister just turned 2yo…. and Cassidy recently turned 3yo.  They all leave me speechless.  Cassidy is coming to visit for four days in September.  Well, a few more days extra since her mom will be staying with her, but then alone with us while her mom visits a few states away.  I feel wowed, I’m being trusted with her.  Her mom says that she doesn’t trust leaving her with anyone else.  Her mom is so sweet – stories that I hear leave me laughing, Cassidy is a ""mini me""… she chose the BEST mom in the world to raise her in this life 🙂  I am so proud of that family.
 
My own children are now (almosts) 14, 11, and 6.  WHERE DOES THE TIME GO???  My near 6yo is starting kindergarten next month.  She’s excited 🙂
 
I have another little girl, Emily, who’s almost 10wks old now.  Emily is a little dream come true.  It took three years to find the right donor to have her…. lots of tears, as my arms ached for her but couldn’t find the person to donate who felt ""right"".  Maybe she was leading me from the other side… someone sure knew who it was suppose to be.  He appeared at just the right time, and our friendship grew.  He donated, and three days after insems he flew back to his home town (china) for the next five months.  I shared with him over chat the positive tests, and kept a diary going on a site that China allows to be visited.  Once he returned I continued it on a site that allows pictures.  Although ""dad"" wasn’t what was planned, it all fell that direction.  He is the best father, I am so thankful to him.  With him being gay, there’s not a chance at weird ""I’m so in love with you, lets get together"" which was almost on purpose.  I’m happy single, I am focused on raising my children in a safe environment (not men coming in and out of their lives).  It has been such a joy at sharing Emily with her dad so he can experience things also.

 Wow.  I really need to be getting back here more often.  I do miss writing, but I haven’t even been keeping up with Emily’s diary.
 
Not so sure where I left off, so will just ramble a bit.
 
I still live in the same house as the last entry.  I am not teaching riding lessons again, as I had planned, but loving having my pony with me.  My blind horse will be returning at the beginning of August.  Gabrial, our old black arabian, sadly had to be euthinized last Tuesday 🙁
 
My children are all growing, too fast in my opinion.   Did I mention in the past that I was looking for the right donor to have my last child?  I did finally find him, and he is beyond all I could have ever dreamed of.  He is the best father, amazing co-parenter.  He is gay, so no sexual relationship will ruin what we have.  We chose to have a full sibling, with him being the main raising parent – – again, perfect.  Aria is now almost 5mo 🙂
 
I am nannying a wonderful family, but with them comes some challenges as well.  Love the kids to pieces, they are easy – but we have worked to reach this point.  They are a severe handful with mom, and recently has been a handful with dad (but he is a great one).
 
I am pumping milk for Aria, but also triplets.  Two of the boys, although mainly one in particular, is allergic to everything it seems so chose to go off of the top 8 food allergens.  So, no dairy, soy, gluten, eggs, nuts, or fish.  He is much better, it makes it all worth it.  It’s been about two months now, I don’t really crave any of the foods but occasionally do find I want to reach for something to grab and eat, lol
 
I am working towards weight loss, but where I struggled before it’s coming off…..slowly.  Yay 🙂
 
I’ll have to type more later…………….

 Following Aria’s birth, I decided to help a friend who had triplets but wasn’t able to pump enough milk for them because of her PCOS.  She was devoted though, pumping throughout the day while managing her three boys, and ending up with a whole ounce.  1oz.  Soon she got it up to 3.5oz, but never above that.  
 
Soon it was realized that the one with severe reflux was most likely allergic to something – dairy maybe? – and I went off of wet dairy (sour cream, milk, pudding, etc).  Nope, didn’t work, so ended up doing what is considered the ""elimination diet"" and have remained so for the last near three months because it DID work.  A second triplet, August, is sensitive as well so is able to have some also.
 
No Dairy, Eggs, Gluten, Soy, Nuts, Fish, and Corn
 
At first, ""What the hell do I eat???"" rambled through my brain.  Basically, I had to completely relook at what I ate and consider a different direction.  Thankfully I have been fairly familiar, for the most part, with eating ""differently"" so had an idea on different alternative foods that would work.  Unlike other diets I’ve tried in the past, having this precious little boy in my mind is what kept me on track as I would even for a sliver of a moment ponder cheating.  ""Just this once"" wouldn’t work because the milk would become what he couldn’t drink.
 
I have been enjoying working with different ingredients to make different treats that I’d like… breads, cakes, icing, etc, but for the most part am finding eating this way very simple.  I feel light, and my body has been slimming down.  To date I have lost 25lbs.  It’s slow going, but I’d prefer not to loose it too fast anyway so I can hopefully limit any sagging skin.  
 
Do any of you have food sensitive kids?  Would it be helpful at all to post recipes I end up finding very kid friendly?
 
But, the title, ""Addicted to food""…. we really are.  The idea of giving up cake, bread, soda, etc sends one in to a panic it seems.  Even on support groups I’m on a common question is, ""How do you give it up??""  Umm, you just do.  It sounds so much like an addiction.  I am thankful to be past it, but do believe if it wasn’t for Gage I wouldn’t have been able to make it.

It’s been so long since I’ve written here.  I’ve restored an old diary but am still trying to restore a few others that were connected to the same email address.  So this entry is just more like a dangling one, not sure if it’ll be left here or just temporarily sitting until I finish getting my blog site put together.
 
In 2015 I met someone.  Someone who I thought I’d be staying with.  I was so young and naive in mind.  Although he never raised a hand to me, in ways I feel it would have been less painful if he had done so, the psychological, emotional, and mental abuse sliced me soul deep.  Looking back now I can see how strong I was, and how beautifully I danced the journey.  I am still breathing on this side, I made it.  I gained many life lessons in that journey, power packed in to seven years, a bonus daughter, and a child.
There is much more I will talk about later in this area, but the journey I’m starting on now is healing from the inside.  I have worked on the healing in many areas, working through triggers and panic attacks, but realized more recently that what I was not ready for before but am now, is the coping methods I turned to just to keep breathing I now was ready to face off with.  For me, the majority of the faceoff would be with food.
When I met my ex I had already lost a lot of weight and felt amazing.  I was 173lbs.  As the abuse intensified, so did my weight gain, it flooded back quickly.  Then a pregnancy on top of it.  I left everything behind at 262lbs.  Today I hover around 253lbs.
It doesn’t always make sense.  I am physically active all day, working on an equestrian and farm facility property, among other things.  But I can also look and see what holds my weight, the inflammatory foods I choose to eat.  Items I know are harmful for me.  They are also items that are peace bringing, a momentary crutch even if physical pain follows.  Simple carbs and sugar, usually in the form of soda.  They are my go to, when I’m tired and need a pick-me-up or just to momentarily feel better.  The pain after the fact is debilitating though.  I hopple.  Injuries I already have hurt more.  My hands and feet hurt (arthritis), everything hurts.
I have given these items up in the past and the inflammation goes down, and I can walk without pain, but it’s then so easy to reach for those chips and I’m on the cycle again.
I am now ready to take a bigger step though.  I feel myself dying inside, crawling as I reach for my next step and breath, and I can’t keep going through life like this.  I have too much waiting for me, and too much to offer.
I am ready to face off with my additions, and what keeps pulling me back to them.  I have worked through so much healing from childhood trauma and my last abusive relationship, I’m now ready to take the step to work through coping mechanisms acquired over the years, especially around food.
In the past my favorite “diet” program is the HCG program.  My body feels at peace.  I am not taking this step for weight loss, but to heal and leave foods/addictions behind me, and this program is something I am use to and feel good about.  The drops are suppose to arrive tonight.
As I face off with addictions, I was ready to give up coffee.  I had to wait until I really was ready, trying before only got so far before I reached for my coffee.  It was something dependable before, hot and starting my morning with a smile.  But, it was an addiction for me and so it’s something added to the list.  My wish is to be sipping on tea in the morning instead, and even better if I can make my own tea…. which will happen eventually.  But, for now, I am stepping back slowly.  I am now down to one cup in the morning, where before it was 3-4.  The desire to step away from it is still there.
Join me in my journey.  What I am facing with, most have the same experience as well.  What are you “addicted” to, that was your dependable to lean on in times of struggle – your comfort and familiar?
Addictions are hard to give up, we are such creatures of habits.  It makes it even harder when it’s seen as normal and is everywhere, especially when the addiction is around food.

In the past, the “diet program” my body felt most at peace with is the HCG Diet through the Omni Program.  This is what I’m choosing to do again, but I’m coming from a different direction.  As mentioned before, I’m facing off with my addictive behavior and relationship with food as a coping tool.
The program has you weighing daily, I am not doing this.  It has helped in the past, especially in being able to see what foods cause inflammation (onions is one for me), but it’s not for this time around.  I’m not even so sure I’ll take progressive pictures.  This isn’t about losing weight.
Drops arrive yesterday, and I started them this morning.  It is relieving to feel ready again, knowing internal peace, along with my physical pain disappearing, is just around the corner.  I am thankful the time has come for me to do some deep work around addictions and coping skills.
One addition item I need to incorporate, is grounding
