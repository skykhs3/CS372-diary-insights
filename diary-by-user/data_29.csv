I wish yesterday never happened. I wish you hadn’t said (not once but three times) “You only want me if you can #$&@ me in the ass.” That statement hurt. I do that because you like it, too, and because I like to control your pleasure. I do it because you agreed to be my sub. You being my sub makes me happy. I don’t want you to make it ugly. 
 
Me enjoying that does not mean that I don’t want to switch. It means that the balance of power is tipped a little too far in one person’s favor. Most everything can be balanced, including this.
 
I acknowledged that I use my dominance as a way to deflect, or as an act of self-defense. 
 
Problem is, I don’t need to defend myself from you. You’re not the bad guy.  You are the one I let see into my soul. You are the keeper of my secrets. You are above everyone else. 
 
You reawakened my sexuality many years ago and you are more powerful today than you were then. You can reduce me to tears with a cross word or an angry sentence. When I make you upset, my whole world feels bad. 
 
I’m not self sacrificing. I’m not weak. I can quell the panic. The panic comes from the awareness that there is no other person like you and that if I drive you away, I will search for what we had for the rest of my life. I will chase it to my grave. 
 
You breathed life into me the moment you put your mouth on mine. You rescued me before everything went black. I’ve said it to you before, and because it’s true, I will say it again. Without you, I would have spent a lifetime never knowing true intimacy.
 
I can’t control my future. Imagining it without you in it makes my chest hurt deep inside like I’m having a heart attack. It makes hot tears burn my cheeks and drop onto my chest. 
 
When you retired several years ago, there was an abrupt halt to our communication. We went from a few times a day contact, with weekly or twice weekly visits, to an entire year of separation. This is where the tiny seed of doubt developed roots.
 
Days went by without hearing your voice in my ear, and then weeks. I think you were overwhelmed and preoccupied, having trouble with the adjustment between work and retirement. In my mind, you were out with your wife, enjoying the hard earned fruits of your labor. You didn’t need me anymore; I served my purpose. I didn’t know what to think, and you stayed silent. 
 
In retrospect you may have been struggling. I felt so alone. You were my emotional lifeline. Without you I floundered and after a while, I sank…literally, into a whirlwind depression complete with bouts of crippling anxiety. I began to sabotage a successful business and a career I loved. I knew that your retirement was going to make seeing me more risky, but I wasn’t prepared for you to deem the risk too great. I wasn’t prepared for you to sacrifice me to protect her. To be fair, I knew this was to be expected. I agreed to it before our relationship started. 
 
I tried to fill the empty spot you left with alcohol and with an emotional connection to a man that wasn’t healthy or sober enough to make love to me. He needed someone to convince him to live. I made it my mission to save him so I didn’t have to face the fact that I needed to save myself. 
 
The void you left in my heart was FAR worse than the one my husband left. Wiith him, I was conditioned to accept emotional distance and avoidance as normal marital behavior . Your absence felt like a sudden death and I suffered every awful one of the seven steps of grief on my way to coming to terms with the loss. I stayed stuck on “pissed” for quite a while, and I flirted with the idea of finding someone else. 
 
But there was no one else, and I already knew that. 
 
Eventually, I had no choice but to detach from you, as it hurt to much to dwell on the pain that comes with abandonment, whether it’s real or imagined. I withdrew into myself, at the same time becoming overtly sexual and flirtatious. I used my pain as a catalyst to prove I could attract men. I even kissed a few. But once I knew I could have them,I didn’t want them. They were akin to getting a tiny sip of water when I was dying of thirst. I just wanted the water that had sustained me for so long. I wanted to go back in time, before my well dried up. 
 
By the time you realized the depth of my wounds, they had formed scar tissue. I was spending all my time trying to make you sorry you didn’t want me anymore. I ran, and for what seemed like a very long time, you chased.
 
Eventually, you gave up on me.
 
ALMOST.
 
It’s that one word that saved us. 
 
People often use the phrase “almost doesn’t count”, which just goes to show you that people don’t know everything.
 
Because in this case, it’s what counted the most.

I’d like to think of myself as a reasonable person, but not liking someone you don’t even know and have never met is NOT reasonable. 
Before I begin I want it noted that I understand that there are two sides to every story and that an ailing or terminal relationship is never just one person’s fault.
But oh God how I despise my lover’s wife. Is she a good person? Maybe. Is she giving and loving? No, I don’t think so, because after all I’ve heard, she just seems demanding and above reproach.
She is in constant need of his physical care, and by that I mean she demands he do even the simplest of tasks for her and here’s the kicker… she is 1,254 miles away from him. Yup, she’s in a sunny retirement state living in her own beach side apartment, controlling her pawn from afar all while living with a crippling emotional dependency on him that she insists isn’t so.
She claims to be an “independent woman” but can’t choose her own doctor or buy herself a cell phone without holding him over a barrel until he helps make the choice or worse, until he troubleshoots all the problems that she won’t or can’t figure out on her own. Oh, and don’t forget, he’s doing all This from several states away and working in the city hall all day as a paid official.
Meanwhile, he expects ME to actually BE the independent woman she says she is. I can go as far as putting myself out there socially and sexually for both of us, but she’s to be protected in a bubble so her feelings don’t get hurt. Oh, and I forgot to add that she is rarely, if ever, happy or pleasant or humble no matter what he does for her, and she loves to make him feel as if he continually fails. This is important to note, because anyone that knows my lover, KNOWS that there is one thing he would never do, and that’s knowingly fail. He will persevere tirelessly until there is no other outcome BUT success. He is a perfectionist with just as high of expectations of others.
But she seems to be exempt.
Which brings me to this: I’ve examined the reasons behind why I care and I am not sure I know the answer.
Am I jealous? No I don’t think so. I would never trade my life for hers because she has no children. The reasons why she has none are beyond her control and the result of betrayal by her own body. She can’t do what women were meant to do. For that reason, and the fact that she had an awful childhood that would fuck anyone up, she is allowed to hide behind a mask of ill manners and bitchy behavior and get a pass to do hurtful things to people trying to love her.
Now, here’s where she and I differ.
I’d go to the end of the motherfucking earth to be a mother. I’d adopt a child, and I’d do whatever it took to make that happen. If that meant getting my mental health under control, I’d bust my ass trying. But she didn’t do that. Instead she blames my lover for a baby born too soon because he wanted to have sex with her when she was pregnant. And she knows that as long as he carries that guilt, she can be a beast to him to alleviate her own sadness. It was easier for her to become an insufferable bitch than to fix her own issues.
If she had wanted a baby, my lover would have made it happen.  He’d have moved the proverbial mountain to make it happen.
He told me that he didn’t want children with her because she was not mentally stable enough to be a mother. So, at some point he made a choice to trade his own chance at having children for a lifetime of loving her.
That’s just about the biggest sacrifice one person can make for another. The only one higher is to give your life for that person.
All this has left me with a huge misunderstanding of what defines love. I don’t have an example in my own husband and my parents’ marriage seems like a fairy tale or a pipe dream.
What IS love? I have to think it comes in many forms, and that the skewed sacrifices my lover makes for his wife and me for my children’s happiness is nothing short of a slow suicide that we are inflicting on ourselves. A martyrdom.
What makes this even more complicated is that we are each other’s coping mechanism, my lover and I. We are the stitches that repair the other’s wounds.
Sooner or later, one of us is going to bleed to death, leaving the other knowing that without your lifeblood, there is no way to exist.
Until then, I will be the transfusion that keeps him going and I hope he will be mine.
This will surely work,like it always has.
Unless one of us taints the blood supply.

I heard my friend Brian express his wish to be a slave. Not just anyone’s slave, but the slave of an ungrateful, punishing female Domina.
He claimed it was just one of his kinks, but that MY role as a Dominant woman made ME a fetish.
It pissed me off because I don’t want to be somebody’s fetish. I want to be somebody’s queen.
I am about to speak for Dominant females everywhere because I’m pretty sure none of us consider ourselves a fetish. You can find those girls working the cam sites in cheap vinyl corsets, charging your credit card by the minute, but you won’t find me there because I am much more than a fetish.
I am real.
I cry and I bleed and I make mistakes. I am not afraid to be a fearless player in this game called life.
Inside this Dominant woman there lies a natural born nurturer. If you are hungry, I will feed you. If you are cold, I will warm you with my flesh. I will touch you with a love comparable to none and I will be fiercely loyal even though I will test your patience along the way. I will fix your hurt and love away your sadness. I will embed myself so far into your soul that when you are dying you will call out my name.
I’M not your fetish. Your willing servitude to me is your fetish. At least that’s how it starts out.
With a little time, you just might find yourself wishing you could feel my hands work their magic on your weary body at the end of each long day. You might find yourself waking up in the early morning hours wishing my butt was planted firmly into your groin so you could slip your penis inside me and fill me up with your jizz before you even have your coffee.
 
And if you’re not careful, you might find yourself buying me my favorite beer because you appreciate me ironing your work clothes. Maybe you’d even find it endearing to come home and find me lounging in your bathtub, or to wake up to me sitting on your face. 
 
Eventually, you might find yourself wishing I WAS just a fetish, so you could lock me away in your underwear drawer and only use me when your wife isn’t looking.
 
Instead you will forever be drawn to me, because in me you have found a sexual sanctuary, a place where you can show fear and weakness and surrender the burden of strength that all men are expected to maintain. 
 
I am your truth.
 
I love the real you, all of you, even the parts that you’re too ashamed or afraid to share with anyone else.
 
That doesn’t make me your fetish.
 
That makes me your salvation.

My deceased Aunt, who was my best friend and the wisest woman I know, once told me that it was best to be the girlfriend and NOT the wife.
I have to say she wasn’t entirely wrong, but I can’t say she was entirely right either.
There are perks.
I don’t have to live with an angry man that I may have said “no” to. I don’t have to pay for a lawyer if he cheats. I don’t have to clean his bathroom or keep our laundry done.
All I have to do is please him.
And when I do, I am rewarded. I am rewarded with care and attention and concessions that are more eagerly made. I am rewarded with physical pleasure, and specialty beer and foods. I am rewarded with the joy of being a part of his day to day life, hearing about work and projects and accomplishments.
Loving me isn’t free. It’s expensive, I am expensive, and we ALL know what happens to expensive hobbies…they are in constant danger of losing their appeal. To remain a priority, the reward has to be worth the financial sacrifice.
My lover often reminds me that I am high on his list and that the proof is in the sheer amount of time he invests in me. He speaks the truth, and I DO feel very much attended to. I am not neglected, in fact, I am exalted. As I said before, my lover does not fail often and he’s a wonderful partner…and as awful as this is going to sound, herein lies the problem.
He’s such a good partner that I WANT to do his laundry. He’s such a good partner that he makes me WANT to give back everything he gives me and more. He is my safe harbor. During Christmas I was as sick as I’ve been in a long time and my heart just longed for him. I felt so bad that I cried intermittently and my body hurt and I just wanted him to put his big warm hands on me and provide me with the comfort that only he can.
But my rational mind knew that wasn’t possible, on my part as well as his.
There was no comfort to be had from a man that was on vacation with his wife and that’s when it really finally hit me, after all these years. The biggest part of my life (after my children) wasn’t real to anyone but me,and if I were to die from blood poisoning tonight, I would never get to say goodbye.
After this many years, it FEELS like it should BE real to someone other than me and I struggle with my own feelings of worth.
I have no delusions. My lover told me gently to my face that we will never live together and he will not be getting a divorce. Nobody in his life knows I exist. That is a feeling that has no words to describe it. It isn’t pain. It isn’t anger. It’s disbelief and denial. I can’t not exist, for I am abundant and joyful about life. I can’t not exist, because it feels like he needs me. It feels as if I possess something that is vital to his existence, so surely that makes me valid.
Secrets are kept silent because of shame. You keep a secret because you are ashamed of what you’ve done and don’t want to be exposed.
For that reason,  I like to call myself a secret indulgence. A secret indulgence sounds like something you enjoy but don’t want other people to judge you for. The difference between the secret and the secret indulgence is that the indulgence usually only hurts the person indulging but the shameful secret hurts many.
Yes, it’s best to be an indulgence, like cheesecake or chocolate, an indulgence with depth and history. You never hear anyone say they regret eating cheesecake or chocolate. As a matter of fact, it usually leaves them wanting more.
I don’t want to be empty calories or something that you regret eating afterward.
I want to be savored.
Every.
Last.
Bite.

4,https://www.opendiary.com/m/kaleidoscope-eyes/a-soul-with-no-window-5578558/,2020-02-15,A soul with no window,"
I have had a female lover. 
She is the only one I’ve ever had, and I can’t foresee another, as hard as I might try.
She was a strange mix of tomboy and beautiful, and I loved every inch of her battered body. She worked alongside men all her life and her body bore the proof. She was a sexy badass with a killer smile.
It is because of her that I understand what a man means when he refers to a woman as a “crazy bitch”.
It is also because of her that I have felt the indescribable, sweet touch of a woman. And boobs. I never knew how much I would love someone else’s.
She was troubled when I met her, and I thought I could help. She grew to trust me enough to tell me her biggest regret, and my heart ached with the knowledge that she had never been the “receiver” in a relationship. I was crazy attracted to her and the feeling was mutual so I set about to change that.
She wanted me so badly, and we kissed for hours and then days and eventually weeks. When the night came that I had her hips dancing under my careful stroking, I made love to her.
It was hard to believe she had gone all 59 years of her life without ever having let herself be pleasured. This was directly related to childhood sexual abuse and untreated mental illness. It was directly related to her diagnosis of Borderline Personality Disorder. Not surprisingly, this is something I could never fix. At the heart of this disorder is instability in personal relationships, intense fear of abandonment and a “push/pull” cycle that consists of pushing your partner to their emotional limit and then luring them back in with charm, sex and finely honed manipulation tactics. Then,the whole thing starts all over again. They do this as a twisted test of loyalty and devotion. It’s all to soothe and bolster an ego or sense of self that they are missing.
As one can imagine, this does not make for a good extramarital affair partner.
It’s selfish of me to want a relationship that is not good for her. It’s selfish of me to miss the sex. Every time I think of her, I am painfully reminded that not everyone who says “I love you” means it and for some people, it’s just an expression of sexual pleasure.
It took me forever to convince her that engaging with me during sex would bring her great pleasure and I tried to set up an experiment, the same experiement that somebody else used to convince ME many years before.
I persuaded her to look into my eyes as she let me bring her to her first ever shared orgasm, and I thought that maybe at that moment, I might see something beautiful. Something I may never see again. Something some people never get to see. And I was ready for this. I don’t think I’ve ever wanted anything more than what was about to happen for her, for me.
That moment came and I had to hold her chin up, forcing her to meet my gaze. It was as if it was excruciating for her to experience true intimacy. I found out later that it WAS excruciating for her, as intimacy frightens someone with no ability to comprehend object permanence. For me, it was the ultimate feeling of power to be holding her pleasure literally at my fingertips.
I am not sure what I anticipated seeing in her eyes, but I never imagined it would be total disconnection. In her eyes was an emptiness that unnerved me in a way nothing has before.
Her eyes did not reflect sadness or anxiety. They did not reflect fear or anticipation. They did not reflect boredom or intolerance. They did not reflect desire.
But worst of all, her eyes did not reflect love.
So I am left with one question. How will she ever find a soul mate? To do so, she’d have to find someone willing to give her half of their soul to make up for the one she lost.
That someone ain’t me.
You’d have better luck getting one of my kidneys. I can live without that. But her dead eyes are proof enough for me.
You can’t LIVE without a soul.

5,https://www.opendiary.com/m/kaleidoscope-eyes/im-still-standing-21-5578566/,2020-02-15,I’m still standing,"
This entry will be in the same vein as the last.
I never prepared myself for lesbian sex. I didn’t read books. I didn’t ask a friend and I didn’t Google.
It came naturally and it progressed without any awkwardness at all. I’m not sure if that’s good or bad, but it’s the truth.
I often felt such overwhelming desire during foreplay that I’d have to go into the bathroom and wipe my vagina off so her hands did not slip around when she finally touched me. I was self conscious about it but it was a turn on for her.
It was an unhealthy relationship, yet still there are things I miss.
I miss how she worshipped my long hair and how she would lovingly pull it up into an imaginary ponytail and kiss my neck.I miss how she would rub it on her tummy as she neared orgasm. I miss her running her hands through it and I miss her murmuring under her breath that I was her beautiful mermaid.
I miss the way we fit together. I miss how my curvy parts filled in the spaces of her tall straight body. I miss the way her mouth felt on mine and I miss the smell of her skin and hair. I miss that she always wanted to make me happy with earthly pleasures like coffee and marijuana and cocktails made with whatever I wanted.
I miss her wanting to keep me comfortable all the time.
I miss the taste of her vagina, and the noises she made when I used my tongue and hands to make her climax.
I miss her reading me books in her “sexy” voice while I lounged in her arms. I miss how even though I weighed more, she was stronger and more sturdy than me and I could melt into her and comfortably let her hold me on her lap and in her arms.
I miss her laugh and I miss seeing her hold her own against the biggest and baddest of men. I miss the way her driving scared me because to her, “4 wheel drive” translated into drive wherever the fuck you want.
I miss how she wouldn’t let anyone disrespect me and I miss her giving me lessons in how to shoot pool. I miss how she thought men were looking at me, as if they were looking through the same rose colored glasses she was and found me too beautiful to resist.
I miss that she kept my favorite drinks in the mini frig in her room, so we didn’t have to interrupt our lovemaking to rehydrate.
I miss how she touched me with the confidence I have yet to see in a man, and how her hands knew exactly what to do and how to gracefully travel across my body,making sure to hit every pleasure spot on her rounds.
Now, for what I don’t miss.
I don’t miss her twisting my words, even when I complimented her, and making them ugly and barren of meaning. I don’t miss how everything was always my fault and how she believed I was out to hurt her at every turn when nothing was further from the truth.
I don’t miss the chaos or her alcohol dependency. I don’t miss the constant anger and sadness she felt or the way she took it out on me, when all I ever wanted to do was love her and make her feel good.
I don’t miss the accusations and the interrogations and the way my stomach would feel as she picked apart my words and spit them back at me from venomous lips, looking for the lie she was sure I had told.
I don’t miss the constant drama or how no matter which hill I climbed, it never seemed to satisfy her.
I don’t miss the mean words I didn’t deserve, or rather, the mean words I was forced to deflect because someone before me made the mistake of hurting her. I don’t miss paying the penance for someone else’s sin.
I don’t miss how she would then try to take the words back and expect me to forget she ever said them. I don’t miss her insistence that I didn’t love her because I wouldn’t commit my life to her and divorce my husband six months into our affair.
I don’t miss being ignored or dismissed, or having my boundaries breached time and time again until I just got too pissed off to even fight for an equally matched opponent.
I don’t miss the crazy bitch she turned into after midnight, the Frankenstein version of Cinderella. The creature that accused me of saying terrible things that I KNOW I never did so she could pretend to be my victim.
I don’t miss the exhausting torrent of words that came out of her mouth because she was afraid of peace and silence.
After reading all that, it seems the bad outweighed the good, but damnit, I still want to fuck her. The idea of finding another girlfriend has crossed my mind, but there is one thought that keeps me from acting on that desire.
What if there are women crazier than her out there??!
So…on second thought…
I’ll stick to men, the malleable gentle giants that you can have eating out of your hand if you play your cards right.
Cuz I get it, bitches ARE crazy, and she’s one of em.
That bitch is the first (and she will be the last) lover to ever have me down on my knees begging “baby please”.
Fuck you. I don’t beg.
And from now on, I’ll remain standing.

6,https://www.opendiary.com/m/kaleidoscope-eyes/i-hear-you-knocking-3-5578620/,2020-02-15,I hear you knocking,"
I’m going to be posting a lot of stored entries, so they will be in no particular order. This one is my latest.
I used to keep a diary on the old OD site and it had somewhere around 600 entries. It documented many years of my life and it was my only emotional outlet during a tumultuous time in my life.
I’m not sure at which point I told my lover about it or when I allowed him to begin reading it, but soon thereafter he was following it daily while I wrote my way through life.
When the OD site went down, I mourned the loss of my diary like you would an old friend and the thought of starting over was overwhelming
Now that I HAVE started over, my lover would like the same privilege he had with my original diary. He deserves to have it. He earned it, so to speak. He has always claimed that it helped him to understand me and it gave him insight into how to best love me. He swore over and over that he would never hold my private feelings against me, and he kept his word. Sometimes my entries would prompt an honest discussion that we may not have otherwise had. Overall, it was a positive thing and I wrote with fervor, knowing he was part of my audience.
This time around, I’m more afraid to let him see.
I’m afraid of how he may perceive my words. I’m afraid he will think I’m ungrateful or spoiled. I’m afraid he will feel like I take him for granted. I’m afraid he will find me boastful. I’m afraid he will think I don’t love him, respect him or believe in him. I’m afraid a fleeting thought that I type into this diary could potentially be our undoing.
But mostly, I’m afraid to be that vulnerable in the relationship. I’m afraid that all of me will be exposed, that I’ll become unlovable. This is more than worrying that your vagina is ugly or you have a zit somewhere unmentionable. This is more than omg I forgot to shave my butt crack. This is allowing someone to lift my skull flap and see my private thoughts. This is worse than x-ray vision or night goggles, this is total exposure.
After almost 13 years together with my lover, my affair, a lot has happened. I’ve grown a lot and I’m not the 40 year old woman I was when he met me. We’ve been through surgeries and separations and job losses. We have weathered a lot of storms and in the fashion of true love, time has only served to make our relationship stronger and our love deeper. That,I have come to realize, is what happens when two people maintain love for one another. They bend and make adjustments, both of them, because they want to see the other be happy.
Most times, it makes me sad that our relationship is an affair,but just as often I find myself so grateful to have found it that I will embrace it in any form.
Part of embracing it involves taking chances. Growth always does. I guess my biggest fear is that he will find me boring and quickly lose interest in my private thoughts. I think that might hurt me more than any potential argument my words could spark.
Part of me is amazed that he still wants to learn about me, and the other part of me knows that I am most certainly appealing and interesting to more than just him.
52 year old me has way fewer stars in her eyes. 52 year old me realizes now more than ever that it’s not about what you collect and amass throughout your life, it’s about how you live it. 52 year old me could be happy in a treehouse with a Keurig and some weed.
52 year old me won’t write to impress my lover, like 40 year old me did. 52 year old me is willing to defend what I write, or say fuck you if I don’t want to explain it.
52 year old me is still wrestling with being fully naked in front of said lover, but believe it or not, this makes me feel more exposed than that.
Ok Baby. I’ll let you in. Here’s the key to my thoughts. If I were you, I’d keep it on a chain around your neck so you don’t lose it.
Because by keeping it safe, you’ll always be guaranteed a place to go when you need shelter from the storm.

I keep hearing how nowadays, 50 is the new 30, but I don’t think I believe it. 
I am 52.
I don’t feel 30.
As a matter of fact, it has taken me ALL 52 of those years to finally recognize a pattern in my behavior, and to be able to predict with certainty the outcome of each and every bad decision I make. I am able to see how all those same coping mechanisms to help me fix what hurts emotionally are all part of a cycle, a cycle that lands me right back where I started.
In my attempt to feel better, I smoke too much pot. I eat too much and drink too much. I use sex like a drug, but for now I’ve traded that for laying next to my lover, trying to suck up as much physical affection as I can from him to help me make it till the next week.  I leave at the end of those visits knowing I will go without physical touch until I see him again, coupled with knowing I shouldn’t have to, and I don’t know which one hurts more.
I do all those things to fill the void in my heart and I even search out new ones to try, hoping I will find the one that enables me to live happily with a spouse I don’t love, one who imposed celibacy on me by both not addressing his impotence and his inability to get over his discomfort about discussing alternate ways of pleasuring me. When there was no orgasm in it for him, he lost all incentive to maintain interest in MY sexual well being.
By this point, the 15 years he spent as an alcoholic and me as a philanderer has heavily eroded the foundation of our marriage. His uptight attitude and downright refusal to talk about sex and intimacy really WAS the final nail in the big, ugly coffin.
Throughout the years, I have gravitated towards wounded people with the hope that I can heal them and they can heal me. I operate on the belief that all we really need is common  ground and love to make us ok.
But we need a lot more than love to be ok. We need strength and resilience and freedom and sunshine. We need music and money and hope and empathy and compassion.
Most of all we need great courage.
When I think about what things in life require great courage, I think of an epic battle or heroism in the form of a savior or a saint.
Maybe real courage is when there is nowhere left to run, but instead of accepting your fate to die a martyr, you decide to save your own damn life and say to hell with everyone else’s.
Maybe real courage is swimming away from the drowning people, the ones floundering in the water trying to pull you down as they frantically try to save themselves. Maybe that great act of courage is what pushes you to swim for your life, to not stop until you can float on your back and catch your breath.
This is what I think…I think the greatest act of courage is getting the balls to jump ship.
Once you hit the water, your natural born instinct, self preservation, kicks in and there is only one thing left to do.
Paddle like hell.

I was raised in the 70s.
People still hit their kids.
It was an accepted form of discipline, and the wave of hippies having kids didn’t want society to think they had loose morals, or worse, that they were a generation of hopeless war protesters raising degenerates.
So here we were, little kids in denim cut-off’s and long braided hair, being raised in the era of Peace and Love and getting our asses beat on the regular.
I was taught at a young age to behave properly, so it reflected favorably on my WAY too young parents. In hindsight this was no doubt done in an effort to prove WRONG their parent’s angry predictions that they would not survive the trials of marriage and parenthood. I think, at 16 and 18, my parents made a pact to succeed no matter what it took, and prove them all wrong.
This put a lot of pressure on them.
And me.
When I made a bad choice or operated on skewed free thinking, my dad would spank me. I remember being spanked with a belt once, for climbing into a deep hole in our yard, dug by the city’s municipal guys burying big pipes or something…that part is fuzzy. What is crystal clear is the fact that I heard my dad say “Don’t climb in that hole when I leave. You stay out of it, you hear?” And I know as sure as the sun is gonna come up tomorrow that I shook my head back and forth and said, “I won’t.”
When I saw his tail lights disappear around the corner at the end of the street, for reasons unbeknownst to even ME, I jumped down into the hole. The damp Earth made a hollow thud under my feet when I landed.
It was too deep to get back out. I sat there panicking, and trying to climb up the side, but the dirt just crumbled under my hands.
Before I had time to think of plan b, my dad’s PISSED off face was looming over the hole. He had thought twice about leaving me there unsupervised, and had looped around the block to come back and get me. Suddenly, being trapped down there didn’t seem so bad, in lieu of what was waiting at the top.
I got yanked out of the hole and promptly cracked on the ass with my dad’s belt. That’s another thing, not only could you smack your kid without retribution, you could do it in your own front yard.
After that episode, I tried hard to be good, and for the most part, I was. Still, there are scattered memories of painful slaps and twisted arms, and two instances stand out in my mind. They stand out as being grossly unfair and uncalled for because I was punished for things that were accidents. Kids being kids kinds of accidents. Broken glasses and pushing swings too hard are not punishable by smacking your kid so hard IN THE HEAD that they piss themselves and their ears ring.
And it wasn’t that my dad beat me on a consistent basis. He didn’t. He spanked me when I did something wrong as a child, like all parents did then.
Where he went off the rails was after I hit puberty and defied him by doing all the shit every other teenager does. I was no better or worse than any of my peers, but I was particularly stupid and I got caught at just about everything I did. I’m sure he was freaking out that he might lose total control of me, so he did what he thought he should do because that’s what his dad did to him.
He physically punished me in anger, then convinced me I deserved it because it would make me a better person. He told me IF he DIDN’T love me, he wouldn’t hit me. I know now that he said all those things because he felt guilty for hitting me.
16 year old me was afraid of losing my Dad’s love. 16 year old me also wished he didn’t love me, because then I would be allowed to make mistakes without paying such a huge emotional price.
At about 18, I figured out that all I had to do to maintain my dad’s favor was to obey. All I had to do was make the choices that wouldn’t reflect badly on my family, or bring him shame.
All this makes him sound like a monster, but he wasn’t a monster then and he’s not one now, either. He is a guy that is a product of his own upbringing and I swear to you his good made up for his bad. He was a great provider and he spent every dime on my brother and I and every spare minute either doing something for us or with us. He is an excellent grandfather and my kids adore him. They have seen his temper and his judgement of others, but they are exempt from his anger. He has never raised a hand to them.
I love my dad. I wouldn’t want any other. He is my everything and I revere him. He came into my room after every bad dream that made me yell for him. He kept me fed and safe and dry. I never longed for anything. My life was rich and full of privileges some people never had.
But in the back of my formative mind, he held the key to life and death, because he could physically hurt me. He became omnipotent.
His punishments left no scars upon my body.
They lie hidden on my heart.

I was angry with my lover today. 
I don’t remember yelling at him more than a handful of times in the course of our relationship, but maybe I have. Either way, we don’t generally argue so it feels particularly uncomfortable when we do.
I love him so much that the worst day with him in my life is better than the best day without him in my life, and there’s a general unease if we go to bed without loving thoughts about each other. My heart feels hurt and afraid if I raise my voice to him or upset him. My heart feels afraid that if I yell and cry, fuss or argue, he will find somewhere else to spend the money I cost and the time I consume.
But  today I was blindingly angry and even though this is an anonymous audience, I will keep private the reason why. That is best saved for a different entry, when I can introduce you to the kinky Dominatrix inside me. You will also meet her soul sister, the submissive that needs her own Dom to shelter her from the beautiful storm that can bring disaster in the game of life.
They say that when you are angry, you should make a list of all that is good about the person you love, and tuck it away someplace. After a week, take it out and read it, and bear in mind, the list is to remind you of why you love the person you have chosen as your lover.
If the list doesn’t remind you of why, then you should probably pack up your stuff and start kicking rocks down the road, cuz you’re with the wrong person.
I have decided to make a list about R.
I have to put the anger away to do the list justice, and to be fair.
In no particular order, this is my list:
My lover always makes time to talk to me. Always. Every day. He’s a man of his word and he never breaks his promises to me. He does what he says he’s gonna do and that’s my definition of integrity.
He spares no expense on me, and he works a job so he can not only see me, but see me in a manner most affair partners are probably not accustomed to. He gifts to me things that fill my senses like good food and marijuana and spirits. He gives me things I need, like phone chargers and money for gas if I forget my debit card.
He calls me on my way home, even if I just left him. He is PATIENT when I fight him…SO patient that I eventually wind down and realize MYSELF that I am being difficult.  He doesn’t hold a grudge though, he forgives as easily as he gives.
He hurt me once and we had honest but difficult conversations about it. He implemented and made changes to fix the things that I said were hurtful. He took to heart every word I said and put forth tremendous effort in ways I have not even touched on in this diary. The way he reacted and handled the crisis point that nearly ended our relationship firmly cemented my belief that he loves me and would cross an ocean to get to me. He didn’t just step up, he completed a task I asked of him that even the most brilliant of men couldn’t. He has won my heart not once, but twice and I could never imagine sharing the things we share with anyone but him.
When he gets me on my knees in front of him I am stripped naked, both my body and my mind. It is him that makes me vulnerable. It is him that treasures me and tells me I am beautiful and desirable. It is him that will do anything to my body sexually that I ask him for, and do it with enthusiasm.
He is gentle to me and he spoils me and as I see these words spill onto the screen before me, I feel selfish for being angry, even justifiably so, because he is selfless with his time, love, attention and emotional care when it comes to me.
I am suddenly aware that I could keep listing good  things about him for long enough to lose my reader’s interest.
And this is after 13 years. Lasting love in its own right. These things still hold true and he and I are both blessed to have found each other because it seems as if my life before he came along was spent looking for him.
I will cease to feel when he is gone and when he dies he will take me with him.
This man is still the love of my life.
I am no longer angry. I am instead longing for him to lay beside me and put his healing hands on me and take away my pain.
And I will take away his.
Anger is the enemy. You can invite it in but you can’t let it spend the night. It will rob you of your silver.
Anger will shorten your list.
And your life.

I found this old picture today when I was cleaning out a dresser. 
It’s my dad and me on Christmas morning and I am about six and a half years old. The baby is my brother and he’s now 47. My dad looks like a barefoot Tony Orlando and he is playing The “Peanuts” Lucy’s tea party game. It was a plastic game board and a teapot that you filled with real water.
I can remember it like it was yesterday but it was actually 1973 in small town Michigan and I’m still here at 52 years old. That house still stands. The stone terrace around it holds all my memories in place.
Yes that’s my dad and he’s 25 years old. My mom embroidered butterflies and flowers on the pockets of the bell bottom jeans he is wearing. I remember the bright silky colors and watching her separate the strands of thread.
I remember my baby brother’s “rubber pants” that went over his cloth diaper and the way his one piece pajamas had snaps on his butt so we could change him.
My grandma was still alive and we were surely going there soon because we did every Christmas day my entire life until she died. I probably packed my pajamas because staying overnight at Grandma’s beat playing with new Christmas toys that would be there when you got home and that says a lot about how much I loved her. I’d give up anything to be with her because I knew she loved me more than anyone else ever would or did. I was born to her determined 16 year old daughter, who moved out and lived in a tiny house, married in the tenth grade. It was her watchful eye making sure my Mom was all she needed to be.
And she was. She is. No, she’s MORE than she needs to be. I am petrified of a life without her. The only thing I’ve never told her is that I’m still having an affair years after she thought I’d stopped and I have steadfastly refused to reveal my lovers name to her. Those are the only two secrets between us.
Yes, that’s the same man that beat my ass, about to drink dirty water from a plastic tea cup, probably cursing my mom for not having told Santa to bring boxing gloves or a baseball mitt.
I remember sleeping in the bunk bed in my room with a cubby hole and hearing my young parents make love in their bedroom next door on the nights I couldn’t sleep.
In the backyard there was a small patch of grapes and the neighbor had made a square arbor. The grapevine twisted around and over top of the chicken wire, making a sheltered cave inside.
I would sit in there with my same sex friend and we would kiss like we saw our hippie parents doing.  Her Mom was divorced and “fast” and the way she kissed me in retrospect makes me wonder what the hell she was exposed to. But the kissing was innocent. Nobody caught us but If they had, I guarantee there would be no shame attached and we wouldn’t have been branded sex offenders.
Life was simpler. You could make money selling lemonade or nightcrawlers and everybody’s parents had a van with shag carpet that doubled as a clubhouse. My dad had a brand new midnight blue one and I remember how proud he was.
Inside there were schwanky lanterns on chains and deep pile carpet and Rhiannon was playing on the radio in Stevie’s raspy voice.
Soon after this picture was taken, we moved to the country to live in our forever home and everyone had to work harder and be gone longer to pay the price attached to it.
My parents were upwardly mobile in spite of Reaganomics and the collapse of the auto industry.
But I always loved the little house with the grapevine hideout and the pretty friend named Dawn with silky hair and soft lips and loving arms.
After she moved away, life just seemed to be harder and there was a hole in my heart. She was only 30 miles away but it seemed like a universe. I was allowed to visit her in the Co-op housing unit she and her mom had, but my sheltered mom didn’t like to leave me in the not so nice part of the capital city so the visits dwindled and then stopped. Soon after, she moved hours away and I wouldn’t see her for 25 years, until the introduction of the internet brought us together again.
I think the loss of her was harder on me than anyone knew.
In my 7 year old mind, she was the love of my life.
Years later, my first and only female lover is an older version of my little friend, and when I put my fingers in her hair it is the same texture that Dawn’s was so many years ago.
I remember crying and knowing my best friend was gone and we were helplessly apart by no doing of our own.
And I remember the smell of her skin when it rained. I remember her upturned nose and her giggle and the mischievous way she would whisper a plan and urge me to help her carry it out. Her eyes were blue and her hair was jet black and she wore fringe moccasins and she was beautiful.  I loved her so much that I went in front of her when I walked her back to her apartment at the end of my street, because she was afraid of the dark. It was my love for her that made me protect her even if it meant running those same two blocks home alone in the other direction. My heart was beating hard because I was every bit as afraid as she was, but I could fix it for her so it was worth the fear.
I never found anyone like her again.
Instead I found arms I’d never sleep in and cold eyes that accused me silently of crimes I had yet to commit.
I think my heart yearned for her until puberty dictated I forget her. My pretty Mommy told me it was ok and that I would have more friends like Dawn.
But I never have. I never did. It was an innocent lie to soothe my broken heart.
Instead, I had my life stolen by an ugly man that harbored secrets and kept score and assigned blame from atop his high horse.
Eventually, all horses, no matter how trained, no matter how high, throw their rider. It’s a show of Independence and to remind their rider that obedience doesn’t mean weakness.
Obedience is earned. You have to train with kindness or you will never get respect.
My husband is a cocky, showy rider, parading his ego around an empty arena. His only audience are the few he holds hostage, forced to be fans. I am the horse he will never break.
I appear to be obedient, for now.
But the day I rear up and toss him is coming…
And when I do, he’ll be off my back forever.

11,https://www.opendiary.com/m/kaleidoscope-eyes/breathless-78-5773527/,2020-03-30,Breathless,"
I think I am having what they call “complicated grief” over the death of my very special Aunt and best friend. 
Complicated grief is grief that doesn’t abate over time.
She wasn’t just my Aunt, she was my confidante. She made me feel safe and loved in a unique way nobody else did in my family.
She was always there for me, until she wasn’t. Losing her is so permanent and I can’t accept that she’s gone forever.
Every time I drive the three miles to town from my house out in the country, I struggle with intrusive thoughts about her death and subsequent absence. It’s always at the SAME point/place during my drive. I can be lost in a pleasant daydream and BAM it will hit me and I’m suddenly struck down by the pain of missing her.
She was always my example and the person that told me how strong I was and how I came rightfully by that via a great grandma that lost her husband at 40 and raised six kids on her own, long before food stamps were a thing and you had to rely on other people to help you. My Grandma was her oldest daughter,and she said that if it wasn’t for neighbors leaving food on their porch in the night while she and her mother and younger siblings slept they would have never survived. She said “if it weren’t for the neighbors we’d have starved to death” and that’s the exact way she said it.
My Aunt was the one who told me when to suck it up and she taught me how to hold onto my pride and protect my dignity.
Without her I feel weaker.
I saw her for the last time the day before she died. It frightened me how much her face had blown up with the steroids they were using to help her breathe as cancer took what was left of her. It hurt my heart so bad to see her but I couldn’t NOT see her. It was gut wrenching and I put on the fakest ass positive attitude and looked into her eyes and I lost all composure.
In her eyes there was something I had never seen before,even when frightening life circumstances warranted it.
In her eyes was fear.
She looked at me as if it were too difficult to even find the strength to speak and she said “come” and motioned for me to embrace her.
And then she said I love you.
But her eyes never changed, and when she had held my gaze just minutes before, her eyes told me she was afraid to die and leave everything she knew as life.
With her death, I got a glimpse of how it is going to feel when I am in her position and my own special niece is hugging me.
What’s just as bad is the idea that I will lose someone even more special to me like my child or my parents.
Or my lover.
If I lose my lover before I die, I don’t know if I will survive. The way I feel about losing my Aunt makes me worry that my mental health won’t be ok if I lose him.
I am scared that I will die from the pain.
I will have nobody to tell.
Nobody to cry to.
No family member that binds me to him, that I can hug or talk to as a tangible piece left behind.
No common friend to laugh with as we remember something funny about him.
Nothing.
It is the same for him, but he is 14 years older than me.
His wife lives in a different state where it is beautiful and he will eventually go and be with her to live out what’s left of his life. I will be a memory left behind like the house he will sell and the cottage he will forget.
He’s getting more tired and he’s lived and worked hard. He seems stressed lately and like he’s somewhere else in his mind and every time he leaves me after a visit I am petrified that he won’t come back, that an illness or something will steal him from me and I will never get that last Goodbye.
Because as awful as the memory of my Aunt saying goodbye to me is, to never have heard that last “I love you” would be even worse.
I guess anything that is devastating in life teaches us a lesson, and the lesson I learned the day I heard my Aunt say I love you is that grief is the price we pay for love.
Yes, grief is the price we pay for having experienced what is probably life’s greatest joy.
I wish we could pay the price with a currency other than misery and an ache in your throat that brings choking sobs.
Every time I kiss my lover Goodbye I have to fight the overwhelming urge to follow him home, so I can take care of his every need and make the rest of his life easier and better.
I want to follow him home in case he gets sick, so I never have to be separated from him and feel helpless while he needs care or suffers.
I’m painfully aware that I have set myself up to possibly experience every single awful emotion I just listed.
But I didn’t count on loving R the way I do when I first met him and wanted to have sex with someone that made me feel beautiful and smart. I thought I could control every feeling and he would only be for fun, like an escape.
13 years later he’s the air I breathe and I am petrified…aware that when he goes he will be taking me with him, because I can only hold my breath for sixty seconds.
That’s 60 seconds to contemplate my fate.
After that, it’s all over.
And everything goes black.

12,https://www.opendiary.com/m/kaleidoscope-eyes/tainted-love-32-5814614/,2020-04-19,Tainted Love,"
My lover and I have logged a million hours on the phone over the course of the last 13 years. I think a big reason for the success of our relationship is because no topic is off limits. We have always had an amazing bond that was fostered through communication. 
And I damaged it.
I was feeling jealous, when in fact I should be more secure in his love than I ever have been before.
He was stressed and needed an ear and instead of providing that, I was selfish and spoiled and mean, and I snapped at him and said I didn’t want to hear him talk about his wife anymore.
I did damage because I invalidated his pain and put my own above it and as soon as the words came out of my mouth, I KNEW they had done damage. His voice sounded wounded…like his puppy had turned feral and bit him.
I effectively dismissed his pain while doing the same thing to him that I said he was doing to me, and continuing to complain about MY spouse. I DON’T love my spouse and for him, I do the bare minimum, which is hardly enough for him to even tolerate me. I try hard NOT to please him and I suffer the animosity hoping that it will prove to be too much for him and he will have to divorce me
What my lover doesn’t know is the anguish that lives in my heart because of what his wife does to him, and how she makes him feel. It didn’t occur to me that I was adding to the anguish by effectively barring him from finding solace in me by venting about her.
Her words are venomous and the contempt is not veiled. She wants to chew him up and spit him back out and emasculate him for some perceived wrong he’s done to cause her distress.
Maybe he DID do something wrong.
But it isn’t what SHE said he did.
This next sentence is almost too painful for me to compose. The pain isn’t for me, but for my lover.
He and his wife had a baby in the beginning of their marriage and she was not born a healthy baby. My lover had to make a horrible, awful, gut wrenching decision that changed him and the course of his life forever. He had to make a choice that is every parent’s worst nightmare and out of compassion for him, I cannot even bring myself to divulge it. It’s just too horrible to imagine, the stuff he told me, and he wept when he choked out the words. I felt the depth of his suffering, and for days I felt sick inside when I remembered his eyes as he relayed his story.
Their baby girl didn’t get to see her first birthday.
My lover had to stand in a room and lean over his dying child, unable to comfort her without inflicting pain upon her tiny, sick body. It takes a special kind of ugly to do what his beast of a wife did next…
She blamed HIM for the death of that infant.
Let that sink in before you read this next part.
My lover wanted to have sex with her, his pregnant wife, and she callously hurled the accusation that their lovemaking resulted in her premature labor and the eventual death of their child.
Not only is that complete nonsense, but it has to be the most cruel, heartless thing one could inflict on an already grieving father.  No, let me rephrase that…it’s the most cruel thing to inflict on ANYBODY.
But your own husband? That you promised to honor and cherish just months before?
How could she accuse him of killing his own child?  Who. Does. That?
With that despicable act, she bought herself a hefty emotional insurance policy. She now had him feeling responsible for the biggest tragedy of her life.
And she no longer wanted sex. She was punishing him by withdrawing her love and affection.
He loved her, and he has spent the remainder of their marriage putting up with an attitude that would make most people slap the shit out of her.
I’ve personally heard voicemails where she has threatened suicide, to end an argument or to avoid conflict,  and I could hear her casually smoking a cigarette as she mentally tortured him.
She is perpetually angry and defensive and she keeps him in a constant state of trying but never quite reaching the goal to make her happy. But he has to know she will never be happy. She will die complaining.
She has embarrassed him in front of his family and has had to write apology letters! She was punched in the face by her niece, who was defending her own mother from her aunt. That’s some Jerry Springer level shit…but I’M the skank?
I told my lover I didn’t want to hear him talk about her anymore because at the time, he was defending her three day stint of wretched behavior by claiming she was having a particularly stressful month, moving to her own VACATION home while he stayed here to work full time and clean the home they’ve shared for 20+ years while she gets a tan. Yes, that was sarcasm.
He is a martyr for her poison love, while I long for every stolen hour I can get. I am grateful to get what he gives me and he gives to me everything he can and some things he shouldn’t and my hatred for her colors my gratitude in ways that I should not let it.
I snapped at him and lashed out because in my head, I was screaming “Give UP! Stop loving her so much that you’re willing to sacrifice your own life to make her happy! Because it kills me to see you try and try and try and lament to the very woman who would give up everything to love you. To hear you try and fail and hurt about it just reminds me that you love her deeply.
I’d give anything to be in her shoes, to have you every day and to wake up next to you, even though you said we would “probably fight” and I don’t know how that would be even remotely possible with the amount of love we show each other…
She has tainted your love towards every woman, not just her.
So that’s the emotions behind those ugly words and I know that doesn’t make them any less hurtful.
On the playground the children chant…”sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me.”
But that couldn’t be further from the truth. Sticks and stones may indeed break your bones,but words will ALWAYS hurt you.
Most people, if given a choice between the two, would opt for a broken arm or leg over a broken heart.
You don’t die from a broken heart.
You only wish you did.

Quarantine: in general, a quarantine is “a strict isolation imposed to prevent the spread of disease.” 
In the case of two long distance lovers,it does the opposite…the longer you go without your lover, the more sick you become.
Being separated for two weeks from my lover made me feel like I was dying. His wife is coming home for the summer and our new normal is about to come to a screeching halt.
We’ve been apart for long periods of time before. Once we went an entire year without seeing each other because he lost his job and his wife retired.
After the initial shock of him losing his job wore off, everything was uncertain and our routine changed. I expected that.
What I didn’t expect is that I would go an entire year without seeing the person I was convinced I could not live without.
Initially, he just stopped coming to me, and the calls dropped down to twice a week. Not too long after that he abandoned the idea of us almost completely.
In his defense, I think he was shell shocked and depressed. And I think I was a casualty, but I still won’t ever really know. All I do know is that he found another lover besides me, because he accidentally sent me a text he meant for her. It made my stomach sink, because it looked a lot like the texts he sent to me in the beginning, when he was trying to cultivate a special relationship.
I was replaceable.
To say I was devastated isn’t enough. It does not scratch the surface of the pain I felt. This was a man that made me feel love for the first time when I was 40 years old. I had never had a love like him and he was my savior. He treated me like a China doll and lavished time and attention on me from day one, and it never wavered for the next 7 years, until the very day he lost that job.
I depended on him for everything, emotionally.
And then he was gone.
I felt as if he no longer loved me. I had no ground underneath me.
I never knew exactly why and I still get a horrible panicked feeling,remembering how alone and sick I felt in his absence and wondering how I was going to ever feel ok again.
I was self destructing and needed a cause. I found one in the form of a friendship that grew to be one of the most meaningful, albeit difficult relationships of my life. We were two very complex individuals with our own sets of problems and flaws and having him in my life taught me tolerance and sacrifice and it taught me the meaning of altruistic love.
That friend was a dying alcoholic,and he was my emotional lover when I was going through this dark time. We came together in a desperate attempt to feel good. We saved each other’s lives.
We never shared more than kissing. We were never fully naked together. Our love and devotion to each other was unconditional, if not unconventional, and I took a lot of heat from family and friends wondering and watching and waiting to see if this was a cover for an inappropriate relationship. Maybe in my heart, it started out that way, but it quickly turned to a platonic union built on trust and faith and nurtured for the next six years. He had my back and I had his.
Unfortunately, I realized pretty early on that my dear friend was unhealthy and that no matter how much I cared for him, he was not an answer to my broken heart, nor did his presence even begin to fill the hole losing my lover had left.
I was not innocent in all of this. I had turned to someone else first, even if it was non sexual, and I had done so with the idea that it would become romantic.
I worked next door to a bar and I didn’t go home on a regular basis for two weeks after I got the text that was not meant for me. I drank after work and slept in my barber chair so I didn’t have to process my emotional loss or feel the sting of betrayal.
I kept on partying and I blocked my lover from my phone. I refused to answer his calls or his texts. There were so many I lost count. I had an indignant anger burning in what was left of my heart and I was wounded and reckless.
I struggled to keep my shit together and he refused to let up. He continued relentlessly to try to reach me, and when he realized he wasn’t going to be allowed a platform to speak, he showed up at the door to my barbershop.
I expected a plea or a heartfelt apology.
What I got instead made me understand the old adage “the truth hurts”, because that is the day my lover looked me in the eye and killed any remaining dream I may have had left about him and I ever being together legitimately.
I still don’t know why he did this, because it wasn’t conducive to winning my heart back, but he told me the truth that I guess he needed to tell me for reasons known only to him.
The truth he told me was that he would never leave his wife and that he would never be with me, and he paused before he said we would never live together, so that I would fully absorb the words.
I’ll always wonder why he drove all that way to tell me things that would only serve to hurt me more. He didn’t say them with malice in his voice. He didn’t ask me to come back or to talk to him again. I think he just wanted to assuage his own guilt for maybe allowing me to dream about those things happening, when he knew all along they weren’t going to.
His truth ignited a stark realization. Now he had someone else, but here he was with his head in my lap, refusing to walk away, and showing reverence at my feet.
Today we are in a different place. He has worked hard to win back my favor and I mean HARD. It has taken several years, but I am more in love with him now than I have ever been and he has earned that. He never gave up, even when other people would have and this remains true for everything he does in regards to me.
He worships me. Sometimes I wonder why he thinks I’m worth so much effort but I try not to wonder for long and just enjoy him instead.
The hard part about loving him like this is that I fear I will lose him again. I just don’t know when.
I would say I feel like I am walking on eggshells, but that would be a lie.
I feel like I’m walking through a field of landmines.
Soon, one may take me by surprise and blow my leg off and if I don’t bleed to death, I’ll have to find a way to go through life without it.
I will forever lose my balance.
But I will find a way to keep standing.

The truth my lover told me, it hurt very much to hear.
I cried.
He cried.
He reminded me that I, too, was married so it was not fair to be angry at him for staying.
He did not understand then and he doesn’t understand now, that the reason for my anger is because he loves his wife on a different level than he does me, and it’s a level that feels like he appoints her more worth than me.
And he should. She’s his wife.
This is a direct juxtaposition of his actions though, as he devotes most (if not all) his quality time to me. He tirelessly woos me and spoils me. I am lavished with time and attention and effort. He drives two hours each weekend to see me and I was recently given a monthly tally of what it costs to keep me and I amount to a house payment or a kick ass car. He’s always there when I want him and in her absence I have stolen her throne.
AND her King.
But there is another reason for my anger. It’s disguising the hurt I feel when I witness his genuine love for her. He says it is to keep her happy so he doesn’t have to suffer because of her unhappiness. But if he didn’t love her, he wouldn’t care if she was happy, and he suffers anyway because she IS never happy despite his heartfelt efforts.
I need to go back to Affairs 101 and find my place, but he’s made that impossible because he exalts me!
From the day I met him, he cautioned me to never leave my marriage for him or anyone else, and that I could not expect the same from him for doing so.
The understanding from day one was also that we would be staying married to our respective spouses. I have always known the truth deep down because he told me that more than once. It was just hard not to hope and I have grown to love him so deeply since he made those declarations.
Two years into our affair I did leave my marriage. I was in my own apartment for a year. I left my husband then for the same reasons I want to leave him in the near future.
I’ve stayed ten years since the last time I left and I’ve been here so long that nobody believes in me anymore.
They think I’m weak.
Or afraid.
I am a little afraid. But I’m definitely not weak.
Ever since I admitted to wanting to silence my lover and keep him from speaking about his wife, I’ve been defending my callousness by explaining where the disdain comes from and why I don’t like her. I’m almost done.
He says she has accused him of masturbating in bed, has elbowed him in the chest for touching her in what she perceived as an attempt to seduce her, denied him affection and berated him for having a harmless urge to playfully spank her butt during sexy time.
She routinely accuses him of having a girlfriend on the side or from what I just learned yesterday, prostitutes!
This is horrifying for a few reasons, one of which is the insinuation that this talented and brilliant man she married is worth so little that nobody would willingly want to have sex with him. The other insinuation is that she’s so above him that he should take whatever abuse or punishment she dishes out AND go without sex, but still want to take care of her. In her mind, a prostitute would make her the martyr and him the devil.
It’s a double insult, aimed at both him AND me.
Is she fucking serious? And how can she even BE attractive to him after that kind of accusation? She is haughty and I am beginning to think she has eroded his self esteem to the point he believes what she says about him. She emasculates him and he still bends over backwards to please her, as if his masochistic heart truly needs a punishing female to give him purpose and self worth. To keep him hanging on, trying to live up to her expectations, is something only a cruel and ugly Mistress would do.
Just how unlikeable she truly is astounds me.
She scrutinizes everything my lover does and insults him to feed her overblown ego.
He has said many times that he is financially tied to her. I think her income combined with his has afforded them a lifestyle that they are accustomed to and comfortable with. She helps make the nice things possible. Together they have the things that they want or value. It means a lot to them.
I have nothing to offer like that. I have nothing but earthly things to offer.
But earthly things aren’t worth much. In a real relationship, you gotta have something to bring to the table, as they say. You need more than loving hands and a willing heart. That kind of currency can’t buy you the finer things or help keep you warm.
It seems like my life thus far has been a series of events, failures and successes, all of which have given me insight into myself…each and every one.
I am always growing. Getting more and more comfortable in my skin. Cementing beliefs and daring to adopt new ones.
I am accepting who I am.
After I’m gone, I won’t be the stuff of any flashy memories. I won’t be remembered for anything remarkable, but I’ll be remembered instead for driving my kids to the quarter car wash in their bathing suits on a ninety degree day and hosing them down.
Or maybe it will be as simple as “Her chocolate frosting kicked ass.”
And the moral of this entry is, that I’m ok with either of those things.

There’s always the Judgy McJudgerson keyboard warrior.  
The one that wants to shame you for your sin against your spouse, as if the spouse deserves MORE than someone they can manipulate, abuse and control.
And I can’t speak for anyone else, but my spouse does not want a divorce.
I have not only asked for one several times, but I’ve left him once and kicked him out once. At one point, he asked for a divorce as a scare tactic or an ultimatum.
I agreed.
He was bluffing.
He quickly dismissed any further discussion and acted as if it never happened.
Before you mistakenly jump to the conclusion that his ambivalence is because he loves me, he has amassed a large amount of money (that I helped him earn), and he doesn’t want to share it with me. He will lose all control over his most important thing should he divorce me…his money. She is his lover.
He doesn’t need what I need.
He decided he would rather be celibate than have open communication about the sexual needs of his wife. He is avoidant even when it cost him something huge, and he’s distant at best.
He knows FULL well where I’m going on the weekends overnight, and listen closely…he doesn’t want to acknowledge it. He doesn’t want or need sex or he would want a divorce. The whole sex thing has always been a problem, as we had what they call a “desire discrepancy.”
For the layman: he didnt want to fuck as much or as often as I did. Suck it up and bang her, guys, or this is what happens.
My spouse CHOOSES this over divorce. He’s no fool. He’s aware of what is happening and he plays the “ignorance is bliss” card.
His alcoholism has made my children deem me responsible for taking care of him and they have convinced themselves that if I leave, it will threaten his sobriety. I don’t want to disrupt my last kid still at home, in high school. I will wait patiently, or impatiently, until she goes to college and at that point I will take back what’s left of my life. Which isn’t much…and my biggest regret is not having left sooner.
My husband has many good qualities and we do not live acrimoniously full time or even part time. His youngest daughter cried when he came home from a four day trip to drive his parents somewhere recently, and they weren’t tears of happiness. This makes me sad, not triumphant. I want my daughter to feel secure in his love, but I never did and she may not either. He needs to learn to touch and nurture and yes, I tried to teach him how.
What I’m employing as a solution is not moral in anyone’s eyes…not even mine, but until you walk in someone else’s shoes you should reserve judgement.
And don’t tell me about what HE deserves. What about what I deserve, or rather, deserved?
Yup. The guilt ship sailed a long time ago. I didn’t hustle on board and I missed it.
That’s ok, I prefer a train wreck over capsizing and going down at sea.
So unless you’re coming for me in a rescue dinghy, spare me your bullshit.
The train will eventually slow down enough that I can jump out of the freight car on my own.
Watch me stick the landing.

My lover’s wife wants to come home.
She lives several states away from ours during the winter months. Last winter was her first attempt at being there alone, which she wanted to do, despite the fact that Lover cannot yet retire. She made it through the season, and was satisfied enough with his visiting schedule to stay put, much to my surprise.
But the grass is turning green and the lakes are warming up and our state is a paradise when the snow finally melts. This is home. Vacation is just that…vacation. It isn’t permanent, and I knew it would eventually come to an end.
I guess I forgot my place along the way. I got comfortable in a “normal” long distance relationship with her husband. We spoke every day and I lived for the end of the week, which would culminate in an overnight visit in a lovely hotel with a big luxurious bed and a Jacuzzi bath.
For the first time in 13 years, I had him almost all to myself.
And he treated me in the grandest fashion imaginable, for not having a shared space to call our own. This time, the scale was tipped in my favor and I logged more face time with him than her.
For a minute, she got a tiny taste of what it feels like to be me (minus vacation home), and I got a tiny taste of what it feels like to be her. She deserves to live a good life. She earned her retirement.
Now, the ball is back in her court, but the game has been delayed and she’s not happy. She’s been without him long enough, and she wants her man back.
This pandemic is making her paranoid and justifiably so. She’s afraid she will get trapped in her current paradise and not be able to get back to the home she left in shambles and the husband she seems to despise. A dark cloud of discontent follows her everywhere she goes.
I’m about to get to the meat of the entry, but I’m taking the long way there.
This woman has a host of emotional problems and some are rooted in childhood sexual abuse and the suicide of a parent. She is neurotic, anxious and mean. She is demanding and angry and combative. She is insulting and disrespectful and assigns blame.
She is also broken and scared.
I know this because I have witnessed the fall out from her behavior over the past decade. I have heard her ugly words and I have seen the pain she has inflicted. I had never heard the word “Parasuicidal” before it came from my lover’s lips.
He was agitated today and admitted to me that his wife was having a hard time with her “nerves” and then he sent me one of the most shocking photos I have ever seen. It was her fingers, or what was left of them.
All around her brittle fingernails were bloody wounds, old scabs and torn skin. The tips and areas around her cuticles looked like someone had rubbed a cheese grater over them. They were open and angry and raw. It made my stomach turn thinking about how she must have obsessively macerated her tender skin with her own teeth. It truly made me feel ill.
And then I felt something else.
I felt compassion…or maybe it was pity.
When questioned, my lover told me that she sent the picture because HE was “dragging his feet” about flying to their retirement home to get her and therefore he was the direct cause of her anguish. She sent the picture for shock value, to provide proof of her distress and to make sure he knew he was at least partially responsible for it.
He HAS been dragging his feet about going to get her and driving her back home, and she even so much as caught him canceling his flight to reschedule and postpone his departure date. Instead of examining why her husband was dreading her impending homecoming, she scolded and degraded him, dismissing him with a flippant insult of how his half-hearted attempts meant “nothing” to her anyways so he should stay home.
My pity and compassion then turned to disgust. To wound herself and call another person responsible for it is clearly a modus operandi that she’s used many times before.
I would never want to hold someone emotionally hostage when I knew in my heart they didn’t want to be with me.
I guess I feel compelled to ask her why she does.
Where is the comfort in that? What do you gain from guilting him? Does it make you feel loved to know that he will do anything to please you even though you make him miserable? Does that give you a feeling of worth, to make your childhood pain HIS burden and to watch him struggle to try to heal your wounds?  Or is it a tactic you use to encourage him to stay with you, because your ego can’t handle the fact that he doesn’t want to be around you?
You were fine on your own when it meant you were on the beach while he shoveled snow and did the unfinished tasks you left behind in pursuit of your tropical paradise. You were content to be without him while he readied a new condo for you to live in, but only AFTER hoeing out the house you filled with worthless garbage to feed the selfish beast in your pissed off soul.
You want HIM to pay for every fucked up thing that ever happened to you and make you all better, at the expense of HIS LIFE.
Now you’ve thrust upon him a horror show worthy photo of your bloody finger stumps and he actually defended you and said he had “put you off for three weeks” and that his actions had caused you undue stress.
You are very good at your craft, you vicious little witch.
I am left to wonder what her response would be to the questions I posed.
I struggle to find anything likable about her even when she has compassion and pity on her side.
Where is her dignity and pride?
Better yet, where is mine? Where is MY dignity and pride, which would allow me to walk away from my OWN train wreck of a marriage and stop writing about hers?
I am grateful to look down and see my own fingers, which may not be feminine or beautiful, but they are appendages of my heart and a conductor of the love I feel inside for others. I touch those I love with them and I convey those feelings through each and every finger tip. Mangling my own fingers would render me incapable of achieving any emotional gratification.
I guess that’s why it disturbed me so much, because I cannot fathom why anyone would do that.
There is an old proverb that reads “God has given us two hands, one to receive with and the other to give with.”
She may as well be dead.
Because now she can do neither.

17,https://www.opendiary.com/m/kaleidoscope-eyes/silence-is-golden-48-5833923/,2020-05-07,Silence is golden,"
My lover has been gone.
He left to get his wife from her vacation home and they will drive back together at the end of the week.
Normally, he seems to enjoy the activities they do together and that’s enough to make his visit pleasant. This time, however, nothing is open for tourist business and in the wake of Covid, they cannot even dine out, which I think is one of the few things they both enjoy doing as a couple.
I usually don’t hear much from him when he’s there, but this time has been different.
This time, he appears to be miserable.
She is unhappy with him, accusatory about his motives for not coming sooner and just recently, down right abusive.
She has been calling him names.
Yes, like on the playground in the schoolyard. She has slung several hurtful insults at him, including calling him an “elitist.”
I had to look it up to make sure I was correct about the meaning behind the word, because I thought it meant snobby and arrogant and or influential and powerful.
It does mean all those things but it also means that you are smarter than most everyone else, and that you feel self entitled to be in a position of authority over others because of that…a smart “good old boys” club that runs a big corporate ship, if you will.
This could not be further from the truth.
In all the years that I’ve known my lover, I’ve seen him serve people less fortunate than himself and fight to get them the things they need. Not things like a loaf of bread or a pair of pants, we’re talking homes and repairs to homes and the very things that sustain life, such as water and heat and shelter and clean air and safe paint.
He’s worked as an advocate for senior citizens and he’s been to national disaster areas as a government liaison to get the homeless what little housing aid or monetary aid they qualify for.
He has revitalized whole neighborhoods and I mean hands on, not from the sidelines. He’s always worked two and sometimes three jobs. Most importantly,  he’s a humble man.
His wife’s name calling didn’t just give me pause, it pissed me off, to the point of my body physically shaking.
She called him every ugly thing that her OWN damaged spirit embodies. SHE is the haughty, arrogant, holier than thou bitch, perched atop her high horse. SHE fancies herself smarter than the average bear and she tries like hell to come off that way by using uncommon words like “conversely” and “elitist” and a whole slew of others that she probably took the time to learn just so she can appear more educated than her imaginary opponent.
She’s not superior and she’s not fooling me. I’m not eating her bullshit sandwich.
Her family owned a men’s clothing store back in the day and it was successful, so in her mind, this grants her impeccable taste that reigns supreme over anyone else’s. She spends money on clothing and other stuff to a hoarding degree. She dresses my lover like he’s her own personal property and he appears to enjoy that. Rather than resent her being controlling, I think he views it as one of few acts of love and he’s grateful to get that tiny, pathetic bit. That speaks volumes about the character of the same man she wants to tear down.
She worked for a paper factory.
Even if she was in upper management, or had a good salary, it wasn’t anything that now gives her the right to be the red haired, pig tailed playground bully.
Again, I am left to ask why. He’s told me the reasons behind why he stays with her and they are reasons that I cannot judge or question for they are HIS reasons and only he really knows why.
Their latest argument was because my lover told her she couldn’t take up both handicap parking spaces in the lot at her apartment complex. She had literally straddled the two spaces and half of her vehicle was in the loading and unloading zone for a power chair and lift.
Instead of just admitting that she may be in the wrong, she fought for justification, saying “nobody uses the spots anyways” Um…maybe cuz you’re parked IN them, you crazy ass bitch.
Yup, she can park wherever her able bodied ass feels like, because she deserves to do whatever the fuck she wants. Screw all you dicks who have the misfortune of being crippled, find your OWN damn spot.
And I’d like to say she’s only ugly on the inside but I can’t, cuz the outside matches. She looks like a dusty old bag of wrinkles with abnormally large teeth, who just sucked the juice from an entire bag of lemons. She looks like she could be a man in drag. And, this is coming from an admitted short, fat, German girl with childbearing hips and saggy boobs.
My dad always said that beauty is skin deep, but ugly goes clear to the bone. I’ve never had to question that adage and I certainly see where it is true in this situation.
I closed my eyes and tried to imagine what her harsh, battered, sour face would look like if she WAS beautiful on the inside. Maybe the corners of her mouth would lift up a little and maybe her hollow cheeks would become round and smooth and feminine.
Maybe the painful looking lines would go away around her eyes if she stopped scowling her way through life.
Or maybe they would shine a little brighter if she stopped to appreciate that someone loves her unconditionally, despite her cruel treatment.
Maybe if she forgave my lover for everything he ever did that hurt her, she’d be grateful for his love, because his undying commitment has to be worth something.
But then again, if it hasn’t been worth anything for 25 years, it probably never will be.
My Grandmother would settle a fight between cousins and say “taste your words before you spit them out!”
My lover’s wife tastes every horribly bitter word that passes across her forked tongue, but she is not deterred.
She loves to open her mouth wide and let the destructive words come tumbling out.
I wish she’d choke to death on them instead.

With the quarantine, I’ve watched more television and YouTube than ever before and I’m particularly drawn to true crime documentaries and the like.
Tonight, I was tuned in to a story that involved the murder of a gay man by his married police officer lover. He was about to “out” the cop to the chief of police in his small town and forever tarnish his reputation and ruin his relationship with his wife.
During the trial, the officer’s testimony was that he was “engaged in sexual behavior that he was embarrassed of and didn’t want his colleagues or wife to know about.”
So he killed the lover that threatened to change his reality. He killed the fantasy lover to keep the real lover. He killed the one that mattered the least. He killed the one he was ashamed of.
After that show, another abruptly followed. THIS story was eerily similar, with different details and a new cast of characters. This time, a pastor had a love affair with a woman parishioner he and his wife had taken into their home. The parishioner was down on her luck and had a newborn child of unknown parentage, so they did the Godly thing.
The minister and his wife housed the woman parishioner and her infant, and all the while the woman carried a terrible secret. You guessed it,the baby was the pastor’s child.
When the woman threatened to disclose the damaging truth, the pastor, who’s life was dependent on leading by moral example, heard this and his solution was to kill her.
He made her “disappear”, leaving her infant behind for him and his wife to raise.
This was a PASTOR driven to kill, not just an average Joe.
It made me remember how years before, my husband had caught me seeing my lover, after he had revoked his permission and his agreement to an open marriage. He was furious, and he told me that he had called my lover’s place of employment and told them that their star employee was, and I quote,”fucking HIS wife.”
I was mortified.
I left the house in a panic and called my lover to warn him about what my husband claimed to have done, with the hope that he could somehow stave it off or prevent it from ever happening in the first place. I was thinking that maybe my husband was bluff charging me with his admission, like a wounded, pissed off buffalo with a hunter’s arrow in its heart.
But it was too late. My scorned husband had stooped to an awful, reptilian level. He had not only outed my lover as a philanderer but had referred to him “Your Gay Contractor” in an attempt to smear his character  and embarrass him among his colleagues.
My sneaky husband had checked my (equally sneaky) online internet activity, and he hit the jackpot when he found my original open diary. He read every entry in secrecy for three months. I was oblivious and continued to pour out my deepest thoughts, while he got a window seat that allowed him to peek into my soul.
One of the things my husband learned from his grievous invasion of my privacy was that my lover and I had participated in a threesome with another man. He used that knowledge to slander him, as retribution for my infidelity, knowing that hurting my lover was the best way to hurt me.
In the midst of this panic, my lover was strangely calm.
I was frantic and expressed my worry that my husband would call his wife next, and the exact words that came out of my lover’s mouth were “If he does that, I will kill him. And yes, I’m serious.”
But I didn’t need him to tell me he was serious.
I had heard it loud and clear in the tone of his voice and it sent a chill down my spine because I was entirely sure he was speaking the truth…he would rather take a life than hurt his wife with the discovery of an affair. He intimated that it would be a self defense mechanism on his part, to protect her. From that day on, I’ve had a little fear buried deep in my heart with my lover’s name on it.
As I sat there watching the crime shows on television, I let my mind ponder a terrible question.
If for some reason my lover felt his marriage was threatened because of me, would he kill me to save his wife from the knowledge of my existence? Nobody in his circle knows I exist and they all think he’s devoted to his difficult wife. He’s her Saint. They would stand behind him and fight for his reputation.
Who would fight for me? Surely my Mom would go to the end of the earth, along with my dad and daughters, but it would be my best friend that led them to me, because she knows my secret. My best friend has my lover’s phone number tucked away because I have designated her the bearer of bad news should I meet my demise unexpectedly.
He has delegated no such person. In 13 years…
Part of the reason I struggled with our relationship and with intimacy is because of that hurtful truth.
I have come to accept it as the price of his love.
But as awful as it is, I really DID wonder if he could kill me to save himself and even worse, I wondered how he would do it.
He wouldn’t shoot me, as that would make too much noise in a hotel and he wouldn’t take me out in the boonies to do it, as he would know I’m a flight risk. He knows I’d run like a mother fucker and I’m comfortable in the woods.
He couldn’t beat me to death because I don’t think he could watch me suffer and he could not stab me for the same reason. That also takes strangulation off the table, and he surely knows better than anyone else how hard I would fight to survive.
I think he would have to passively kill me in order to go through with it.
That leaves only one of two things, drugs or poison, and I finally concurred that he would poison me, and when I was dying he would probably cover my face with a towel so he did not have to meet my eyes as he watched the life leave my body.
Then, common sense kicked in and I told myself I was being ridiculous. My lover is one of the kindest, most sensitive people I know.
But so is my Pastor.
Just because someone loves you doesn’t mean they don’t love someone else more.
I can’t imagine a more horrible final moment than seeing the person you love the most looming over you as you take your final breath, and knowing that all along, you were disposable.
I guess the plus side of all that is that I’d never see it coming. I’d be oblivious to my fate for all but maybe the last five minutes of my life.
I don’t know. Loving him has been my salvation so that almost seems like a small price to pay for it.
13 years of joy in exchange for five minutes of the ultimate betrayal?
Yes, I’d give that.
I’m gonna die eventually anyways.
I will go to sleep tonight assured in my heart and head that the lover I know could never hurt me, let alone kill me. He gasps in fear when he accidentally leans on my hair or gets his fingers tangled in it.
Yes, I will go to bed safe in the knowledge that he couldn’t and wouldn’t do anything to hurt anyone, especially me.
But before I close my eyes, I’m gonna pray. And I know specifically what my plea will be…
Please God, let me be right.

This is an entry about sex and very liberal topics, none of which are wholesome or family friendly. So, there it is. If you want to judge me, it will fall on deaf ears. Please move along if you can’t handle it. I am not Mary Poppins. 
Before Corona took over the world, I signed up for a swinger’s website. I had a previous encounter at a swinger’s club, where my lover and I watched another couple and they watched us. I asked for and was given permission to touch the other woman while her husband had sex with her. It made me curious, and I wanted to take it a step further. Before the club encounter, I’d had a few threesomes, so I was already ⅔ of the way there.
Neither me or my lover had the desire to trade partners, but rather engage in sex with our respective partners in the same room.
But he and I have reversed roles,and I fuck HIM rather than the other way around. I will explain that another day.
He’s all for some bi play too, between both the women and the men. Now that I’ve had a same sex relationship, my lover thinks I should be able to recreationally play with ANY woman. I loved my girlfriend and she was too fragile to share. The sex we had was sacred, and therapeutic for her. That doesn’t stop my man from wanting to see me in action though.
I’m just not sure how I feel about ANY of it and I examined why.
I came up with two things.
I don’t like my body.
And I don’t want anyone to see me in a non-traditional role. It makes me feel like a freak or an outcast to go against the norm in front of others. It just feels private, I guess. I should not care what others think about my sex life, but then again, I’m offering myself up for criticism by parading it around for them to critique.
We tried it once, in a room with a little curtain that we could leave open at a club. A couple walked by and my lover was on his stomach, strapped to a spanking bench and I was in full blown Domina heaven.
Until I heard a woman say, “I want to look away but I can’t. I’m fascinated in a morbid way.”
Maybe if I was in the more traditional female submissive role, I would not feel awkward being watched. I love my role and feel very comfortable in my own bedroom. I also felt comfortable performing in front of the couple at the swinger’s club because we had discussed how it was going to be, and they chose to be voyeurs to that.
My lover does not force me to participate in anything I don’t want to, and I don’t think I would let him. The idea to sign up for the website was mine, because I don’t want to get stuck in a sexual rut. That’s the kiss of death. Two people should challenge each other and keep their sex life interesting. Believe it or not, some people believe that recreational or alternative lifestyle sex creates a more intimate bond between committed partners and makes it more special. I’m not sure if I’m one of those people or not.
With all that said, I am the partner that does the picking and choosing and I take the time to vet the applicants, so to speak.
There are many single men on the site that try to get me to play alone, without my lover. They seem especially curious because I am Dominant and unafraid to lead. They want the experience they have built up in their mind from television and the internet. I’m like a bucket list thing or a new ride at Disneyland.
My lover refers to it as trying to “separate me from the herd” and I always picture myself as an elk when he says that…the human mind is strange indeed.
Anyways, there is one guy in particular that is especially tenacious and a little annoying. He just keeps persisting, regardless of whether I’m receptive or not. He’s aroused by fact that I used the word “Dominant female” in my tag line and he has spent countless HOURS trying to get me to agree (or rather WANT) to dominate him and he just does not have a single, solitary clue what an absolute douche bag he’s coming off as.
I am actually past annoyed to flabbergasted, at the balls this guy has. I’m almost convinced he is a psychopath. He is using himself as bait to lure me in…as if I’m such a dog that that’s all it would take…a flash of his pearly whites and suddenly I will be following him like a Manson groupie with glazed eyes.
At first I played along, and all that did was fuel his fire. He obviously has ZERO experience with BDSM because if he did, he’d know that I don’t want to stick my tongue where he shits on our first date, or on our 50th date,for that matter.
For a month or more he has titillated me with some good conversation and a few dozen pictures of him sticking various dildos up his ass. He either truly thinks that’s the only thing that makes me tick, or he is an incredibly narcissistic person and a selfish lover. I’m willing to bet it’s the latter. All along he has tried to coach me and groom me to be his personal Dominatrix, but he’s not at all mindful that as my sub, he would serve ME, and not the other way around. He knows I am intelligent, and I don’t understand how he thinks he can brainwash me.
He keeps reminding me that I could have had his “hot” ass by now if I’d just “let myself have what I want” which I guess is to fuck him with objects and lube that I PROVIDE, and it sounds like he will even let me pay for the hotel.
I just want to know WHO or WHAT the fuck this guy thinks he is?!
It probably didn’t work in his favor that we are in quarantine and I’ve had a little extra time, cuz I may have strung him along more than I normally would. I just couldn’t believe someone could be so arrogant. He has sent several face shots too, of course,as he fancies himself a pretty dapper guy. I studied the pictures, and he’s definitely NOT God’s gift to women, by any means.
This idiot must think that because I am not thin and gorgeous, I have no self esteem. Let’s just say he knows differently now.
Despite what he thinks, I’ve NEVER had a man that thought he was going to bag a woman, Dominant OR not, by totally ignoring HER desires. Every other guy that’s been interested in me over the years did NOT lead with “hey, you MUST want to fuck me in the ass.”  Not one of them assumed I would receive so much pleasure from it that I would require NO other stimulation.
He went on for weeks about how I was going to LOVE the taste of his ass.
And this man is a stranger to me.
Fucking amazing.
He does not interest me one bit and when he finally figured out he had wasted all his time and was getting a big fat nothing in return, he turned into a real dick. He actually blamed me! He said I was red flagging him for giving me exactly what I asked for…um, no, actually I asked you if you wanted to be a second submissive in a fantasy between me and my lover. YOU are the one that tried to turn it into something else because you thought you were something special, something better than I could normally get.
How wrong you were. Guys like you are a dime a dozen. I want the guy that serves ME. I want the guy that brings me my favorite beer and buys me bubble bath and makes sure I go to bed knowing he cares about me and how I feel. I want the guy that spoils me and I HAVE THAT GUY NOW. You have not scratched the surface of my heart, for it is impenetrable by most. I don’t need to stick my toe in uncertain water when I already have the whole splendid ocean at my feet.
You’re the riptide that makes the ocean ugly and scary. You’re the wave that pulls someone out and batters them until they are too exhausted to swim to shore.
YOU, Manwhore, are the monster under my bed. As a matter of fact, you’re the monster under EVERY woman’s bed, trying to steal her voice and her ego, you righteous prick.
I am not afraid or intimidated. I’ve had scarier and bigger monsters under my bed than you.
Oh, and one more thing…you’re not as smart as you think you are.
Because if you were, you’d know that extraordinary things are always hiding in places people never think to look.

20,https://www.opendiary.com/m/kaleidoscope-eyes/food-for-thought-210-5839096/,2020-05-13,Food for thought,"
I’m weird about food. I’m not a thin person and I have very odd eating habits and behaviors. Sometimes I will go several weeks where nothing at all tastes good and I will cook food with the full intention of eating it and then it doesn’t taste how I thought it would and I am turned off. 
 
I’ve never admitted this because one of my ex lovers called me “eccentric” because of it…but there was a time when I would eat by color.  For instance, one day the color would be orange and I’d eat only orange foods for that day. Didn’t matter if it was orange M and M’s or squash, it just had to be orange. That was the only rule. Looking back, this probably contributed to my unhealthy relationship with food. 
 
When I was pregnant, I had to wear gloves to touch raw meat and my gag reflex was in full swing. I’m not a big fan of meat and if I eat meat, I want it cooked until it’s so done that it’s almost burnt. I want to take this time to say that my husband knows this and when he cooks dinner instead of me, he knows to take his meat off the grill and leave mine cooking.
 
Everyone has preferences and it’s ok as long as you don’t inconvenience others or dictate what they can eat. I would never ever complain about someone unwilling to cater to my finicky tastes. 
 
A few things never disappoint. They always taste good, but unfortunately some of these safe foods are not at all nutritionally sound. They are foods with high sugar content and my favorite is soda pop. Even after having two teeth pulled and knowing it contributes to being overweight, I was still using it like drugs. Another one is dry breakfast cereal. And honey, off a spoon. And l can eat bread anytime, any day.
 
I love almost all fresh fruit and I buy it for myself because my husband buys overripe stuff and it goes bad before we can eat it. Because that happened too many times, he stopped buying fresh fruit. He will buy fresh vegetables and he is cautiously buying certain fruit again.
 
I have worked for many years and earn my own paycheck but there were several years, about ten, where I was a stay at home Mom working two days a week for five hours a night. I made great tips but not much wage. I was dependent on my husband for a lot of things and that was HIS choice because he did not want to pay daycare for three kids. I felt very grateful to him, because I felt it was a privilege to raise my own kids and my greatest desire was to be there with them every day. I never looked at it as MY sacrifice, until they were almost grown. It was then that I became aware of how much I had traded to have that privilege, and how little I had done for myself. My own self growth was pushed far to the back burner and I fell into bed every night exhausted from giving motherhood my full energy store for that day.
 
Part of that dependency on my husband was eating the groceries that he brought home, and he would often cater to me by buying pop and other things I liked. I’m not going to say he never did that because it would be a lie. My children were not at all deprived.
 
Sometimes I did not have a car, even though it was usually short lived. I went ten months once until my dad helped me buy a car. We were not poor, my husband did not want to get a loan. Looking back, he was hoarding money in a retirement fund that I will receive half of, eventually.  But my point is, I was taught not to complain and fuss and I never did but there was one caveat….please cook my meat well. 
 
Tonight my husband made hamburgers. We’ve gone through the same thing for so long now that I already know my hamburger is going to be too pink and I’m going to put it back on the counter top grill. To combat this, I USED to say, “don’t forget to leave mine on the grill and I’ll get it off” but for some reason that would annoy him. It never mattered anyway because my reminder didn’t make him cook my burger any longer. It was always still pink.
 
So before I took one off the grill tonight, without saying a word, I got a little single egg frying pan out and put it on the burner to cook my burger well done. I didn’t scold him or ask him to cook it for me. I was not upset; I was hungry.
 
When I turned the burner on, my husband spoke up and said “that burger is NOT pink.”
 
He sounded so angry that I didn’t dare question him. I took the burger and put it on my plate and as soon as I cut into it, I could see that it was not cooked all the way through.
 
Now he sees me looking and he is growing angry. I know it’s going to end badly if I challenge him and I don’t want the stress so I told myself I HAD to eat the burger, pink or not, to keep the peace. 
 
I managed to get three bites down before I had to take a break. I was sitting right across from my husband and I could see his eyes boring into me, waiting for me to pronounce it unacceptable. I felt so uncomfortable and on blast that I took my plate over to my work space to avoid his watchful eye. 
 
Now I’m getting a lump in my throat because I don’t understand why I cannot cook my own hamburger the way I want it, and I don’t understand what I even did that made him irritated besides get the pan out.
 
It’s hard to swallow around the lump in my throat to eat, even if I wanted to.
 
But I’m no longer hungry. I’m nervous and worried about how I’m gonna get this burger in the trash without him seeing me, because he is stalking me, just waiting to pounce. Then it hit me, he is addicted to nicotine and will go outside for a cigarette as soon as he is done eating, and that’s when I’m going to bury my pink hamburger at the very bottom of our trash can like a dead sailor’s burial at sea. He will haul the offending thing out to the curb on trash day and never know. He will not be able to ridicule me and I’m relieved.
 
I’m almost 53 years old and my husband treats me like a child that needs to obey him. He’s the mean, abusive parent and I’m the kid trying to avoid his scrutiny. WHY does it matter to him that I WANT MY FUCKING BURGER CHARRED??!
 
I am ashamed and embarrassed that I stay and allow this treatment and I know what the root of it is.
 
He is angry because he fucked up his life and his marriage with his drinking, and this time, he cannot fix it. I will not put my faith or trust in him again because I am simply out of love with him. He was distant and avoidant and drunk by 8 p.m. every night for years. He abused us verbally and again, I stayed. But he can’t make me love him and he can’t make me attracted to him. I cringe when my body touches his in bed so I have taken to sleeping in a spare bedroom. His smell and his teeth are offensive to me and I can’t even kiss him without revulsion. He doesn’t take care of himself and people come up to me and ask me if he’s sick and comment that his clothes look like rags. He refuses to buy new and the kids call his pants “Huckleberry Finn’s” because they are tattered at the bottom and have grown too short. He will only wear jeans on special occasions and they are jeans from the 1990s that he won’t throw out. 
 
His tight control of everything from the thermostat to the peanut butter is unrelenting and his small mind needs to be in constant motion so he does everything at breakneck speed. This includes racing ahead of me when we exit the car to go to the store. 
 
We don’t fight much anymore and when we do, it’s because I have stuck up for myself.
 
They say that when you no longer fight, it’s a bad sign,a sign that one of you no longer wants to try. 
 
If you stop fighting it means you gave up.
 
There is a well stated quote and it reads “You don’t learn from talking, you learn from listening.”
 
My husband did neither.
 
And he has rendered me mute and deaf. 
 
Thank God I still have my vision.
 
So I can follow the light to find my way OUT.

21,https://www.opendiary.com/m/kaleidoscope-eyes/a-girl-can-hope-3-5839192/,2020-05-13,A girl can hope,"
There was a comment left on one of my diary entries from a few days ago. It was a reader that (somewhat respectively) admonished me for writing a hostile entry about someone who hadn’t done anything to me, personally. 
 
That someone was my lover’s wife. 
 
I am left to wonder if the commenter has a child or a grandma or a best friend that he/she loves fiercely. And I wonder how they would feel towards someone that repeatedly bullied their child, or the immoral jerk that took advantage of their elderly grandma, or the husband that slaps their best friend around. I wonder how he/she feels towards the ugly person that hurts who they cherish? 
 
I’m not a hostile person by nature and this is an open platform for anonymous private journaling. None of us know each other in real life and that is what makes this a great place to therapeutically write. I do not practice hate and I love very deeply. 
 
But I can’t stand that bitch and she justifies every bad feeling I have about her with the cruelty she shows the man that I love…the same man she SHOULD love.
 
This last trip was hell for my lover, and unmercifully it is not yet over. She has been difficult, and his anger is palpable through the many text messages we’ve exchanged throughout the week. 
 
I’ve watched the rage steadily growing inside of him and it’s a rage I’ve never witnessed in all the years I’ve loved him, until now. His saddlebags seem to be bulging with renewed resentment and his load is getting heavier with every mile closer to home. 
 
It has grown so uncomfortable that he is thinking about surreptitiously recording her out of control behavior. For what reason, I do not know, nor can I answer the question posed to me by yesterday’s reader…for I do not know the real, true, gut reasons he stays. I can only explain my own. 
 
I suspect my lover has finally reached a breaking point.
 
I’m not talking about a breaking point that initiates a divorce. I’m talking about a breaking point where SOME kind of personal fallout ensues. Something has flipped a switch inside him and I fear the consequence of her constant provocation is going to be the breakdown of his physical and mental health.  
 
I fear he’s going to stay with her until it kills him and I think it’s close to doing just that. How much anxiety and stress and anger and gut wrenching frustration can one person take? How much criticism? How much disrespect? I fear we are about to find out. 
 
In his angst, my lover used words so uncharacteristic of him that I had to stop reading them. They were filled with a red hot violent rage, fueled by decades of hurtful treatment. 
 
But one word in particular stood out, because to me it looked like the word that sparked his recent epiphany.
 
The word was “ungrateful.”
 
What that tells me, is that the resentment is oozing out of his body, forming an amoeba like puddle akin to a radioactive spill. It’s its own special poison, and it burns whoever it touches. It is threatening to consume him.
 
The first of his final sequence of texts made me wince. The next few had me turning away for a second so I could steel myself to read the rest. As I proceeded, I slid straight into disbelief and could no longer reconcile the vicious tirade and my normally even tempered, if not downright docile lover.
 
If she doesn’t stop pushing him, he’s going to crack. Even the strongest people have a breaking point.
 
She is playing with fire and thinks she can, without so much as getting singed. 
 
I am on the sidelines. I can say nothing. I can only hope.
 
And there is one thing I hope for the most.
 
I hope Karma is a bigger bitch than her.

22,https://www.opendiary.com/m/kaleidoscope-eyes/everybody-was-kung-fu-fighting-16-5839338/,2020-05-14,Everybody was Kung Fu Fighting,"
I can’t believe I feel like I have to address this but here goes.
 
I would never hurt anyone, but I would certainly never hurt my lover’s wife and here’s why.
 
To do so would be hurting HIM. 
 
I’d be a fool to think he hated her and so would you, for anyone can read between the lines and see that he loves her. If he did not, he would not give one flying fuck if she was unhappy with life, or unhappy with him.
 
It’s been 13 years. I have never even had a flickering thought of harming her. She has no idea I exist. I live far away from her and I take nothing from her that she’s not willing to give away. In a marriage, one person doesn’t get to decide celibacy for both. 
 
I can’t speak for him but for me, I tried everything, including marriage counseling three times, and I can sleep at night knowing I gave up enough and I gave it my best for 18 years. The last twelve years, not so much. I’ve been lost and unsettled in my heart.
 
Both my lover and I have expressed discontent and offered divorce to our respective spouses and neither mine nor his wanted a divorce, then OR now. But..they don’t want to fix or address their sexual dysfunction either. They’d rather farm out the sex because they have no desire to sleep with us. They can’t expect or demand fidelity unless they are a providing what is at stake if there ISN’T fidelity.
 
And, ultimately, my lover has decided he is going to stay his wife, even without the sex and I can’t change that. If it was not me, he’d be sleeping with someone else and the plan would still be the same.
 
The old saying proves true in this instance as well as many others. You can’t have your cake and eat it too.
 
Unless it’s your birthday, in which case, you SHOULD! 
 
I was licensed for daycare for a decade. I watched several people’s infants and helped them raise their kids until they could stay home alone after school. I was a girl scout leader. I’d pass any background check with flying colors. I’ve been to jail once for possession of marijuana, completed probation, and the charge was removed from my record. This was just before legalization.  I was 45 years old, not driving and inside a private residence so I thought I was using weed responsibly. Point is, if anyone tracked me down using my IP address, they would see that I have never had even a hint of violent behavior.  I raised four kids and they still come home, and bring friends. Some of those friends sent me texts on Mother’s day.
 
I would trust anyone that knows me to judge my character and tell you their truthful opinion.
 
I ain’t no killer. 
 
I ain’t Mother Theresa either, but Damn, Girl.
 
Now for the fine print.
 
If my lover didn’t care deeply about his wife, he’d divorce her. That’s the bottom line. If you care deeply for someone you don’t harm them or put them in danger. I’m not dangerous. 
 
I know he will never be with me in real life, even if she WAS gone. He told me he would never divorce her. She has always been this difficult, sometimes more so, and he knew that she would not be changing when he made that declaration.
 
I have nothing to gain from her death. He isn’t leaving her and I accept that for now because I am married too. When I’m not married, I will re-evaluate. 
 
I know exactly where I stand because I have always known that I am an affair. I am treated well. I am treated like a princess when it’s my turn to have him. He is better to me than my husband. He tells me he loves me and he treats me like he loves me, and he’s still working at 65 partly because it allows him to have me. I am here to provide what she won’t, intimacy and sex. I have known for a long time that my time is limited. When he retires they will go away and take my soul with them. 
 
I choose to accept all this because he is worth it. I’ll take what she doesn’t want and that’s why it hurts. Because just a tiny part of him is enough for me but she complains about getting all of him and acts like a beast. I saw the letter of apology that she wrote to my lover’s brother, because of her awful behavior while they vacationed with him. Two days after she wrote the letter she back pedaled, claiming HE, her brother in law that she felt compelled to apologize to,  made her act the way she did. She had no remorse. I’m not totally blind to her after this many years.
 
This man, my lover, is literally miserable. He is experiencing great anguish, because he desires to make her happy and feels he cannot. She BLAMED him for killing his own child, maybe you missed that entry. He’s willing to do whatever it takes to make her life better, and when I see it, it rips me apart and it hurts like a motherfucker because I wish it was me he protected and not her. But just because you’re hurt, you don’t go out and kill someone. She’s not the reason for my pain. I’m not simple. It hurts like hell to watch him exhaust himself and bleed himself dry just to get a drop or two to moisten her lips.
 
If he dies tomorrow, I will have nobody to help me grieve and I won’t even be made aware of details, including if he’s dead or alive. I have nobody to call and ask.  He will just be a memory.
I don’t need to be reminded that this is my choice. The good outweighs the bad, but there is still bad. 
 
I stress this again… He’s not going to leave her so he’s certainly not going to take her life. They have a life together that I don’t even know about and I only know what is filtered through him. Even he has expressed that he only tells me the bad things about her.
 
And here’s why she doesn’t need a defender. 
 
She has one.
 
It’s him.  HE defends her. He starts sentences with “in her defense…” AFTER he’s admitted his part in whatever he’s defending her for. I just recently heard him say her unhappiness is his fault. I think his brain is damaged from her constant abuse.
 
This woman got punched in the face by her own niece (that she helped raise) because she physically attacked her sister, the girl’s mother. She physically attacked her own sister. And SHE’S the one you’re worried about getting killed? I have never even spanked my kids, she’s beating people on her doorstep.
 
Love makes us protect the ones important to us. For fucks sake he loves her and he’s trying to GIVE her life, not take it. 
 
I know about her and I wish I didn’t . 
 
She doesn’t hate ME simply because she does not know I exist. He shelters her, and if I want to stay in his life then I must too.
 
She’s not helpless either. She could defend herself against me if she had to, but that’s just it, she doesn’t have to and she never will.
I should not be judged by my private thoughts.
 
To not do what you can to protect someone is cowardly, but be sure they are facing real danger before you come to their rescue.
 
In this case, my words do not defend me.
 
But my actions do.

I want to purge my feelings, make words out of them so I can rest without them battering my mind into mush. 
 
These are my thoughts and the things I cannot say to people because it would shock them, or hurt their feelings. These are the thoughts that cause me anguish and I barely write about the things that bring me joy because those things don’t dance around in my head at night, taunting me and stealing the serenity that sleep is supposed to bring. 
 
Everyone hurts and the way in which they hurt or the reasons why they hurt are irrelevant, really, because pain is universal, no matter what the degree of pain is.
 
My own may pale in comparison to other people’s and I’m aware of human suffering and realize that I am privileged in many ways.
 
I always try to find the silver lining in every bad situation but things still sometimes get in the way of my optimism. This diary is my way of processing my pain and if that offends anyone then so be it.
 
I have just had a six month taste of what it would be like to have the man I love, not just ANY man, all to myself for the first time ever. And I’ve never felt closer to true happiness.
 
Now she is back, and she will suck the life out of my lover with her poison, and he will give up. He will stay home for days and let her presence be the reason for not talking to me. She is taking back her throne.
 
None of this makes me angry at her, btw…it makes me angry at myself. 
 
I will go from seeing him regularly to God only knows when, and I won’t even have the consolation that he will be there remotely, because he will fall into depression and or be too busy catering to her and I will be cut off and it literally feels like I’m dying right now.
 
As silly as it is, I’m smack dab in the middle of some intense separation anxiety. I’m so full of useless adrenaline that my body is revolting. I have hives and diarrhea and that’s from the uncertainty, the constant wondering if this is when he pulls the plug and stops being the lover that he is now. Is this the day that it all changes and another year long separation ensues…or contact dwindles. Is this the time he retires me, and decides he’s done with the cost of me, and the time I take, and mostly, the energy I require of him? 
 
Is today the day I’m going to be dropped off in the middle of the desert with no water and no way back to safety, at the mercy of a thousand scorpions? If I look down at the ground now, are they already there?
 
I’m so afraid to open up sexually because somehow in my twisted mind, I believe it will make THIS HORRIBLE feeling less intense if I don’t succumb to complete vulnerability. It is hard to expose your soul when it may not be safe.
 
I feel on the verge of panic and I cannot call him. He has not called me and I can’t ask for reassurance. I have to suck it up, have a shot of tequila, pull up my panties, spit on the ground, and rebound.
 
This marks the first week of my personal emotional hell and the first message I got today was him telling me how to explain to my readers that he’s not violent and won’t hurt his wife, and that he did not kill his child. I explained in the entry I wrote that she died in the hospital because she was a very sick baby, from birth. He’s not violent, y’all. I told him I addressed it. 
 
I want to run. I can’t even stand the intense feelings in my own head and there is no way to hide from them and nowhere to run TO. This feeling is what makes people disappear, never to be found. They try to escape their own intrusive thoughts and they wander too far from home and lose their way, succumbing to the elements or to a random act of violence. 
 
I’m aware that I have caused my own sorrow. I know some of you feel I deserve it and I won’t argue that, but it still feels bad. 
 
I have never felt this sick.
 
I’m afraid of what comes next and finally worried that I may be the one that pays the price.
 
I just want to disappear and crawl somewhere safe until I stop hurting or go numb, either will work.
 
The only place to hide is under my bed with the monsters.
 
Maybe it is fitting.
 
Maybe I have become one.

I’m struggling with panic and anxiety because I am afflicted with both disorders. They are normally under control for the most part, being at their worst when I lost my aunt.
 
Emotional upset kinda triggers them, and when they are really bad, they wake me up out of a dead sleep. I BOLT out of bed, gulping for air like I’ve been underwater. 
 
It’s a horrible feeling. I know other people also experience it, because when I was really suffering, I joined a forum and was welcomed into a secret society nobody wants to belong to. 
 
Nothing feels as bad as not being able to breathe. 
 
It feels like I need to run laps or crawl out of my skin. I don’t know what to do to relieve my sick feeling. 
 
I keep thinking writing will help but my body is screaming out for human touch and comfort and I don’t know where to find that so I sit in my own anxious prison waiting for the sun to come up and be my salvation.
 
I know it would be easier if I could cry openly. I don’t know why I am struggling with this so much. I have not struggled like this since the beginning…when we would drive back from a weekend together and I could not hold back the tears. Even that didn’t involve this level of panic. 
 
I don’t know why I feel an impending sense of doom but it is threatening to rob me of my composure and release the tsunami of emotion I have been holding back, in the name of pride and dignity.
 
This is the price I have to pay and I just don’t know what makes this time any different from a thousand others. Maybe because I am older now and I know my time on earth won’t be forever as I watch friends my age die around me. I don’t want to spend one precious minute of the time that’s left without the person I love most, but I know it takes two people and a common goal. I am left to infer awful truths. 
 
My best friend has six grandkids under six, so I cannot run to her for comfort like I used to.
 
I just need to feel the heart of someone that loves me up against my own, chest to chest, in a prolonged hug that might help me catch my breath. 
 
It seems like a long time to be trapped in the dark, from midnight to dawn. The dark isn’t kind to someone that feels an internal sense of fear they cannot explain. The dark isn’t kind to someone feeling closed in because it advances on you like a blanket of smog and slowly smothers you. 
 
I sent a desperate text to my lover and he’s trying to joke but it’s hard to laugh when you’re using all your energy to keep your head above water.
 
My best friend just texted me asking if I am ok. I am not ok. My lover is so disconnected that he may as well be on another planet. I can’t talk to my mom about my pain. This affair is the only secret I’ve ever kept from her. She is the other half of me and I have sacrificed a little piece of that relationship to save my own life.
 
If and when I tell her about my lover, she will have no room to argue. 
 
Because how can you give someone life,and then argue about what it is they had to do to keep from ending it?
 
About once a month, one of my own daughters will come to me with something that requires making a decision that will affect them negatively or positively. When weighing the options, I always tell them to do what makes them happy, because I gave them life to enjoy it, not to live it for others. 
 
That’s something I desperately needed to hear from my own mom along the way.
 
Instead, I am just now building the courage it will take to practice what I preach. 
 
It took me a long time to realize that it doesn’t matter what other people think of me, because other people aren’t going to have to answer for the things I’ve done.
 
Other people don’t have to live with someone that dictates the color of paint they can use in their own house, or how much ketchup they get to have in a month. Other people don’t have to feel like strangers in their own home and be treated with disrespect by the person that is supposed to love them the most.
 
Other people don’t have to feel my pain or live my truths.
 
I do. 
 
And it just now occurred to me that those two very words are what got me into this mess in the first place.
 
And the worst part is, they were spoken with reverence and in somber tones…in a church, with the presence of God in attendance. 
 
Where in the hell is that God NOW? If he blessed this union to last forever then it must have been some kind of cruel joke.
 
Wasted. All. These. Years.
 
The joke’s on me.

My lover is not o.k.
 
I know his heart well enough to know that something is wrong. Terribly wrong. I know what it is, but I don’t know if he does.
 
He’s depressed.
 
He’s had significant and sudden changes in his behavior and his appearance, and the exhaustion he’s feeling shows in his face and body. 
 
I’m scared.
 
He has all but withdrawn into a shell of self isolation and it’s so painful to be shut out. It’s like I’m dangling over the edge of a cliff, just waiting for him to cut the rope that sends me plummeting towards the ground. 
 
I saw him Friday, and he is not the same person he was a month ago. He has not shaved in weeks and in my heart, I know it’s not because he wants to grow a beard. I have begged him to do that for years and was denied repeatedly. 
 
Six weeks ago he was a vibrant, wonderful man, bursting with enthusiasm and with love and affection to spare. Now, he’s beaten and silent. It’s hard to pull the words from his lips and when I do, it sounds as if he has already surrendered his will to survive.
 
We had about four hours and at one point he had to get up and take a call from his wife. He shut himself inside the bathroom and at first, all I heard were hushed defensive  tones. Then, I heard him take her dinner order and he sounded like he was trying not to get angry.
 
And there was one other thing…
 
I heard him repeatedly defending himself as she accused him of doing something to her phone that was hindering her Kohl’s purchase from going through.
 
It made me sick to hear him talk to her. My lover has chosen to live with a woman that batters him, while the woman that worships him sits by and listens in horror while he capitulates over and over to his ruthless Mistress, one that does not give pleasure, but rather the cruelest of pain.
 
He stabs my heart with every anguished word he speaks. But I must endure and be a strong woman, and listen to him suffer, knowing his pain comes from her not loving him back. It’s a sick and sobering and empty feeling.
 
We are no longer on the exact same playing field, my lover and I. I don’t care if I please my husband. I stopped trying when I stopped loving him. I don’t have the passion to hurt for him or because of him. My heart is truly void of love for him, romantic or otherwise.
 
I got upset at my lover not too long ago for talking about his wife so frequently. It doesn’t hurt me that my lover talks about his wife; it hurts me that he wants to please her. It hurts that he won’t just give up on her. 
 
I can’t deny what is right in front of me.
 
Somewhere in the back of my mind there is a little spark of hope. I know it’s evil and I know it’s not reality, yet I can’t put it out. I’m always blowing little gusts of air at it to keep it ignited. The stubborn flicker of hope is the dream that he will leave her and I will be able to at least see him regularly. I know it’s not going to happen and that it is a dangerous thought to allow.
 
Realistically, all I can hope for is that he will stop caring and stop loving her so much that it makes him constantly distressed and unhappy during what little time we now have together. 
 
My job is to soothe his pain, make him better. 
 
Feeling my own pain feels better than feeling his, because watching him try so hard makes me feel like I need to run away and hurt in solitude.  
 
THIS is why I struggle with opening up. It hurts so bad to let myself think it could be me that he loves and cares for and instead it is someone that doesn’t even treat him like a human being. 
 
That makes my GOOD love worth less than her BAD love.
 
How is that even possible?!
 
She and I are different in many ways but I guess the biggest difference is in our value. 
 
I am like the gambling addiction that provides a quick shot of adrenaline. I must be hidden knowledge because I’m kinda seedy and corrupt. I make him look bad. 
 
She’s the investment in stability and success. 
 
My payout is zero. 
 
She’s a steady dividend.

Enough doom and gloom. I’m tired of riding that train. Time to write a lighthearted entry and adjust my attitude, so here goes. 
 
The internet butt monkey is still hanging around. 
 
I am perplexed by the fact that he does not want a monogamous relationship with anyone, but he desires intimacy with his stable of lovers. He denies having a stable (of COURSE), and only claims to have one other woman that he calls a “playmate.”  I guess that’s supposed to make me think he only bestows intimacy on the “special” ones.
 
That’s comical.
 
I’m not attracted to him sexually, for a shallow reason I’ll admit, but I do find myself wondering if he truly believes what he preaches.
 
His actions don’t seem to be on par with his words. I was too busy to answer him back a few days ago when he messaged, and then life happened and I didn’t give it much thought. After a day, he sent a message asking why I was not interested in talking. I thought that was a little pushy so I ignored him for another day. By day three, when I popped on to check my messages, he had sent several messages asking me if I was o.k., and a very recent one that said, “please tell me what’s going on in that pretty head of yours!”
 
The “pretty” part was again, an attempt to make me feel special. Don’t groom me, Manwhore. I will chew you up and SHIT you out if you attempt to. 
 
For someone that says he doesn’t like committed relationships, he sure is interested in building one. If he’s spending all this time on me, how’s he spreading himself around like the high class gigolo he is trying to portray himself as? That doesn’t jive with bombarding me with internet messages and wanting to chat for literally hours in between sleeping and working a full time job.
 
And what does he want with me? 
 
He said he started out wanting sex, but now he finds me “interesting” and “eccentric” and does this shit work for this guy on a consistent basis?!
 
His initial contact was via the swinger’s site, asking my lover if I used a strap on. When I answered in place of my lover and informed him that I was the one he needed to address, he seemed thrilled. He has tried tirelessly to manipulate me into being his Domina, verbally sparring with me, hoping to entice me, unaware that I am a formidable opponent. He thought he could take me with one hand tied behind his back.
 
I love that he underestimated me.
 
Because I knew his response would be to redouble his efforts.
 
It made him crazy that I wasn’t taking the bait.
 
He point blank asked me why.
 
So, I told him.
 
I told him that I already had a subbie that I love and that I did not desire another. I explained that I didn’t build relationships quickly and that I required a lot of familiarity, which cost time. Not everyone is willing to give away their most precious commodity…their time.
 
I went further, and explained that I developed the feelings and comfort I have with my current lover over a long period of time…years… and that my Dominance is mixed with a huge dose of genuine love for him. I wrapped it up by admitting that my sexual proclivity for ass fucking a man was dependent on love and that love is not something I am seeking.
 
He was not deterred. This bitch REALLY wants my fingers up his butt. I know this because HE switched TACTICS and went for the weakest part of a woman.
 
His next message was a virtual porn play by play of what he was going to do to me and how. I responded by telling him he missed his calling and that if he wanted to write erotic fiction, I’d get him going on a website that would quickly gain followers. Then, I asked him if he was trying to seduce me and his response was that if he was, he was failing miserably. After a few minutes of silence, he sent this message: “Come on, help a brotha out.”
 
I mentioned in a previous entry that he figured out right away that I was a wordsmith, and to show his grammatical prowess, he tries to use words that he thinks I may not know. Every time I use a not so common word that he deems worthy, he says I earned a quarter, as in 25 cents.
 
When he uses a word I don’t know, I admit it, and he subtracts a quarter from my winnings.
 
The running joke has been how many quarters he owes me, and if I use a big word, I will say “oh, and you owe me a quarter” and he will say “I’m gonna hide it and you gotta find it.”
 
Cuz he’s a pervert and he wants his ass violated. 
 
Make no mistake. 
 
I have banned him from sending me pictures of said ass. Our last conversation ended with me telling him to pay UP and mail the winnings and him telling me to come and get it. 
 
When I opened up my messages this morning, I see his freshly shaven ass, balls held tight up against his body, squatting over the camera, with what appears to be a shiny new United States quarter wedged in his ass, flat, like a man hole cover.
 
I haven’t laughed that hard in a long time and I shot him a note telling him just that.
 
He shot me one back, saying “you have no idea how many attempts it took to get that shot!” 
 
And I laughed again, maybe harder.
 
I don’t want to kiss him or fuck him in the ass. I don’t care what he’s got in his boxers.
 
But I agree with J.K. Rowling.
 
“Wit without measure, is a man’s greatest treasure.”
 
Foot note: this loser is gone as of this posting….good fucking riddance.

27,https://www.opendiary.com/m/kaleidoscope-eyes/killing-me-softly-58-5929801/,2020-11-27,Killing me softly,"
Thank God this day is over. It hurts so deep inside me that I don’t know how to put it into words. 
I’m pretty sure that the man I love sent me a text meant for someone else. I KNOW it was for someone else, I am just struggling with accepting and processing that it happened. I was numb when I went to bed last night and I woke up with an immediate sinking feeling in my stomach, knowing it had really happened and that the reprieve granted by sleep was over, and a long painful day was ahead of me, one in which I would suffer in silence.
I struggled to maintain my composure. On this Holiday, we are supposed to give thanks, but all I gave was a performance, and a lackluster one at that. Pretending to be ok and having nobody know how hurt you are inside is a special form of torture. I snuck away a few times to let out the tears and I’m ashamed that I feel this bad over something that many people would gladly trade me for, because their pain is far worse. I’m ashamed because the sobs I let out in silent little bursts behind a closed bathroom door feel exactly like the ones I felt when I lost the person I loved the most to death. I’m ashamed this hurts me as much as death.
I am ashamed and embarrassed and wounded and I want to curl up on my side and hug myself. The very thing that made me feel like l could make it through  yesterday is killing me today.
If I could talk to my lover, I would tell him this…
I accepted my part in the breakdown of our relationship the first time we hit a rough patch. I conceded that I deserved it when you found someone else the last time. You stayed away from me for an entire YEAR…what was I supposed to do?? You called ONCE a week.
Newly out of work and toying with retirement, I was low on the priority list and you let me ride, and I sought comfort from someone else. I did not ever have intercourse, because HE had higher morals than me and was emotionally stronger and wiser. That’s not to say I wouldn’t have if he had wanted to. Make no mistake, I was so lonely and neglected that I would have fucked his brains out. Twice for starters.
There is no denying I had an emotional affair because I was devastated by your abandonment, but being hurt doesn’t excuse my behavior. I was petrified because you’re the only man I’ve ever loved deep in my heart and you were leaving me, with NO.explanation as to why.
You are the one I long for and wish I could live with. You are the one that I’m not sure I can go on without. You are the one that made me whole and now I am forever broken and it is a pain I have only felt when I lost my best friend, my auntie, my confidante and the only one that harbored my secrets and made me believe in myself.
The waiting to talk about this… it hurts so badly. It’s the worst kind of awful, the kind that takes your breath away because the sobs keep coming one on top of the other until the chance to get air easily has come and gone.
What hurts the most is that I’m not worth as much to you as I thought I was. I wanted to be worth protecting. I wanted a place in your heart.
I have built part of a lifetime, 13 years, with you. I always felt privileged to know what your love felt like, because in my marriage I was not given love. I have spent thirty years with a man totally unable to have an interpersonal relationship.
Yes, for 31 years I have lived with a man that has hardly ever touched me with affection or tenderness. He never spoke to me during sex. Never. He never called me a pet name or sheltered me from anything or anyone harmful. He never stood with his arm around me, danced with me, held me, consoled me or caressed me. I was like a doll he didn’t know what to do with, a strange foreign toy that didn’t interest him and I KNEW, from having been raised in a family with parents that loved each other fiercely that how he treated me was abnormal and unsettling.
Three marriage counselors recommended medication, substance abuse treatment and counseling…ALL FOR HIM. One older female doctor brazenly told him he was missing a screw because he lacked empathy and the ability to read emotional cues.
When I began to act out from the strange and emotionless life I’d been leading with him for so many years, instead of reining me in, he let me go and do what I wanted and he never once demanded I stop.
He did that because it was easier than working through the emotional dysfunction in our marriage. He gave up then and drank himself into a ten year stupor and he was mean and miserable and my kids suffered and still I stayed. I didn’t stay because I was a martyr. I stayed out of fear. There was the fear of being able to make it on my own, and fear of being blamed for the demise of my marriage. THAT fear was for a very good reason, because it had come to fruition the first time I left my husband ten+ years ago. I was shunned by my embarrassed parents and also punished, because they were married at 15 and 18 and defied all odds. There was no such thing as divorce to them.
Now I’m 53 and I’m no longer afraid of them shunning me. If they do, it won’t be for long because I won’t ALLOW them to, and that’s what makes this time different than the last.
If my lover admits to a sexual affair with someone else, I will HAVE to leave him. I can’t take having a marriage that hurts me AND an affair that hurts me. I don’t think my heart can handle that, OR his serial infidelity and the pain of always wondering.
This must be what she felt like, his wife. She was married only five years when she caught him cheating and she has stayed another 15 but I have an advantage over her. I can run away from him with no legal ramifications. She’s a horrible woman but her behavior makes more sense to me now that I know how she felt. I feel worse. I have 13 yrs in and she had five.
Let’s not make this a pissing match.
We Finally have something in common, me and that bitch.
We’ve both been fucked. We’ve both been cheated on.
Anyone reading this entry will say I got what was coming to me, and they would be correct. I’ll be in the town square next Friday if you’d all like to participate in my stoning.
Karma just kicked me in the crotch. She’s not only a bitch, she likes to fight dirty. I’m just about pissed enough to tell that cunt to BRING IT ON.
After this, she’s got NOTHING left in her arsenal of comeuppance that will do as much damage as this has. I am now exempt from that whore
Fuck you, Karma. I DARE you to come after me NOW, after serving me up this plate of shit.
If you do, Bitch, you’d better be ready for a fight.
Cuz EVERYONE knows not to fuck with someone that has nothing left to lose.

You waited at the edge of the forest and watched for me. You sidled up to me and convinced me with your slick tongue to follow you. I held your hand and you led me away in my red hooded cape, blissfully unaware that THIS day would come.
Come AGAIN, that is.
Because this isn’t the first time you have strayed. No, not at all. I caught you maintaining a burn phone one year into our relationship, the same burn phone you used to court ME. There was the time I caught you online chatting, having forgotten to make yourself invisible to me, with a totally different profile pic…one with a goatee and mustache. You admitted you had been talking to an old flame, far away in California, dying of cancer. Then you said you should have married her and that she liked you with facial hair.
We never brought her up again. Maybe she survived and she’s my second invisible sister wife.
You repeatedly sent me duplicate texts of the same pictures and messages when you spent those months in Texas, and oftentimes after you returned home. I was suspicious that there was someone else waaay back then.
And the pics
A woman knows the look on her lover’s face when he’s sending pics of himself with feelings attached to them. I saw that look in every pic you showed me that you had not previously shared with me. None of them were meant for me.
Finally, you accidently sent me a text meant for her, and there was a quick attempt to explain it away, but that was not possible, and I went off the grid to lick my wounds.
After several weeks in hiding, you came for me. You apologized and cried and swore it was over and that there had been no sex, but I knew you’d never willingly give up a second bird in the same bush.
Now I suspect that you never gave that woman up or there is an entirely new woman. I have no way of knowing if there are more or if they are the same or different.
You may as well have said, let me coax you out of your shell and convince you that you’re safe and show you what heaven is, RIGHT before I turn around and stomp the fuck out of you while looking into your eyes as the light is extinguished.
Now, six years later it’s happened again, me finding out, and if I choose to believe what I know to be a lie, then I have sacrificed my pride. My pride is one of the few things about me that has steadfastly remained intact, and if I forgive and overlook this, I’m gonna lose two fold because doing that will cost me my dignity as well.
You won’t come for me this time. You will already have my replacement and you’re too tired to chase me and that makes me more afraid than anything else. I’m THAT attached to you, that the fear of you NOT trying to rectify the hurt outweighs the fact that you hurt me in the first place.
But then, the sick awareness comes…that this is the kind of hurt that can’t be rectified without making huge personal life changes.
And you did it for such a selfish reason… your insatiable need to maintain relationships with more lovers than just myself. Love is selfless. Maybe it helps you feel better about your life, duping a bunch of adoring women to validate yourself. Maybe when your difficult wife demeans you, we are there to build you back up. It doesn’t matter who you hurt in your quest to feel better because your void is so deep. I understand, I just foolishly assumed I was exempt.
No, I must finally face THE truth.
The truth is, I trusted the wrong man and this time it feels like it might kill me.I
I hope it happens quickly…because this kind of suffering is not for the weak. It hurts worse than death cuz I lost you, but you’re still alive. I have so much ugly awareness about myself in my heart, awareness of all my flaws.It’s not my heart I’m worried about, I have had that broken before.
So here I stand on the precipice, waiting to hear the words I know will change US forever. This time, you won’t just break my heart.
This time, you will break my spirit.

He finally capitulated via text message and admitted that he was stonewalling me, carefully skirting my questions with hour long pauses, while I sat in a giant puddle of my own pathetic despair. 
Soon thereafter, the phone call came. I knew as soon as I heard his strained voice that I was about to come to Jesus.
I demanded the truth and what followed was the longest pause I think I’ve ever had to endure. He vacillated between telling me the truth or giving up the lie he had been clinging to. I could HEAR the wheels turning in his head as resignation set in that I was not ever going to buy his story.
I knew then, in that agonizing seven second silence, that he was about to push me off the plank and into the violent sea of past lovers, where I would be pulled under the water, never to breathe again.
And then he laid it at my feet… and out came his admission. Tonight, my world feels too painful to exist in. I have little choice though, and I must find a way to deal with the swirling emotions inside my head. There will be no attention paid to grammar or punctuation in these writings because I am writing for therapy and nothing more. I am writing so my chest will stop hurting and so my head doesn’t blow up.
He will not be able to see what I write because he cannot remember my diary name and always needs my assistance in logging on. It is a relief to have a place to put the thoughts into words. Writing is what I have always used to help me cope, to heal, to endure difficult things. This will be my most difficult hurdle to date.
I don’t want him to know my thoughts. I don’t want him to be able to see inside the heart he broke. I don’t want to hear him pretend like it hurts him as much as it hurts me.
I just opened a beautiful red dress that came in the mail the other day. I was procrastinating because I bought it to wear when I saw him next. I ran my fingers over the tight girdle-like fabric, wondering how good a short, fat, old chick could look in a dress like that. I wanted it to look horrible because that’s how it makes me feel to look at it, knowing what it was intended for.
In a stroke of cruel luck, the fucker fit me like someone custom made it for me. It is sleeveless and deep V neck in both front AND back, with the rest hugging my body snugly until just above the knee, where it flares out mermaid style. It’s the sexiest dress I’ve ever owned. And it’s fire engine red, folks.
He would have pretended to love it, and told me I was sexy, no matter how it REALLY looked.
I look at myself in the mirror, and my heart is pounding with the terrifying awareness that he will never look at me in this dress with what I thought was love in his eyes. If I wore it for him now, he’d see HER face and body and imagine HER in my sexy red dress and my chest can’t expand and I cry. I cry because I don’t know who I am without him. In the mirror I see a beautifully sad woman with a wounded face, but if I look hard, I can almost see a 100% American beauty underneath. A sultry, chubby siren with bright red lips and wild curly hair. A force to be reckoned with.
Yes. I see her. I forgot she existed.
She likes to party like a rock star.
I can go one of two ways with my shattered ego. I can reap my revenge on every man from this day forward and use every one of them for purely physical reasons, or I can wait the 26 months till my separation and subsequent divorce and never hurt anyone the way I’m hurting now.
For physical reasons, I’m leaning towards what I have come to know as a hook up. It’s like a one night stand, with two options. Option one is the monthly subscription plan and option two is a permanent ghosting with neither party offering an explanation as to why.
The choice to ghost has no requirements.
The monthly subscription plan carries with it just one, albeit very important, requirement. That requirement is that I will be wearing wireless earbuds, blasting the music as loud as it goes..every time we have sex.
That way, I will never ever hear another man’s lies again.

THIS IS AN ENTRY I WROTE MONTHS AGO BUT BOY AM I FEELING IT RIGHT NOW….
Today the lady that served me my coffee looked me in the eye and asked me how I was. I said “Fine, thank you”, and I took notice that my response was a reflex.
I didn’t give the question posed by a stranger any thought. Most days, I just pretend that I’m ok, because to explain everything that is wrong would take so long. And to say the ungrateful words would make me ugly.
It hurts to be me. I know I should not complain, because I have so much to be grateful for, a lot more than some people have.
It hurts to wonder what it feels like to be physically close to a man for more than a few hours. It hurts to know that I am not worth what other women are, because nobody wants to love me on a full time basis.
My husband has never known how to express love and I’m not entirely sure he can feel it. Choosing to stay here all these years has rendered me useless to anyone but myself. He stole from me what every woman needs, to FEEL like a woman. He never verbally expressed his desire, and he was afraid to ask for or initiate sex.
He was never my rock or my comfort or my cheerleader. He was never affectionate or playful or sexual. When I cried, he would tilt his head like a dog that is straining to hear a sound we humans can’t, and look at me with curiosity. What was worse is when he’d look at me with no expression at all.
One day, after an argument, I tried communicating to him what was missing. I told him that we had no intimacy, no connection. He asked me to explain what intimacy was and after seeing the genuine look of bewilderment on his face, I finally had to concede that it wasn’t his fault that he didn’t know how to emote
I used to be of the opinion that emoting was inherent, with the ability to do so beginning at birth. I have come to understand it is learned by example.
Now I understand that when you grow up in an abusive household, you keep the beast at bay by remaining silent. That is how my husband survived a difficult and cold childhood. It isn’t his fault he doesn’t know how to love me. He’s damaged. I used to hate him because in turn, he damaged me. I was clean and happy when he found me and after thirty years with him I feel dead inside…and dirty from the things I’ve done in a twisted attempt to feel loved and wanted.
I think what has finally hit home for me is that my lover loves his wife, and I DON’T love my husband. The one man I have ever felt loved by loves someone else. She’s his everything. No matter how much he loves me, I am not someone he would be proud to be with. He needs her for legitimacy, to match his ego and his success and that is not me and it never will be. I’m the barefoot weirdo in a sundress, dans underpants, picking daisies. And I bought the sundress for ten bucks at Walmart. Because I spent all my money on weed. I don’t know fashion and I don’t buy expensive shoes.
But none of that matters because I’m always gonna be separate from his real life and him from mine. This was the balm we chose to relieve our pain, but even after all these years it still hurts that he won’t leave her. He makes excuses but there is no excuse. Nothing is truly preventing him from divorcing her. He and I both make up reasons to stay, but the truth is, things don’t have to be tied up in a neat bow to file for a divorce. I would leave as soon as he did and nobody would ever have to know we were lovers until we chose to reveal it.
It would be hard and we’d lose property but if we loved each other none of that would matter.
I’ll never live her life, nor she mine.
She would never participate in any of the sexual antics I have, because she is too good for that and because her fragile mental state is to be protected at all cost. Why? Because she is the one that he has to live with and the one he desperately wants and needs to please.
 My lover tells me all the time that I am not cheap. He tells me that I am a sacrifice that requires great cost and effort.
But at the end of the day when I lay in bed alone, I question my worth.
I am something ugly that you have to hide because I make you a bad person.
There is no value in that.
In the early years of our respective marriages, my lover and I were denied sex by our spouses. After years of pain, we looked to fill the void. We felt unjustly denied. We felt angry.
So we did an unspeakable thing and we found justification for our anger by having sex with each other while remaining married.
A quote by Benjamin Franklin prompted me to write this entry.
“Whatever is begun in anger ends in shame.”
I can’t think of a more fitting example than what I have written here.
What AM I worth? Maybe I am worth no more than this and maybe I am tainted. Maybe I’m a whore.
They say if the shoe fits, wear it.
Never say that to a woman who wears no shoes from April to November.
Call me any names you want and slap your labels on me.
I go barefoot year round for a reason.

So this is what I’ve learned about your other lover. She’s a bad mom and her pussy stinks. I know the latter because I’ve smelled it on your dick when I went to suck it and I was immediately offended and I knew it wasn’t ME. I have sworn I’ve smelled it in the soft hair of your chest when I bury my face into you. Now I know, it’s probably from her sitting on your face like you ask ME to.
Having “ne’er do well” kids means you fucked something up. You didn’t give them stability or proper discipline or adequate attention…SOMETHING.
It’s hard as HELL to be a good mom and raise good kids so their lack of success speaks LOUDLY of your other lover’s character.
My kids are ALL BEYOND successful.
I have one that is 10 months away from being a DOCTOR with a SPECIALTY practice inside a prominent children’s hospital…and hell yes it’s due in part to ME, so I don’t give a fuck what reason she gave you, she’s a shitty mom.
If you had the balls to leave your wife, you’d be a proud step dad right now instead of a sneaky bastard getting a quickie with an internet girlfriend whose meth head kids might knock you out with a lead pipe and steal your wallet.
Yet you chose that over me.
But let’s not throw stones in a glass house as I also found you on an internet web site. Fair is fair, but you get the point..
You put your mouth on her pussy and then on my lips. Do you shower HER smell off like you do mine? I never want your filthy mouth on mine again.
You put your dick inside her and never once did I get to have a say in what you were transferring to me. You put ME at risk. And you looked into my eyes as you brought me to orgasm and told me you loved me.
Then you did this.
You saved me so you could murder me.
I meant NOTHING.
That’s the most devastating part.
And just like with anything in life, there is a bit of irony in this whole situation. I discovered that you’ve cheated so many times that you have scripted a story for THAT too, one that lessens your involvement.
The last time you cheated, when you came for me, you delivered the exact same story. You’ve actually used it THREE times now, because I FORGOT about the doctor’s wife in the parking lot story. Same thing, no sex, oral only, only been going on a few weeks, she’s not your soulmate, you don’t want to talk to her about personal stuff. Same exact fucking story.
And you did that so you wouldn’t fuck your story up, because you’ve cheated so many times you NEED to have one at hand, ready on a moment’s notice.
Yet you are the same guy that advocates for the homeless and cries over the injustice of the world and claims to be so compassionate that you can’t do a humanitarian profession because you’re too mentally affected. You are the same hypocrite flying the Black Lives Matter flag.
My fucking life matters!!!!  And it should have to you. But that won’t make you a hero or get you accolades, being responsible for a little piece of MY anonymous heart.
What a carefully constructed facade of total bullshit. If you were that kind of man you would have made an honest fucking woman out of me ten years ago. If you were the man that cries over a stranger’s pain you’d NEVER entertain the thought of creating the same fate for your own loved one. Good men don’t do that.
Oh, but that’s where I went wrong. You never considered me your loved one. That miserable spiteful complaining bitch you married held that title. I guess you’re a hero for loving poor difficult Lori. Barf.
And then you have nothing to say but “A few months ago you said that you would not blame me for having an affair” I was dumbfounded and I said “why would I say that? For what reason??”
Your reply?…wait for it…
“I don’t remember but it was something you did wrong.”
Oh my God…you heartless prick.
If that was true you would sure in the fuck remember what I supposedly did to deserve that shit.
You are blaming me for a statement I never made, one that might justify your behavior, but you are NOT one iota justified. You are evil and phony. You only pretend to care when someone is looking.
You are not sorry for what you did or you’d never blame me.
You are sorry you got caught.
Actually, you’re BOTH kinds of sorry and I can create a sentence for you to explain what I mean by that.
You’ll be sorry you lost me, you sorry motherfucker.

It’s so hard not to answer the texts. I shouldn’t even look at them because I’m already breaking the rules of “no contact” by allowing a way for messages to get through.
I can’t bear to block him and I can’t bear to leave the texts unread. I can’t just yet. I need more time. The sick feelings of panic keep coming in waves and I pray he isn’t reading this because these admissions make me feel foolish and humiliated. They make me look weak and stupid. I know I can make it private and I thought about it. I hesitate to do that because I need a human connection right now.
I’m too embarrassed to tell my good friends and if I see or hear my BEST friends voice, I will LOSE every shred of composure and dissolve into I’m not even sure what. I will fall at her feet because she is me and she will cry real tears from seeing me this way. I honestly can’t even try to talk to her yet. I’m too embarrassed.
I can’t keep the tears from coming again and again and I would do anything to make this pain stop.
I can’t believe how much it hurts. It’s this deep aching crushing sensation in my chest and then the actual feeling of panic in my throat, rising up, and it’s a real physical sensation of pressure. Then the sobs erupt, the kind that catch in your throat before they come out.
My lover’s  texts are killing me, I WANT him so much. He is ALWAYS the one I want most when I hurt, but what do I do if he’s the one that caused me the hurt? And what do I call him now that he’s not my lover? My whole world feels scary. It takes more strength than I possess right now to admit that I won’t NEED to use the word “lover” because I won’t have him.
He keeps emphasizing the word “baby” in his texts because he knows. He knows I’ve never been anything else BUT his Baby. He knows I’m lost without him, dead inside. Petrified. Just typing that makes me hyperventilate. I’m petrified of being without him and I seriously feel so sick and frightened and vulnerable right now. I AM ashamed to admit it hurts this bad but I NEED to get it out for fear I could easily shout it from the rooftop if I don’t.
It’s so unreal, because this was the day I feared the most, behind losing my kids. I couldn’t think of how I was going to grieve my lover and not be able to show it.
Now I know what it feels like and it’s worse than I thought it would be. I have tried my absolute hardest to maintain the appearance of normalcy but my daughter and my mom and even my normally unobservant husband have expressed concern about my welfare.
I cannot hide my pain.
It’s 3AM and I must be lonely, as Matchbox 20 would say, and I’m trying not to choke on the three ritz crackers I’m making myself eat. The last thing I ate before now was half the piece of pizza I was eating Wednesday night when the text came asking me if I was “still working” when he knew damn well I wasn’t cuz I had JUST left him an hour before.
Immediately, my body had a physical reaction to that text because I KNEW. Right there, the bomb was dropped. It was that sick feeling of betrayal that you never forget.
It is hard to swallow the bites of food. My throat feels extra dry and I gag easily. The sobs come unexpectedly and with food in my mouth and I’m afraid I will choke. That will be the ONLY positive thing I can attribute to this, a loss of appetite. I usually EAT my feelings so this will be a welcome change.
And I wonder if she’s thin and beautiful.
I am fully aware that all of this sounds pathetic and that I need to pull myself together, like I gently tell my girls when they get too hysterical. I can’t live on xanax and coffee and I have to get my shit together.
It’s time for me to practice what I preach. I can only guess that God wants to remind me of what it feels like to hurt this deeply, so that I am never hurtful to someone if their grief should try my patience.
Late last night, I used a podcast to fall asleep. When I woke up this morning, my cell phone was still laying on my ear where I left it. I don’t think I slept long at all because the two part podcast was nearly over.
Then it dawned on me that perhaps I should listen to some kind of self help information, because I don’t know how I’m gonna make it through today or tomorrow.
How do you grasp that the person you believed in wasn’t who you thought they were, and suddenly you’re faced with being totally and utterly emotionally alone, when they were your whole world just three days ago.
I prayed so hard it wouldn’t happen cuz I knew it would end us and I prayed I was enough to make him different, to keep him satisfied so he didn’t want to cheat. To change him.
Typical stupid woman. Superwoman. The one that’s gonna change him.
Never let a fool kiss you, or a kiss fool you.
Don’t be stupid like me.
I did both.

33,https://www.opendiary.com/m/kaleidoscope-eyes/groundhogs-day-7-5929933/,2020-11-28,Groundhog’s Day,"
It’s morning.
I know because there is light coming through the curtains.
The cobwebs are not even cleared from my head and the sucker punch comes. Every day, the blow feels the same, like when my friend jumped off the end of the teeter-totter on the playground and I slammed into the hard packed dirt.
This time, a few pats from the recess lady and the assurance that you just got the wind knocked out of you isn’t going to ease your mind. No, these are adult hurts, and I am not anyone’s baby anymore and my pain is mine on this sunny morning.
And I cry
Again.
I wonder when it won’t be the first thing I think of when I open my eyes and how many days or weeks or months before the fear and  pain are not forefront in my tortured mind.  Every. Single. Day.
And then the rage comes. Because I gave it all I had. I bent so far backwards that I broke. I never stopped trying or forgiving or giving selflessly. I wasn’t perfect and I did a lot of things wrong. I had my own transgressions and imperfections.
You always reminded me that I wasn’t convenient, but that was always followed by…”but you’re worth it.”
I wonder when I stopped being worth it.
And who will hold me when I hurt or kiss me when I feel deprived of love and look at me with eyes that breathe life into my needy body every week.
I can’t go back into the affair world. THOSE JACKALS WILL EAT ME ALIVE. They can smell bleeding prey from a mile away. I know this is the thing that will drive me to finally divorce my husband. The pain I will endure without my lover, and my resolve to never feel this pain again, will force my hand in the game. I’m gonna lay down my cards, and it isn’t gonna take long for shit to get real.
The desire for a divorce has been strong for the past couple days. I think the shock has made me numb, and it’s like novacaine for my heart. The pain of a divorce honestly HAS to pale in comparison to this pain. It’s like, “Quick! Rip the wedding ring off while I’m still numb!”
Only I don’t wear a wedding ring. My wedding ring means nothing to me, but the ring my lover painstakingly formed out of a silver quarter from his birth year…THAT was my dearest possession. It, and his refusal to give up on making it for me, was the greatest love story in the world and it was mine until he ripped it away. I looked at that ring every day and it was a part of my body, as sure as my arm is. I wanted to die wearing it.
And I did.
The problem is, I’m still alive on the outside.
My lover told me to let my kids cremate me with that ring on and as stupid as it sounds, it was my own little CONSOLATION prize for having stuck with the person I loved even though being second forever to his wife was the hardest sacrifice I ever made for someone else. That ring… It was my secret way of having part of him with me forever after I died.
But my commitment to him didn’t warrant a consolation prize…it should have earned me the grand prize, and the grand prize was him.
Instead, I got a pocket full of humiliation and rage.
And a rare coin that didn’t hold its value.

34,https://www.opendiary.com/m/kaleidoscope-eyes/til-the-landslide-brought-me-down-5930041/,2020-11-29,Til’ the landslide brought me down.,"
This morning has been the worst so far. I can’t believe he did this to us. I have never been so wrong about someone and for so many years.
I said my goodbye to him and I know I must be strong and not talk to him but the thought of that made me sorry I woke up this morning. As soon as I opened my eyes, I had to squeeze them shut to keep from crying. The sad disappointment washed over me before I even rolled over. I am so ashamed that this pain is making me this weak and debilitated. I am disgusted with myself for hurting this deeply yet I cannot stop.
For the first time in my life, I prayed for my death. It would be preferable to this pain and I’ve lived a pretty painful yet wonderful life, up until now. It’s still a good life, it’s just too painful to navigate and when I had that little shred of him, it was bearable. Right now, it is not. It’s ok if this kills me because I’m ready to go now. I’m tired of hurting.
I would never take my own life, my daughters NEED me, but today,  I AM ok with dying in my sleep. I was worried about this giving me a heart attack but maybe that would bring relief and end my suffering. The pain of living like this is torturous.
I’ve been up for ten minutes and I’ve dry heaved like when I was pregnant with morning sickness and I’ve already had one sob session and I HATE myself. I am ugly and flawed and ruined for anyone else because I don’t know how to be soft and tender. I’m just a fetish and a pervert that doesn’t deserve love and wouldn’t know how to react to normal sex anyways. He never looked at me as a normal woman and now he blames me for being an inadequate lover that stole his manhood when it was HIM that bought the first ever strap on and asked me to wear it.
I am my own worst enemy and I don’t want to be me anymore. I don’t want to exist. I want me AND my sexuality to no longer exist.
It’s worse than yesterday and the day before and I am shaking uncontrollably because I know that not answering that phone if he calls is sure to be a fate WORSE than death. The fear of being cut off from him is immobilizing.  I’m so scared and everything feels petrifying, because right now my brain still can’t accept that I will be without him. It’s denial. I think this IS how it would feel to lose my child.
Forgive me for my ungrateful words. I am not myself anymore. I am sick with grief. I will never be able to feel anything but this pain when I open my eyes every morning, it will just be varying degrees of awful, but still there to greet me.
I wonder when I am going to wake up and not feel worse than when I went to bed. I wonder when I won’t wake up in the night wondering what she looks like and thinking of all the loving things he does to her that he did to me. It was all a lie. A carefully scripted plan that involved the same rituals and words. The person is invalid and doesn’t matter, as long as they give him what he is after.
We are all the same to him, maybe some, like me, are assigned more or less value and who knows what determines each of his lovers’ rank. I know what things determine our value to him and I am not a good value because of cost and location and apparently, frequency. I am near the bottom I’m sure, and he spent a lot of money on me, so WHAT does he pay for the most important side piece?  Probably her mortgage. We already know what he’s willing to do for the woman he married. HER consolation prize was WAY better than mine, of course. She got a beautiful apartment on a famous beach. She eats bon bons and suntans all day and if she feels like I do then trust me when I say it’s not enough, no matter how luxurious.
I hurt so much that my chest feels like it’s being crushed by a thousand pounds of misery. I didn’t need ANY of those trappings and I shared everything I had with him, even if I barely had enough for myself. Sometimes, I gave away something that was for me, because I didn’t want HIM to go without. He out-earns me by a long shot but I shared and gave what little monetary things I had and paid half of the hotel bill when I could and I tried to be consistent. I stayed up all night making him homemade food that he could eat for lunch at work, but now I know that PUSSY was on the menu and not my stupid potato chips. I labored for six months to make him a stupid tray to look at and be reminded of me. I hope he burned it into a big pile of melted plastic and ashes, much like what’s left of my heart.
All I can think of is his hands and mouth all over her, in her bed, helping her with her house, reassuring her, holding her, kissing her, maybe paying an additional bill or two since he seems pretty concerned with her loser kids taking her money.
Well, he’s ALL yours.
I wish I could warn you that when he’s looking into your eyes telling you that you are sexy and beautiful, he’s telling it to many people and all you’re gonna get is fucked and mangled and you too, will feel like dying if you fall for his fake ass proclamations of love.
He’s sick. He’s going to use you so he can continue to be his wife’s whipping boy. He gets off on it. He’s her martyr. He told me he’s her beast of burden and he LOVES the title and the sympathy it brings from others. His guilt makes him a pussy. He allows the abuse she gives him, like a fearful child would, and she calls him names and degrades him and the way he keeps TRYING to please her makes him look ridiculous and foolish. At least I quit trying to please the asshole I married and I don’t bust my ass for him.
The worse his bitch wife treats him, the harder he will try to please her and YOU will get nothing when that’s happening so buckle up, Buttercup cuz you’ll be riding in the suicide seat and your day is coming. You better hope your emotional air bag inflates when his certain betrayal smacks you in the fucking face with a force that WILL kill you. I bet he tells you your pussy is “nice” and “beautiful” and HIS. I bet he tells you to stretch it across his face and grind it on him and oh my God I am going to make myself sick wondering what he does to you.
And I bet you’ve been his lover for years and it’s already too late for warnings.
And you, you heartless bastard…
This mornings horror show in my head could be a very real rendition of what you did, what transpired.
I imagine you awaking and telling your wife you are going to the store for the paper, like you used to do when you called me…only you didn’t call me. You went to her and she let you in and took you to her bed where you made love to her like you didn’t me and each kiss you give her kills another little piece of what YOU left of me.
Then you hold each other and snuggle and you tell her that SHE is the one you should have married and then you say I have to go, Baby, and she cries.
And this most recent time you went to your cottage, there is no doubt in my mind that you took her to the place I loved.
I hate you for making me feel like I’m dying.
But I hate myself more for loving you, even as you carry out my execution.

35,https://www.opendiary.com/m/kaleidoscope-eyes/it-didnt-start-out-as-love-5930112/,2020-11-30,It didn’t start out as love.,"
Last year was the first year his wife spent all summer in Florida. Her absence was heavenly and it allowed us a ton of time to see each other. As soon as she came back, things between us changed drastically. I panicked because I am intuitive and it was glaringly evident that he was withdrawn and mean. Irritated. Angry. Full of dread. 
I want to say he realized how nice it was with her gone, because I believe we discussed it, and the closer it came to the time for her return, the worse he acted and felt. I wonder if that taste of honey with her absence awakened within him a feeling of what freedom could be like and he loved it so much that her coming back put him in a tailspin of despair.
So maybe when she came back, it was worse than had she never left. It may have felt so bad in fact, that he DID need more sex to feel better. But at what point do you look in the mirror and say enough is enough and just go masturbate?
He agreed he “should” have masturbated, but I think he wanted MORE than sexual release…he wanted emotional connection too. He is still lying, claiming she is just a release….that he ONLY has oral with.
He knows the jig is up, too, as his denials are getting weaker by the hour.
And then later today, there was this message.. “it’s quick, we get into bed, get done quickly, put our clothes on and go”…and he closed with, “it’s not fulfilling.”
Again, lies. If it’s just oral sex, you only need to pull your pants down and she can take hers off. You took all your clothes off so you could FUCK and you got into the bed so you could cuddle and I HATE you for LETTING ME DOWN AND RIPPING MY HEART OUT.
Shortly thereafter, he started talking about the cost of a motel four times a month and how keeping me was akin to a car payment. I now see that he was facing what he probably perceived as the worst summer ever with his wife’s bitch ass back, and a plan was born. Or maybe the other other woman already had a weekly spot. I don’t know anything and I never will.
That is probably not the truth, his claim that he only started seeing her a few months ago. So I’m just rambling because nothing is the truth anymore and it never was. But I think his plan to get a closer lover was twofold, as it eliminated his cost for a motel all winter and gave him a free pass to stop over at her house and grab some sex anytime he wanted. He could NEVER pass that deal up, no matter if me finding out would put an end to us or not. I can’t come to his house in the winter and spend the night.
But she can. Or he can stay at her house. And it’s free.
I tried to use the logic that I could come to the city he works in, to visit an additional day of the week so as to give him sex more often, and I’d have to pay for the motel, but I’d be willing if that’s what it took. I know it’s hard and costly and I can’t blame him if that weighed in.
But he didn’t want to do that.
He wanted to go the convenient and cheap method…with intimacy included, phone calls texts, dinner, who knows what they have going on.
What hurts the absolute most is the lie. Which lie? There are many but the killer one is “we don’t talk like you and I do” and “we only see each other an hour a week” but the text he accidentally sent me said otherwise. He was asking her a daily question, “Are you working still?”…They talk daily.
I’m sickened.
And the first time he sent me the wrong text, it said ” enjoy dinner out. I’ll call when I get out later.”
Fucking liar. He talked to her daily and he left the house to maintain a relationship by speaking on the phone.
I didn’t deserve to spend 13 legitimate years as the other fucking woman and I sure in the fuck don’t deserve to spend one DAY being the OTHER other woman.
And my heart is so broken. I don’t know how to begin to mend it. I just wake up and get through each hour until it’s time to sleep and then I am blissfully unaware for five hours if I’m lucky.
He can’t afford me anymore and he doesn’t want to hurt me. I’m too inconvenient to be ABLE to fill the void. I’m not thin enough, pretty enough, I have an A#1 mom bod, I turn him off but he can’t bring himself to hurt me, the list goes on and it’s endless and I have to stop obsessing over why and start worrying about WHAT. What to do now.
He keeps wanting to talk but I know I’m gonna have to pull the plug to my own life support soon, for I am only prolonging the agony. The first and second and third time I caught him, I swallowed lies and accepted excuses and sold myself out. This time, it would cost me too much of myself to forgive. At what point do I protect myself so that it doesn’t kill me? I forgave many times, and to forgive without any changes will surely bring the same outcome.
And there won’t be any changes. The only changes will be that he and his wife (that he’d NEVER risk hurting with his carelessness) will move into a newly remodeled condo with his stupid fancy hotel mirror that has a dehumidifier so the glass doesn’t fog up. That’s what is important to him, having the best things and looking successful and fancy gadgets that plastic rich people have.
He didn’t think one smidgen about me, his stupid, free, kinky, fetish girl that was a fool to believe a self serving word he said. I never fit in anywhere.
He ignored me all summer and most of fall and he keeps revealing details that I can’t trust to be true, even though they’re plenty horrible. I can’t believe him because the truth is probably far worse.. He’s covering up past lies and he’s gonna tell the biggest lie to himself when he looks at his reflection in the mirror. He’s gonna pretend like I didn’t matter and forget about me to save face to himself about his own character flaw. He won’t ever own it and change because he has told me that, that he won’t leave her and he tells me this after having thrown me a tantalizing crumb that hinted of MAYBE leaving her.
But he’s said a lot of awful things that I have overlooked.
He has said that if he left his wife and lived with me, we wouldn’t get along anyways…as if to discount me…even though we have never fought.
He’s said that even if he COULD see me more, he’d not have the time…but he has time for a whole other relationship.
He said he didn’t fuck the woman he is seeing, but he forgot he answered “yes” to my question about using a condom, and I  know THAT’S a lie because erection issues are the reason he can’t.
And he’s done awful things like ask my best friends boyfriend for a foursome in the mens room, and he let me ingest so much absinthe that I was almost comatose and then he held my arms down and urged a guy named Scott Parker to fuck me and do sexual things to me. I remember flashes of the night but most of it’s a blur. I distinctly remember my lover holding my legs apart and Scott Parker being concerned for my ability to consent and my lover saying”she’s fine. She wants it, and he’d ask me, ” don’t you?” as he coaxed me to regain consciousness long enough to agree.
And he told me he would never love me so that I’d feel special when he did. He screamed and yelled at me until I cried because I didn’t look for a male play partner after he paid for a swing website subscription I asked for, to try to be his kinky queen, because all the other titles were being held by other stupid women with no self esteem.
I was curious about the sex club so I asked him to take me. We had done it together a few times early on in our relationship, and it was fun.
So I asked, all these years later, to do it again…ONCE…and he turned it into a twice monthly or more date night, and he’d physically push me to be the front man, leading him around in full fetish gear  and the more I said yes to, the more kink value I gained.
I saw that and I devoured that role and studied it relentlessly so that I could please my lover and what happened is that I excelled at it. I was a natural born sensual Domina and performer and I shine at it. I far succeeded his expectations and he liked it so much that he got greedy and lost sight of my pleasure.
Now he has assigned blame to me for taking over and being too controlling of the lovemaking session that is full of rituals to please him that I have carefully honed and tailored to his physical and mental needs
I never wanted this title full fucking time..HE CREATED ME and gave me the confidence I needed to keep learning. Now he is saying I emasculated him so he needed her. He’s blaming me for my own heartache and it feels so ugly and unfair.
The ONLY time we fought was when I wouldn’t agree to something without an argument. In the end, he always won.
Still, I saw the good in him and hung on long enough to become what he called “his Baby” and to be fair, if he wasn’t good to me, I would not be in so much pain now, NOR would I have stayed for 13 yrs. Oh my God he fooled me and I’m just so sick that what I thought I was doing to please him caused my own demise. Now I’ve grown to identify as the sexual dominant and he wants to be Dominant over me and we can’t go back and do it over because I’m not close enough or easy enough to meet his needs. Please God, help me cope.
I did all of that and accepted less in return and endured a lot of just…well…horrible things, to become worthy of being in his inner circle. Once in, and valuable, he grew to treat me better and we grew closer.
I lapped up his attention like a hungry puppy.
And he DID treat me like a queen for that time he had me, and he used to WANT to leave the house and talk to me like he does for HER.
Now I have to face my fears, because if he does call, it’s gonna kill me to let it go unanswered and if he doesn’t call, it might kill me faster.
And in my mind there is a dark corner that hides the most terrifying thought of all.
What if he doesn’t try, because trying is too much work and too much time and too much stress and he just drops off with a relieved and lighter heart. What if he knows what it would take to make me believe in him again and it’s the ONE challenge in his life that he doesn’t want to rise up to.
Maybe he will give me up easily, turn away from me and never look back.
It’s easy to turn your back on someone that nobody knows exists.
Especially if you hurt them terribly and you don’t want to feel ashamed or have to pay a consequence.
He won’t go away yet, no matter how many names I call him or how much hate I spit in his face and shove down his throat.  He is STILL talking, still begging to be battered and stomped and insulted.
Just as I guessed. That fucker’s a masochist to the bitter end.
I used to tell him he’d have to find a punishing Domme if he wanted to be roughed up, because I loved him and could never hurt him.
But now the game has changed, and I just might be the bitch in leather he’s always wanted.
I’ll make the safe word “sorry.”
It’ll be the easiest to ignore.

Yesterday he defended his recent choice’s “ne’er do well” children and then tried to backtrack on the never do well part that he laid down previously…for who knows what the fuck reason. I guess to torture me with the fact that she laments her troubles to him.
I remember when he watched from the safety of his car as I took my baby’s hand and walked her into daycare, so he could steal a glimpse of her long golden curls and her tiny body clad in a fairy dress and cowboy boots that she chose from her own drawers.
Over the years he’s been the silent internet daddy, and I shared with him everything that happened in my kids’ lives. Their joys, their triumphs, their struggles, a rape, a suicide attempt and boyfriends and academic achievements and failures..Both my oldest children were in the top ten of their class in high school and my second born who is now in grad school was salutatorian.
I said no to going to the sex club the day my daughter was to accept her senior National honor society award.  I was minutes away from the glory hole, risking a sex charge that would steal from her a moment she’d never get back and I ALMOST took that chance. I remember asserting myself for the sake of my kid…the ONLY thing that ever stood in the way of me putting him first. Like a fool, I shared my greatest gift with someone that wasn’t careful with my feelings.
Thank God they didn’t love him too. He never really liked kids and that’s probably another reason for my status on the totem pole of his life. I would kill him with my bare hands had he done this to ALL of us, as a step dad or even live in lover.
How do you hurt the mother of a kid you’ve watched grow up from afar for most of her life?
His first story about the “other” other woman was that her kids were always into her for something, and that she had to carry them more than what is normal for their ages, but then he downgraded it to they are just living at home into their 20’s.
I have to scold my daughters (excluding the almost grad school student…she is broke) because they buy me things that I don’t need…most recently a Vera Bradley tote and an authentic needlepoint Turquoise ring made by my favorite Zuni artist, Bath and Body Works soaps and shampoos, and a gel nail polish kit. One changes the oil in my crappy car, AND she usually buys the oil for me. My youngest does everything for me including keep track of all our appointments, because she has grown up compensating for having an older mom. She and I are inseparable and we are together almost every waking moment. She’s my only child at home and will leave for college in two years.
When I protested to my oldest about spending money on me, her reply was “I want to do things for you, Mom. You gave me everything and a wonderful, rich childhood.”
I cried. Because if I do NOTHING else right in my life it’s ok, cuz I did the most important thing right. I hurt them when they found out about my affair years ago. I can’t take that back but they still love me fucking fiercely because I am beautiful and good and I did the most important thing in life a hundred percent right.
Fuck you and her loser kids.
Come to my house on a Sunday morning, where I sit in a sunny kitchen that smells of coffee and scrambled eggs, listening in absolute awe as my child fills my house with piano music. Her gifted mind and nimble fingers make my house sound like what Heaven must and guess what? It would sound just as beautiful in a cozy rental I could afford. It’s NOT the expensive sunny kitchen that makes it beautiful…it’s the fifteen dollar acrosonic baldwin piano I bought for 15 bucks off the goodwill showroom floor. God smiled on us that day!
That’s MY life, the one you DIDN’T choose to share with me. Instead you stayed with someone that robbed you of everything including your balls and your morals. She batters you relentlessly and throws vases at you and you chose THAT over me for all these years because it would cost you too much to make me REAL.
Yes, my marriage sucks and hearing the music does not make my miserable sacrifice for it any less miserable, but my daughter at that piano making me choke on my own tears is an accomplishment nobody can deny me. Those lessons meant working my fat ass off from 8p.m.to 3 a.m., every day, after having put a full day in being a barber and a mom and a friend and a daughter.
So does all this make me perfect or above anyone else? Does it make me noble or get me into the martyr club? Does it elevate me to some otherworldly status?
No.
Does it make me worth being faithful to?
You better fucking believe it does.
How dare you hurt my kid by hurting me.
You are SO lucky she did not love you like I did.
Cuz you’d be a dead man walking.

I know that cheating is hurtful, but how to fix a broken ego? How do I repair my fragile sense of self and look deeper than my own flawed skin and somehow come up with something beautiful about myself to believe in?
I don’t know how, because all I see now are the things about me that are NOT beautiful, my scars and my body, beat to shit from carrying life four times. I see the damage I’ve done by drinking too much pop and beer, having too many babies and sleepless nights, and shooting tequila and the million other bad things I’ve done. I see the lines in my face from worry and the lines around my mouth from laughing at life along the way.
I feel afraid to be exposed in my naked skin because I can’t see why anyone would want to love me. If he needs more than me and he claims to love me, how will I ever be enough for anyone else?
Is he slipping into her house and inside her now? Who was it before it was her?  He’s done it many times before this time, but I could not accept it until it hit me in the face. I could no longer accept it because you DON’T hurt those you love, especially a woman that loves you.
I can safely bet my life that my dad would never hurt my mom like this.
And if I had a quarter for every time he told me not to let a man do to me what my lover has done, I’d be a rich fool right now and not a broke bitch crying at four a.m.
Sometimes, a lover can show you the way to body acceptance and other times, you just gotta find it for yourself. What I have learned is that your lover is going to go and find someone else when your light no longer shines as brightly as it once did.
Mine went out of his way to be different than most men and it kept me devoted for a long time. It wasn’t wasted effort. Last time we hit a rough patch he sent me a penny in the mail, shiny and uncirculated, with a note that said pennies gain luster over the years, like ME, and I almost believed him until he made a liar out of himself.
If my lover found a woman with kids the same age as mine, that means she is my age or younger, and that makes me feel NOT jealous, but sick. I close my eyes and I see her running her hands through his silver hair and over his back and I see her on top of him and I hate him for making me think she’s better than me. I  feel insecure. I want to be loved and held and to get that, I just might do the unthinkable.
He did.
I hardly know what it’s like to be with a man other than my husband, who I haven’t slept with in years, and now, my lover, who I’ve solely slept with for 13 years. I had a high school boyfriend and then one long term (four year) relationship and an early affair with my boss.
That’s it.
I’ve had sex with a handful of others but most of them were before I was even 23 years old, because at 22 I was married. I feel duped by my lying, dysfunctional, fucked up husband, who rushed an engagement and then stood at an altar for a shotgun wedding with a victorious smirk on his ugly face and then proceeded to ruin my fucking life. To keep from dying for my mistake, I DID THIS. And ironically, IT’S now killing me as well.
My lover has duped me too.
I wonder what someone else’s hands, not his, would feel like on me and inside me. I wonder how it would feel to kiss someone else in the dark and how they would handle me. I wonder what someone else smells like and what their skin would feel like against mine, and I wonder when he’s fucking me if he will feel tender towards me for even a second or two, or will I just be a hole to fill up and get gratification from?
My lover surely wondered those things and he was finding them out. He must have liked it because he kept going back and did he ever think about me and how much I loved him when he was kissing her passionately? He’s lying about what she meant to him and how intimate it was. I know he is. He wanted to kiss another woman and when his wife came back from her winter home, he made a decision that I was no longer worth the sacrifice and he started looking for more, for someone else, someone better than me.
I cannot put into words what it feels like to lose that…to lose the security and love you thought you had and how alone and sad it feels to know that he gave the ONLY part of himself I didn’t have to share with his wife to someone else.
She touched him how I do and he touched her with the same mouth and hands he touched me with and I CAN’T BELIEVE IT WON’T STOP HURTING.
I just want to throw it all up and flush it down the toilet, the ugliness and the self loathing.
I want to stop wondering what it is that made me uninteresting and not sexy to him. What did he stop seeing in me and will anyone else ever see it again? Why did he stop loving me and curse me with ugly pictures in my head and a dead heart that somehow keeps fucking beating even when I wish it would stop.
I can’t find what makes me, me.
He took it from me.
He saw who I was… because I gave him my best… and it wasn’t good enough.
One man’s trash is another man’s treasure.
And my own lover hauled me to the curb.

This is an entry from Monday. Or Tuesday. I can’t remember cuz the days have all kinda sucked, lol. Anyways, here it is:
 
He hasn’t stopped seeing her. 
He actually sent me a message that he had called to “cancel” their meeting today. Then he relayed to me that he would stop seeing her IF he thought it would make a difference.
Let that sink in.
He said he’d stop “IF” he thought it would matter or do any good. Cuz NOT doing it would HELP?!
Then he used the excuse he will forever use if I allow this shit. He said “no matter what I do, you won’t believe me.
That is called “victim blaming” and it’s a way to avoid consequences for your hurtful behavior.
He said it was the stress that made him do it. He said he reached his breaking point when in September, his wife didn’t leave to go to her vacation home, so he began an affair to feel better.
And there is just so much wrong with that explanation.
For starters, he was only gonna have to wait till after Christmas for her to leave. He couldn’t wait two months?
He’s 60 fucking Six years old and can’t keep his dick in his pants for two months till she’s gone?
At the very heart of that admission lies the truth and quite possibly the reason for all this. His wife makes him so miserable that a woman that would marry him tomorrow and give him the world isn’t enough, and the addition of the other “other woman” isn’t enough either. The real problem is that his wife makes him miserably sick and he uses outside relationships to fill the void.
Once he lost his wife because of his infidelity, that was the most costly thing he had to lose…anyone he hurt after that was collateral damage. Nothing could be worse than having to live with a furious, wounded woman who has punished you for your mistake for 15+ years. What price is he gonna pay for his infidelity to ME that SHE hasn’t already charged him?
Hurting an affair partner is small potatoes if it solves the problem without losing any of your financial assets. That’s why MY husband stays married to ME, and he doesn’t treat me 1/18th as good as what my ex lover treats HIS wife. So, it’s more than financial or he would cut his losses and run like Flo-Jo.
The part that concerns me is this next bit…
If I forgive him again, I am agreeing to this happening over and over again.
As long as he’s married to his wife, he will cheat. And he may cheat even if he’s not. His solution to his problem is to get rid of her for three months out of the year to make the other nine bearable.
But the other nine AREN’T bearable or he would not need so much extra in addition to her. And me.
He told me in the beginning of our relationship that he was loyal and devoted and he’d never cheat on his wife if she would do so little as to HOLD HIM AS HE LAYS BESIDE HER AND MASTURBATES.
Apparently, that same courtesy is not extended  to affair partners…cuz I NEVER refused him and he STILL fucked around.
I believed him too, that he’d never cheat if she even so much as threw him a bone, cuz he didn’t seem to want to hurt her and she was always protected, first and foremost. He believed that if he told me he loved her in a familial way, and not a romantic way,  it made me feel special enough to stick around.
She is the Queen bitch in charge and I am her stunt double. I get all the danger and she gets to be the movie star on my emotional dime and I hate her. The rules he made me follow for all these years were in place to protect her, never me. And he would like to say I’m the same way about my husband but that would not be true. I’m not gonna LET my fucking husband pin me down to every minute of every hour to track me. I’m not gonna listen to him question me and try to catch me in lies and demand I do this and that and basically kiss his ass every hour of the day. It is never ME that has to text my husband or call from the bathroom of the hotel during the whole FOUR fucking hours ww get together a week. He can’t even be away from her what boils down to one hour after work. It’s fucking excessive. She’s nuts and he’s built his life AND MINE around her crazy ass. I would rather die than be someone’s bitch like that. Especially hers.
She has literally taken everything good from him and vice versa. They hate each other and are all wrapped up in the trimmings…the phony shit….the real shit is me at the motel with money in hand every week and his sneaking inside the girlfriend’s house where the damp smell of her laundry fills the air. That is his REALITY but he pretends like it is her that he needs and for what??? He says money but here’s a newsflash….I’m gonna have a boatload to share in two years and this just in..You don’t find happiness in THINGS and if you do, I don’t fucking want you. He’s going to die miserable and he doesn’t have to. They have NO kids and money and debt can be split. The only reason he’d have to stay married is love.
Or refusal to change your standard of living. I was never happier and more content than I was with a 500 dollar a month crackerbox that got me away from my husband and gave me the freedom to love who I fucking  chose to. The stupidest thing I did was come back here…home.
Today, he told me she “hasn’t been that bad lately” but she was apparently still bad enough to make him want MORE sex from outside sources.
He’s going to DIE with someone who has anger and resentment towards him. I would have run like a motherfucker when she was irritated and complaining and mean about caring for him after knee surgery, cuz imagine what abuse he will suffer if he’s helpless and under her care. She uses HIM to make her happy but when he isn’t able to do for her what he does now, she will let him suffer. I guarantee it. And he is sacrificing for this person what we all need for basic survival…love and affection and the promise that you will never leave them alone or let them hurt or suffer.
What the hell. This is my wake up call.
I do NOT want to do what he’s done.
There is NO amount of creature comforts that will keep me here until I’m his age, living this hell. It is NEVER too late to find love. My mother in law’s 81 yr old bestie just did.
It’s never too late for happiness and omg just feeling loved at the end of the day and having loving arms around you or a lap or breasts to sink into.
I’m getting out of this prison I live in.
Seeing his misery is the catalyst I needed to start digging, tunneling under the walls of MY OWN hellhole.
And this time, I’m using something bigger than a spoon.

My lover told me in the beginning of our affair that no other married man would treat me as well as or as decent as he would. 
I thought it was lip service because I didn’t know any different.
After this many years, I have seen a lot and I am sad to say that being treated poorly by an affair partner is so common that one who treats you humanely is considered the cream of the crop.
So, as far as affairs go, I had thought I hit the proverbial jackpot.
And I still think I did. I just lost it all at the track on a bad bet, the bet that he loved me too much to forsake me.
I wonder what his dating profile says…
I don’t want to go on the adult affair site and make a profile because I know JUST what the fuck I’m gonna catch there, besides chlamydia.
I am confident enough in my knowledge of those men to write a manual on the subject. I wouldn’t sugar coat it either.
The creepy, sickening, unadulterated truth is that all those men ARE the same. They are predators and you only exist to be the receptacle into which they deposit their jizz twice a week.
They can only fuck you during the day, and they will present this shit to you in resume’ format…compete with a list of strengths and weaknesses in regards to their sexual performance. The “ad” will read something like, “NSA affair wanted, can only meet during the day.”
This is because their boss is a lot easier to lie to than their wife! This means LOSING money is preferable to being interrogated by THAT suspicious cunt.
Oh, and don’t forget… These guys are paying upwards of 30 bucks an hour to be with your fat, tired ass so you better suck dick, too.
NSA, or No Strings Attached means that you should not plan on any type of emotional connection because they do not need that from you. You are not supposed to require ANY emotional work. You are for fun. You are supposed to be ready and willing and wet and aroused with little more than a few grunts, caveman style, and a dick pic.
Oh, and you are going to be HAPPY with that, because you are desperate for someone to make you feel good about yourself and they are banking on the fact that nobody has fucked you properly for the last year and you are in serious need of a deep down dirty banging.
This one might be my favorite…
“I’m not looking to change your situation OR mine”
No shit, you arrogant fuck.
Neither am I, or I would not be here dealing with your sleazy ass. I’d be getting a divorce, so I wasn’t on your level and forced to accept your bullshit story and deviant behavior.
With that famous line of crap,”Not looking to change your situation or mine”, you are insinuating that I’m less successful than you and have less to lose. You are also insinuating that you’re SO great and wonderful that I’m going to fall madly in love and demand you leave your wife and kids. Lastly, you are assuming I need a man to jump to before I ditch the old safety net of a husband I have at home.
(Sidenote!) You couldn’t be more wrong, you jack wagon. You are the means to an end and how I am gonna get MY rocks off now that my lover’s gone, so sit down, shut up and eat my pussy.
There ain’t ONE of em that can give you a factual first name and they sure in hell can’t give you a last name. They have to give you a fictional city of residence because the last affair got too attached and “stalked them.”
Nah, that’s code word for “she realized you’re a douchebag”, Dude.
Oh, forgot to enlighten you…she was banging on your door cuz she wanted to tell your wife you’re a louse and then beat your lying ass with a lead pipe so yeah, she’s psycho and you, Sir Pants On Fire, are a prick.
But, THAT’S their M.O., internet affair whores, and they’re sticking to it. It works for them and I guess for me, too, cuz I went along with some of it.
They don’t normally care if they find a woman like me, one that wants them for more than just sex…but MY lover DID.
He found one like me!… casually texting about the week’s work schedule so they could plan their rendezvous.
This was RIGHT after he left me…an hour after he physically got sex from me, he texted her to talk. So it’s NOT about frequency alone, it’s about him trying to build intimacy with someone other than me. He didn’t text me to see if I got home ok, or to say something sweet or sexy to remind me of our time together. Nope, he was busy that night hooking up a future date.
I know I have to let it go eventually, but it’s still too fresh to put into perspective, or to look back on and analyze.
It’s an agonizing exercise in self harm, the constant thinking about her and him together, or him and his last lover together and I’m so fucking stupid to believe this hasn’t been going on the whole time and just WHY let ME down?? What makes ME the girl whose meager dreams you scrap? Don’t you just wanna be one girl’s true hero, Baby? Why didn’t you love me and protect me? Do you know what I feel in my heart of hearts?
Betrayed.
Like my daddy brought me to the woods at night, then drove away and left me standing there alone, and I’m watching his taillights get smaller as he leaves me to the coyotes.
You betrayed me, Baby, and reduced me to an infantile, crying, sack of shit. You injured my pride beyond repair and all I ever did was worship you and the word you spoke.
Now you’ve tossed me out into a sea of sharks, and you don’t care what they want to do to me. You don’t care that they want to sully what is yours, YOUR Baby, and you don’t care that you’ve had me for so much of my adult life that I don’t remember anyone else’s touch.
You have fucked me up but good with this and you have made me feel so low, but I’m stronger than you are so I’m gonna be fine. I am stronger than you because I would NEVER let you suffer emotionally like that, alone and being fucking gaslighted by the person that you thought loved you. It is absolutely devastating to be disregarded and ignored and I didn’t think you’d ever be that kind of guy to me.
I didn’t expect to suffer this heartache at my age. I thought this didn’t happen if you still loved a man so much that after a decade,  when you close your eyes and kiss him, it feels like you’re spiraling down a tunnel of euphoria.
I thought that kind of love lasted.
But now I know different.
The moral of this story?
You’re never too old and wise to be dead ass wrong.

This love affair has always been what makes me capable of surviving another miserable married day, my salvation, what makes me feel good. 
Now, what I’ve always counted on to make me well is making me unwell.
I feel hurt and violated and not true to myself. I am going down the path of righteous self destruction, to make my wounded ego whole again. I know what lies at the bottom of a bottle and what’s hiding in a stranger’s bed, yet I am strangely drawn to the danger.
Like thin ice, if I skim along the surface really quickly, I might make it across. If I stumble, or pick the wrong bed, I’m gonna go through the ice and the cold water below will drown me on a bright winter day, face up and trapped under the clear ice with a perfect view of the sun I’ll never see again.
A stranger’s hands don’t love you and their lips are soft but their hearts are calloused and hard.
They don’t want to treat you nice and buy you beer and sushi. They want to blow out your carefully preserved pussy and destroy your tender ass and the worst part is, they don’t touch you gently and purposefully…They hold you down on your tummy so you can’t get away while they pound you relentlessly.
They leave marks.
And you mean nothing to them. If you cry they will turn the shower head to a higher setting so they won’t be bothered by your ridiculous suffering.
Don’t cry, because it will make you a victim.
But being a stranger’s victim hurts far less than being your lover’s victim.
Because I already knew I meant nothing to a stranger.
I wish I wouldn’t have read the break up texts that he saved screenshots of, supposedly to show me how little he meant to her. The texts that he thought would justify his claims of a barren affair rather than an emotional one didn’t invoke any feelings of relief.
Instead, it solidified just what I already suspected. Her text read “got off with my vibrator today but better with a real person, lol”
And I was sick immediately, my head filled with visions of him looking in her eyes and connecting with her as he GOT HER OFF, just like he does to me. I wonder if she has to ask him to look at her, like I do, or if it comes naturally to him because he finds her beautiful. 
She said “I know you had reservations in the beginning and we’ve tried to keep it almost clinical”
In the beginning when he and I started seeing each other, he said the same thing to Me. He said he’d never love me or invest feelings. Maybe that was designed to make me want him even more, his vocal claims of cold hearted unattainability.
The bottom line is that my lover may be done with me. He’s gotta find a transitional lover for when he retires and doesn’t have a chance to see me.
He cheated cuz he wants more sex.
But the problem is, he cheated rather than try to find a way to get more sex from me. He said, when asked, that it felt good to get attention from someone…someone…other than me.
I’m afraid I can never forget that I was not even in the running. I am no longer his baby and his princess and his first choice.
If he fooled me….there is NO hope for me and I NO LONGER believe in love.
Love is supposed to make you feel safe and secure, not give you traumatic visions of your favorite and most revered person looking into the eyes of another woman as he fingers her vagina and brings her to orgasm.
I don’t want his penis inside me knowing it’s been in her, because I don’t know who she has slept with!
And neither does he, I’m willing to bet.
I know in my heart that this is the turning point.
This means he’s never leaving his wife and that I’m just a temporary means to an end. Leaving is too much work and loss and change and I’m not worth it. That’s why he was tired of me and moving on to someone new that didn’t know his history. I…ME, would expect him to act on his misery by finally admitting that it is ME THAT HE NEEDS.
His  wife’s return was filling him with dread so he sought comfort in someone. Seeking comfort in me was no longer enough, and to make me a more regular fixture in his life meant hurting his wife and losing half of his things.
I wonder if he thought of me when he was looking down at her sucking his dick. I am going to think he is fantasizing about her every time I’m kneeling at his feet.
The same feet I lovingly washed and rubbed…like Jesus did to show humility to his disciples .
I wish he would have exercised some humility when he had his mouth on her pussy.
I want him to hurt like I do, but do I love him too much to inflict the revenge upon him that I feel in my heart? And even if I did, I wonder if it would punish ME and not HIM. He had already replaced me. He just couldn’t let me go until he was sure she was gonna work out.
I was one step away from being kicked to the curb.
Or rather, left laying in the middle of the street.

I sowed some oats. 
I have always half ass wondered why that old saying has weathered the years…until I sowed some oats.
I have wrestled with what good could come of me spilling all the gory details. I am afraid it will open a pandora’s box that was meant to stay shut forever.
I don’t feel any better and here is why.
Sowing my oats didn’t make the images that are forever burnt in my mind go away. The images of her are still there and it is hard to place trust in my lover.
But why would I?, You ask. He is not to be trusted and I should never see him again.
But I DID see him again, on Thursday.
Yes…one week and 800 texts later, I was sitting in the parking lot of a chain grocery store feeling like I was about to be naked in front of a thousand people, vulnerable and bare.
I HAD to see him, for closure, I told myself.
But it was to avoid closure, if we are being truthful. I wanted any reason in the world to forgive this man because I don’t want to live without him.
I also wanted to make him see just what my physical and emotional pain looked like up close. I was still flaming hot with anger and disbelief. And then I saw him, and what I thought would happen didn’t happen. I didn’t burst into tears as soon as I saw him. I stared at him long and hard and asked him why.
My lover was remorseful. Even HE questioned why he needs more and why nothing is ever enough. I don’t know the answer but I know that as soon as he knew his wife was coming home, he lost all will to be positive.
He was happy without her. He had a sparkle in his eye and he was enthusiastic about life…joyful. He had time to relax for a partial weekend with me every week and he would even say I was his mini vacation. We talked every night on the phone as if we were there together. He would come home and sit in his chair and talk to me while his house warmed up. Then, he would send me pictures of the dinner he had prepared for himself.
It was like we lived together but apart.
It was the most consistent and longest amount of time we have ever been able to spend together and he flourished with her gone.
I thought his good spirits were due in part to being able to spend so much time with me.  Looking back now with my wounded heart, I question if it was the other “other” woman that made his time alone so wonderful.
Regardless of who was making him happy, when his wife came home his mood plummeted. He was mean and testy. He snapped at me. He ignored and barely spoke or called.
He acquired instant seasonal depression and it’s no wonder, because hurricane season was about to hit home
At the end of summer, my lover claims he started an affair with the other “other” woman. I don’t know what to believe anymore.
I keep thinking that his getting another lover was him finally conceding that he will never leave his wife. He will just try to stop the bleeding until he hemorrhages and dies writhing at that bitch’s feet.
I guess a life well spent means different things to different people. At my lover’s age, I simply cannot wrap my mind around why he doesn’t want to salvage the life he has left and spend it being truly happy.
Maybe because he doesn’t need ME in his real life TO be happy. Maybe he is already happy and I’m the only one of us unhappy without the other.
If tomorrow I said … “come be with me, Baby. I’ll take care of you. You won’t be rich but you won’t be poor, and you’ll never be as loved as you will be in my bed, by me, Lover”, would he do it?
No.
Yet I could change his life and him mine, in monumental ways. We could give each other the greatest gift in the world.
Instead we go years and years giving each other hand me down love, and concentrating our efforts on people that don’t give back or fulfill our needs.
Still, I met him in a parking lot exactly one week after he broke my heart more than any other man ever has.
I don’t know if my lover was crying crocodile tears or the real deal. I guess time will tell.
I’ve given him the best years of my life.
But that’s just it, THESE are the best years of our lives and these are the years that we need someone who loves us most, because we will need love and care as we age.
Somehow, all my fears are coming to life. He was setting the stage to replace me for good.
I can’t help but think my lover’s other affair is the answer to how he’s gonna survive without me.
But how will I survive?
When the trial run almost killed me.

I’m losing it.
Last night I hung out at a hotel and partied with my friend Donny. I met him a year ago on a website while looking for a three way partner, and oddly enough, we didn’t hook up then, but we did become friends. I’ve written about him before.
I partied and used some drugs I have not used since the 80s. I don’t think he has either, because his texts this morning made it sound like he was in worse shape than I was.
Why we did that, l don’t know. I think we were both nervous and thought it might ease any awkwardness of being alone together.
We drank too much, and we had previously hatched an idea, Donny and I, that I would dominate him and that any receiving on my part was completely at my discretion. He made it very clear that he wanted to reciprocate and I made it very clear that I wasn’t sure I’d feel close enough to let him.
I don’t need to give details, but Donny is a natural submissive and he went down easily. What I learned from this experience is three fold. 1), You don’t hurt your lover by fucking a friend…2), you don’t hurt a friend by pleasuring them for revenge against your lover, and 3), I’m a switch, with or without R. I could survive as totally submissive, but if given the choice, it’s my ideal relationship to switch back and forth.
Donny isn’t my forever lover. I have him pegged as selfish and arrogant. He and I are a volatile mix, with me being a nurturer and Donny being pragmatic as fuck. We have fought real battles and he hurt my feelings by once saying I wasn’t “girlfriend” material because I had a husband and a lover and no time to devote to him or anyone else.
After it was over, and I had defiled Donny in a few ways, we laid in bed and Donny said “tell me what makes you feel good, like a woman. I want to do it for you.”
I told him what R. does to me and how he holds me and gets me off with his fingers and when I orgasm, how he looks in my eyes.
It’s not necessarily that I wanted or needed that from Donny, it’s just that it is safe to me and requires little exposure…vulnerability.
So after some quick rearranging and an arm under me, Donny did just what I asked for. I said very little to him other than “It’s not where a normal woman’s is…it’s shallow” in response to what I knew to be a lofty attempt at finding it, the elusive “G” spot, and it took me a long time to cum…a LONG time…because I couldn’t stop thinking about how it DIDN’T feel, being held and cradled by Donny. Both of us had a hard time keeping our eyes open and maintaining eye contact.
I did NOT see love reflected back at me in Donny’s eyes when I had my hard won orgasm, and I missed my lover so desperately that for me, that’s the second the party was over. I wanted to go home and be alone.
I longed to be held and nuzzled and I missed my cue to let it go. I just wanted my lover’s warm hands on me and his voice, low and murmuring in my ear. I wanted to hear him say he still loves me and that I am not bad and that I’m important to him. I want this to stop hurting and it won’t. It fucking hurts so bad and he can’t be here to be sorry or to hold me and I’m still pissed. And defeated.
I thought Donny wanting me would make me feel better…but it didn’t…it made me feel worse and confirmed the fact that I’m just a good time girl that nobody deems worthy of being a real partner.
And for those of you thinking that I’m not owning up to fucking Donny, let me make it clear that everything I outlined above is egregious enough on its own, and having someone’s fingers in your vagina is no different than their penis. It’s a betrayal, either way, and there is no line in the sand that says if you go this far, or don’t go that far, it isn’t truly cheating.
I may be leaving a few details out, but it was sex nonetheless, and my lover’s claim that no penis in the vagina lessens the crime is NOT true; it does not. I cheated. There were a few reasons we did not have full blown sex.
I’m not sure when I’m going to stop being numb over this. It is so hard for me to open up. I had just finally re-mastered it, with my lover’s careful coaxing and encouragement, his reassurance and patience. What a gift he gave me. And I could not fully understand that it’s about the pleasure you give away and how the reciprocation of that pleasure validates both party’s need and desire for the other…until now. I finally get it and I appreciate that he’s the one that has taken the time to make me feel ok about it. Now I’m ready.
I just want to go home to my lover’s arms…go back in time before this happened to when I felt like his special girl and the one he adored.
Back to when I was safe.
I have guilt, for doing what I said I wasn’t gonna do. I am ashamed that I hurt my baby, and the mean way I served up justice after leading him to believe he was safe.
I sent him a picture of liquor and drugs with a message saying I was partying with Donny. I did this when he was trying to make amends to me. It was as if the damaged demon inside me demanded and extracted revenge. I still can’t believe I did that.
I’m fucking SICK that I DID. I NEVER in a million years thought I would want to do this to my lover…DARE to do this to my lover. He is my God. If you told me I would do this to him someday, I would never believe you.
I DID this to the LOVE of my life. I hate myself. There is no salvation for me and I literally feel like I’m going crazy. I don’t know why I can’t pull myself together. I feel so impulsive, like the proverbial rug has been pulled out from under me.
He predicted I would go to Donny. He actually gave me the idea, and whether or not I desired Donny didn’t matter. My lover knows me the best. He knows I will only engage in sex with someone that I have established some sort of comfort level and familiarity with. He says HE doesn’t need that comfort level to have sex with another woman, but I think he is lying. His actions say otherwise.
On an odd note, my lover is trying to make light of my bad decision, maybe to make me less upset about doing it?… but it’s coming off as callous and like he finds entertainment value in it. My distress is killing me tonight. What if I was right and it hurt me more than it hurt him to know I was with someone else. Maybe he feels less guilt knowing I tried to even the score.
Maybe I am finally worth nothing to anyone but myself…and even SELF worth is iffy at the moment.
Now, I am dealing with the fall out. I am sick and sad tonight, and again the tears come easily.
I reacted to my pain, and now, much like the mushroom cloud after a nuclear explosion, my anguish is coming, but it’s delayed just long enough for me to underestimate it’s powerful boom and latent destruction.
I wanted, deep in my heart, to somehow drive home to my lover the horrible way in which he made me feel.
But you don’t punish. And you don’t exact revenge. And today I am ashamed of my character but open and honest about the raw pain I feel inside of me.
What I did was especially cruel, because I had ALL night to think about it. I had time to think about the circumstances my decision may bring, and I was aware of the emotional pain it would cause another person. A person I claim to love.
And I did it anyway, for such selfish and vain reasons.
They call that premeditated.
In court, that’s an automatic life sentence and in some cases, the death penalty.
I feel like I’m about to meet my maker, and like I’m seconds away from the lethal injection that will stop my heart from beating forever.
What I DON’T want is a stay of execution.
Because living with what I’ve done may be a fate worse than death.

I normally look at those women who stay with serial cheaters and I have disdain for them, my lover’s wife included.
Now, I am in their club, the one nobody wants to belong to. I became one of them when I met my lover in that parking lot last week, and then at a motel where we had mad, passionate sex and I’m not even sure why.
He never missed a beat.
I met him again yesterday, but this time I had spent a week thinking about it and letting it sink in. I spent a lot of nights awake, running on caffeine and xanax and pouring my heart out in this diary.
Did my lack of bestowing consequences for my lover’s indiscretion send a message that it’s ok for him to do it again? If he does, I will have no choice but to leave him and I’m so afraid he is going to put me in that horrible position where I have to keep my word about zero tolerance.
I worry. I’m petrified that the threat of losing me is not enough and he will break my heart again before it has had a chance to recover from the last blow.
I have this horrible impending sense of doom, and then comes the panic attack and it isn’t because of betrayal. it’s straight up separation anxiety.
When he’s there and I can see him, feel him, listen to him and be held by him, it’s ok and good and I feel like I can heal.
Then he’s gone and the anger flashes because I need his reassurance so much right now…to believe in him.
Yesterday the numbness had worn off and I was feeling…feeling so much and so intensely that I shivered and sobbed as I berated my lover and threatened to replace him. My whole body was shaking as I spit my poison words in his face, and then it was over and I buried my face in his chest and sobbed.
And he held me.
I want to forgive my lover so very badly and still maintain my dignity and integrity. I need him to be the man I need him to be.  He has always been the man I needed him to be when it counted and even when it didn’t.
Over the years, he’s been generous about so many things. Lenient. Understanding. He allowed me a female lover for over a year and when it started to threaten our relationship, he stepped up his game and spent two years absolutely doting on me, lavishing me, and trying to secure a position in my life at the top of the heap.
He made me feel so WORTHY.
He busted his ass and pulled out all the stops. He was above and beyond attentive and insightful and most of all, he made it known he didn’t intend to lose me.
For the past six months, I had no idea he needed more. I just knew something changed. It panicked me and when he pulled away, I was spending a lot of time on the internet, flirting. I KNEW his mental state and his personality were shifting and I felt him slipping away.
I’m not excusing myself. I openly showed him chats where other men sent pics. I did this in bed and looking back, that is so cruel and disrespectful. Maybe I made him feel inadequate when in reality, he was SO far above adequate that I was trying to hold on to him by making him jealous.
When he really needed to feel wanted.
Maybe asking me for more sex worried him, because he always treats me with such reverence. Maybe he didn’t want to rock the boat, or put any undue stress on me or maybe he just plain got tired of me, bored. Maybe it cost too much time and money to see me more often, making the alternative seem more appealing.
Did I get complacent?  Is it my turn to give him what he needs rather than punish?. My turn to make HIM feel worthy?
Because he had me on such a pedestal, I had a false sense of security. He is such a good partner to me on a daily basis. He is consistent as fuck. I think that was why it was so hard to believe he did it and so easy to want to forgive him. Because he is good and wonderful, typically.
I am totally unaccustomed to him letting me down. I really am. He’s my superhero.
This is why it still hurts. This is why I can’t believe it.
I want my baby back.
Better yet, I want to go back to when I knew he’d never leave.

Today my lover sent a text saying he was going to be working late and my mind immediately thought of him admitting that he and the “other ” other woman (who will from now on be referred to as OOW) used to meet early in the week. I always saw him at the END of the week. He had ALL his bases covered AND loaded, and was probably working on a grand slam.
I felt sick as soon as I saw the message…like, immediately.
I asked him if he was going to meet her, under the guise of “working late” and he immediately defended himself, and gave me the option to call him at work. When I didn’t, he called me.
I felt stupid and pathetic and Damn, that man has hurt my pride. He has made me challenge the way I look at myself. My confidence is shaken. I don’t eat and I don’t drink sugary drinks. I’m obsessed with losing weight. I see every wrinkle and my fucking heart is hemorrhaging.
What a horrible thing to do to someone, because now, every time he makes a joke or a comment, I think he is alluding to me being not as attractive as I should be.
I can’t do what his wife does and question every place he goes and smell him when he comes home to see if he has used hotel shampoo instead of the brand at home. I can’t call him to check up on him and demand his servitude as proof of his remorse. I can’t inspect his body and smell his breath to see if it smells like another woman’s vagina and according to him, his wife has done all that and more.
If that’s true, It’s pathetic. It’s pathetic that she has done that and pathetic that he has allowed her to. That’s sick and toxic and abusive.
I will NEVER give him that much power over me and my ego. I will NEVER let him do that to me… make me that woman. Never fucking ever. I don’t think I have it in me to surrender to that helpless, powerless way of thinking  like she has. She’s miserable. I don’t want to be like her. I want to be better.
This next part is gonna be up to me. I’m gonna have to rise above it. I am going to have to love myself enough to say if he hurts me again, it’s his loss. I have a lovely face and a sharp brain. I have wit and charisma. I’m fucking worthy.
Tonight, I felt a jab from an innocent comment he made. I don’t want to dissect his every word to find the suspected criticism hidden within. I want to love and adore him.  I want to feel loved and secure and sexy and wanted and protected like I always have. I took it for granted and now that it’s gone, I have a gaping void. For the first time in this relationship, I am feeling fragile.
It does not feel familiar or comfortable and I don’t ever want it to.
I need my self esteem. I can’t give it away, for fucks sake. I hate how this feels…to feel inadequate or unwanted or used up. I’ve always felt sexy and my lover made me feel that way.
He used to look at me with adoration.
Now, it’s like he’s looking right through me.
I wonder what he sees on the other side of me. I wonder what he sees through the hole in the middle of my soul.
Maybe she’s standing behind me, beckoning for him to step right through me and take her to bed.
Please God, help me not feel like this. Make me strong and beautiful and fearless. My self esteem is all I have left…my identity…my own self worth. Don’t let me lose that, too.
I don’t want to be reckless and put myself at risk in my quest to feel better.
Help me love myself.
And help me love my enemy even more.
Because right now, they are one in the same.

My husband was diagnosed years ago with Avoidant Personality Disorder and a few other things, but the worst is the APD. 
What that means is that he will avoid not only confrontation, but all other means of communication and intimacy as well.
People with APD turn down promotions at work and in life, and they don’t take chances for fear of failure. They choose one safe person and have very few other interpersonal relationships and the ones they DO have are lacking intimacy and depth. Most, like my husband, have no friends, no peer group.
They are introverted and oftentimes abuse substances because it helps them to overcome the abnormal inhibition they feel. Alcohol helps them feel normal but alcoholism is a progressive disease so that is a dangerous dance.
All of our married life my husband has been this way. I would beg and plead for him to talk about our problems, as did two marriage counselors, but he was never able to overcome it. He would literally turn his back on me and any request to discuss our feelings not only fell on deaf ears but was met with absolute silence.
Attempts at communication were futile and I accepted that over time, and stopped trying. I held my feelings of anger and frustration and resentment IN, and learned that it was best and easiest to be quiet. We eventually stopped arguing because I gave up.
And so it went, with me living my clandestine life and him pretending like I wasn’t.
Sometimes my husband is mean. A lot of the time he’s condescending. He needs to be in control to a fault, right down to the food we eat and being the sole grocery shopper. I avoid talking to him. Our life is sad.
He’s also a good person, afflicted and afraid of change and perceived failure. He’s afraid to be alone.
In early November we went to see our daughter. She lives two hours away in a huge city. Driving there was nerve wracking and my husband was critical and I snapped after hours of his back seat driving and direct orders. We fought. I screamed and he screamed. We said hurtful things, and I can’t forgive him for what he said. It was so degrading. He called me stupid.
I’m stupid alright, for putting up with your shit…that’s what I wanted to say and pretty much did.
When we got home, I slept in our spare bedroom. I had done that often, but not every night. There were several nights that my husband slept on the couch, for comfort reasons. We were only sleeping in the same bed maybe one night a week.
The following day, I moved into the spare bedroom completely and have been solely sleeping there for going on three months now.
 I looked on google and read that separating yourself entirely from your spouse (and your dead bedroom) by no longer sharing a bed will force a confrontation or provoke change. It’s basically a wake-up call to the offending partner in a sexless marriage. I am in NO way suggesting my husband is the sole offender in this relationship, but it is him that is bothered by our complete separation…not me.
Now… has he SAID he’s bothered, or been moved enough to initiate conversation?
In short, no.
But while my two daughters were here over Christmas, I had to sleep in our bedroom with him.
It was the most uncomfortable three nights of my life. Sleeping together was indeed the only way my husband could ever express any affection towards me, by draping his arm around me and rubbing my body. It was the only time he was actually nice to me and I can’t help but wonder if it was because at night, he could let his guard down and there was no audience to convince.
I fail to find the words to describe how I felt, lying there next to him on Christmas Eve, but the closest I can get is “violated.”  When he was aware that I would be sleeping with him, he showered and I changed the sheets and pillowcases. I felt a sick sense of dread when he crawled into bed next to me.
I prayed he wouldn’t touch me but he took the opportunity because I think he misses that tiny bit of human touch he DID accept or seem to want from me previously. There is no going back for me. He needed to change a long time ago and sadly, it has taken him this long to acknowledge and speak the words out loud…the words “It’s not you, it’s me.”
He said that, In the form of an apology after I confronted him when he was being verbally abusive last week… and after I had demanded a divorce.
Just like the self help websites said, the partner in a loveless, sexless marriage eventually leaves the bedroom as a form of self preservation. For me, it is a way of taking back my power and deciding that independence trumps the fear and the bitter loathing I have for the man that deemed me unworthy of so much.
He is very quiet these days and I see remorse. His anger appears to have left the building. I wonder just what he laid there thinking about in the dark these past three months, REALLY alone for the first time in 30 years.
I’m done. No forgiveness. Zero tolerance.
How did it finally fucking feel to lose me and how the fuck does it taste to get a mouthful of your own righteous bullshit?
How’s it feel NOW, huh?!
I slept fitfully through all three of those nights. I woke up every time he touched me and there was no grogginess, just white hot anger.
I know what moving into my own space did for me. It reinforced the fact that I desperately need and want to be free from him. With the absence of sleeping together, I gained some form of control and self worth and I am never going back to his bedroom.
I’ll fucking die before I toss and turn and dodge his hands and arms all night again…and WHY is he touching me when it should be clear that I don’t want him to, by the fact that I MOVED out of the downstairs of our house?!
Every time he pulled me close my body tensed up and my skin crawled and I wanted to scream in protest and spit in his face but I couldn’t. I laid there silently and felt VIOLATED. And Nauseated. And furious.
Touching a woman that screamed in your face demanding a divorce less than a week?
Avoidant is an understatement.
This arrogant dick just doesn’t get it.
My body is now forever my own.
I will NEVER put myself through that again. I will NEVER lay in bed with him…EVER.
I think moving out of his presence and into my own space was the best and most meaningful gift I have ever given MYSELF.
Merry Christmas to me.
It’s about fucking time.

I just emerged from a long bath. It feels good to be clean. Every time I shower or bathe late at night, I am haunted by a memory.
I am very close to my two female cousins on my dad’s side. They are older than me by about seven yrs and ten years, respectively. They are the two daughters of the Aunt that I loved so much, the Aunt that passed away three years ago.
I am haunted by a story told to me by my Mom, the story of my cousin’s cries the night she frantically phoned my dad to tell him his sister had passed. It was the middle of the night. We had been taking turns staying with my aunt at her bedside but she was not expected to die the night she did and my cousin had the unfortunate experience of being there alone when it happened.
When we all got to the hospice house, my cousin was clearly in shock and she kept repeating the same thing. She said that my aunt asked the hospice nurse to let her take a bath or a shower right before she passed.
As she laid on her deathbed, all she wanted was to be clean.
That nurse did what my aunt asked and she wheeled her to the shower where she helped her wash her sick body for the last time.
When she came back to her bed, she had a smile on her face and she looked different. Softer. Smaller. Peaceful.
She looked at my cousin and my cousin asked, “how do you feel, Mom?”
To which my aunt replied, “I feel wonderful.”
And with that, she closed her eyes and never opened them again.
Her death taught me so much about life.
She never wavered in her love for me. She never shamed me or berated me or cast me aside like my parents did when I needed them most. She taught me about pride and why it was important to have some. She taught me that I possess inner strength I can call on.
I miss her so much and I feel alone without her. There is never a day that goes by that I don’t think about her and the physical ache in my heart never goes away.
I need her so much right now.
I feel broken and battered and scared and weak.
I feel tired and empty and alone.
I feel sick and wasted and unimportant and gullible and stupid.
But I am clean. And being clean makes me feel vulnerable. I’m sitting here in the dark with damp hair crying big fat tears, naked save for a t-shirt, and I feel like I don’t mean anything to anyone anymore. That’s a lot of “any’s.”
I’ve never been the woman that is protected by a man that loves her. I’m the one that is expected to be strong and forgiving and resilient and obedient. I’m expected to give more than I take and be happy with what I get for the sake of someone else’s fucking happiness and at the expense of my own.
Over and over my aunt tried to instill in me that I was the only one responsible for my life and that the only one I could depend on to look out for me was ME, and she urged me to practice self care and live a bit selfishly.
She wanted me to learn from her mistakes and never have to experience the pain of my own self destructive or careless actions. She wanted to save me from myself because she loved me, but she had to have known deep down that I had to make my own mistakes to gain the wisdom and confidence she had.
She hard core taught me how to be both the sexiest AND the classiest woman in the room and I’m so lucky to have had her for my example…right down to her secret show stopper for my uncle’s fancy business dinners….Creme de menthe cake made with liqueur and extra fancy shaved chocolate ribbons.
She gave me a love of books and she is the reason I tell my stories with a flourish and a twinkle in my eye. She preached the importance of education or skilled trades and making my own money.
So, when I take a shower before I lay down to sleep, I am struck with the realization that I know exactly how she felt when she died.
I know the physical sensation she felt right after the last water she’d ever feel washed over her skin.  I know the familiar sense of peaceful well being that soap and water brings.
I wish I knew what she was thinking, in her mind, before she closed her eyes.
Because then we will have shared one last secret.
The one person who would always love me and have only MY best interests at heart is gone forever.
What I did NOT know then was that I had just quite literally lost the ONLY person I would ever be able to trust.
I’m on my own.

47,https://www.opendiary.com/m/kaleidoscope-eyes/hey-soul-sister-7-5962401/,2021-02-06,Hey Soul Sister,"
My best friend has cancer. 
What started out as a hysterectomy and a hopeful prognosis just turned into a nightmare.
The pathology report came back and the cancer has spread to her ovaries, lymph nodes and abdomen. She will need 22 weeks of chemotherapy and radiation.
I read the words “50% cure rate” and my whole world just stopped for a few moments.
That was five hours ago.
I can’t breathe.
I might die along with her. Please not MY best friend. She is the only person I know besides my Mom that loves me without restrictions… unconditionally…and I never doubted her love and I’ll never have to.
That gift may be taken from me too soon and I’m not sure I can handle it. My heart is frozen in fear.
She’s not JUST a person. She’s MY person. She’s so much more than just a friend. We share a fierce and passionate love that has stood the test of time. She’s part of me.
 Whenever I fuck up, she’s there to pretend like I didn’t and to help me pick up the pieces of myself that were usually broken by someone else. She will always find me worthy. She’s seen my tears and held me when I’ve been faced with awful things.
She knows every single one of my secrets.
Every. Single. Awful. One.
We’ve talked about taboo subjects, we’ve admitted fears and we’ve opened our hearts up to each other so wide that I’m not sure where HER kids start and MINE end. Somehow it feels like we raised them together and they are ours.
I’m sick to my stomach and I cannot think clearly.
I helped her care for her Mom when she was at the end of her battle with cancer. Single Handedly, we helped her through the process of dying and nothing has affected me more profoundly. I have flashbacks and nightmares, but I could NOT have abandoned her and the thought never crossed my mind to flee, but rather, to protect her from any further agony. I wanted to feel the hurt for her so she didn’t have to, because I couldn’t stand how it tore her up. As hard as it was for me, it was a thousand times harder for her and I still remember the look on her face when her mom took a big breath and then never breathed again.
Now I might have to watch her suffer the same fate only I don’t know if I can do it.
But I don’t have a choice. I can’t and won’t look the other way and refuse to face such a painful reality. She is me. If she can’t escape this, neither can I.
I knew when I met her that it was a love affair of sorts. I knew we would be bound for life and I know this sounds corny but it felt like we had known each other all our life within minutes of meeting.
She’s not as smart as me, but that has never been a barrier in our relationship because so much else clicked and the pureness in her beautiful soul radiated outward and touched everyone in its path including me.
I’m scared beyond what I thought was humanly possible.
Sick and frozen and helpless and scared fucking shitless and the worst part is, who do I talk to or get comfort from if it isn’t HER?
I’m totally and utterly alone in my grief.
Fifty percent survival rate.
My cup is half empty.
And my well has run dry.

48,https://www.opendiary.com/m/kaleidoscope-eyes/faith-healer-5962414/,2021-02-06,Faith Healer,"
I’ve been afraid to post entries because my lover is privy to reading these most private thoughts. I must always be aware of his feelings, even though he tells me not to hold back and he promises NOT to hold anything I say against me.
But I am still afraid. I’m afraid he will leave me.
If I upset him enough to drive him away, I’ll be committing emotional suicide, and here is why.
I have never felt more alone in my life than I do right now.
I am basically my cancer stricken best friend’s family, which consists of a mentally impaired daughter, an aging father and one selfish, albeit normal son. She inherited her mom’s house and she and her husband had a very broken marriage and have lived apart for seven years. They are currently in the beginning stages of a long overdue divorce.
The catalyst to their merciful breakup was an affair, started by my best friend with some rag tag dude associated with the motley crew she hired to roof her house.
That’s not even the best part.
This guy is a twice convicted sex offender with one of his victims being 13 and the other, 7.
Yes. Seven.
That wasn’t a typo. I wrote it correctly.
This is the same woman that wouldn’t let her grandkids play on the local playground at dusk, for fear of human traffickers, which is ludicrous, because we live in a town of four thousand. Now, her grandkids can’t be anywhere near her. She’s been a willing accomplice in her special needs daughter’s quest to knock herself up as many times as humanly possible, which has resulted in six kids that have been sired by what she says is the same man, but I believe otherwise so he MUST, too.
Maybe that’s why he’s never around and missed all six births.
I saw the hurricane brewing and it all finally blew, leaving ME to pick up the pieces of her daughter’s mangled life. I did this NOT to cover my girlfriend’s ass, but because I genuinely love her daughter like my own child. She IS my own child because my best friend is the other part of me. I’ve watched her grow up and was an active participant in her life.
Last weekend, exactly six months after my girlfriend jumped ship and probably as she lay fucking her pedo boyfriend, CPS was taking all six of her grandkids while I stood by consoling her hysterical child.
Her soon to be ex had left a bruise on the child’s arm, which was reported by school, and thank God it is a law that they do so. What kind of loser bruises their autistic grandkid?
So, I am alone, and aware that my best friend has gone mad and lost her fucking mind and I can’t believe how deeply it has affected me. I’m reluctant to talk to my lover about my problems because I’d rather focus on being happy than complaining, seeing as how I may be on borrowed time.
I wrote and wrote, but I didn’t post. The more I worried about upsetting him, the further inside myself I recoiled, and the more isolated I felt.
A few days ago I woke up and realized that with the absolute and total exception of my children, and maybe my lover, I have nothing left to lose.
I lost my husband years ago. So many years ago that I forgot what it felt like to have loved him. And he made damn sure I stayed in a steady state of amnesia by being a drunken, verbally and occasionally physically abusive prick for most of our marriage.
I lost my business because I didn’t treat my depression.
I’ve lost my best friend to a mid life crisis.
The only thing I have left to lose is faith.
It is hard to put what little is left of my faith in my lover’s promise of fidelity.
I feel like I’m standing in a giant spotlight, naked and vulnerable and at the mercy of everyone, including a God I am most afraid to believe in.
And the one person I trusted to wrap his arms around me and cover me with a blanket is long fucking gone, jamming his dick into some whore of the month because my ass is too fat and I’m yesterday’s news.
I gave my lover the best years of my life, and to repay me, he got himself a side piece…because I had lost my fucking touch I guess.
But now? What am I good for now?
If it isn’t pussy or a bj I’m good for then where does my value lie?
I know the answer to that, but to say it out loud would end my life as I know it. If I say it out loud, it means I acknowledge that I am a tawdry, shameful secret and that I love a man that frequently threatens me with the possibility of losing him immediately and forever should he be discovered having an affair with me.To say those words to someone you claim to love is a direct contradiction of said love.
To tell your lover that she’s history if it comes down to your wife knowing about her is a very fucking hurtful thing to utter.
He silently holds her above me while he watches me on my knees pleasing him.
It’s like she’s there watching, laughing at me because now I’ve done what SHE perceives as her “dirty work” like a puppet on a string. In her head she’s so much smarter than me.
And my lover feels likewise in his head. He got to keep his lifestyle and his reputation and he was gonna wrap up his affair career with a new girlfriend. One to replace ME.
Maybe my lover and his wife belong together because they are both equally awful to each other and self serving to boot.
I’m just a stupid pawn in their toxic game.
A sick game.
Where nobody plays fair.
And everyone’s fair game.

When he put his hands on the other “other” woman, It killed part of me..and I want that part BACK.
My pride is directly related to my self esteem. When my lover’s wife came home last spring, she brought with her an ugly cloud full of poison that rained acid on his heart. He could not breathe his fiery ire back in her face, because he didn’t want to inflict any damage upon her that might end up as permanent. To avoid that, he was mean to me instead. He snapped and scowled. He withdrew. He became an angry stranger.
I am expected to forgive and move along without using guilt as retribution.
And I have. I have not questioned or punished or reminded or cried or scolded or rubbed his face in it.
He said it wasn’t anything I did and that there isn’t anything wrong with me.
But maybe in my heart I believe it WAS something I did and there is a LOT of stuff wrong with me. I miss the days when his eyes saw me as sexy. Now they look right through me.
I want to run and hide because he has vocalized his wife’s physical flaws many times as of recently, so maybe physical beauty means more to him than he says it does. Maybe vanity is his mistress.
I am haunted by the thought that if HE doesn’t love me enough to keep what’s between us sacred, and to find me eternally beautiful, then nobody ever will. That inflicted a horrible kind of pain inside me and for a minute, I knew what it felt like to be his wife.
But I put out. Willingly.
She did not put out, willingly OR otherwise. That’s what he said set me apart from her, the fact that I truly enjoyed sex and wanted what I knew he could give me.
But now I don’t know what to believe, because that fact didn’t get me a pass to avoid his infidelity.
When he found someone else, he robbed me of the unique joy that his love brought into my life. That joy infused me with a spark that was ready to ignite whatever sexual accelerant he poured around me.
I loved being a vixen and a temptress and a delightfully naughty slut that belonged only to him. I loved the feeling it brought me and I liked to look good for him. Always, in the back of my mind, I dressed to turn him on and excite him.
Why did he want to be with someone else? Why won’t I allow my eyes to see what is in front of me, the cold hard fact that I was/am being replaced because I have come to expect something from my lover that he isn’t willing to provide? Is he MOVING on to someone he can start over with, easily, with no complications or expense, with no expectations or desire to be anything other than his blow job queen?
What about me?…his Baby?
I CAN’T GET THE MENTAL IMAGE OF THEM OUT OF MY HEAD, OR THE FEELING OF BETRAYAL OUT OF MY SOUL.
I did everything right and he still hurt me.
I’ve buried the pain and moved on with a precarious semblance of normalcy. I don’t want to face what happened. I did not punish him. I did not withhold affection from him.
I forgave him and allowed him to pretend like it didn’t happen.
I am just waiting for the day to come when he makes another mistake via text and kills what’s left between us.
Waiting for him to finish me off.
Except I’m not in a state of fear and dread, I’m in a state of impending pain. I’m literally waiting to see if this time could hurt more than the last two.
I feel as if I’m being hoodwinked, like the corporate guy that connects the dots too late and realizes as he’s being fired that he trained his own replacement.
I feel like he knows something that I don’t, and I think he’s gonna try to keep me in the dark and juggle two of us at once and he’s gonna be a lot more silent than usual to minimize the risk of fucking up.
He’s just one mistake away from stomping the fuck out of what is left of my heart, and the worst part of that is that I’m afraid to put any belief in him for fear that doing so might make it hurt worse when it all comes to fruition.
He’s essentially put me right between a rock and a hard place. There is a bomb falling from the sky and I have to dodge it or risk being crushed to death by my misplaced trust.
Maybe that’s where Purgatory lies, in between that rock and a hard place.
If that ends up as truth, just end my suffering right then and there.
And send me straight to Hell.

I wish I had a normal relationship with R.
But I need to accept things the way they are and it is foolish to think he may change his mind, because that would be an invitation for certain hurt.
It hurts in the here and now, because what has become natural to us as a couple is in reality, unnatural. It is natural for two people that love each to have a comfortable and easy rapport, especially after many years together, and we have that.
It is not natural to have to wait to talk to one another and it is not natural to communicate electronically and have to wait for resolution to problems or have to experience strong emotions or passion, but to be unable to talk it out.
These are few of the constraints in our relationship.
Sometimes fingers fly and the keypad is the enemy as the words get jumbled and taken out of context.
It’s difficult, and there are days I just long to be able to hug him and look at him and ask him a normal question and get a normal response, all while relishing in the joy of being face to face. Later on we could take a bath together and kiss, then dry off and wrap up in each other until morning comes around…in a perfect world.
Some days we ARE face to face for a few hours. But the questions from days earlier are lost in the excitement of being near each other and the questions that beg for normalcy go unanswered.  For those few hours, I forget the words and my brain is at peace, because he is there next to me.
When my lover found another affair partner in addition to me, I knew why he did it.
He had given up any hope he had of leaving his wife. He gave up on the thought of freedom, and the fear of change and loss made him search for an alternative to leaving his wife and that alternative was blossoming, until my discovery threw a monkey wrench into it. That alternative was another woman to have sex with and NOT an honest discussion with me about how we could change the situation between us and finally be together.
Him seeking another person made me have to face the truth and it confirmed definitively that we will always be stuck right where we are. Not that where we are is bad, it just isn’t ever going to be like a normal, loving relationship where you share complex things like a network of friends and family…or dinner in my home or his. It will always be seen as dirty and tarnished, our love for each other all these years will never be envied or respected or valued by others. It’s a shame and I wonder why we both stayed in bad marriages.
I’m still married, and I plan on initiating a divorce in 18 months, but I’d leave today if it meant having an extra 18 months to be with my lover in real life.
It will be the hardest thing I’ve ever done but I’ll do it, cuz my life is worth something too, and I deserve a little happiness for all the giving and sacrificing I’ve done for others. I deserve a few years of peace and the freedom to love who I want to and make independent decisions.
I think the ship has sailed when it comes to finding someone that treats me how R treats his wife. I also know in my heart that I will never find another love like I have with him. He is my greatest love.
I have always told him that, that I’m his greatest love and him, mine. Somehow I don’t think he understood the meaning behind my words.
I bought a pair of red boots to soothe my soul. They are like salve on a wound.
My last purchase was a sexy, curve hugging red dress. Something about heartache and anxiety and fear and victory ALL make me see red. A lot of feelings begin and end with the color red.
Red like fire. Bold and flashy. Like a force to be reckoned with. Like a sultry velvet curtain in a darkened theatre.
Like the deepest red rose, the one with the longest thorn. 
Like the fruit of a temptress.
Like Anger.
Like a beating heart.
Or one that lies bleeding.
Red is the color of a robust life and deep passionate desire.
I haven’t always loved the color red.
But when your life is black, you lose sight of color and how the different colors make you feel. When that happens, red is there to wake you up.
And lead you to the outer edge of the rainbow.

I know my lover won’t leave his wife and the time has come for me to really and truly accept it. 
I need to accept it and accepting it will mean the end of hope and the end of my dreams, because every woman wants to be with the man she loves more than just a few hours a week.
I have accepted this, too, and I know that I am willingly participating in an affair to get what I need to cope with and survive a bad marriage.
I’m the same boat and yet I’m in a different boat than my lover is. I’m not all that invested in keeping my husband happy because he isn’t invested in keeping ME happy, and I’ve decided that my happiness MATTERS.
Neither is R’s wife. She’s not invested at all in keeping him happy but he is a martyr for her and always tries to “anticipate her needs” so he can be her superhero. And he says he does it because if he doesn’t, she will treat him poorly. Bullshit. He does it because he loves her and she treats him poorly most of the time irregardless.
I have often wondered if he would kill me to keep her from knowing. Would he watch me die at his hands to erase any trace of me or to make sure she never found out about me?
It would be so easy for him and nobody would know. I don’t tell anyone where I am going when I meet him secretly.
It’s hard not to imagine it happening when I see his actual FEAR of upsetting her. It makes me sick to see him try and fail repeatedly, and to hear him lament over and over how he’s to blame for her unhappiness.
He doesn’t seem to care or understand how it makes me feel to hear him suffer and bemoan the fact that she won’t return the love he SWEARS HE DOESN’T HAVE FOR HER.
Which is utter bullshit and he must think I’m fucking stupid and can’t or won’t see it.
His argument is that I do the same thing in reference to my spouse but I know that isn’t the truth. I know it isn’t the truth because I don’t CARE enough about my spouse to FEEL hurt or angry about his refusal to change or try. I simply don’t care enough to spend that much time on it.I don’t expect or want his attention therefore I don’t feel any sort of emotional connection to him. He doesn’t now and has not ever done for me half the things R does for his wife.
He used to tell me not to waste our time together fighting or arguing, but he wastes a lot of our time fighting and arguing with her and then needing comfort and stress relief from me.
I feel like he found that other woman because I’m too much work and he’s preparing for an easier affair, closer to home. He’s looking for a woman that can separate the two and he’s looking to find someone that can give him what I do in a shorter and easier and cheaper format.
Because I am hard to find time for and more expensive. Because he has outgrown his need for me and is ready to downsize his life.
This is how I feel.
Like I am an aging mansion and all along he was just maintaining me until he didn’t need such a big house anymore.
I  feel lost and alone. I have given him the best years of my life and to thank me he put his lips on another woman’s pussy, and he did it so he could KEEP the miserable bitch he really loves.
Maybe he agreed to stop seeing her not because he wanted to but because he could not bear to hurt my feelings knowing how much I loved him.
I’ve spent so much time coming to see him every week and I did it without ever putting my husband first. I worked around his schedule and I took any and all risks to see him and I don’t really matter.
Nobody knows about me.
Nobody.
He’s told nobody about me in thirteen years. Confided in nobody but one co-worker who has since died.
I don’t understand how I can be loved and still be regarded as someone having no worth or place or any kind of validation that I mean anything to him or to his quality of life.
Sure, he may love me
But he doesn’t want me anywhere near his real life or his family.
I have a purpose and when he retires with her and there is no time for me, I will be phased out or abruptly cut off one day out of nowhere and I won’t see it coming.
I have a minor child less than two years (18 months) away from 18, and after that, I have every intention of leaving this house and my husband.
Then, I won’t be anyone’s secret.

I am the truth he hides from everyone.

R keeps urging me to write my feelings out but the things I say about him might be hurtful. I might pay for those words with a withdrawal of his affection or a change in our relationship. Sometimes I feel I am at a disadvantage if he knows my true feelings. I am allowing him to peek inside my soul but I am fed silence on his end. I don’t have the same opportunity.
He doesn’t feel compelled to write about me or to make his feelings public knowledge.
Maybe he can shelf me, and obviously separate that from his real life.
I’m not physically there to demand anything or to have a breakdown when things go wrong for me.
I’m not there to ask him what time he wants to have dinner.
I’m not there to make mistakes that he has to fix. I’m not there to need help solving a problem or his words to soothe me when I’m suffering or afraid.
I’m just plain old not there. I’m not saying I’m free and available and I’m not blaming. It is the hard truth.
I understand where I rank in his life, if you will. I KNOW my place and my status, but that doesn’t keep the fact that I’m not in the running from hurting.
A few weeks ago, I was having issues with my old car, a car that really should be replaced if we are being honest. I had driven to see R, and had almost made it there when the problem arose. I needed new spark plugs and wires, but I didn’t know that at the time.
The problem had just presented itself and I was struggling to keep the engine from idling too slow and cutting out. Every time I put my foot on the brake, my car would sputter and chug. The only problem I really had with this was that to get home, I would be pulling out on a very busy road and stalling would most certainly result in an accident.
I have been around cars my whole life and I know how to keep my engine running by utilizing my brake and gas simultaneously.  I learned it by driving a car with a manual transmission…or a go cart…can’t remember which but the fact is, I can do it! But THAT doesn’t mean my car is gonna STAY running once I’m ON the freeway.
I was plenty afraid and nervous because nightfall was approaching and I was about to be enveloped in the darkness of a Michigan evening, headed East on the highway to hell in a 2009 Pontiac handcart.
So, as my lover and I sat in our cars in the parking lot of the place we had met, I was feeling a rising panic and fear, and he was well aware that I was about to be in a vulnerable position that would put me one step away from a bad situation.
As I looked to him for advice or a solution or even just help or concern, I saw him nervously glancing at his phone, repeatedly.
His wife was texting. He was anxious to leave because my time was over.
His parting words to me were….
“I feel really bad leaving you like this, but I have to.”
And then, he did just that.
He left me in the dark, in the rain, vulnerable. He drove away and left me there, afraid and alone and a long way from home and from anyone that loved me enough to come pick my broke ass up off the side of the road. Where I come from we don’t call a tow truck, we call so and so’s cousin who has a tow strap and they come and tow you home for a six pack and a quarter ounce of weed.
I maybe had six bucks in my pocket, and I was wearing high heeled boots and a short skirt in 35 degree weather when it dawned on me that I’m as stupid as stupid comes, putting myself at risk for a man that drove away from me when he should have at least followed me five miles to see that I made it onto the freeway and towards home.
But he didn’t.
Because leaving me in that state was preferable to upsetting his ungrateful bitch of a wife.
My safety was not worth the ten minutes it would have taken him to give a shit. It was not worth risking her questions…ten fucking minutes.
He would NEVER leave her in that position. But I’M the one rubbing his feet and cutting his toenails like his little fucking Geisha?.
I didn’t hear from him again until well past midnight, when he texted me to say goodnight.
He never asked if I made it home.
But I DID make it home, if you wanna call it that. It’s hard to call it home and when the OTHER guy that doesnt give a fuck about you lives there with you.
Yup. I made it home because I’m a bad ass bitch that doesn’t need a man to love me and care about my safety.
Which is a good thing.
Because I still ain’t found one that will.

As I watch my best friend fall apart both emotionally and physically, I don’t have to wonder what contributed to her downfall.
I know the reason why a predatory creep was able to manipulate his way into her fragile heart. It’s not because she’s stupid or foolhardy or careless. She’s the opposite, caring too much about everything, to the point where it is smothering and unhealthy.

It didn’t happen because she’s weak. She’s one of the strongest people I know and by far the most compassionate. At one point she was my hero. I was in awe of the way she cared for her dying mother with a stoicism few could muster. 

I’ve seen her bring animals back from the brink of death. She is a crusader for the innocent or those without a voice. 

The reason she left everything she holds sacred behind and committed her life to a child molester is because she has spent years being lonely and deprived of the loving treatment that a lot of women get from a man and take for granted.

She had a husband that for nearly three decades treated her with casual disregard and very little affection. He never bought her a birthday or Christmas gift and he has barely ever took her to dinner. He isn’t fun, gregarious or loyal.
She’s never been on vacation or driven a nice car.

He’s cheated and lied and had two affairs and one secret love child, minus the love.

He’s kind of a bastard.

Yes, she was ripe for a smooth talking predator because her body and soul have been screaming out for the sweet salvation that love brings for as long as I’ve known her.

And there but for the grace of God go I.

She and I bonded over our similar suffering and our friendship sprouted at first and then flourished over the years, laying a huge network of sprawling roots in the form of shared memories and quiet understanding of the other’s pain.

And as I sat in a jacuzzi tub full of warm, bubbling water on the eve of Valentine’s day, it occurred to me that the ONE major thing that I had that she didn’t was my lover, R. 

He changed the course of my life and rescued me from the suffering she is going through. His love elevated me and made me enviable and fortunate. 

Because of him, I don’t know what she’s feeling right now.

Because of him, I know only love and tenderness.

Because of him, I know what it feels like to truly believe I’m beautiful and to feel worthy of someone’s time and energy and attention and effort and forgiveness.

Because of him I am allowed to make mistakes and gain or lose weight and cry and throw a tantrum and wake up sorry for what I did and know that despite all those things I am STILL LOVED. I know that if I cry out to my lover, he will almost always respond to my needs.

I have a different kind of security. It doesn’t come in the typical form of commitment, and the relationship I share with my lover doesn’t even warrant commitment in his eyes. I can’t count on his fidelity.

But what I CAN count on is being treated like the ground I walk on is hallowed and I am the Goddess that governs it.

That rarely, if ever, wavers.

He. Spoils. Me. Rotten.

I one thousand percent know what it feels like to be worshipped and adored despite all that is ugly about me.

I know what it feels like to be someone’s sexual Achilles heel, the object of their powerful, burning desire.

I know what passion and romance look and feel and taste like.

When I walk into a room, the softness in his eyes leaves no question that he finds me beautiful.

Because of him, I know what it feels like to live every little girl’s dream and find Prince Charming and true love.

But just like in the fairy tale, midnight always comes around to smash my dreams and turn my beautiful clothes to rags.

The clock always winds its way around to reality and I wake up sitting on a pumpkin in a muddy garden in the darkness, wishing I could still smell his skin.

A smart woman would run away and never go back to wait for a rescue dependent upon finding your misplaced shoe.

You gotta ask yourself, how far are you gonna get in glass slippers anyway?

You have a better chance barefoot.

Even on the most difficult path.

I’m sitting here smoking a joint and looking out the window at the gray sky and deep snow.
It’s not beautiful by any means.

Last year when my lover’s wife left for her vacation home, things were wonderful. We talked on the phone before or after dinner and we enjoyed the freedom of seeing each other overnight, every week almost. 

We were what I would describe as giddy the whole time she was gone. It felt like a real relationship, even though we were both still married. 

Looking back, it was probably one of the happiest couple months of my adult life.

This year is a lot different. He’s busy fixing a place up for them to move to and that’s just the beginning of his list of huge projects. 

His depression/sadness seems to have been triggered by his wife’s leaving. It was either that or the loss of the extra girlfriend, or the lack of sun in our state or all the above. 

His wife JUST left a few weeks ago. Last time this happened when she came BACK. It is perplexing as hell.  

All I know is every time I bring up the fact that he’s emotionally distant when we are apart or that something is off, it gets me chastised so harshly and efficiently that I end up apologizing profusely for whatever it is that I shouldn’t have brought up, and I feel ungrateful and selfish for wanting more than the tons of attention I already get.

I also feel ashamed for wanting his time when he works so hard and is in physical pain. I know I am selfish to a man that has loved me unconditionally. 

But it’s not attention I’m missing…it’s the uncertainty, the shift in his emotions…the way he abruptly changes his demeanor and deems isolation preferable to interacting with me. It hurts. It’s always a shock. It makes me feel lost.

It has never FELT like an affair because we were so close and we depended on each other for everything emotional in nature. I don’t want to force him to text or call because the problem isn’t the amount of calls or texts, it’s the sudden lack of interest in communication outside of our face to face visits. 

I usually vow that I will never set him off or upset him again.

His isn’t the screaming and yelling kind of anger.

It’s a silent punishing anger that makes you feel like hiding in a corner with a blanket and a jar to pee in so you don’t have to come out anytime soon.

I actually did that when I was a little girl, because my young, inexperienced father would lose his cool and go what he referred to as “ape shit.”

I didn’t know what Ape Shit was. All I knew was when my questions started bothering him or my requests for his attention were met with a foreboding “No”, it was time to get as far away as my little body could get me, which was a recessed cubby hole built into the knotty pine wall of my tiny bedroom. That was my sanctuary.

That’s where I went to avoid the anger and comfort myself until my good daddy came back and his face softened and took me into his arms and on his lap. 

His love and affection was dependent upon my behavior. If I was good and said the right things, or kept quiet when things got tense, I felt like he still loved me. I was so afraid to say the wrong thing and lose his favor. I learned to apologize and regret what I DID say, and then to shut the fuck up and go to my cubby until the tornado was done sucking up debris. Number one rule, stay out of its path.

Other times, most times, my father was my life. He was the governor of my pleasure and pain. He was my benevolent dictator. He was my moral compass and he commanded respect. I was terrified of him when his voice rose because I learned what happened when I stuck around to see the show.

My lover is a lot like my father.

I am afraid of disappointing or angering him, too.

If I do the wrong thing or if I say the wrong thing, will he still love me? Or will I get to meet the other side of him, instead? If I annoy or disappoint or fail him, I feel just like that little girl that took a canning jar to the cubby to hide from the pissed off Giant.

The memories are vivid. I had a big blue stuffed Huckleberry Hound from the Hanna Barbera cartoon show that my dad won me at the county fair. I would take Huçkleberry into the cubby with me to hold and talk to, and we would sometimes stay there until I fell asleep or got so thirsty my lips would stick to my gums and I was forced to emerge.

All this sounds so abusive and self pitying,  but I know it was just the immature brain of a 7 year old that formed my intense memories, and it seemed like the end of the world for that very reason and no other.

Adult me knows my dad would have probably done nothing more than spank my ass, at worst with a belt, and that neither of those would hurt me permanently. He might have smacked me upside the head, as he called it, and while I don’t believe that is an acceptable form of discipline, a million fathers did it and mine is the last generation with intact morals and a conscience. 

It was about 3 foot by 3 foot, the cubby.

If I had one now, I’d take Huçkleberry and hide.

But I don’t fit in the cubby anymore. I’m a grown woman and the 7 year old is gone and my lover is not my father and my best friend is dying and I just need to be held so badly that my heart feels like it’s gonna burst.

And I hate feeling weak or needy. It does not suit a short, sexy Dominatrix.

There is nowhere for me to hide except inside my own MIND. That is not a place of comfort lately. The words and thoughts are so wildly jumbled and tossed around that there is no solace. It’s all so overwhelming that I shut down, or I write. I understand wholly what my lover is doing when he pulls away from me because I have been in that ugly place before.

Yesterday, he indignantly snapped “cuz I like being a Hermit, that’s why!” in response to what probably felt like his whiny girlfriend bitching.

I can isolate with the best of them.

I can make myself invisible.

And still be in plain sight.

THIS ENTRY IS SEXUALLY GRAPHIC. SKIP THIS IF EASILY OFFENDED.
Because my lover calls me his baby, I sometimes act like one.
I almost attacked him tonight for chiding me, for jokingly saying that maybe my insecurity would get in the way of going to a sex club this weekend.

As I edged towards defensiveness, he shut me down, by informing me that those were MY words and not his. He repeated it again, emphasizing that those were the words I recently used to describe how I felt about MYSELF.

I wasn’t angry. But I think I DID take almost immediate offense. After analyzing that for a bit, I’ve concluded that I felt offended because it is indeed true, and something I’ve been struggling with for the past few months. 

I’m embarrassed I even mentioned my insecurity…it shows weakness and weakness makes me feel ugly. But I’m not ugly. It is true I weigh more than I should, but I have a face that a man would fall in love with. I have golden brown, expressive eyes that captivate and a personality that rivals the exotic fabled muse.

I have long, tousled, unruly hair like a mermaid, the siren of the sea, with cascading tresses and a sweet lilting song behind full red lips. That’s how I would fantastically describe myself. 

I haven’t really ever struggled with self esteem issues. It feels strange and foreign and uncomfortable. It doesn’t feel like what I’m used to and I DON’T LIKE IT.

I LOVE feeling sexy and wild. I love making a man smile and laugh and open himself up to me…moving closer and leaning in with a gleam in his eye, a sparkle that I can turn LUSTFUL given five minutes alone with him.

If my lover says those were my own words, I believe him. If they fell from MY mouth that means they were born in MY brain. So, I have to acknowledge that my ego is indeed wounded.

You bet your fucking ass it is.

And why wouldn’t it be?

Show me a woman who can suck it up and keep it inside like I have the past few months, two months after a horrible betrayal that snatched my breath from my throat and spit in my face. 

I’ve been every bit as loving and good and all along it’s been eating at me that he went to someone else.

And here’s why.

After all these years together, there has been one or two things that have remained constant. The one thing that stands out above everything else is the statement my lover has ALWAYS maintained and reassured me with. 

Whenever I worried about the distance between us, or about how little we were able to physically see each other, he would always say the same thing…

“You are quality and I’ll take that over quantity any day. You’re worth it.”

Oh my God…who doesn’t want to hear that from their lover’s mouth? That’s a gift in itself and I’ve always known it.

I suspect this isn’t the first time he has had two lovers at once. I mean, I KNOW it isn’t. That means at some point in the last ten years, I ceased to be of high enough quality to be worth it. 

How could anyone’s self esteem not be hurt by that? I ask you.

I wonder if I’m too old, too ugly, too fat, too bitchy, too far away, too dumb, too much hassle, too much money, or  too much work. I close my eyes and I know she’s prettier and softer and sexier than me and my fucking heart breaks because I didn’t deserve it, but I understand it, because in my mind I am forever more flawed than her. 

Now she’s worth it, too.

My response to this is a desire to impose self destructive behavior. I wanna go fucking nuts.

I’m not talking about taking an overdose or cutting my skin. I’m not talking about throwing myself at a man, crying and begging and asking to be critiqued so I can change what’s wrong with me.

I’m talking about risky, impulsive, degrading things. I’m talking about trying to find my worth behind every good looking guy with a dick that I can lure my way.

And I CAN lure them my way. I am absolutely certain of my sexuality and I know how to dress sexy without accentuating my flaws . I can move my body very erotically and can dance my way right into a man’s jeans. I can drink a lot of whiskey and stay upright while losing every inhibition and I can be the most sensual, beautiful whore you’ve ever had the pleasure of finger banging.

If you’re chosen, I’ll let you put your dick in me and that rarely happens so it’s not like a three lane freeway in there. I know my body. I have what Donny called a “tight little well preserved pussy” and I don’t waste it on just anyone because I consider it just about the best piece of ass a man can get. You keep your car nice by not driving it a lot. Same analogy.

I love it if you jam it up my ass then spank me till my full cheeks are a hot bright red and don’t forget to pull my hair and flick my clit. Put your fingers inside me until I piss all over you. 

Extra points if I can get my short legs around you. You just won the bonus round cuz I love the penny pony and I got a pocketful of copper to spend.

I’ll suck your dick so hard you’ll accidentally come without warning. Just happened a few months ago, so that’s proof I still got it. I can deepthroat a garden hose and I have little to NO gag reflex. Try me. Bet you can’t last two full minutes.

I don’t require dinner out or a movie. I’m ready to go anytime, night or day. My sex drive is insane. I’ll lead. I’ll push your boundaries and if you desire, I’ll fuck YOUR brains out and flip you around just in time to swallow every last drop of jizz you’ve got to give me. 

I don’t have insecurity issues with strangers in a club and I don’t feel insecure about my lover wanting strangers in a club. 

I feel insecure when the person I love and trust enough to do literally everything in the book sexually turns his attention to someone else. After I bared my soul like he begged me to, it lost its value because it was something he conquered. He no longer needed to prove his own prowess..that’s not true but it feels like it is in my wounded fucking heart. 

And as long as I don’t throw it in his face or punish him with it emotionally, I am allowed to feel it and to heal from it and to stumble while doing so. 

 The anger from the early days is gone and in its place is embarrassment and a sickening feeling of inferiority. I stand naked and fearful and under a spotlight but you want me to leave my pain buried under a mountain of dirt and never dig it up.You’re not a monster and you didn’t mean to hurt me…YOU were hurting and I wasn’t there, because of all the reasons you told me I never had to fear.

I just want to hold you and you to hold me. I just want to feel your mouth on mine and your skin under my fingertips. I just want you to love me with unrivaled fervor.

Part of me is laughing inside, wondering if you’re playing me like a puppet and my fiery response is what you hoped for. My competitive nature is sparked with your humble insinuation that I’m common enough to be insecure.

I am confident enough to believe I can have almost any man I set my sights on. 

You’re one LUCKY bastard that I’m staring straight at you, baby.

And that all the rest are out of my line of vision.

Ok, you said you wanted every angry entry, to know why every tear was shed, why every idea was dismissed or acted on, what wounds I carry and who I cannot forgive.
The most sacred of all the things you will become privy to are my hopes and my fears.  

If you run away from me after all the ugly truths, then my own words have betrayed me and nothing or noone else.

If I drive you away from me, I will still have children and family but I will be left with nothing…because I will have nobody to go to when I need to be loved. Without you, life is all give and no take for me. I give and don’t take from most people. YOU are the only person I can take from. It is the water from YOUR well that gives me life. 

All of that is romanticized.

The truth is this. I can lay it bare.

I don’t want our love to die. I don’t want our love to become something that doesn’t give YOU life.

I don’t want to lose the bond, the romance, the intimacy, the sexy way you make me feel, the comfort of your arms and your words, your smell, your taste, the sound of your voice when my eyes are closed and the spell it invokes when they are open and fixed on your face.

And you would stand to lose someone that sees only the good in you, someone who sees you in the light you deserve, as a lover and a hero to the unfortunate. You would stand to lose the person in whose life you have made the greatest impact and where the purest of love and attention would be bestowed upon you by a selfless person who will never see your face as anything other than handsome. You would stand to lose the reciprocal care of the woman whom your love wholly changed.

Here’s what I think…

You’d be more likely to LOSE your way long before you’d RUN away.

But if you do, I’m gonna skip all the emotional bullshit and go straight for your weak spot.

Black Boots, bound titties and a butt plug…that will lure you back home.

57,https://www.opendiary.com/m/kaleidoscope-eyes/addicted-to-love-10-5968408/,2021-02-22,Addicted to love,"
When I learned about the other “other” woman, the defense my lover offered up was that he feared he had a sex addiction. I panicked, because an addiction means it is likely to happen again, as does the general pattern of his behavior.
I poo poo’d the sex addiction thing as just lip service to soften the blow to my ego. 

He was offering me something worthy of marriage level commitment, but because I was SO embarrassed and distressed for him to have to admit it to anyone, I shut it down immediately. 

That is something I don’t think he ever thought about doing for his wife, at least he never mentioned that he did, which says a lot about his love for me. It was something I should have embraced, because what is important was that HE was willing to be embarrassed. 

I should have encouraged it, because here is where we stand today. He is remorseful and I’m wrecked and waiting for him to re-offend. And without treatment, maybe he will.
I am charmed by the fact that we are still excited to see each other, and that we still party and stay up too late and lose track of time. I am amazed that at 67 and 53 years old, we still love to be in each other’s company.  It’s surprising that we’ve met every week for 14 years, mostly in the confines of a hotel, yet we still laugh and connect.
Has all that all become boring to him?
Maybe I don’t look the same to him.

Wondering if his eyes find me beautiful is a sick feeling, much like the one that had me on the xanax diet for two weeks.

I am angry that his infidelity stole my ego from me.

I know I can’t bring it up and harp on it. He is not my husband, he is my boyfriend (what’s wrong with that statement?!) and it needs to be beneficial to him to have me be a part of his life. Whining on the regular about how unattractive I feel and rubbing his nose in his puddle of pee is only gonna get me a pass for so long, then I’m just a bitch like the wife. 

Genuinely forgiving him required swallowing my pride, and I deemed it worthy of doing so. But tonight, I’m struggling with my wounded dignity.. 

What makes it so much harder is that there IS NO time to waste being angry. The truth is, I am a secret and he is a secret and one of us is gonna die first. That means one of us will wake up one morning unaware that we have lost the other. One of us will suffer first an agonizing silence, followed by an interminable wait, and finally, great shock with the discovery that the other is gone.

We will grieve silently and have to swallow our pain and be sick to our stomachs because the world keeps turning but for one us, it will have stopped.

There will be nobody to express our anguish to over the loss of the other.

I know it doesn’t seem like a big thing to some people, but to me it seems like the worst pain I could ever suffer. Because we don’t share relatives or friends, I will never have a tangible connection to the man I loved the most. He will have existed to nobody in my life but me.

There is no shared house full of things he left behind, no clothing casually  draped over a chair to put to my face and inhale his musky scent. He will have left no footprints anywhere besides in my heart. 

That’s what makes this time so precious. Fate can snatch it away at any time, and he will choose his wife over me if she catches him cheating. I’m not being self deprecating, he TOLD me this a hundred times.

If I get caught, I’m prepared to get a divorce to keep seeing him. He doesn’t afford me the same guarantee. Fate doesn’t determine our future, his wife does.
When she came back last year, he was angry and cold and distant. He flipped like a switch and shut me off and turned the other other woman on. I knew then that something was wrong.

What makes the hurt so deep is that this is the same man that has consistently loved and spoiled me for almost a decade and a half. He has lavished me with good food and drink and attention, tons of it. This is the same man that never let me hang up angry or sad, who refused to let me stew or be confused or hurt. 

Never.

That’s what elevated him above all the others, that feeling of being wanted and loved and having him refuse to let me hurt or suffer. If he fucked up, he owned it immediately, and swiftly reconciled it.

That same man is now content to hang up and forego talking about it. That same man is now content not talking at all.

That same man let me choke down silent tears alone and vomit up my own snot for two days after he fessed up, avoiding my angry wrath.

He has told me he wants to be a hermit more than one time recently. He has isolated himself for days at a time from me, leaving me confused and anxious.

Yet he has not recognized that he has every symptom of depression and that his bad marriage may be the primary cause. The first change in him came when his wife returned from her winter retreat and the subsequent change occurred when she wouldn’t leave to go back this year and he wasn’t sure she ever would. 

Now he is planning a new phase of life with her and could be using his self admitted addiction to cope with the distress he knows is gonna come along with that choice…all her, all the time. Just like a junkie, the more miserable he gets in his heart, the more he wants to snort, smoke or in his case, seduce and conquer women.

Either that, or my first theory holds the most water and he is planning an easier and less expensive affair, tailored to fit his next phase of life, spending 24/7 with the wife.

Or maybe he hurts so much that my hurt is irrelevant. 

I just can’t find it in my heart to feel angry with him because how could I… when for two or three weekends now I’ve been treated like the absolute princess of his life. It feels so good that I forget all about the hurt.

Until he goes to leave.

That’s when I fall apart.

He lights me on fire and then religiously applies the salve to heal the raw skin he burned.

But when I’m in his arms and know that he is sacrificing his time and energy, when he doesn’t feel well,  to prove his love for me, how could I be angry? How can I be angry when my lover/ daddy/ King is fluffing my pillow and running my bath and feeding me sushi?

Nope. My heart is not angry. I love him even more watching him trying to please me.

I have a somber new awareness that I’ve bet everything on the hand that has always fed me.
NOW if I starve, it is nobody’s fault but my own.

In my mind, I live a different life.
I close my eyes and live in a world where every color is rich like velvet and so bright it hurts your eyes. The grass is like a  deep lush carpet that covers my toes. The ground underneath the grass is cool and damp, and mother nature is lounging amongst the tree roots, laid out like a beautiful serpent maiden.
In this beautiful place there is someone for me to love and someone to love me back.
In this world I am never ugly.
I am beautiful in my lover’s blue eyes.
In this world there are no monsters and no fear and you are always safe, even if you are not in someone’s arms. The sun is always on your face. The water is never rough, but always clear like glass and its beauty is real! You can trust it. There are no surprises lurking just underneath the surface to drag you to the bottom and snicker at you while you struggle to live.
In this world I am never afraid.
I am fearless in my lover’s eyes.
The days in this world never end until you’re nestled snugly on a big downy mattress covered with the finest silk sheets, pressed against the naked body of the one you want to spend every second of moonlight with for the rest of your life.
I know in THIS world that I live in, in REAL life, I sleep alone. I have to lay upon my side with my arms wrapped around my chest to hold my heart captive inside my body while it beats out my hapless song.
And in the morning, I have to check and make sure it didn’t escape in the night to go searching for the answers to the questions I left unasked, afraid of rejection and of the blow to my fragile sense of self should I be denied or laughed at.
In my world, I am always the one and only woman in my lover’s heart and I will never have to smell the sick stench of death they call unreciprocal love. In my world, I never have to understand why I can’t be loved as much as someone else, or be as sexy as the other “her” and what level of desirability I fall at on the scale is never a question I need to ponder.
In my world I know what it’s like to close my eyes and be able to sleep peacefully for the first time in forever, because everything that keeps me alive is warm and breathing is finally beside me.
In my daydream world, I never have to hide from the lover that is supposed to offer me the highest salvation but instead stabs me in my back and leaves me to bleed while he cavorts with a sophisticated woman, one that doesn’t have pink hair and in your face bedroom eyes.
It matters not if she can hold her whiskey or get down to business in a ponytail. It matters not if she can lace her Domme boots in the dark or milk a prostate or give you an enema and that’s why SHE will never be ME.
None of them will.
If I never get to keep the lover of my technicolor dream, I know what it felt like to almost have him. That’s a lot more than most people have so I should be aware that I have lived a privileged life.
Privilege is invisible to those who have it.
I was blind.
But now I see.

These next few entries may be the hardest ones I’ve written yet. 
After my lover cheated, I was numb. It didn’t just hurt. It was crushing.
My self esteem and sexuality and everything I ever loved about myself is now in question. There is now a memory burned into my mind that I cannot erase of him having secret sex with a “vanilla” woman that made him feel better than I did.
But what is worse than the imagined memory is the doubt. The questions in my head cannot be silenced or dismissed. They eat at me endlessly, telling me I was not enough for the man I loved the most.
When he met me I was just 40 years old. I had been with my husband for 17 years and had had one short term affair. That was it. And my husband’s idea of sexuality was not the same as the other “boys” I had dated.
And they WERE boys. I had not ever had a powerful man before I met my lover.
My husband gave me little to no affection once he started working his life away to support our growing family. There was never sex. If it happened once a month I was lucky.
More often than not, I laid in the dark at night and cried over my sexless marriage and prayed for a miracle or death, because I felt divorce was unattainable. I had been married since I was 23 years old and I was too afraid to trust myself to make it on my own.
I didn’t want to be the bad guy.
Instead I have spent 31 years of my life with a man that never put his arm around my waist or held my hand. He never introduced me to a friend or showed any pride in me. He rarely took me anywhere, and if he did it was because I insisted.
He was never comfortable or willing to go to a party or meet new friends. To this day he rarely leaves the house. He is a complete introvert that was diagnosed clinically depressed with alcoholism over 15 years ago. He refuses to help himself.
He stopped showering and shaving and going to the dentist years ago. His clothes are filthy and in tatters and the new “old” clothes from Christmas’ past sit in his drawer untouched. I have never had the experience of picking out his clothes at the store cuz he didn’t ever want any new clothes, and spending money on something he didn’t need was out of the question in his book. He never wore cologne or aftershave. He was timid.
Birthday, Christmas, Valentine’s day and anniversaries are all no gift, no card occasions. He actually forgot our anniversary twice but to be fair, we BOTH forgot once. I’m not amused or proud of that. It is the stereotypical hallmark of a bad marriage when one spouse forgets an anniversary, so I don’t even know what it says about your marriage if you BOTH forget.
He never one single time told me I was pretty or smart or funny or any of the above.
He didn’t know how to emote and foreplay was painful for him. Sex was painful too, because it was hard for him to feel or show emotion. Sex was actually downright emotionally awkward for him…and it’s the one thing that’s supposed to transcend all that inconsequential stuff in life.
I had lived 17 years of misery when I met my lover and he was my salvation.
I had NEVER been loved by anyone like him. I’d never been called baby or had fine liquor. I had never been treated like a lady AND a whore and been appreciated for being both. I had never been whispered to as erotically or kissed as deeply before he came into my life. I had never known what is was like to have exciting sex or to be turned on by a man’s words and fingers and mind.
I thought my lover, R,  was Jesus Christ himself the way he made me feel. His love was the most intoxicating thing I have ever experienced and he will forever be my hero and the epitome of what a man is to me.
I knew NOTHING about how it felt to be loved by someone with command and overpowering masculinity. I was in awe when he would stand naked in front of me.
His was the word of God.
I came to him as a new affair, a nearly blank slate and he was thirteen years my senior.
Within the first few months of meeting him, I was going to sex “munch” meetings at bars, trying to set up ties for us in the world of BDSM or kink. A world that one month previous, I had no idea even existed.
I was intrigued and eager. Fresh faced sexually.
Within a year he had bought me a book about Dominance and submission and the delicate dance two people do when they exchange sexual power. It explained all the nuances of the Dom/sub “switch” partnership.
It changed the course of my previously arrested sexual development and forever influenced what sex and love look like to me. For the better.
It has been the most fulfilling relationship of my life and it saved me.
I participated willingly and joyfully and with little reservation. I was proud to be brave enough to try anything.
I am not blaming him for who I am. I accept who I am and embrace my different approach to sex but this doesn’t mean I’m not open to changing if it makes both of us whole.
I tried to be the best sex partner I could be to this man so I didn’t lose the closest fucking thing I had ever known to happiness.
He helped to mold and shape me into the woman I am today and have I now become his curse?
I fear I am too dominant, and his words ring in my ears. Now I feel tainted and damaged and maybe I don’t make him feel how he wants to feel about himself.
I made him feel like his wife does for a brief second in time and now I fear I will forever pay for my mistake with veiled insults and painful barbs aimed at my heart.
And this is the always forgiving man that means everything to me.
What if I have made him feel ineffective and unneeded sexually? Somehow he feels I am blaming him for something when in reality I just want his love and don’t blame him for anything. In fact, I still cry from separation anxiety when he leaves on Sundays. I love this man with all my being and he has always been and still is my greatest love. He is everything sexual to me and I have stolen from him what every man needs to feel like a man, but I don’t even know why I did it. I would have never gotten this far on my own, without him as a willing tutor and pupil and partner.
He helped create me, now I worry he looks to someone else to give him what I have rightfully forfeited…my womanhood.
And it hurts like fucking hell.
Three months later, and I’m sitting in a canoe full of shit and my dreams are somewhere down at the bottom.
I have to bail all that shit out to have even half a chance at any dream beneath it.
But I’m gonna find me the biggest bucket and do what I can, because I can’t afford to lose one more fucking thing and I aint going down in a boat full of shit.
I’ll take my chances on a detour and head up Shit Creek. Because I have gotten what we proverbially call “smarter and wiser” after today.
And I will NOT forget a paddle.
I’ll be armed with two.

My lover treated me to a beautiful weekend and I drank too much and copped a bit of an attitude. I guess I was bossy and demanding sexually. I thwarted his efforts to sexually please me and then got pissed at him for not reciprocating promptly enough. He didn’t deserve my treatment and I usually make it my mission to treat him with love and care, as he does me.
I was moody and stressed and I cried.
He was moody and stressed and got pissed, and we got a little bitchy with each other. It ramped up, and I quickly folded once I pissed off the bear and dissolved into tears.
I felt sick with remorse immediately, because I really needed him more than usual and the last thing I wanted was to not have his favor or affection.
Afterwards, when I got home and before I went to bed,  I sent a text saying I was sorry for wasting time fighting and he said…
“No problemo. I’m used to it, being married.”
Then he said goodnight.
I can’t count the number of times he has complained about his wife ruining a good time with her difficult and unstable emotional behavior. If I had a dollar for every time he complained about her unappreciative attitude in regards to his efforts to give her a nice time, I’d be rich.
And that’s what he left me with to sleep on for the night. “No problemo, I’m used to it being married so long.”
Translation:
You, bitch, are acting like my wife. I don’t like my wife because she is an unappreciative, overbearing cunt that does nothing but complain.
If I am going to have to listen to you act like my wife, then I will find another woman to spend time with. If I spend my limited free time and hard earned money taking a woman to a nice hotel, and I give them the gift of my sacrifice and all the spoils then they BETTER be more than appreciative.
If you ain’t appreciative, someone easier, cheaper, closer and less fucking work than your pampered ass will be. Guaranteed.
AND she won’t want to stick shit up my ass. Maybe she will instead make me feel like the powerful Dom I started out as before your freak ass stole my thunder and made me your personal ass slut.
Now suck it up and turn that smile into a frown or I’ll stick my dick in a happy mouth and a SAFE, old, dried up pussy that won’t soak up my semen and then spit out my demon spawn like a slot machine from hell.
Oh and one more thing…
You see what happens to my wife for bitching. What you won’t see is me putting up with YOUR ass like I do hers. She already has the Queen Bitch spot filled, ain’t no vacancy so get your fat ass down on your knees, open up your mouth, and shut the fuck up before you ain’t worth the beer it costs me to keep you happy on a typical winter weekend.
Here’s your walking papers.
Your night in a jacuzzi tub just turned into you holding a ratty hotel washcloth up to your battered asshole while you try not to tip off the psycho you picked up online…you know, the one that held you down and rammed your ass so hard you had to escape to the bathroom afterwards and turn the water on so you didn’t give the sadistic fuck a hard on with your whimpering.
Of course this is all exaggerated, but it’s based on the truth…even if it’s written with sarcasm.
My lover however, would never say these things to me. The words came from my imagination. He is usually kind to a fault.
And speaking of sarcasm…
My lover has frequently told me that his wife accuses him of being passive aggressive. He disagrees with that assessment of his character.
I think this is a perfect example of what she means when she incorrectly calls him that…the hurtful comments full of hidden rancor disguised as a light-hearted joke.
Passive aggression is sabotaging someone secretly or high jacking their cooperation through manipulation and then making them believe they chose their own destiny.
Those are two examples I understand to be passive aggressive.
What my lover exhibited was not passive aggressiveness.
It’s called a mean streak.
It is as devastating as an atom bomb on a schoolhouse. It has absolutely NO place in love.
But he got that mean streak because of her, not me. I just did something that infuriated him. I reminded him of her. She is unkind to him, not me.
Buddah said: Be kind to unkind people, they need it the most.
No problemo, Buddah. I’ll just take it up the ass and smile at any mean fucker that comes my way.
I am used to it being married so long.

I am not defending my behavior, but in the past three months, I’ve had a seemingly heavy load of stress. Maybe it isn’t the typical stress your average person has, but right now, my life feels like the makings of a bad country song.
I don’t want to complain because I love being a mostly happy person and I want to stay that way.
But in the past three months, I’ve been dealt the following blows…
My best friend of 25 years was diagnosed with aggressive, invasive ovarian cancer. She has a 50 percent chance of survival.
I have been through one surgery with her, and I filled out an advanced directive to be her medical power of attorney. I’ve had to step up to the plate and help her special needs daughter, who is 26 and has six kids and no baby daddy.
Why did I have to step up? Cuz said best friend has decided to do something completely insane in response to her diagnosis and allow a twice convicted sex offender to move in with her.
Sleeping with a child molester can apparently fuck up your well being as well as your life and she has set herself back health wise to a point where she cannot have the lifesaving chemotherapy that she desperately needs.
I’ve been left with the mess she’s run away from. I’m left soothing the confused and angry hearts of those she left behind or discarded in her struggle to be free, and that includes three house cats. One was 12 yrs old.
This morning I had to block her almost 80 year old ex affair partner, who started out as her MOTHER’S affair partner of 20+ years. When her mom died, he moved on to my bestie, his dead lover’s daughter. Let that sink in.
Now that she’s screwing a monster, he’s trying to move ME into the vacancy. Sorry dude, but I am not gonna be your next place to stick it so fuck the fuck off.
I could not make this shit up if I tried and truth really is stranger than fiction and that is some messed up shit right there.
But by far the biggest stressor is trying not to vomit in the face is her unshaven, smirking, snaggle toothed, baby raping boyfriend.
My dad has been a diabetic for 30 years. He is losing his eyesight and has A-fib and is retaining water from an unknown source and they’ve been through every test.
My mom is so stressed. She has an eye drop regimen that involves putting them in his eyes 12 times in a day and I’m not joking. They have been to two eye specialists to try to prolong his ability to see. Right now he can’t drive. They say his eyesight will get better with treatment but maybe not better enough to drive again. My mom is scared. It is humbling and uneasy for me to hear fear in her voice. They have been together 54 years. My dad is alpha. She’s getting their affairs in order in case they need long term care.
My normally straight A student, 16, failed two classes. Failed. Cries all the time. Isn’t motivated enough to keep up in school. Went from bummed out when a snow day was called to openly crying when the weekend is over and Monday rolls around. I’m driving her an hour to and from to see a special adolescent counselor. I’ve had to beg, cry and exhaustively wait for mental health care and I have an older daughter that attempted suicide previously, so this shit is petrifying. I’m petrified. My husband doesn’t hold me or comfort me. He does not know how to help her or me.
Last Tuesday, I asked my husband for a divorce and an exit plan agreement. I am openly spending the night on the weekends with my boyfriend while his wife vacations. I am blatantly “in your face” cheating and he’s walking around with his hands in his pocket looking anxious.
He hasn’t tried to fix or change or grow in years and we haven’t fucked in even longer. But he thinks he can make an attempt to change a few of the things that have been sticking points all this time. He showers more than once a week. He went to the dentist  and he is trying to sleep in bed with me and rub my back.  I know I have to accept his affection or hurt him tremendously. but I’m just completely void of any feelings for him besides fear and loathing.
Now I’m gonna be the bad guy for sure. He’s making a feeble, and I mean feeble, attempt by doing these two simple things. Feeble because there is no way it could even begin to bridge the physical and emotional gap spanning thirty years. I think at this point he has to have more than just an inkling that I am having sex. I’m just waiting for the day he feels he needs to confirm it and quite frankly, I’m getting tired of pretending and it’s getting hard to hide the misery.
A clear cut case, too little too late.
Add to that the fact that one daughter’s boyfriend of four years has a terminally ill mom. She’s dying of liver cancer. She was supposed to die last Christmas because she stopped chemo a while ago, but she’s still here. She’s an amazing person and she has struggled to make friends after having moved hours away from her hometown and family. Her name is B.
B’s mom is too mentally ill to acknowledge B is dying so she drinks and stays away. It’s outta sight outta mind. That’s not a Mom. Her dad follows suit.
As fate would have it, me and B fell in friend love. I call her Tinkerbell because she’s tiny and magical. We are doing the equivalent of speed dating. I adore her. She will die soon, leaving behind her 16 year old son and two girls, 7 and 9, who will be forever broken in a certain way from the crippling loss.
And me. She will leave me with an up close glimpse of my own imminent death. It makes me long for the life I don’t have with my lover, because time is moving quickly and we ain’t getting younger. We are all waiting in line to cross over and every day we are alive, we get one step closer to the front of the line. The closer you get to your turn, the more peace, comfort and love you need.
After our lover’s squabble, I laid in the dark and held R in my arms. Spending nights together is rare, a gift. To my horror, he struggled desperately to breathe and I listened to his sleep apnea rob his brain and muscles of oxygen. The pauses in breathing were so prolonged that I began to really feel panic.
I cannot bear to lose him, too.
We need to go to bed earlier so it doesn’t exhaust him to see me. I’m so scared it’s gonna get to be too much like I’ve always feared with him being older than me.
He woke up cranky and irritated and kinda disinterested in rewarding my difficult behavior.
But he did it anyway, I am hoping out of love.
To top it all off, I feel like I’m 53 years old and reaching at straws as to how I’m gonna survive the rest of my life with the choices I have made so far.
The betrayal of my lover was the blow that kicked off the whole string of bad luck. It got the ball of crap rolling and all it’s done is gain momentum.
I’d run away from the giant, rolling pile of anxiety and devastation and stark fear if I thought I could catch a break. I’d run fast and far if I thought I had a snowball’s chance in hell of actually getting far enough ahead of it to escape the destruction.
But with my luck and the way things are going, I guarantee the fucker will catch me at the top of a hill.
This seems like a good time to say it.
Fuck my life.

My Lover has always told me that if I wanted to, I could have another man in bed.One with a bigger penis or more stamina or whatever he thinks I’m missing out on.
I can say in all honesty that I never felt like I wanted to cheat or needed anything other than him. There was no temptation. Ever.
Until he did it to me.
After I forced a confession, he expressed concern that I would have a revenge fuck.
At that time, when the wound was fresh, it was the furthest thing from my mind. But the hurt ate away at my heart until I felt like only someone else’s hands and mouth could even the score between him and I. I started to believe that the only thing that would soothe my ravaged ego WAS revenge.
Dominating Donny/Loverboy was akin to dipping my toes in the water to test the temperature.
What I did next was akin to jumping off the face of a cliff and into a turbulent ocean.
And I was totally willing to risk drowning in that manner if it meant I was gonna feel sexy again.
R and I have hit a rough patch.
We’ve hit a few in the course of our long relationship, but we always come out on the other side of it stronger and better to each other and for each other.
What has kept us together all these years is communication and the genuine and heartfelt desire to please each other and to find pleasure in each other.
There has never been a problem we can’t work out with time and effort and love and understanding.
I hope this time is no different.
Because I didn’t just even the score, I went a step further. I kicked dirt in the face of the teammate I call my lover.
I made him my opponent.
And then I one upped him by engaging in unsportsmanlike conduct.I
It was premeditated.
Or rather, I already had a game plan.
I knew going in I would be hitting below the belt.
I’m not gonna stop writing until my ugly confession is out on the table, laid out like a winning poker hand.
Only I didn’t win. I lost.
I just hope I can cover my debt.

I have finally felt something I have not felt in a long time.
Shame.

I did the same thing to my lover that he did to me. I wish I hadn’t. It could easily be the biggest mistake of my life.

When he did it, I ripped him to shreds. I was so angry that I saw only red, and I called him so many horrible names. He felt like a stranger to me and it was one of the loneliest, worst, anxiety filled weeks of my life.

When I would apologize, he would say “I deserve it”

But he didn’t. I know now it was self serving and damaging and hurtful for me to allow him to think he DID deserve it. He took every verbal blow without flinching and I hope I’m half the person he is cuz I don’t know if I can take my lumps as well as he did.

You don’t really get a lot of choices as the offender. We are taught as children that when you know you did something wrong, you humbly take the verbal admonishment and feel remorseful as penance for your crime. Somehow it makes you feel better if your victim hurts you back.

Eventually, the hurt partner knows when enough is enough, and they recognize their own behavior as cruel.

I’m facing a lot of emotional things in my life and it feels like my lover’s disdainful comments made a tremendous chink in the armor I’m keeping up around myself to keep from falling apart.

I feel sick for my choices. He said it didn’t hurt him but of course it hurt him and I didn’t really do it with malice, I did it with grief. Now I have wounded the one person that has always loved me and called me his baby. The one and only man that has paved the path I walk on with gold and riches.

He’s never going to treat me the same. He’s already said things to me that he never would have before, like maybe I have an STD in my asshole or I’m carrying a brown eyed baby with blonde hair, which are the opposite of his features. He mocked my excuses for not using protection and his condescending tone pretty much told me what he was thinking. 

His voice has never sounded like that until today and he’s never been mean to me before.

Now I feel tainted and not worth his love and affection, like I am less than clean for letting someone use my body for sex. Like I have a disease, or a bastard kid growing in me. Now he is going to hurt me where he knows my demons lie…in my body image. 

He quickly tried to smooth over his words after I expressed shock, probably because he heard the fucking hurt in my voice and the loud crash of my magic mirror breaking, cuz the one person I allowed to see my flaws is now calling me flawed and with disgust in his voice. I heard disgust.

I don’t even know what I feel anymore cuz I just kinda feel fucked. Numb. Like I’ve destroyed the one that gives me life and he threw the key to my sexuality over the bridge and into the river.

Now I really wonder if you CAN drown in your misery or die of shame.

I know one thing. I should have never retaliated. I always try to do the right thing by the people I love.

Yup. I shoulda taken the high road.

But at the time, my heart was on fire.

And I didn’t have the strength to make the climb.

64,https://www.opendiary.com/m/kaleidoscope-eyes/the-devil-made-me-do-it-18-5972275/,2021-03-03,The devil made me do it,"
Stop beating myself up?
I think I’m done doing that and now I just want to isolate and lick my self inflicted wounds.
My lover said stop beating yourself up.
So, I’m not going to do it out loud any longer.
I will find a quiet spot and ponder.
I did that once. Then I did it twice. Before I knew it, I had been doing it for a few months straight. It just kind of happened.
Usually at about five or six o’clock at night, I would have to concede to myself that I hadn’t done anything all day except sit by the window.
One day turned into the next and eventually they were all one big blur and I could no longer keep track of what day it was when I woke up.
Then came the tiredness and the overwhelming feeling that I was drowning in the work piled up around me, and not knowing where to start because it seemed like everything was an insurmountable task. And the neverending plight of not being able to find anything because you aren’t organized… flashlight, scissors, that bag of stuff you bought at Walmart.
That wastes time so you continue to get further behind.
And you forget what gives you pleasure.
You stay inside the house and life passes you by and your friends and loved ones are screaming out in worry and confusion, fearful of what’s going on in your head after you’ve abandoned them without a moment’s notice.
They feel sick and helpless because you shut them out.
Some of them stay for the long haul and others just move on, afraid of not knowing what to do or how to react or help.
What seemed to spark that downward spiral was my lover’s year long absence. He had lost his job and his wife was retired and we sometimes went a whole week without talking and it left this huge hole. I felt completely abandoned and fragile because it was then that I fully understood that his wife truly did come first and whatever price he had to pay for that, he paid, even if it meant forfeiting me.
Reality check.
I realized that I had been living in a fairy tale.
And it knocked me on my ass. I grew depressed because I was experiencing a vicious withdrawal of the dopamine he had provided my brain every day for 8 years running. I ended up in a diagnosed state of catatonic depression. The word “catatonic” describes exactly how you feel, too.
When I was in this depressed state, my lover never gave up on me, or on us. He began to call and he never stopped, whether I answered or not.
Eventually he only tried every three days or so, but one time, he coaxed me out and I drove halfway to see him and turned the car around. It frustrated him and he exploded at me on the phone. He later apologized and called himself an asshole.
That day was a turning point.
He told me he was at a place where he had to give up if I didn’t do my part of the work to maintain a relationship and I began to cry. I didn’t want to lose a man that refused to give up on me. But I was hurt.
I said, “I just want you to love me.”
He said, “I can’t, if you won’t physically see me. If you let me see you, I will.”
So I drove to him.
And that was the beginning of my healing.
I don’t want to slide down that slippery slope again. I take a handful of meds each day to stay on this side of it.
So now when I want to hide, I do it in plain sight. I do it outside or I drive somewhere, so I’m not barricading myself into a room, occupied all day long with my own persistent agenda running through my head.
Once again I am plagued with not being able to shut my mind off, and this manifests itself as nervous energy.
The more I think about it, the more I don’t want to self medicate that way, by isolating, inside OR out.
It was a bad experience all the way around, depression.
The little devil on my shoulder tells me there has to be a better way.
So maybe I’ll try rebellion instead.

65,https://www.opendiary.com/m/kaleidoscope-eyes/im-a-believer-19-5987001/,2021-04-12,I’m a believer,"
This entry is about me.
Because for the first time in my life, I’m emotionally alone.

It’s the most sickening feeling in the world to hear the person you love the most say “maybe we should break up.”

After 14 years of believing his love was unconditional, I’m on kinda shaky ground right now. This is the only man I have ever loved and the only adult love I have ever known and tonight, he felt as if he needed to remind me that he’s someone else’s husband and that he always will be.

From what I understood, he isn’t going to be able to give me anything more than what he gives now, and that maybe I’d be better off without him if I can’t be happy or content. 

He also reminded me that he gives me more than he gives his wife…more time, more attention, more of everything.

And he does.

I asked him what he would do if he didn’t have me for an affair partner and his reply was that he wouldn’t have another relationship, he’d just masturbate.

I feel sick.

I want to cry or throw up or maybe both. 

If he’s made to feel like his efforts fall short of what I need, he’s ready to resign himself to a lifetime WITH his wife and WITHOUT me. He will no longer want me for an emotional partner at that point anymore, either. He will be content with her and will find ways to get sexual gratification that do not include me.

So sex with me is replaced by jerking off. And she, or someone else that isn’t me, replaces the emotional part. Or, he becomes a hermit. Those were the two choices he said he had chosen for himself.

He capitulated when I freaked out!  He backtracked, in an effort to soothe me. I can’t unhear the words and I’m torn between a big fuck you and clinging to him, begging him not to leave me because I cannot breathe without him.

But that’s precisely what he wants to avoid. That is what he’s trying to flee from…the feeling of being responsible for another person’s happiness. 

And the worst part of all of this is that it came on the heels of a very personal disagreement, one for which I placed some of the blame for my hurt onto him. After some reflection time, his response to his own guilt or to my finger pointing, however misplaced it may have been, was to abandon me. 

He needs someone to vent to about how miserable his wife makes him, I know that and I want it to be me, but then he gets angry when I express confusion over why he won’t leave her. 

Angry enough to remind me that it’s ME he will leave if I make demands he isn’t willing or able to fulfill. 

I’m not angry. I’m not panicked. I’m fucking numb because nothing surprises me anymore.
Now, I feel like I’m moving closer and closer to the edge of a waterfall. I can see the drop coming and the tumultuous water is beating me up. The sound it makes is as deafening as the screams inside my head.

In the final seconds I realize I am not afraid anymore of what’s over the edge.

I am already dead, for he has silenced me. 

My voice and my written word just became what he will use to try to prove to me that I’m better off without him, to avenge himself of any guilt he will have for leaving me.

He said to let him into my head and to let him read these words because I could trust him. He assured me over and over.

What is he going to do now, with that trust I placed in him? Is he going to use it to show me what the devil looks like when he’s laughing in my face or is he gonna use it to prove to me that the 14 years I’ve given him were because the feelings in my heart were right and he was worthy of them?

If he can’t be my superhero, he’s gonna jump ship. 

But I don’t need a superhero. Everyone knows that a superhero never lets you down, and THAT isn’t reasonable because nobody is perfect.

All I need is a mortal man to believe in.

I will take him, all of him, emotional and physical imperfections included. 

My mortal man will kneel down at my feet and lay his head against my belly and tell me I’m the last face he wants to see before he leaves this world.

I don’t know who that man will be at the end of my life, but I wish my lover would continue to be his understudy, in the meantime.

It never hurts to memorize the lines.

Sometimes the cocky lead actor isn’t prepared. 

And in a twist of fate, the guy that sacrificed and put in the study time gets the part.

66,https://www.opendiary.com/m/kaleidoscope-eyes/holy-water-19-6037516/,2021-08-17,Holy Water,"
Throughout my childhood, my grandma’s house was my sanctuary.  
Grandma’s house is where I felt most loved. Being born to her 16 year old daughter ensured my grandma’s constant presence in my life and there was nobody that loved me more than she did.
And I knew it.
Whenever I felt bad about life, or my feelings were hurt or my parents didn’t understand me or my boyfriend broke up with me…I went to grandma and she put her arms around me and told me I was good and everything was right again.
Even more special than grandma’s house was her cabin at the lake, and when summer rolled around it was like salve to a wounded soul. The sun would shine on your face and the warm water held you like a lover.
Now my heart is mangled and my grandma is gone and there is nowhere to run except the lake, the only part I have left of her. It is the last place on earth where I can be close to her. I miss her so much right now. I just need someone to love me.
The man I have loved for a thousand years chose someone else. He chose her knowing that if he got caught he would never see me again. So today, I learned of my value to him, or lack thereof, and this time I cannot look the other way.
And I can’t decide if my heart is on fire with rage or dead at the hand of betrayal.
I just know that this is where I need to be for the next few days, or maybe longer. I don’t want to be me right now. I don’t want to be in my own skin. I want to be in anyone else’s reality besides my own, even though I am well aware there are far worse fates than betrayal.
When I am here alone at the cottage, I am not afraid. I have never been afraid. I am surrounded by pictures of the people that I am part of. The ones that brought me into this world and the ones I will be reunited with in the end, if you believe in fairy tales.
My husband didn’t look surprised when I packed a bag and told him I was heading here. He looked startled, but not surprised.
I got here in the middle of the night, and now I sit in the dark waiting for daylight to come so the sun can shine on my face and I can cry as much as I want.
The lake can absorb a thousand tears.
I wonder what would happen if I drifted on a raft until the sun burned me into nothingness.
I bet even then I would still feel the sick pain of failure and smell the stench of inferiority.
What will happen now that my worst fears have come true?
I think it means that there is nothing left to fear. Maybe that’s a good thing.
Just a few more hours till salvation comes over the horizon.
They say it’s darkest before the dawn and dawn’s still three hours away. I am anxious to be outside.
The sun is all I have left.
Because what used to light up my world is gone.

I’m afraid.
I’ve been perpetually afraid that this day would come and even more afraid it would destroy me when it did.
But here I am, very much alive. I am not dead but instead I am reeling from the pain of abandonment and indeed, frozen by a strange new fear.
I have not known anything but Roger for 14 years.
I was 40 years old, lonely as fuck, and petrified when I ventured out onto the married “dating” website, and he was quick to strike.
He gave me the attention I was missing and soon the desire to meet him in real life won out over sensibility and what followed was the greatest love affair of my life, lasting well beyond most marriages.
I clung to him for years as if he were the only thing giving me life and maybe he was, cuz without him I feel like I’m dying.
I begged him not to cheat again and I told him that I could only swallow my pride once, but I could not face a life without him in it, and I promptly forgave him.
Then came the second time.
And now the third.
Today, there is but one tiny shred of my dignity left for me to reclaim.
The greatest love of my life called my bluff. He challenged me to make good on the ultimatum I gave him.
I was angry, and admonished him by saying HE lost the best thing he had going for him. Now that I think about it, it’s ME that walks away defeated. He has someone to love him. He has someone that wants him. He feels adored and his pride is intact. He never missed a beat and his heart has no burden, nor does he have to give me the gift of his remorse.
Without him I’m vulnerable. But he doesn’t want me anymore. He’s no longer the keeper of my heart. He threw it back into the discard pile because it’s value didn’t contribute to his winning hand. His best value is the woman closer to him and cheaper to maintain. She’s his ace in the hole.
In short, he lied when he said I was irreplaceable.
And I deserve every ounce of the pain I’m feeling for allowing myself to believe him. But every girl wants to believe she is special to one man, more valuable than all the others and enough to make him stop searching for something better.
I feel like I’m lost and I can’t go home because home is gone forever. The big bad wolf blew it down and she’s sucking my lover’s dick and he’s letting her. He puts his face in her pussy and he breathes her in and she turns him on like I cannot and it hurts so bad it feels like an actual weight on my chest.
He called me his baby. I thought that meant he cherished me, yet it is him that has hurt me so deeply. I am left feeling so confused.
I don’t want him to go away and leave me alone, but now I’m out of choices. He made the choice for both him AND I. I still can’t believe he chose this. My heart cannot accept it. I am unlovable.
I don’t want to close my eyes and sleep because I am afraid of the feeling I know awaits me when I wake up.
For a split second I will feel joy and then the realization that he is gone will come flooding back and my memory will be cruelly refreshed.
I don’t understand how he could call me his lover and touch me with a mouth that loves another woman’s body.
I have never been so afraid in my whole 54 years.
Everything that grounded me has fallen from beneath my feet.
I feel like the earth is about to open her mouth and swallow me whole and my lover won’t be there to keep me from her grasp.
Instead he will look upon me with a face full of betrayal and at the moment of my death he will laugh at me for being the foolish girl I am. I will have maybe thirty seconds of harsh realization before it’s over but maybe that’s the best I can hope for in terms of mercy.
I know the rule when giving someone an ultimatum is that you have to be prepared to lose.
I gambled on the belief that the fear of losing me was enough to make my lover faithful. I had to put my money where my mouth is and now I’m scared as fuck.
I hope his decision was the right one for him even though it left me afraid and in the dark.
Because fear is temporary.
But regret is forever.

68,https://www.opendiary.com/m/kaleidoscope-eyes/good-love-is-hard-to-find-6037634/,2021-08-18,Good love is hard to find,"
I am still hiding at the lake cottage.
I don’t want to go back to reality and face probing eyes and questions about why I’m not hungry or why I look so tired.
I can’t stay here forever but today I wish I could. I hurt so bad that I cannot bear to face people.
My lover confessed that he tricked me and fooled me into believing the other affair he had been having was over, only to go right back to her once he regained his foothold in OUR relationship.
What is her allure?
Is she prettier than me? Does she make him feel more like a man? Did I rob him of his manhood with my ugly dominance and my lurid fantasies? Did I make him bisexual and piss in my own well by having playful fantasies that he wanted to turn into reality once the idea and the words escaped my lips? Do I deserve all of this for everything he ever said I did wrong or for everything I ever did to annoy or upset him?
I miss him so much. I hurt so bad. I can’t feel my heart and my soul is no longer inside of me. I feel anxious…like I will die from the panic of him not being here.
Soon it will be winter and how will I survive the short days and long nights with nothing but an empty heart and memories? How will I survive without ever feeling his lips on mine again or his breath and soft words in my ear?
Will I ever again look into the face of a man that I love as I climax?
I will never feel my lover’s warm and familiar hands on the tattoo near my lower back that represents the love I have for him.
Please God, don’t let me die of fear or from the painful longing I have for the man that doesn’t love me. That seems like a cruel fate to inflict on someone that was already made painfully aware of that fact.
I cannot accept that I will never see him again, that I will never see his eyes light up when he looks at me. I will never again watch the smile creep over his face or hold him and breathe in his rich, manly smell….the one I hold so dear that I sleep with his sweat stained t shirt up to my face at night.
How am I going to accept that he doesn’t want me anymore?
He was not keen on me giving him oral sex because that is what his other lover provided and I was pigeonholed and earmarked for a different purpose and I don’t know how I can feel any more sick or sad about that. Now I find out that I didn’t matter much to him. I meant less to him than she did.
In the end it was her that he couldn’t live without…not me.
I cannot bear to block his calls and texts but I know I must summon the strength to do so. My plan is to build up my strength little by little, day by day, so I don’t fall into an abyss of panic when I no longer have any avenue of communication. Somehow it feels better that he tries to reach me and I am petrified that he will soon give up and move on with her and I will have been nothing at all. I will have to accept that as my reality, and I don’t think I have what it takes to be able to do that.
I am nothing at all right now, alone at a picnic table in the dark hurting for the touch of someone that has the ability to make me whole, but who would instead rather break me into a million tiny pieces to throw into the air like radioactive confetti.
I’ve never in my life felt this scared and alone.
Please baby, make it all go back to the way it was before you loved her more than me. Please let me feel your body against mine and your face in my chest just one more time and please don’t leave me alone for the rest of my life because without you I am dying.
Please my lover, wipe away all the memories of how you have forsaken me even though I gave you more than I have ever given anyone else. Please let me run my fingers through your hair and down your back one more time.
If I knew that the last time I saw you was going to be the last time I would ever touch you, I would have given anything to make it last even one more hour.
Take me back to when I could believe in you and when I went to bed at night knowing and believing that when I woke up you would be there loving me.
When I met you, you promised that if I exposed myself to you, you would love me and hold me in the highest regard.
I exposed myself to you and you mocked me by allowing someone else inside our sacred emotional shelter. Now you’re gone and I’m alone and I wonder when I will stop crying out for you.
I have to accept the truth that trying your hardest and doing your best doesn’t mean you will succeed in holding on to what is important to you.
As much as it kills me to believe it, someone else’s best was better than mine.
I HAVE to let go of the belief that hard work guarantees success, cuz I worked my ass off to make our love affair successful and I failed. I failed and I’m so scared to walk without you holding my hand. I am lost. Success was not meant to be mine, and from this I will learn an excruciatingly painful lesson.
Success is not final;
Failure is not fatal;
It is the courage to continue that counts.

I have known for months now that you had another lover and I suspected it was the same one I caught you with six months ago.
You never stopped seeing her.
She must have been worth more to you than me.
Now she can be the one that worries about your fidelity. She can be the one waiting for the text you can’t lie away or cover up for. She can experience that sickening emotional punch in the gut that comes with the discovery of your betrayal.
I know I must swallow it instead of continuing to pour my guts out in an online diary. But I feel angry and wounded, and this is a safe place to vent.
I’m glad you aren’t reading this because I am at the lowest point in my life thus far and I’m embarrassed and self conscious. I feel embarrassed that I was sharing you with someone else and that you said the same things to her that you said to me. I was not your special lover. I was not your baby. I was just a willing participant in line and cycled through like all the others before me.
SHE is your only baby now.
You can call her that, too, if you don’t already, when you say “nitey nite” in your special way, just like you did to me.
I was aware of her existence because you fucked up previous to this time, accidently sending me texts meant for her and forgetting who you told what. What resulted from that was you telling me things several times to cover your bases.
One night, you told me goodnight and then two hours later, you said goodnight again, but I knew about her LONG before you made THAT mistake. I knew from the past that there had always been texts that made no sense, texts that were out of context, texts that I let you explain away because I would rather believe your lies than believe I meant so little to you.
Last time this happened, I fought a raging battle with my ego. I was repeatedly bitch slapped by my furious pride and I could not wait to prove to you that I was worthy to someone. Beautiful. Desirable. Accepted and loved without conditions.
Instead I got brutally sodomized.
Humiliated.
I was left fearful of disease, only to be chastised by you for possibly contracting “herpes in my ass”, and I took two std tests to keep you safe and to assuage my guilt and shame… so that you would find me clean enough to love again, so you wouldn’t make me feel like being with someone else made me tainted and sick. Untouchable. Like a whore…not “devoted” like you said your wife is. You OWN her useless, rigid body, and she is unsullied by other men. That makes her yours. She is clean and she remains protected. She won’t be put at risk because there is no way she will ask for sex.
She is abhorred by sex. That’s why you’re so empty and why you keep searching for something to soothe the sting her words burn into your skin.
There is no chance you will infect your ice princess. But it’s ok to infect me. That’s your thought process in this clusterfuck of a situation.
I felt sick for betraying you with others, but you didn’t give me the same courtesy.
All along you were exposing me to someone else’s potential disease, Illness, virus, and basically all infectious agents in general including HIV, because you don’t know where she has been and who else she’s sleeping with.
After all, she’s fucking around with your skank ass now isn’t she? So, there are probably more where you came from, knocking on her door for an afternoon quickie, and you can ALL go fuck and swim in your own filthy pond full of cum.
You betrayed me and put my life in danger.
You shattered my illusions of what a man means to a woman. You took away my most prized possession and turned it into a useless piece of defaced currency, as cold as the government that minted it.
You let the woman you married make you feel like less than a man because you’re too afraid to stand up to her, and then you hurt the woman that licks your ass to save face.
I’m angry as hell at you for asking me to stay for 14 years with not only zero intention of ever giving me a shot at a real spot in your life, but with no intention of even letting me be your ONLY extracurricular lover.  With zero fucks given about how I would feel when I found out, you chose to keep up what you claim is no more than a casual relationship, at the expense of losing me.
If I knew that was part of the package, I would have told you to go to hell before you even got me close to the soapy shower stall that you bent me over in to seal our deal.
I pathetically tried to shame you into feeling remorse for hurting me, but if you were capable of remorse you wouldn’t have risked hurting me to begin with.
I can hardly believe you did this again.
And I can hardly believe that you are questioning why I feel that you aren’t sexually attracted to me, so let me break it down for you.
It’s so simple. It won’t take long so listen carefully.
IF you found me sexually attractive, you would not need more stimulation than I could provide you. I would be more than a fetish, more than your dominatrix. I would be your normal, conventional, vanilla lover also… LIKE SHE IS. I would be ENOUGH…enough to fulfill every need and the love and desire you feel for me would blind you to any other woman’s beauty. You are sexually attracted to a few parts of me…not ALL of me.
It seems as if you would reward me for my selflessness. It seems you would reward me for being a lover that cared solely about your pleasure, sometimes over my own.
And how would you reward me? By giving yourself to me, and ONLY me. By being faithful to me, NOT by having other women, all the while expecting me to be open and energetic and giving and confident, despite knowing that. That’s a tall motherfucking order. Find me the woman that can do that so I can get her autograph.
In the end, you sold me out for a woman closer to home and less hassle. In the end, the void Lori created in you makes you crave more acceptance and adoration than I alone can give you.
In the end, you needed MORE than the self admitted “best sex of your life” to keep you from hurting and disrespecting me. In the end, even what you yourself admitted was the best thing you have ever had wasn’t enough to make you trustworthy and grateful.
And most importantly, satisfied.
When I was growing up, I was taught to be satisfied with very little because we HAD so little. If ever I wanted a Barbie doll or some other item that wasn’t in the budget, I was reminded that I had three Barbie dolls at home and that some little girls had none at all. When I got older and more independent, I MET those little girls that didn’t have a pot to piss in or a window to throw it out of and guess what? I learned real quick that my mama was right, and I was always grateful to get back home to my three not so new Barbie dolls.
I guess nobody ever told you what my mama told me, but somebody should have.
Because then maybe you’d know that the old adage below is still true today.
Always remember…
That someone else is happy,
With less than what you have.

Today is Thursday and I’m still at the cottage.
I’ve been here since Monday.
There is solace in being alone. Today, I floated on the water and listened to the sounds around me and I tried to think good thoughts but the ugly truths kept replaying in my head.
He doesn’t just have sex with her.
He has a relationship with her.
He tells her all the same things he told me. Maybe he does all the same things for her that he did for me. He said she was more convenient and provided him the extra stimulation he craved, the stimulation he doesn’t want from me or that he can’t afford or spare the time for. He maintains daily contact with her, and asks her about the things that are important to her and I bet he tells her she’s sexy because the bastard says it to me.
And he did it right under my nose like I didn’t matter at all, but that’s not the worst part.
No.
The worst part is he can’t even pretend to be sorry. He won’t admit to doing wrong…and he hasn’t uttered so much as an apology of any sorts because he’s more concerned with dodging allegations than he is with being sorry.
He’s only sorry he got caught.
He can’t be faithful to me and I already didn’t trust him, for very good reason, obviously. Now I can’t even hope for empathy, remorse or self reflection. There is absolutely no way on God’s green earth this motherfucker is EVER going to be faithful to me. In 14 years, he has told nobody but one person that I even fucking EXIST cuz he didn’t want to risk hurting his wretched old dungeon master of a wife.
He didn’t give two shits about hurting and betraying ME. To add insult to injury, he wasn’t even careful…he didn’t care if he got caught! He knew full well that disrespecting me again would result in our forever separation.
But. He. Did. It. Anyway.
Now, he’s asking me if I want to chat on the phone and telling me that he missed our nightly talk.
Maybe he will call HER now on his way home.
Maybe when he sees HER his eyes will sparkle and she will fill his vision and I will be just another one of his worn out vehicles, neglected now that I struggle to start on cold days.
I hate the man I love for hurting me so deeply. I hate the man I love for not meaning it when he said I was his baby and when he looked into my eyes and said I love you.
I hate him for not loving me enough to protect me from hurt and additional or unnecessary pain.
Now I’m stupid and alone.
But the alone part feels ok.
I’d rather be alone than to be repeatedly taken for granted and hurt by the person that claims to love me.
My lover wouldn’t give me legitimacy. He didn’t assign me enough value. He wouldn’t make me his girlfriend or wife and he told me we would never live together or have a relationship outside of an affair and I accepted it all with one condition…that he be loyal to me. He knew that it was important to earn my trust so that I could feel safe enough to receive pleasure from him.
ALL he really had to do to be my hero was THAT…BE LOYAL. GUARD MY FEELINGS.
But he didn’t. And this closing quote is not only fitting, but it was the inspiration for this entry. It says everything about my lover’s tactic of throwing up smoke and mirrors to make himself look less culpable. Things such as focusing on issues that do not pertain to what he has done wrong, like whether or not I think he’s sexually attracted to me.
Of course I don’t think you’re sexually attracted to me, for fuck’s sake, because you would rather have sex with someone else…and you currently ARE. That’s pretty indicative of lack of interest, or losing sexual attraction to someone…when you need to choose someone other than that person to be naked with and licking once a week in the mid afternoon, or maybe weekends, which is probably why your suspicious wife was looking for your lying ass.
HE is a serial cheater. That’s the problem, NOT my degree of sexual attractiveness.
All my lover had left TO offer me was his fucking loyalty.
So yeah, the quote I chose summed it up better than I could and it is as follows:
“Those who do not understand the REAL value of loyalty, tend to underestimate the cost of betrayal.”
Time to pay up, lover.
Hope you can cover it.
Cuz I’m flat broke.

71,https://www.opendiary.com/m/kaleidoscope-eyes/little-dreamer-5-6038777/,2021-08-22,Little Dreamer,"
Every morning this past week, the birds were singing outside and I was coaxed awake by the sun blasting through the huge floor to ceiling windows at the cottage. They open straight out and up, and are then latched to a hook in the ceiling so that they hang horizontal and suspended, parallel to.
They are twenty or thirty years older than me.
Waking up there helped me cope with the hurt I am experiencing. It felt safe.
When I woke up at home this morning, I had fragmented memories of a dream I must have had sometime in the night.
It was pitch black, nighttime, in my dream, and I was asleep in a big old fashioned wooden bed with a down tick for a mattress and an ornately carved headboard. Old, like Victorian era old. And that’s how the room looked too, with tall ceilings and big bare floors. It was cold and I could hear my lover calling my name. He sounded hurt or frightened. Instinctually, I went to him.
I lit a torch or a candle and I was walking down what seemed like an endless hallway, with flaming sconces lining the walls. I could faintly hear a raging wind coming from somewhere.
It was not loud enough to drown out my lover’s urgent cries. It seemed as if they weren’t getting louder, no matter how far down the hallway I ventured, and my search became desperate.
I flung open door after big wooden door, all along the hallway, but each one I opened was as dark and empty as the last.
I felt more panic with each barren room when finally, after what seemed like a hundred doors, my lover’s voice became louder and clearer.
I could see light coming from under the final door I reached, and a searing heat could be felt through the wood panels. My lover was in the room and I could hear his frantic cries loudly now!
I opened the door to the loudest wind I had ever heard and things like paper and books were caught up in the current and hurling through the air.
And then our eyes met and there was my lover, hanging on for dear life, his fingers clawing the splintered boards of the floor he had fallen through. Underneath him was what looked like a six story drop into a raging inferno.
I looked over to see a frightened woman, her eyes wide with panic and disbelief. It didn’t take long to register that I was looking at his other lover. The one that wasn’t me.
That’s when I said to her, “Get him! Pull him up!”
To which she replied, “I can’t. I’m not strong enough.”
I said “You have to try!”
Then she shook her head and said, “No…He might pull me down with him and he’s not worth my own life.”
And then she fled out the same door I entered and I was alone with my traitor of a lover.
In his eyes I saw a flash of relief and I think I saw hope…hope that he might have a shot at surviving after all, and I caught a glimpse of confidence, too, for reflected in his eyes was the sure knowledge that I would not hesitate to risk falling down the hole to save him.
That’s it. That’s where it ended, the dream. Once I oriented myself to the fact that it WAS indeed a dream, I was almost bummed that there was no climactic ending…like a bad movie where in the credits roll and you throw your hands up and go “That was it??!”
I think what I do in the next few days will determine the ending to my dream.
Will I stand just far enough away that he cannot quite reach me and watch the look of betrayal on his face as he slips down the hole? Or will I reach for him without thinking of my own peril, like his eyes expected me to do?
How hard it would be, not to let the past determine his future. How sweet IS revenge? And what did he think he would find in her that he wouldn’t find in me? In my dream,it was she who turned her back on him with the fire licking at his ass. That was the consequence for his hurtful choice, and the woman who would risk life and limb stood there deciding his fate.
At that moment in time, he would have realized that his choices were about to cost him everything. Literally.
Be careful who you trust, lover.
Salt and sugar look the same.

Today I am struggling. 
I can’t control my emotions.
I knew it would be hard when I came home from the lake cottage, to face my real life alone without you.
I want you so bad. I cry for you on and off throughout the day and I don’t know why I want to feed the hand that bites me.
I’m 54 years old and I am crying like a fucking baby, because you made me feel like one. You were safe and warm and your arms were my sanctuary and I don’t know anything but you and I feel so afraid.
I know now how a child feels when a parent turns abusive. The confusion is real, because the same person that loves you can and will hurt you again and again. You love them. You want to trust them and receive affection and care, but you guard yourself, unsure when the next blow is coming.
I’m ashamed of myself for my pain and neediness. I don’t want to be weak willed. The urge to run to you and feel your lips on mine is the hardest urge I’ve ever had to fend off.
I want my daddy. But you left me. You didn’t care enough about me to not hurt me again and now I have to face what I know is the truth.
I can’t eat or sleep. I want you so bad it’s like a physical pain, the longing.
I feel like I must be the most fucked up woman in the world. I feel stupid. Pissed. Weak. Ugly. Unwanted. Flawed. Afraid. Ashamed. Sick.
And the list goes on.
But I don’t want to be bound like that, in great emotional turmoil and facing conflict within myself. I want to go back into hiding. It’s so much easier to be alone with my thoughts and feelings.
When I held my daughter in my arms for the first time, I knew I’d lay my life down for my baby so when you called me baby, I believed you would protect me from hurt.
Instead, you inflicted it. On me. Your baby.
I don’t know why you loved me for so many years but never wanted me to be part of your real life.
All of it is confusing and I don’t want you to keep apologizing. I don’t know what I thought would ever become of our relationship, of us. I don’t know why I was so hopeful that it could be real, probably because you were so good to me in so many other ways and I believed we had worked through our problems with this subject but I guess I was mistaken. I was always satisfied sexually in the past 7 months, the interval in which you were with your other lover…this time around.
I imagine her to be seductive and beautiful, because you could not give her up for me. I imagine her to be so much more than me and her ghost is causing me hellish turmoil.
I want someone to love me like you love her and like you love your wife. Why can’t that someone be you? Isn’t being my hero enough? Why does she have to come before me?
When you are looking down at her as she’s sucking your cock, I want you to see my face and hear my cries. When you put your face in her pussy, I hope it’s me that you taste and smell.
I hope she gives you everything I couldn’t or didn’t.
I’m not going to let her in line in front of me. Fuck no. I forfeit.
I don’t want to be a sore loser.
But second place is just the first loser in the competition.

73,https://www.opendiary.com/m/kaleidoscope-eyes/ticket-to-ride-13-6038961/,2021-08-24,Ticket to ride,"
I don’t want to be awake today.
It’s just another difficult day to try and muddle through.
I feel broken and empty and the tears are all dried up and there is nothing left to me but a shell of a person. I feel beaten and defeated and like I have no future when my best isn’t good enough.
I admitted to the man I love my own wrong doing and it was definitely a wrong doing, but I do not feel sparse conversation and one way sex between me and the person I was with is equivalent to an affair where you talk daily and stay together for the better part of a year, but my lover would like me to think it was. Somehow we have turned it around so that my mistake exonerates his own, and he actually mocked me yesterday after all the tears I’ve cried. He laughed at me when I said I missed him and he said it had only been a week and a half. I guess it has to be forever before he misses me and I hate myself. I am stupid and flawed and I am aware of it but I don’t know how to change myself and be a better person.
Now I feel responsible for his betrayal, and because I didn’t provide for all of his sexual needs or I didn’t give him enough, he had to seek out someone better, someone that could offer more and be more sexual and more kind. And more beautiful for sure. I don’t want to be in a contest with her. I don’t want to taste her pussy on my lover’s lips and the thought that I did makes me want to die of shame and humiliation. They can be together forever and laugh at me for all of eternity. He says he told her he wanted to devote time to me, and instead of letting him, she had to see if she could lure him back in and he let her so he didn’t give one fuck about our 14 year love affair. His ego was more important than my feelings. HER wanting him is what is most important.
I just want to give in to the sick feelings dragging me down and replaying in my head but I don’t know how. I would never commit suicide. I’m too chicken and I love my kids and my parents.
And even my own miserable life.
I won’t kill myself. Ever.
But I AM thinking about running away for good. I know it’s an unconventional plan but it sounds more and more feasible every day. Start over. No lovers or friends and no family and responsibilities for anyone but myself.
It is selfish, I know. But I find myself thinking about it just about every second of every hour and I fucking hurt and want to run.
I’ll make my own way and fly under the government radar by working without a license in my trade, because my license is only good for the state I live in and I would have to be far away from here to make it work and to stay hidden.
I think my kids will be most affected but maybe if they knew I was alive, it wouldn’t be so hard for them.
I hurt so much I’m not sure I can put them first, before me, and I never in a million years thought I would ever say this because my kids are the good thing in my life, but I feel like I failed them, too.
Maybe they will find a replacement mother and it will be better for them in the long run.
I think my mind is sound. I would not be contemplating this if it wasn’t.
I don’t think this is just because my lover hurt me. I think this is because I don’t want to be where I am reminded of my empty life and with a husband that is abusive and makes me feel like a prisoner. I think it is a response to a lifetime of shit judgement and failures.
AND yes, the urge to run is also fueled by the hurt bestowed upon me by my lover, because I believed in someone that didn’t respect my feelings and betrayed my trust. I feel hoodwinked. I did what I did with another man to find comfort from the wounds he was inflicting upon me with his other affair that I knew about all along, and because I felt his absence in my heart and I knew he was sharing himself with someone else. Women know when the man they love is focusing his efforts elsewhere. I don’t think he ever got rid of her and I was just someone for them to laugh at because I was the only one that didn’t know about what was going on. She knew about me.
I can honestly say I hate my husband with all that is inside me. There is not one shred of love left between us and he refuses to acknowledge how miserable I am and take any real responsibility for the shitty man he’s always been, and he acts like doesn’t even hear my pleas for a fair and amicable divorce. He’d rather see me sick and alone before he gives up one cent to me. That’s what makes him stay married, the loss of money. How is that in ANY way fair to me? He is the same man that became impotent and rather than share that fact, he just never had sex with me again. I was 50 years old and celibacy was chosen for me by HIM. That’s a crock of crap and I swallowed it.
Yup, he’d rather see me (and him) miserable than have to share one penny of the considerable fortune that he has amassed. I’ve never spent a dime of our money and if he has anything to say about it, I never will. He will hoard it until the day he dies and that, by the way, can’t come soon enough and I don’t give a good Goddamn if I go straight to hell for saying that. I mean every word. I hate that fucker of a man. He robbed me of my sexuality. He wants nothing to do with me and vice versa. And yes, his death would be a welcome relief and an end to the suffering inflicted by his cruel hand.
Yes. Fuck him. He’s been the worst partner a woman could have and he’s devoid of so much love and tenderness that it is almost inhuman.
And the man I chose to fill his shoes doesn’t give a fuck either. All he wanted was a stand in for sex so he could keep the woman he does love..or maybe there is more than two, because I am certainly not enough and never was.
I’ve wasted the life God gave me and I don’t see why disappearing and being a drifter could be any more stupid and frivolous than what I’ve already done with that life.
All I ever wanted was someone to love me and make me feel like I was the only one but I am convinced it’s a stupid girlish fairy tale and every man will fuck you and hurt your heart and soul. And cheat. And you’ll NEVER ever be enough.
Love does not exist for me.
And a life without real love is a life wasted.
There is a quote I remember hearing once and it stuck with me.
“Don’t waste words on people that deserve your silence.”
The way I feel today…
I may never speak again.

I am telling myself that this thought does not need to be immortalized on open diary, but for some reason I feel compelled to write it.
Life is just weird and the seven degrees of separation thing is true, as is the fact that sometimes you run into someone that made a difference in your life, and you get to TELL them they made a difference in your life.
That happened to me today.
The start of high school can be rough. You want to fit in and have a boyfriend and friends, but you are definitely not confident or comfortable in your own skin as a 14 year old girl.
And what’s worse than being a freshman?
Being a freshman that has to ride the school bus, that’s what.
The first day I had to climb up the steps and sit among a bunch of high schoolers, after having only ever been on the primary school bus, was petrifying.
My dad always bought me new clothes to start school and my mom always let me get my haircut in the latest style, but all I wanted to do was blend in.
But a girl named Jackie made sure I did NOT.
She was mean. Relentlessly mean. She was from a dairy farming family and they were well off. That still happens in the Midwest believe it or not, and she had everything money could buy except apparently a car, because bitch was riding the bus as a senior.
Every day she would file past me and hit me on the head with her history book. It hurt like a fucker and I think I still have neck damage. It hurt so bad I had to bite my tongue to keep from crying and it was a shock each time she did it…came out of nowhere and I never knew when she was gonna strike.
There was another girl on the bus and her name was Dawn. She was from a very modest family but she had something Jackie did not. She. Was. Beautiful.
She had brown feathered hair with blonde highlights like Farrah Fawcett and shiny glossed lips. She was petite and soft spoken and she dressed well. She always had a leather jacket and perfect makeup and she was very shy and introverted.
But boys adored her and clamored for her attention and all the girls wanted to be around Dawn, because that’s where the boys were.
Shy, quiet, beautiful Dawn had high school clout and a pure heart, and I know this because of what she did for me.
Jackie had been torturing me for weeks but the day she wiped a big blob of vaseline petroleum jelly in my hair was the most humiliating day of my young life.
I didn’t go to school. When I got off the bus, I walked to the seven eleven store in town and used the payphone to call my dad. He drove home 20 miles to take me home to wash my hair. I couldn’t get it out no matter how many times I washed it and finally my dad used go-jo automotive hand cleaner to strip it out.
And he was furious. He said that he was going to take care of it by going to Jackie’s dad, Jack. Growing up in a small town, everyone knows one another and my dad knew Jack. I begged and pleaded with him NOT to, as it was certain to be social suicide for me if he did.
He said he wouldn’t go to her dad, but I’d have to stick up for myself and stand up to my bus bully. His exact words were “it’s time you cleaned her clock.”
So the next day when she stabbed me in the head with an open safety pin, I followed his orders and I shoved her down the bus stairs and straight onto her wicked little ass. She was aghast, for lack of a better word.
I got kicked off the bus for one week and my dad told me he was proud of me and that I always needed to stand up for myself regardless of the consequences. And then he drove me to school every morning for that week of suspension. And he even bought me McDonald’s breakfast.
I had no classes with mean Jackie so it wasn’t until I got back on the bus that she began to plot her revenge.
But this time she needed help. There is safety in numbers and it is easy to be tough with a gang by your side.
So Jackie enlisted the help of several girls to beat me up.
But one girl refused. Not only did she refuse to participate in hurting me, but she told Jackie she was all but DONE with watching her hit me and stab me and ruin my hair.
It was beautiful Dawn. All four foot eleven inches of her tiny frame stood there brazenly  protecting my dignity.
Mean Jackie never looked my way again, for the Queen Bee had spoken, and called her off, effectively too, I might add. Mean Jackie knew if she went against beautiful Dawn she’d pay the price with isolation and unpopularity, brought upon by Dawn’s disapproval of her actions.
They were not friends, Dawn and Jackie.
Dawn had gone out on a limb for me.
She was so pretty and popular that I was too in awe of her to even mutter a thank you. All I remember is her glossy, slight smile and her courage. And then she graduated and was gone.
Her life was not good after she finished school. Her husband left her for his own sister in law and Dawn ended up a single mom working at the party store, with a food card and a drinking problem
And stage four breast cancer.
There were canisters around town and we collected money for her treatment and in a small town what you do is pray, pray the illness away like any good German Catholic.  Several years went by and I wondered how she had fared. I didn’t hear any updates,  but I always hoped she was well. With cancer though, that is rarely the outcome.
Fast forward to today, about two o clock this afternoon. I was in line to pay for my gas and there was a tiny old lady in line in front of me. I stared at the back of her head as I waited my turn to pay the attendant, noticing its steely gray color and her perfect but outdated feathered hair. She was carrying a 24 pack of beer and she struggled to balance it against her small frame.
She paid for her beer and turned to leave and our eyes met. Her face was lined with deep wrinkles and her skin looked like leather. Her eyes held a sadness that belied her faded beauty.
It was beautiful Dawn. Fate has been unkind to her and she is now formerly beautiful Dawn but it was definitely her and I put my arm out gently to block her path out and I said “Do you remember me?”
She said “yes” and then she called me by name.
Before she could say another word I said “Do you remember the girl that tortured me on the bus? You confronted her and told her to stop hurting me and you put an end to her constant harassment and I just want to say thank you for that. Your kindness made a huge difference to a 14 year old band nerd with glasses. You saved me from what would have been certain misery my first year in high school.”
She just stared at me for a second and her eyes filled with tears and she looked overcome with emotion. She put the case of beer on the floor and she held her arms out to me and we embraced for longer than the average quick “hello” hug and then she said “thank you.”
I went home and looked on facebook and all over Dawn’s page were well wishers and congratulatory messages, celebrating the fact that she has been cancer free for five years now.
Apparently, my words touched her in a way that made me glad I had thanked her.
I would like to think karma blessed Dawn with recovery for her kindness towards me as a frightened teenager. I would like to think what she did earned her cosmic favor with the universe.
Truth is, she just got lucky. Cuz fate is what you make it and karma is just a pipe dream.
But I learned something important from that experience.
Jackie was wealthy.
Dawn was not.
But kindness is a gift everyone can afford.

I don’t know how to feel less wounded.
I wish I did,  so I could stop thinking about the bad stuff.
Every time he does anything, goes anywhere, or even just stays home, I am wondering if he’s seeing her. I know him. He won’t stop.
I don’t know how to handle my emotions.
Part of me wants comfort so bad that I want to go out and find someone.
But the other part of me knows I will not get what I need or want by doing that. I will get the same married men, wanting an hour affair each week with little to no contact in between. And that man will have several other women in addition to me, because he already took the big leap of cheating on his spouse..cheating on anyone else has minimal consequence to him. It’s gravy. That’s it.
And married women can be the same way in this arena. There are plenty that want sex and not much else and there are plenty that want a relationship in addition to the affair.
Either way, he has a smorgasbord to choose from and I’m yesterday’s dinner.
He uses the word “prolly” in his texts now for “probably” and I know damn well he learned that lingo from his local lover.
I’m so hurt and humiliated and angry that I just want to hide away and let him and her enjoy each other for an eternity while I throw up the poison that’s left in my heart.
I want to cry and I do. Often. And it never seems to make me feel any better.
I want someone’s arms around me for comfort.
I want to know how, when I tried so hard, he could hurt me. And why did HE try so hard by spending time and money and effort only to let his investment crash in the end? Why didn’t he protect it?
All of these questions I will never know the answer to, because there is never honesty.
I will forever wonder what she looks like and wonder if she has integrity and intelligence, if she is exotic or average, if she is honest or kind and if he has a raging love affair with her and I’m the side side piece. I will always wonder if he likes her more than me and I will feel ugly and flawed and inadequate.
I just want these torturous feelings to end but I don’t want to let go, I still love him so much and there is so much good in him.
I want to rewind time and be like we used to be…best friends and lovers that took every opportunity to talk and be together with fidelity and adoration towards one another.
Or maybe there was never fidelity.
I just want my lover to make me well again but I’m also angry with him for making me feel sick. I’m angry at myself for seeing Donny. He wasn’t worth the boost in my fragile self esteem.
I almost hate Donny. He’s a predator that cares only about himself. He’s on block, because he’s a wolf in sheep’s clothing and NOT a friend.
I want to be in my lover’s arms but they are far away and I feel like punishing him and it’s a horrible juxtaposition.
Please don’t hurt me anymore baby. I loved you so much. You won’t be happy when I’m gone and neither will I but you leave me in a confusing puddle of uncertainty and doubt.
You have always been my magic man. A real man to me.
When you get a taste of a real man, the rest of the world never really tastes the same. Even when the real man cheats.
I guess now I have the answer…
To what happened to my appetite.

It’s 7:15 a.m. Wednesday and I’m already crying.
I just can’t seem to feel better.
I hurt so much and I feel like a big baby that can’t control my emotions.
I don’t know how anyone survives this without a complete loss of self esteem and dignity and for the first time in my life I feel unstable.
I’m angry at myself for being so horribly affected by this. I don’t know why it cuts so deep and I don’t know why I’m having such a hard time emotionally, as I am normally strong and I suspected this day would come. I thought I could prepare mentally to handle it but I am scared that I was wrong.
The first time, I forgave.
The second time, I forgave.
This time around maybe I just forfeit the game and let her have him. She sounds like she might be the right person for him and him for her if they can’t stay out of each other’s arms…and I’m not fool enough to believe they ever will.
This time, the pain goes deeper than before and I’m angry that I have been put in this position AGAIN, as if my first round of pain wasn’t sufficient enough and I deserved more.
I can’t get over the fact that he doesn’t think as much of me as I thought he did, and deep down, I DO know why I am crying and can’t sleep or eat.
It’s called trauma.
My heart cannot reconcile the fact that the person I love the most is the same person that has hurt me. I was raised in a home where the man of the house would never ever ever hurt my mom this way. Never. Ever. Daddy is good. Grandpa is good. Uncles are good.
I want Roger to be good that way too.
Why does he have to hurt ME? I’ve never even been loved in my marriage and I trust so easily and want to be cared about so badly. I got the shit end of the stick in my marriage and I want to know if there is ONE man out there that won’t hurt me.
Just fucking one.
One that might love me enough to wake up next to me and breathe me in and say, “this is the woman I love and I will protect her at all cost.” One that sees and feels and loves only me and nobody else. One whose heart is filled with protective love and one that will hold me and make me his baby and never hurt me. One that never makes me feel like I’m not good enough or smart enough or pretty enough.
One that never wants to see me cry.
One that wants to be a hero to a girl with a fragile ego and a battered heart and a pocket full of nothing.
When will I pull myself up by my bootstraps and put on a black dress and get back to who I know I am, a girl that would never let someone bring her to depths she cannot climb out of. Someone leading the way giggling and confident and happy and eternally optimistic. Where is SHE? I need to be the same calibur of confident as the bitch he’s fucking, that dared to call him up and see if she could get him on her hook like a big fish she could stuff and mount on the wall as a trophy to herself…after he told her he didn’t want her any more. Yup. She’s a winner.
Nah, you’re a horny bitch with no integrity for your own species. And I guess he likes women like that.
I can’t swallow the rage in my throat.
He didn’t pay enough of a price the first time he took me, US, for granted. His first betrayal made me feel sad and scared but this one makes me pissed as fuck.
Yup. I hit the anger stage in the four phases of GRIEF. Cuz trauma ain’t the only dinner guest here… grief is coming, too.
Grief is a loss, even if the loss is someone that betrayed your trust and undermined your confidence.
Grief is a raging freight train running errantly down the tracks with no conductor in the front. Grief is the silent enemy that squeezes you to death with arms that you thought would save you.
Grief has a hold on my beautiful, giving, soul and it won’t surrender and give it back to me. Instead, it slaps me in the face in the morning when I wake up and tells me I’m not worth a shit.
I need to silence the taunting voice of his lover in my head. I have to beat her ass mentally and take my fucking dignity back.
I don’t need to go down a raging path of self destruction. I don’t need to defend my sexuality and prove my sexual worth to myself and every man in four surrounding counties.  It won’t do anything but make me sadder than I already am.
Today I will go silent, with only my own voice inside my head, and I will fight a battle with the other voice telling me I’m ugly and flawed and unworthy of good love.
I need to be the bad ass I know I am inside and pick myself up off the floor and do business.
Self love is the greatest middle finger.
And to every man that hurts a woman…
Fuck.
Off.

77,https://www.opendiary.com/m/kaleidoscope-eyes/whats-in-a-name-269-6092621/,2022-02-13,What’s in a name.,"
So, now that I’ve heard your lover raging on your voicemail messages, let me reiterate the reasons why you shouldn’t give her my name.
First and foremost is my emotional safety. My reputation. I guarded yours with the utmost of sanctity for many years and I hope you feel an obligation to do the same for me. Especially since you allowed her access to my number in the first place.
She said she wanted my name so she could protect herself, but from WHAT I don’t know because I have not so much as glanced your way, so that’s irrational.
She said you OWED it to her cuz you played her and that you could make amends by giving her my name. Another irrationality. How does anything to do with ME pay HER back for YOUR transgressions? Totally nonsensical.
She thinks you and I are going through her phone and I’m looking at the personal messages back and forth between you and her??? Does she think I would WANT to see correspondence between you and her? Nah, I don’t want to know.
She doesn’t hold that kind of power over me but I’m sure she wishes she did. I truly don’t care to know what her messages to you say.
Funny…
That’s the same thing you both did to me. SHE read OUR messages back and forth as I cried my heart out to you in pain and bewilderment. Yup, that bitch got a front row seat to the shit show that my life was at that moment.
She made sure she clawed her way to the top of the pack and she made sure she was the only one left. She hurt you and robbed you of the woman you loved and you are still with her and I will never understand THAT.
I know full well why she wants my name and I think you do, too. We BOTH know the real reason, the reason that goes BEYOND the excuses she’s giving you.
But in case you DON’T understand the underlying message she’s sending, I’ll translate it from woman speak to layman’s terms.
She got you in the end but she didn’t get all of you. Part of your heart is still mine and she needs to own ALL of you to be the victor.
She got her man but that’s not enough. She wants you to PROVE you love her more than you love me and how she wants you to prove that is by giving up my name. My identity. My invisibility. My safety. My immunity.
She wants you to serve me up to her on a silver platter.
The only thing that will quiet the anger in her heart is if you stop protecting me. That’s the only dowry she will accept. You revealing my identity gives her the ammunition she needs to keep you in line, because then she can use the threat of bringing physical harm to me. Knowing my name will finally give her control of everything and over everyone.
That’s what she needs in order to validate her absolute victory. She will have the validation she so desperately seeks ONLY when you give to her what she knows is your most precious possession.
Me.
She hates that you protect me and she’s raging because she won’t truly be the winner until you sacrifice me to her.
Now is when you make the choice.
Are you gonna sell me out to keep that pussy in your pocket and throw away the closest thing to unconditional love you’ve ever had? The only woman that loves you more than me is named Lily and she’s not here to protect you. But I AM.
Let’s see how your Momma and God made you, Roger.
Let’s see what you do when you are faced with total selflessness by perhaps losing your piece of ass to protect me…someone that no longer serves you a purpose.
Let’s see what happens when it comes down to you getting a regular local blowjob or saving my ass from a vengeful, physically addicted, hot mess that you brought in like a cancer that’s now consuming every part of you so it can get to me.
You have two choices here. You can choose betrayal or integrity.
You can show me the man you used to be or you can show me the same man you have shown me for the past year.
Life is a matter of choices, and every choice you make makes you.
The day my name crosses her tainted lips is the day I finally find out the man YOU really are.
I’m scared. I have ONE person I can really rely on and that is myself.
But it’s too late for that. I have to rely on you. 18 months ago, I would not have questioned putting my life in your hands.
But today, I am bracing for impact.

I don’t like you. I’m not gonna sugar coat it. You fucked my bf knowing I loved him and he loved me because you didn’t give a fuxk about me either.
Well I have now been devastated as far as I’m willing to be devastated. For the last 25 hours I have suffered the worst kind of torture imaginable. He has decided to ignore me and not answer my calls or texts. He is not even close to the man he used to be and he never will be as long as he has the people in his life that he has now. He’s a cruel coward afraid to look into my devastated face. He won’t even call back. He’s that fucking cruel to me. And listening to you talk like you know him better than me and listening to you act superior to me is a fucking travesty I ain’t willing to deal with.
You have NO FUCKING clue what you’re dealing with and let me tell you right now you won’t be able to handle it cuz you don’t have what it takes or he would have left me for you when you tried to make him. Instead you won by default because you will let him be a piece of shit and accept that to get your cigarettes and rent relief. That fucker owns you, you pathetic, cruel, heartless cunt. You hurt Lori too. Shame on you, you deserve his lying ass.
He ignores me because he is ashamed of what he’s doing to himself and to me…had he ever been faithful? Nope. And if I can’t keep him faithful then nobody can because I went to the ends of the earth to keep him happy but he is a selfish bastard at the moment and he simply does not give a fuck what pain he dishes out.
After 15 years he has turned on me just like that. If you had not called me and gotten thru to me, he would have never had to confront the fact that he was going to leave me and never even discuss it. HE just moved on to you.
So here we are. I can tell you that it won’t matter what you do to make him happy. It won’t ever be enough and he will demand more and more until he has no need for you or he no longer benefits from what you have to offer. After 15 years he ditched me because of drugs and you sucking his cock so he didn’t have to drive as far and fork out good drug money for a hotel.  When he is done with you or cleans up his act, or you’re bugging his lifestyle, he can turn you off and leave you outside like a stray dog when he decides something better than you comes along. Just like he did me. You aint special but he will try to convince you he thinks you are.
That man worshiped me and put me on a pedestal for 15 years and now you and drugs have taken the best thing in my life…or so I thought. Now he won’t even face me, he’d rather let me suffer alone so he can have his drugged up face in your pussy.
How did he go from THAT to lying,.hiding and having zero integrity.
I hope that you are ready for the new roger because I have finally given up on getting the old one back. You may feel like you won but I’m gonna tell you that you ain’t getting half the man I had for 15 years but he’s all yours now and it ain’t cuz I didn’t fight for him. You saw me fight but in the end, he chose YOU because with you he can get away with being a lesser man. You’ll never know the man he once was, you’ll get this version because the old guy ain’t coming back and he proved that to me last night.
The man I knew would never hurt me like this.
Today my best friend is coming from an hour and a half away to hold me,and to take me to get the help I need to process the trauma Roger is putting me through. I’m sick from what he has done to me and what you have done to me. He won’t answer my calls so I officially gave up on ever getting him back.
You win. He said you’re merely convenience. It doesn’t matter that he loved me… convenience and money matter way more than I did. You had already won bcuz he was taking time away from me for you so take your prize and go away. Please stop calling me every time you feel doubt.  He said you wanted my name so you could use it to hurt me and my family. He said you would hurt me. He probably said that so I wouldn’t call you and he wouldn’t be discovered still fucking around with you. Cuz he planned to lie about that too. Don’t worry about me fucking him, he has hurt me so much I’d have to sell my soul to take him back and YOU still want him????? How fucked up ARE you that you want him knowing all you know. And you can’t hurt me any more than he has no matter what awful revenge you try to get. You stirred the fucking pot so here’s the truth.
He gave me a ring and it meant NOTHING to him as he was eating your pussy. Let’s hope your lying ass does better than me.
Take your bitch and go, you shit bag. Your filth better not ever touch me again. I’m done dealing with your flat ass psychotic behavior.
Party on, dumbass. Wish I had a front row seat to the boxing match between your last two brain cells fighting for dominance.
"
79,https://www.opendiary.com/m/kaleidoscope-eyes/day-of-reckoning-19-6092626/,2022-02-13,Day of reckoning,"
He called me.
I didn’t think this day was going to come and because I had lost faith in him, I had stopped hoping. I had almost stopped counting the days I had gone without hearing his voice and feeling his touch. I tried to force myself to stop believing he existed.
Then, today.
Because I was supposed to get a tattoo removed that was in his honor, and because it’s hard to give up old comforts.
I didn’t know how to feel when I heard his voice and he heard mine. But quickly, instinct kicked in and I heard only the pain in his voice so I soothed him. My voice softened and in spite of all that has happened, I softly said “don’t cry.”
I wanted to add “baby”. I wanted to add “my baby.” My instinct was to hold the man that has brought so much pain upon me. My instinct was to wrap my arms around my baby.
I don’t know if I am extraordinary, or extraordinarily sick and damaged for this way of thinking. I’m willing to say it’s the latter.
What is it inside of me that makes me willing to let him hurt me? Willing to let anyone hurt me?
I know now what it is that makes me allow it.
It is how my brain was taught love.
Kids adapt to make their circumstances the best they can be in their little minds. They adapt because they need somewhere or someone to provide them comfort and safety. How love was shown to me by the most important people in my life, my parents, was a combination of neglect and reward. NOT neglect of my basic needs like food and shelter, but neglect in the form of long periods of abandonment during my formative years while they went to work to make ends meet and to prove themselves. Sometimes they over disciplined because they were young and stressed. To compensate for that, they were sometimes Disneyland parents.
It is a system based on intermittent reward. The intermittent reward makes the bad times or neglect seem less bad. The bad memories fade quicker, become more acceptable. Before long they are replaced with good memories and all is well until the abuse happens again. It is abusive but it is abuse born of ignorance and fear. I forgive them because I always felt loved and secure. I forgive them because we all grew up together and they are me and I am them and no division exists.
But it DID teach me that in order to be loved, I had to please others. Please my parents. Please my friends and most importantly, please my lover.
As much as I love my dad, you did NOT piss him off or disobey and when you did something that made him unhappy, he smacked you upside the head first and asked no questions about why or what, just a deliverance of swift justice that even HE felt ashamed of afterwards. That was evidenced by the aftercare that was provided along with the apology.
I love my dad fiercely. He was 18 years old when I was born. He made sure he was good and responsible and took care of his family and what made my dad hit me was two things… fear, and pride.
He did not want to fail. I was part of him and I was the reason he had to succeed and be a good man. If I fucked up, then in his mind HE fucked up, and his pride left him no room for failure. I did not make these excuses for him and he did not offer this theory up as an excuse. I know in my heart that he did his best and his best was awesome. I was spoiled in many ways and that too set the stage for my future relationships with men. Be good and I will spoil you.
I was good. And Roger spoiled me. It felt natural to me and the closest thing to love I have ever known. Roger did the same thing to me as my parents did, but he didn’t love me as much as they did. His abuse was his infidelity and the anger from his untreated depression fueled by his horrible marriage.
Losing him has been the biggest loss of my life thus far.
I am grieving his death, but he’s not dead.
In my heart there burns an eternal fire of devout belief. That belief is not in God or my country. That belief has always been in Roger. As he grew more addicted and further away, that flame began to flicker and fade.
All of our life we are growing. When Roger left me there was nobody to believe in. My flame was all but extinguished.
But then I woke up one morning and realized that the person I believe in is there in bed with me, greeting the dawn. The person I believe in is me.
Somewhere along the line, Roger stopped believing in himself, so me believing in him didn’t matter.
That’s what now separates us. I will fight for what is best for myself. He will settle for second best.
Second best isn’t good enough for me. I have ONE rule when it comes to ANY game and that includes both love and war.
Rule#1…
Never be #2.

80,https://www.opendiary.com/m/kaleidoscope-eyes/quarter-for-your-thoughts-6092628/,2022-02-13,Quarter for your thoughts,"
The day I took the quarter ring off was the hardest day of my life.
The love and devotion it was originally forged in was so badly tarnished that wearing it had become a cruel reminder of what once was.
I COULD no longer wear it without inconceivable pain, so I took it off and placed it in my jewelry box, but not without some chest wrenching sobs that left me even more broken than the day before.
At first, the indent that the prolonged wearing of the ring left on my finger was prominent, and every glance was like re-opening the wound of betrayal.
The ring restricted and strangled my finger for so long that it had come to match my heart, and week after week, I patiently waited for the impression to fade.
Several weeks later and to my bewilderment, it was STILL there, like an invisible band around my left ring finger.
I tried to will it away, along with the memory of his hands and the sound of her voice as she proudly laughed and said “He wants to be friends with benefits.”
It’s still there today, the impression from the ring, mocking me for my false beliefs and misplaced trust. I’ve come to believe that it will never go away, as if the universe won’t let me forget this man who both shaped and broke my beautiful heart.
I wear other rings over it so I don’t have to see it all the time and I WAS afraid it would never go away.
Now, I am afraid that it WILL go away, and take with it the last tangible reminder of the impression he left on my soul.
I fear nobody will ever love me again and I want so bad to feel comfort and to be held. This has been a constant, familiar need for well over a year. I felt there was something wrong in our relationship all those months because there WAS something wrong. I felt abandoned and forsaken and rejected because I WAS abandoned, forsaken and rejected.
And for WAY more than a New York minute, I thought I was gonna die.
Funny thing though, I woke up every one of those mornings thereafter, amazed that I hadn’t. And eventually, the feeling I was gonna die faded. The sound of her voice and her hurtful words have somewhat faded.
But the impression of that ring hasn’t.
It’s as stubborn as the man that created it. It may not ever go away, and even if I cover it with another ring, it will be there when I unmask it,
In my dreams, my lover makes me a new ring, to cover up the old impression with the promise of a new one.
We all know dreams don’t come true.
But that doesn’t stop us from having them.
Dreams are not what you SEE in sleep…
Real dreams are what won’t LET you sleep.

I find it amusing that Roger’s lover is consumed with thoughts of us sneaking around clandestinely, even if she IS mistaken. First of all, it serves her right and second, what the hell does she think is gonna happen??
Does she think she is immune to his infidelity? Does she think she is gonna be the one to reform him?? Sorry Vickie, but that’s laughable. You knew this was how it was going to be and your sole goal was winning his ass and now you ain’t happy cuz he feels my absence and nothing you can do will erase me. My mark has been made on your man’s heart.
Even the most well laid plans have a margin for error. Guess Miss Vickie is learning that the hard way. This is what happens when you fuck a man that’s still in love with another woman.
I won’t give her the satisfaction of easing her doubts. She can feel the same torture I did, now that she’s holding top rank. She can wonder where he is and she can feel the sick dread of suspicion when she can’t get a call back or he doesn’t answer his phone on the nights she can’t find him.
I am sickened by the fact that he is scrambling for her, offering her google map proof of his whereabouts and access to his text and phone records…the same thing she mocked him for doing for ME. That shows me that he is fearful of losing her so he’s still lying and deceiving me by saying he doesn’t love her and when I called him out, he tried to fall back on the triangular theory of love.
Now, if wifey is familial love and I am both emotional and romantic love, then what in the fuck is Vickie Dean?
She is the big prize, I guess it’s fact, because he is jumping through hoops to please her just like he did his wife.
Now here’s to you, Vickie D…
You are a classless woman. Threatening to blow shit up and use violence to get a man. Where is your fucking dignity, Skank.
You don’t need my name and if you DO get it, there will be no greater pain than what you’ll do to me to appease your anger over the fact that he still loves me.
Honestly, did you think your appeal was gonna last more than 2,3, 4 years? Do you realize how I became the person he loves?? Certainly not by coercing and threatening but rather by love and negotiation and sticking it out and guess what motivated us to do that for a decade and a half, you idiot?
A deep and powerful L.O.V.E.,.that’s what. Now you’re pissed cuz you don’t have the same thing. Do you not understand commitment and longevity is what counts here? And trust? Do you think that you are going to immediately have what took me 15 years to earn? Lmfao. You must think that your pussy tastes like caviar. Nah, it taste like government cheese, you broke bitch.
And I don’t feel sorry for you. You knew he was in love with me early on and you thought you could take him from me. Now YOU can wonder where he is because that ho named karma just kicked you in the crotch.
Oh, and you DID succeed in taking him from me, because he has issues with needing validation and is sex obsessed, and you introduced him to poison or at the very least were part of the group of losers that thought giving a 67 year old man methamphetamine was a good way to get your kicks. You’re gonna kill him, you stupid bitch.
And Roger, you are a vain and shallow fool for allowing this beast of a woman to usurp me and take my place in your life.
In actuality, you deserve her so it’s good you do indeed love her and provide for her. That is more than you were ever willing to do for me. You did not buy me things like cigarettes and phones and housing. I worked hard to do my part by you, but in the end it didn’t make a difference.
I wasn’t the right kind of needy to stroke your ego. I guess you didn’t feel you were valuable to me because I wasn’t down and out or needy enough.
One thing I have over her is I ain’t nobody’s victim. I’ve heard a bunch of bullshit excuses from her for being a piece of shit and I’ve never even met her. She had a rough life. She doesn’t have anyone. She has daddy issues. She’s gonna be evicted. Blah blah blah.
Your lips are moving but I can’t hear what you’re saying.
But sounds like you’re offering up a bunch of excuses about why you are a vindictive asshole that went postal.
I’m not anyone’s victim and I’m sure the hell not about to be yours so STOP trying to get my name out of Roger. You don’t need to know jack about me, I am not part of your life or relevant in any fucking way whatsoever
You better not show up on my door step cuz I’m ready to fight…not for HIM but for me, and what your vengeance did to my heart. I want to kick your ASS for hurting two innocent people.
But I especially want to kick your ass because one of those people was ME.
So bring it.
You will come as the aggressor but I guarantee, you will leave as the victim.
Mine.

I am still trying to understand why my ex lover reached out to me.
For the past year he has been consumed with someone else. He and I used to share all sorts of intimacies. He used to ask me to take and send pictures of myself and he could hardly tear himself away from texting or talking to me. We shared everything…and I mean EVERYTHING. I have never been more open with anyone else in my life as I was with him.
We would sneak away to have phone sex and we would participate in mutual masturbation with lots of dirty talk. We could fill hours on the telephone and even more hours in each other’s company.
That lasted 13 years.
But she came along and was new and exciting. She brought drugs that gave him a feeling of omnipotence. She made him feel sexy and sexual. She was easy and convenient and he could pay the same amount or less and not have to drive as far.
I can understand how I seemed less exciting in comparison, but what I don’t understand is why he didn’t just let me go once he fell in love with her. Why would he gamble with my heart like that? Why did he risk hurting me, carrying on and engaging in risky behavior for SO long?
I know the answer.
Drugs robbed me of my lover. SHE came with the lifestyle just like groupies come with rock groups. And he is addicted to the feeling of being wanted and the newness of a relationship…the rush. The sex. The power he wields. He can’t see the smoke through the trees, like, what the consequences of his actions may be and who they may hurt and that’s probably because he has narcissistic tendencies and a fragile ego. Him feeling good takes front seat and everything else rides shotgun.
He says she was just for convenience, but that’s a lie. He MUST love her to want to be with her after what she did to me and to his wife and that is a truth I must face today.
He’s still with her.
And he had the nerve to call me and complain about his bad choice. About her volatile behavior. As if I wanted to hear that? Am I supposed to feel sorry for him?
I did ASK HIM why he called and he said because he couldn’t just ignore how he had treated me forever. I ask him this, how could he have ignored how he treated me for one day? Let alone maintain almost a month of cruel and indifferent silence.
Roger…I wish you could hear my words in this moment.
There is no room in my heart for your lover, Vicki D. She is ranting and raving about how you betrayed HER by seeing ME?? A woman you have loved for 15 years?! Does she not realize that YOU are still betraying ME by cruelly admitting to me that you’re with her?
You cannot disrespect me any more. You cannot have ME AND her, or me AND anyone else… NOBODY can.
You must live with the choice you made. You miss talking to me every day? I heard your voice crack when you said those words and that was the truth in your heart betraying your cheating ass. You lost something tremendous and SO DID I.
I still love you with evey fiber of my being, but If you think I’m going to lower myself to acceptance of this kind of behavior, you’re more fucking nuts than BOTH your bitches.
That’s like crazy 2.0.
I have come to believe that I’m too normal, smart, loving, well rounded, and rational to be the kind of girl that gets your dick hard.
I gave you just enough rope to half assed hang yourself.
Now you’re waiting for me to cut you down, losing precious oxygen every second that you’re caught in your own noose.
When you’re dangling like that, you should be smart enough to bargain for your life with the woman you fucked over.
You know I know the truth. I KNOW what will happen when I save you.
As soon as you regain enough strength to stand…
You will use it to make a dead run straight for the bitch you knew wouldn’t.

Roger, even if you don’t ever read this or acknowledge that you read it, I have to write it down to get it out of my head so I can sleep. 
I’ve cried every day since Vickie first called me and I’m crying now. I don’t know if it will ever hurt less. Every day I wake up and it still hurts just as much as it did the day she called. Every day when I wake up, the first thought I have is of you and the next thought I have is if you’re waking up next to her and why you just stopped needing me. 

I feel so alone and like I’m in a bad dream. My heart longs for you and you could care less if you ever see me or touch me again it seems. You’re fine without me and it’s devastating. This whole mess happened two days before Christmas. It’s now the middle of February. I loved you for 15 years and in all this time you never once talked to me and apologized face to face. 15 years. I deserved at least that. Instead I got silence..

This letter isn’t to make you feel bad or guilty but rather it is what I need to do to try to heal a little bit. I don’t need to remind you that what you did was bad. I need to defend my broken ego and spirit. That’s what this is for. I need to say it and when you left, you silenced me and shut me out and I still feel like I lost my best friend and my daddy and my lover and my baby and my everything.

I found a “nuclear letter” that I had written you back before I knew about the drugs and Vickie. I recently read it and it was a letter outlining my suspicions and my gut feelings and it was so unbelievably accurate that it shocked even me. I was almost 100 percent right about everything I suspected.

I can’t explain to you how it feels with you gone. Everywhere I look there is a reminder of you. You were my everything. I am so lost. I lay awake and I wonder why you chose her over me when the shit hit the fan. When she outed you, you didn’t scramble to save our relationship. You let me go and you kept her and I knew then that you had given up on us, on me. In the end, I think you wanted all along to break up with me before you retired and to have a new lover in place before you let me go.

It doesn’t seem fair that I’m left alone and devastated while you sleep nights with Vickie D., wrapped around each other like you used to do to me. You don’t lay awake in the night, unblinking, eyes wide open, imagining the person you love the most, loving someone else. I didn’t stop loving you, so this seems like the most awful form of torture. I see her perched on your face naked and I see you doing to her what you did to me. I swear I thought it was sacred between us and special but now it feels like I was nothing, so easy to let go.

I imagine your blue eyes looking into her eyes and telling her you love her. I imagine you saying to her the things you said to me. I see you at your cottage and I see her in your car running errands with you and I see you playfully slapping her ass and calling her baby and loving her like I thought you loved me.
I hear you talking to her in your low sexy voice. I see you whispering in her ear and rubbing the small of her back as she lies next to you. I see you stopping at her apartment and I see her making you coffee and I want to die from the pain. How convenient that you keep her in a pumpkin shell like Peter Peter pumpkin eater, so you have access to her 24/7. I hear you tell her to “let it go” and I hear you tell her how sexy she looks in her dress. I see her working with you and eating dinner with you and being with you in your everyday life. Something I waited almost 15 years for and by the way, happy 15 year anniversary Jan 8. She’s now living the life I waited half my marriage of 30 years to do with you.

And Roger, it’s killing me and I don’t know why. I know I’m a good person and I know I loved you with all I had and I don’t understand how you could love me like you say you did and then do this. And you did it for so long. 

Baby…why?

I’ve asked that question a million times and I will never know the answer. Did I make you feel like less than a man with my sexual proclivities? Was I too fat? Too unattractive? Not smart enough? What was it about her that made me not valuable enough to protect and to keep.

After everything that has happened I keep going back to why are you still with her and the only answer I have is because even if you do love me, you love her more and she is who you choose to be with. Not me. How could you still be with someone that hurt Lori and me like she did? I know the answer. I just can’t accept it.

I am grappling most with the fact that you were able to turn your back on me and just walk away. Then to leave me so devastated, angry and bewildered for almost a month of silent indifference seems like the cruelest thing I’ve ever endured at the hands of anyone. It was life altering to have it happen by the hand of someone you thought was your greatest protector. 

When we talked on Monday, you brought her into the conversation as if SHE did this to us and not you. You speak about her as if she is the new Lori. You show her your gps and offer up excuses to prove to her I’m out of the picture and omg….my heart hurts. She’s most important now. That psycho bitch is number one after everything I gave you, you hurt me and kept HER. You lied about everything. It wasn’t plenty of fish where you met her. It wasn’t anything like you said and you tried to show me texts where you ditched her and told her you were in love with me and wanted to work on your relationship with me and all along you had no intention of leaving her. 

And the most hurtful thing you said to me the other day was this…

You said that now, some days, your relationship with her is touch and go. I wonder if you even realize you are talking about her as if you want me to sympathize with you because the woman you chose over me won’t believe you when you tell her you are not seeing me. Do you realize you are basically complaining to me that your new lover won’t do what I did and not throw it in your face that you were unfaithful to her? 

You let me hear voicemails where she is demanding you don’t ever see me or talk to me, demanding my name and she has you right by the balls and you are bitching to ME that she won’t be a good girlfriend and give you a pass. Do you even fucking realize how insensitive that is to me? I’m heartbroken for fucks sake and you are saying she’s a loose cannon and lamenting to me about how Lori wants rid of her too.

Roger is all this normal to you? The man I love would have been in that van on my proverbial doorstep and talking to me face to face…not letting months go by with total absence. That absence contradicts the love you say you feel for me. 

And why would you lower yourself to such a demanding, fuxked up, troubled person when you could have me? Why would you let her threaten me?

You are scrambling to keep her happy and you only called me on Monday to assuage your own guilt about how you treated me. If that wasn’t the reason then you would have been more sympathetic about my feelings when you were basically making me hear about your mistake in choosing her.

Nothing compares to a year of watching my value plummet. Nothing compares to being ignored and made to wait and go without seeing you, all the while knowing there was someone else.

Before you had Vickie, can you imagine how you would have felt if I just started phasing you out? How it would feel if I started experimenting with deadly street drugs and sleeping around with someone I was paying bills for and basically keeping on the side and moving into head position? All the while keeping you dangling, barely giving you any attention and seeing less and less of you? Can you imagine what it would feel like to have every phone call ignored and to get messages of affection clearly not meant for you but for another lover of mine?

Can you imagine waiting in a hotel parking lot to see you until 10:30 at night because you’re fighting with her to be allowed to leave to see me?

Do you know the pain of fighting for something you have no idea why you’re even losing because the person that once told you everything just suddenly and inexplicably shut you out, cut you off and abandoned you? 

In closing I want to tell you a few important things that I need to say.

I’m sorry for sending the pics of Donny. I am so hurt and jealous and feel so rejected that I did it to hurt you. And it did. 

I don’t love him. I mean nothing to him. He might have an attractive body but he’s nothing compared to you and I NEVER want you to feel like I feel right now because Roger, I don’t find ANYONE as handsome and powerful as you. Even in this state I’m in, I don’t want to hurt you. I am so hurt that you are touching and having sex with someone else that my heart is aching. I feel bad knowing she’s prettier and more lucrative than me. I’m so hurt that you just left when the going got tough. I can’t reconcile that with the man that used to refuse to let me hang up the phone and go to bed angry. My lover. My perverted darling playmate. It hurt so much that I allowed myself to lash out at you and make you feel insecure like I did. That’s not who I am and I don’t ever want to hurt you. I want to have the integrity to say I’m sorry for that Roger. I can’t get over the hurt of you staying with Vickie after all she did to you. Of you keeping me around until I caught you and then cruelly dumping me for her. 

I’m just so devastated by the changes that I don’t even know how to live. I’ve had dates with other men and I can’t even begin to concentrate and don’t even know why I’m doing it because I’m in no shape emotionally to be doing so. I think I just want comfort and validation so bad, but I won’t and have not found it with them. With strangers. I hurt so bad that I just want to be held and cared about but they don’t care about me. I cry all the way home and my stomach feels sick and my heart empty.
I drive and I think about how I’m in love with someone that was loving someone other than me and I was too weak and stupid to call your bluff and leave you…and you let her win in the end. You rewarded her bad behavior and stayed with her and punished me for all the years of love I gave you. 
I will never understand and I’m starting to think I’ll never recover. I ache for the same man that hurt me. That bitch had the nerve to say “idk about your emotional state but mine is horrible”. Bitch, you had him 2 years and I had him 15 years. How the FUCK do you THINK my emotional state is and how dare you talk down to me. Vicious little cunt, how do you think I feel!?? 

And you LOVE her?!?!

In the end, you chose a drug addicted, broke, dependent, volatile, mentally ill, unstable woman you have to babysit over me. Just like the one you were trying to leave. You downgraded rather than make me legit. 

It makes me feel so worthless and bad.
I don’t know if I’ll ever find someone that wants to be with just me. I don’t think I’m gonna find that before I die. 

The men that want me? They don’t care about me. They care about the wife that won’t fuck them or the girlfriend that makes them feel good about themselves, the real girlfriend like what Donny has. I’m the kinky secret. 

Seems like I’m that attractive nuisance you once spoke of. I’m sexy and fun and I’m tempting…but I’m not wife or girlfriend material for some reason I have yet to figure out. They have committments to the women they love, the crazy violent ones that keep things exciting and want sex with me and then to forget about me or up and replace me. Like I have no substance. 

Not happening. 

Those men won’t hold me and if they did, it would be weird anyways cuz they don’t love me so I won’t ask.

The kind of men that want me can only see me at 10:00 a.m. weekdays and they wouldn’t piss on me if I were on fire. They don’t even ask what my name is unless they think they have to pretend like they want a relationship with me to get sex. 

I’m not getting as lucky as Vickie, finding a lover, free housing, cigarettes employment, a companion and drugs all in one. I’m not getting lucky enough to get a man so crazy for me that he leaves a wife and a long term lover.

I know now that I was expensive, too. How? Cuz nobody else will do what you did and pay to see me every week, except Donny. I care for Donny but I don’t love him enough to let him live in a house I own. I don’t see him every day and stop in to visit and get oral sex. So….not even close.

You ended up being right in the end. You really were the only one willing to do that for me. The man that cheated and lied to me for a couple years and had three other affairs (that I know of) is the only man that will treat me good.

I guess that says more bad about me than you, huh?

Sorry this is so long but I feel like you left me with no closure. I have never felt this kind of rejection and I am sorry I didn’t handle it well but when you ignored me, I lost all sanity cuz it hurt so much and I said things and did things I regret. 

I knew you were not planning on trying to save is when you didn’t seem at all concerned with me running around single while you sort.your life out. You’re willing to take the chance of losing me,.just like you let Donny’s fox ass into the hen house. You don’t seem affected that I’ve chosen to try to find some form of comfort from someone else. Never would you have just given up and handed me over to the wolves before Vickie came along.

I sent that picture of Donny to her because I KNEW it was the foolproof way to get you to see it. I knew she would put it in your face because she’s fucked up and doesn’t love you. She’s looking to hurt me, too, and you want to give her the name of a dead person and tell her it’s me so she will be appeased, and you can have a relationship with her and not have her worrying about the threat of me. You want to conveniently make me DEAD so you can get me out of your new relationship.
It honestly took me this long to stop waiting for your call every day telling me you’ll do whatever it takes to make it right. I just yesterday realized that Instead you made excuses like you’re not right and you can’t get rid of her cuz of covid money and jobs and her housing. Excuses.

Then it dawned on me….you’re not calling and promising all that because you DON’T want me back.

And now I feel not only stupid but humiliated and I won’t continue to beg and plead and check my phone constantly for your ephinany text.

You’re gone and you ain’t planning on returning. I just want you to know that I didn’t choose to leave you, therefore I have not stopped loving you. I have no further need to punish you or rub your face in anything. I won’t ever call you names. Just know I want you to stop doing drugs and turn this around while you still have a chance at a healthy life away from a bad marriage. Wait and find someone better than her. Be strong. 

I don’t hate you, Baby. I love you. Stop what you’re doing before it kills you. 

You have thrown it all away. I would have bet my life on you doing anything you had to to keep me with you. 

Good thing I didn’t.

I’d be one dead motherfucker.

I don’t know how deep this pain goes. I don’t know how far down into my soul its ugly tentacles can reach.
 
When I called yesterday, I was so hurt to have discovered you didn’t care enough about me to even read the diary entries I sent you links for.
I was hurt to know you had erased what I worked so hard on, what I struggled to write, because it risked pissing her off. It meant nothing and I MUST face the fact that I am no longer important to you.
It is beyond pain. It’s indescribable.
And you erased it because you were with your lover and didn’t want her to catch you talking to me. You lied and said it was Lori that was looking. You must think I’m stupid, because you’ve told me many times that Lori doesn’t look at your phone.
BUT we BOTH know VICKIE DOES!! And YOUR pussy whipped ass LETS her!!!
This is where it has to end for me because I am doing what I said I would never do and that is to chase a man that doesn’t want me. I understand why women do it now, because they can’t accept or comprehend why they are no longer loved. Especially if there was betrayal involved.
I am absolutely haunted by the images and the idea of being replaced by her. I’m even more haunted by your rejection.
I’ve never hurt so bad in my whole life.
You called me Monday but I don’t know what for, because you’re still with her and it appears you don’t plan on leaving. A week after you told me you still loved me I caught you with her.
It’s all lies and I must accept that you’re gone. I just want to cry forever and I can hardly stand to be around anyone.
I can’t forgive you for hurting me and never apologizing face to face. You left me in the most cowardly and cruel way but then say you still love me and none of those words jive with your current actions.
You’re STILL letting me suffer in cruel silence. You run from my words and I’m willing to bet my kids’ lives that this is never read cuz you’re gonna ignore it and tuck it away like a giant hospital bill statement you get in the mail and know you can’t pay.
You should have told me straight up you were gonna give your relationship with her your full attention, and not led me to believe she was gone or soon to be.
I’m not sure you know how to tell the truth, Roger. Almost everything out of your mouth is a self serving, narcissistic falsehood to further whatever agenda you have going on at the time.
You hurt me effortlessly. You claim you don’t mean to but that is laughable because how can you lie about another relationship not once or twice but THREE times and expect that to fly as an innocent offense? You are a martyr saying “it seems I always hurt you and can do nothing but hurt you no matter how hard I try” when in actuality that’s bullshit.
All you gotta do not to hurt me is either keep your dick in your pants or tell the fucking truth. You’ve gone as far as to blame Vickie for your infidelity and what you did to me. You want to be blameless.
Me constantly expressing my feelings and suffering to you and my waiting for you to have some sort of epiphany and come begging for me on bended knee is simply a pipe dream on my part.
You say you’re too fucked up to be faithful to anyone but you are having NO problem not only being faithful to Vickie but kissing her ass just like you did Lori’s. You are one of those fucked up people that love difficult, volatile, psychotic fucking women and goddamn if you ain’t turning ME into one of them now.
You told me when she outed you that you’d spend the rest of your life regretting choosing her over me. That must have been nothing but lip service designed to save your ass because here you are, WITH her still!
Wow! You must’ve spent a whole 30 seconds feeling regret before you shrugged your shoulders and said to yourself , Oh well, at least I got the woman I really wanted out of them all and I can find another piece of ass to supplement what sex I don’t get from her.
I hope you stop smoking meth because if you don’t you are surely gonna die an ugly death. I’m petrified to see what you look like now, six months or a year into your use. You lost a job, your reputation, your wife, your long term lover, your best friend, your safety, your peace of mind, everything. Soon it will take your teeth and skin and finally your heart will stop functioning under the constant pressure.  She came along and poisoned your life and you somehow thought it was ok to keep me in the dark and put me in danger so you could get your ass a shot of validation in the form of female attention.
Do you think that is what makes you valuable or what makes you a MAN? Getting a woman to give you sex? That must be what you want to be remembered for or that must be what you have to do to prove to yourself that you are sexy or desirable, but why wouldn’t you get that validation from being honorable and creating things with your hands and mind and then reveling in your accomplishments, and the people you helped.
Why can’t those things make you feel wanted and valued. Why didn’t MY UNDYING devotion and willingness to do anything for you make you feel wanted and good about yourself and why does manipulating a disadvantaged woman to give you pussy make you feel powerful? She’s clearly disadvantaged with loser kids, low income housing and a job doing lawn work and being your gopher and drug dealer. Or, knowing you, you are probably HER drug dealer by now because with that class of people it ain’t hard to rise to the top of the food chain. By now, I’m sure you’re the leader of the pack.
So, all of this has brought out an UGLY side to me that I would just have soon never met. I have new understanding for the women I’ve always held in disdain, the ones that put up with serial cheaters and abusive partners. The ones that continue to go back to the guy that’s fucking someone new, seemingly unable to understand that they HAVE indeed been replaced. They can’t seem to grasp that rejection and departure, but unbeknownst or not, they need to GTFO of Denver before they get labeled crazy and slapped with a restraining order.
It’s hard to reach the place where the light bulb goes off and your self esteem and pride kick in. Soon, your dignity joins the party and anger crashes it and you’re saying all sorts of horrible things like “I hope you overdose and die in her pussy” to the person you love the most. Because your pain is so great that you lash out to reap upon your abuser the same thing they put upon you.
I hate myself for the ugly things I said. The truth is, there is no anger without love. If you don’t love someone, there is not enough passion to fuel rage.
You’ve made a lot of people rageful.
Rage in turn, eats you alive until you grant forgiveness.
Forgiveness frees your soul.
I’m nowhere near forgiveness.
But that’s ok. I don’t need to worry. I have no soul.
I sold it to you a long time ago.

85,https://www.opendiary.com/m/kaleidoscope-eyes/go-easy-on-me-baby-6101232/,2022-03-14,"Go easy on me, Baby","
So this is it.
I can now say I lost my lover to drugs. My best friend. My baby.
I will never be the same.
Sometimes I think it would be easier if you were dead, so you are not here, torturing me by killing yourself, no longer within my reach.
I thought I was done crying but in my heart, I know I will never be done crying. I will call out for you for the rest of my life without you.
This morning when I took the Babe to school, on my way home, the radio played an Adele song. The chorus says “Go easy on me, Baby” and I cried yet again.
I didn’t just cry, I sobbed. It feels physically like it’s coming from a new place inside of me. It doesn’t even sound like me. It’s choking. Strangled. Deep.
I said “I miss you, Baby. I love you. Why did you go and why did you need drugs and her?” out loud to nobody but myself, cuz that’s who I have left in my corner…myself. I am scared without you but I don’t know what of. The emptiness, I guess. And I am angry but not at you. I am angry at God and Vickie and at myself because my love can’t save you.
Every day is hard to get through and I actually look forward to bedtime so I don’t have to feel the absolute anguish that resides in my heart. I worry for you constantly and my brain cannot rest knowing you are hurting yourself and surrounding yourself with people that don’t have your best interest at heart.
The worst part of all this isn’t what you’ve done to me or to Lori or Vickie. It’s what you have done to yourself. Your pain is my pain and my heart is dying because you have lost your will to live. Your pain is screaming out loud for you to fix it, and you are just struggling to find the answer, but it isn’t there with those people sharing a pipe.
Oh my God, I love you and I am trying to learn to love myself as much as I do you and that means moving forward without you.
I don’t want to.
I’ve fought it every step of the way but you don’t want to come home. I’m not home anymore.
You’re homeless.
And all I can do is pray that if you don’t find shelter in my arms nobody hurts you.
Please God, don’t let them hurt my Baby. Don’t let him continue to hurt himself. Just make me wake up and all this is over and he’s safe and healthy and I won’t ask for another thing as long as I live.
I would trade or give anything right now to get my lover back in my arms.
But there is no bargaining with the devil. It took the devil to beat me, so I guess there is solace in that. He’s the most formidable opponent there is.
I stayed in the fight for as long as I could before I had to say “take him”, you won.
You are not defeated when you lose.
You are defeated when you quit.

Time to write an entry about ME.
I’ve been battered and I feel the effects. Throughout this whole ordeal, I’ve cried a million tears. I’ve felt utterly alone and I’ve had days where I can’t sit still because the uncertainty, loss and anxiety become overwhelming.
I worry constantly for my lover’s health and safety
The last few days have me worried for my OWN health and safety
After 15 years, I did what I never thought I’d do. I spoke to my ex’s wife. Because he asked me to, even though I knew it would only serve to hurt me and so did he. I think he asked me to do it to make things better for him. I think so little of myself and so much of him that I actually did what he asked of me.
As if being verbally abused and mentally harassed by Vickie wasn’t enough, now his wife’s horrible insults are ringing in my ears.
I cannot remember all the hurtful things she told me, because about half way through her tirade, I began to fall apart and the weight of the last year came crashing down upon my shoulders and all I could do was break down in tears. I went numb. I stopped listening and just cried. That’s when she hung up on me.
Then she proceeded to text me for the next four hours, on and off. I even told her that I deserved her insults and rage. Why? I don’t know. For him, I guess.
Between her and Vickie, I’ve been called ugly, stupid, bitch, liar, whore, cunt, slut, a homewrecker, a bad mother, evil, sinful, sick, desperate, non deserving, ignorant, an idiot, worth nothing, a stupid fuck, asshole, cheater, and the list goes on but those are just a few that stuck.
I feel numb inside and out. The words bounce off me yet each one impales me first. I don’t know what I feel because I’m not sure that I CAN feel anymore. I feel nothing but exhaustion and failure and all I want is someone to hold my battered body.
I yearn to be held and to hold on to someone solid that loves me, but he is gone. He is lying with the women whose words made me feel small and weak.
He doesn’t need me anymore. He never comes. When he speaks to me it is usually prompted by one of the other women doing something hurtful to me.
Or, most recently, because he needed his wife to believe in him for some reason or another and somehow, her being able to call me names and threaten me furthered whatever cause he had at the moment cuz I ain’t heard from him since.
It was all about exonerating him so she could take him back and save face. Hurting me allowed her to do that. Blame me, exonerate him, so she feels justified in wanting him back and taking him back.
She told me to stop chasing her husband.
He’s there overnight and all the time. He can’t even make phone calls, and he expects me to believe he is divorcing her.
You don’t appease and allow yourself to be taken hostage by someone you’re divorcing and separating yourself from. I didn’t think I could hurt more.
I am so broken. Maybe I finally shattered. I don’t know what’s left of ME.
Or how I will pick up the pieces.

Wanna know what I think?
I think you’re going back to your wife.
You actually said the words “this is the best we’ve gotten along in years” and the fact is, you’re living there with her and she has told me to stay away and to stop chasing you.
And you let her. You encouraged me to make it easier for her. You let her hurt me to make her feel better and to make moving back home easier for you.
You living there and moving in with her has pretty much happened and you admitted it.
The fact that you even did it for one day, let alone a week, and the fact that you cuddle her and that you have visited Vickie in addition to all this tells me that you still love the both of them and they are still taking up all your time. I’m always the quiet one in the corner NOT being demanding and crazy and guess what that’s gotten me? And you still want sex from Vickie maybe, cuz you’ve “visited”. Now Lori is willing to give you sex, too. What the fuck do you need me for?
You want it to go back to the way it was, with me a secret, while she turns the screws even tighter and you live together? She already considers you back together and you are making it a reality.
So I made it through all that heartache just to see you go BACK to Lori and now, things will be even more suffocating than they were before. She will have hawk eyes on you and you will never be allowed to see me.
So all that talking to Lori I did was to appease her and to make your transition back home easier?
How do I know? You still don’t want to call me and you’re still kissing her ass, worse than before. You are still leaving me out to dry and putting talking to me and working it out with me last, cuz that’s where it ranks evidently.
I’m not sure what you even want with me anymore. You tell me one thing but then you act another way.
I don’t know what to believe anymore or who to trust.
You are living with your wife.
Looks like you want to sign back up for your old life.
I’m pretty sure she didn’t fill the position yet cuz she can’t. You’re the only one willing to suffer her abuse. She makes you so miserable that ruining your life with drugs was comparably better to you in your mind. Think about that shit.
I’ll take yet another step back cuz that’s where you seem to want me to be, either behind everyone else or plain old forgotten and left in the dark.
I’m getting sick of being in solitary confinement.
I’m about to make a run for the light.

88,https://www.opendiary.com/m/kaleidoscope-eyes/shit-outta-luck-6104273/,2022-03-30,Shit outta luck,"
When my love affair ended so abruptly, I was lonely and devastated and probably in shock and I clung to anything even remotely familiar or safe or comforting.
One of those things was Donny.
I’ve known him for two years this month and although we spoke often and maintained a kind of loose friendship, we were not sexual until late summer.
The relationship I have come to have with him is so complicated and I have struggled to navigate it.
He has a steady girlfriend, but if I hadn’t seen proof of her on Facebook, I would say she did not exist. I have spent a lot of time over the course of this “relationship” (and I call it that loosely) wondering why there is no evidence of her presence in his life. He has openly invited me to his house and courts me on overnight trips. His car is a mess. There has not been anything but his golf clubs and the contents of a small dumpster in the passenger seat since I’ve known him. He can literally be reached and is accessible for talk or texts literally any time of day…or night. He sends me pics of every room in his house with him in it and believe me, there is no evidence of a woman anywhere.
I’m not jealous.
As a matter of fact, I don’t want Donny for anything other than the pseudo feeling of comfort he gives me due to simple familiarity.
He gets a free domina, and I get someone that gives me an ego boost because his desire for me is through the roof, obsession level.
The black lining in all of this is a familiar problem in my sex life. I cannot enjoy the full benefits of a sexual relationship with my lover because I know he has other lovers and I am afraid for my sexual health.
With Roger, there is jealousy because I love him. There is anger because I feel robbed of something I should rightfully have. With Donny, I am more self centered and that is honestly what drives my feelings about him. What can he do for me? Is he a throw away lover? Maybe. Yeah.
I don’t want to have sexual intercourse with someone that has other lovers besides me. How safe can you feel and how vulnerable can you allow yourself to be when you know there is someone else sleeping with your lover? Fantastic sex requires trust and practice.
How can I be vulnerable to someone that I feel is comparing me to someone else he sleeps with, or someone that he places at a much higher priority level than me? How can I have sexual freedom with that hanging over my head and how fucking fair is that to ME?…that my lovers get to have me for kinky sex and their normal girlfriends and wives for vanilla sex and somehow I get just the kinky aspect and made to feel like I’m not worthy of real love and affection.
Why are my lovers ashamed of me, of being with me in real life?
In my next entry, I’m going to try to explain the relationship with Donny and I do this for MYSELF because this diary is for me to reflect on how I am living my life and to help me pinpoint the changes I need to make and I need to make some difficult changes on the road ahead of me. I’m confused and I need to be honest. This helps me to reread and sort everything out.
These past six months have been life changing. My lover can now read this diary if he chooses to because I no longer care who reads what is in my heart and I gave him the ability to do so freely and without coercion. There is no fear he will leave me if I hurt him with the truth. He already left me a long time ago. The stakes are not what they once were so I will not hold back. This is me.
I will lay that shit bare if I want to and nobody can judge me because I have walked through fire to get to where I am at and I want what’s left of my life to be my own.
I have women threatening to “expose” me but what they don’t know is that they already have. It’s just a matter of time before one or the other of them hits on my name in a stroke of luck on a Google search. What they don’t know is that I’m already living my life as if they have exposed me, because as much as I want to believe Roger can protect me from them, the truth is he can’t. They will not stop until they find me. Their wounded pride drives their relentless quest for my head on a platter. Oh, and money… compensation for what his wife thinks he spent on our affair. Icky Vickie just plain old seethes with resentment and jealousy and pure HATE. I’ve wronged HER somehow.
They are both blood lusting over me and the fact that I have not paid a high enough pain price tag in their minds. Both of them are vindictive and reckless and want me to pay for what I have done to them, for what I have supposedly “taken” from them.
Yet THEY still have him and have a place in his life and I am laying in bed with Donny, a man that wants me there when he wakes up solely so I can lick his ass in the morning.
That says one thing and one thing only to me.
I got the shit end of this deal.

Before I get to my next entry, I need to stick this here before I forget to. This is therapy writing and not a story, so there will not be prefacing or order to my entries. This one is from yesterday or the day before, but that only matters to me. Read along if you care to. I’m an open book because I need a friend and that friend is an anonymous diary. No further explanation needed. 
Letter to my baby…
I am going to write you a letter every day in the hope that you will read it and it will help you in some way on the difficult journey you’re currently facing.
They won’t all be proclamations of love, these letters. While it’s true that I love you as much as I love life, I want these words to touch you on a deeper and different level.
Today when you called me, my heart filled with hope and joy. When I heard your voice, a little shaky but clear, and so familiar to my heart, I had to hold back the tears.
My baby, you’re back.
I pray you are slowly on your way back to me. Your body can heal. You are a strong man, and you can fight your way back to health physically. Today you sounded like you are really in the game and trying to stay the course. You sounded so good that my heart lurched in anticipation of rescue from my pain and longing for you.
But this isn’t about my salvation.
It’s about yours. It’s about healing you. It’s about fixing what it is that makes you seek relief from your pain or boredom.
You don’t owe anyone the rest of your life. Not me, not Lori and not Vickie. You deserve to do what makes YOU happy and be with who you want to be with.
Today when I said I am proud of you, you said “don’t be proud yet” and for a minute, I was stunned and didn’t know what to say. I’m pretty sure you noticed my silence.
I was taken aback because it isn’t what you’re trying to do NOW that makes me proud of you. I’ve ALWAYS been proud of you. I have always loved who you are and the fact that you got hung up for a minute when you were down and out emotionally doesn’t erase the years of good treatment you gave me.
What makes me proud of you is ironically, your character. In spite of your sexual proclivities, you’ve worshipped the ground I walked for a decade and a half and I’ve seen a kindness in you that most people cannot emulate, let alone uphold.
I’m proud of you for being a leader. I’m proud of you for going after what you want and persevering until you get it. Tenacity. Loyalty to the cause. A brilliant man whose word is golden and who strived tirelessly to never ever let me suffer or let me down. I am proud of you for loving me so eloquently and thoroughly, for being my hero because I needed one so bad.
I am proud of you for always lifting me up and making me feel as if I was more than beautiful…perfect.
I am proud of you for your giving heart and your hardscrabble fight to be somebody and to have something. I am proud of you for taking risks and being fearless and owning up to problems. I am proud of your God given ability to make beauty out of what other people throw away. I am proud of you for the little things, like integrity in the work you do and the way your beautiful mind charms me with the things you create.
But even superheroes are allowed to stumble and fall. Even golden boys are allowed to struggle and hurt and be unsure of themselves and or their future.
The things you’ve done wrong do not make you who you are.
The way you handle the things you’ve done wrong makes you who you are.
I believe in you.
Not cautiously, but rather with my whole heart and if you fall a hundred times, I will pick you up 101 times.
Forget about what you feel you’ve done wrong.
Don’t stumble over something BEHIND you, because there is nobody there to catch you if you fall.
Just keep moving forward. Don’t look back.
And don’t stop until you’re safely in my arms.

90,https://www.opendiary.com/m/kaleidoscope-eyes/once-burned-6106962/,2022-04-09,Once burned…,"

I’ve had all I can take.
He doesn’t care about me and has been putting me behind his other women for months now. I hung on for so long because I wanted to believe. 

His wife found women’s panties in his backpack and immediately started texting me, asking if I had been with him. She told me SHE was having sex with him and he was only good for “meth fueled sex” anymore. This is a man that gave her everything. She’s as devastated as I am.  I think I’m more devasted only because he finds her attractive enough to be able to physically have sex with her and he didn’t me. I’m just so humiliated. I want to die.

They may have been my panties. I’m not sure. But, if they were, someone else was wearing them and it wasn’t me because I’m not in his life enough to have my panties find their way into his backpack. No Sir. That’s not probable.

Maybe there is a fourth person in this shit show of a love quadrangle.

The humiliation of him going back and forth between his wife and girlfriend I can no longer tolerate. Even the suspicion is more than I can bear. And he lives with his wife now and she TOLD me they have sex so there IS no suspicion, only fact.

He has hurt me so much that when his wife’s text popped up on my message program, I expected it. I expected the pain and I braced myself for it. I thought it would hit me in my face like a tornado.

But instead, I felt rage. 

White hot rage over what he has done to me and to himself. I know it’s not fair because addiction is a disease and I know he has suffered enough with his wife to NEED substances to feel better, but does he need to have sex with other women because of addiction? I don’t think so. I think who you sleep with is a conscious choice and he isn’t choosing me.

I can forgive addiction but how can I forgive his repeated infidelity with someone so dangerous and facetious towards me? Both or either of his lovers blame me and want to hurt me. They say so openly and plot how they are going to do it. They threaten to expose me to my kids. 

That’s all bad enough, but how can I forgive him for not only going back to his wife but engaging in marathon sex with her? Jesus. It’s more than I can swallow. 

My rival of 15 years. The same woman that refused to give him any sex is now doling it out in hours long sessions. And he’s right there lapping it up like it’s liquid gold or something.

And she’s going to call me every time she feels like taking her pain and anger out on someone when she has lost control of him.

I don’t want to open my heart up to feel anymore hurt or anger or betrayal or fear. 

For the first time in my life, I’m totally alone in my heart. Nobody loves me and I have nobody to trust on a romantic level.

It feels empty. 

But that’s nothing compared to the pain of knowing my lover is suffering from the terminal disease of addiction and this time it wants to take the only man I have ever loved. First it was alcoholism that took my life partner and now methamphetamine has robbed me of my soul mate and it feels like I have finally bled out. 

I’m dried up. 

I want to hide away where there is nobody to depend on except me. That way, nobody can ever hurt me again. 

I will be bullet proof because I can love myself better than anyone else can love me at the moment. 

It took a lot of sleepless nights, a lot of tears and a lot of pleading with the universe or God or whoever to just let me keep Roger as I have always known him, strong and sure. It took a lot of pain to get to where I am right now, ready for self love, because my main form of medication, Roger, has a new life without me. He doesn’t want or need me anymore and it took me so long to realize it. It just hurts so much to accept the idea that he’s going to keep on hurting me, even if he says he won’t. It is like trying to believe and trust the devil…and the devil will chew up your heart and spit it back at your feet.  

No matter how much I want to, I can’t go backwards in time. I can’t make it how it used to be or love someone that no longer exists because finally, the pain of all this has overridden the desire to secure his love and be his only lover.

It’s like touching your finger to the end of a burning match. If you do it enough times, you learn to be careful because the pain lasts for so long and you’re reminded of it every time you bump the end of your finger. 

Roger is the flame at the end of my match stick and I keep reaching for him only to get burned. 

Now I am defeated. I hurt so much that I have stopped reaching out for him.

I have all I can do to lie still in bed at night and wrap my own arms around my own raw and wounded body. 

And I don’t want to cry because the tears hurt my tender face. I don’t know what to do except lay here and allow myself to hurt and grieve for the man I have to let go of.

And maybe at some point in the night, I will wrestle with my decision, because there is one thing I am sure of…

The arms that cease to reach for love will never feel its embrace.

91,https://www.opendiary.com/m/kaleidoscope-eyes/is-there-anybody-out-there-22-6107271/,2022-04-11,Is there anybody out there?,"
I am done with Donny. I don’t want to see him anymore. He is acting oblivious to that fact, but I can’t believe he could not know what the problem is. How can he give so little and expect SO much in return, and then act as if he’s entitled to it?  I’m over it.
He’s persisting in trying to see me because he gets a lot from the relationship between him and I. He buys me liquor and sex toys and in return he gets the sex toys used on him and I get an ego boost I guess. And validation that I’m desirable to someone.
To be honest, I’m not sure what it is that I get. But, I know what I DON’T get.
I can have all the oral sex I want and pretty much anything else that I ask for, sexually.
But that is the problem.
I don’t ask.
And the reason I don’t ask is because he doesn’t seem interested and that makes me feel humiliation and embarrassment. How would it make ME or ANYONE feel to have to ASK your lover to reciprocate to you sexually? It’s made even WORSE by the fact that he has a “proper” girlfriend that he sees in public and has a commitment to. This is what I have always allowed men to do to me.
I’m the one they want for sex and fun. I’m not the one they want for a life partner or a real girlfriend or wife. They choose others for that and keep me a secret to everyone.
Because they are ashamed of me. I’m not normal, I guess. And it hurts to say it out loud.
Donny HAS started randomly trying to get me off during our time together over the last few months and I appreciate it, but there is not enough tenderness between us for my liking. It’s not sincere. It’s what he needs to do to get his end goal met. Who “appreciates” their lover “making an effort” to return their affection?
He doesn’t care enough about me to make me feel like catering to him anymore. He doesn’t give back any of what he gets. My orgasm is an afterthought, or a chore he has to do before he can play outside.
And he’s arrogant.
But OH, does he like ME.
I’ve tried to leave him a bunch of times because of this sexual disparity between us and his response was and still is to question my decision, argue with me and then get angry at me for not being happy. He throws a fiery tantrum and tosses my own words back at me in a twisted way until I cave from the unrelenting pressure. I guess him recognizing the problem and attempting to fix it isn’t one of my options.
Eventually, he emotionally manipulates me by luring me there with the hint OR promise of his affection, whichever one it takes, cuz he’s learned my weakness and he uses it to his advantage. He knows how much I want to be held and touched and kissed and he does not do enough of that, or any of that, for that matter. After I’m done being his Domina, he doesn’t even hold me as we fall asleep, and sometimes he turns his back to me and I lay there in the dark and silently cry for Roger. I cry to be loved. Donny’s affection is given in haste and without much enthusiasm and I’m just tired of being his fetish queen.
When I leave him I feel ashamed for selling myself short and I drive home feeling empty, numb and sad. Stupid. Gullible. Dirty. Alone.
When we discussed the issue, Donny claimed he thought being his Domina WAS THE sexual pleasure I got from our time together. I told him that my role play and being a Domme is like foreplay for me. My vagina is wet after I am done doing my thing and I’m highly aroused and how does anyone want to end a long period of foreplay or arousal???
By orgasm!
I don’t care how, but I want one when I’m done dominating my lover and I want him to be enthusiastic about it for fuck’s sake. I spend HOURS performing tantric sex we BOTH enjoy but I WANT him to WANT to please me afterwards, because he’s developed affection and feelings for me and wants, (key word)…WANTS me to have pleasure. What man has to be told this and HOW am I supposed to feel sexy and wanted? Why would I give my man all my attention if I don’t feel he wants the same for ME?
Isn’t this common sense or man+woman 101? Where am I fucking this up??
I always felt loved by Roger when we slept in bed together and when we made love. We could have had the perfect sex life if we had turned to each other instead of others when we got hurt or hit bumps in the road. We could have worked anything out but we just took each other for granted and holed up in a motel and stopped really being the best we could be for each other. We focused on others instead of our own unique love.
But I have never stopped loving Roger and I have always found him sexy and appealing. I never wanted anyone else and I wish he would have felt the same about me.
I never wanted anyone else, but HE did several times over the years, including the latest one, Vickie, and now I learn, even his wife.
It hurts so much to know I wasn’t enough and that he left me for another affair and then did for her in one year what he would not do for me in 15. I’m not sure I can live with it.
Being with Donny was a band aid for the wound Roger inflicted. Being with Donny was a power trip at a time when I had lost control of everything in my life. It helped for a while but it’s just not enough to sustain me if there isn’t love or great affection between us.
He got what he wanted for a long time and I got to soothe my wounded ego by him wanting me.
But he just wants the fantasy.
Not me.
I’m not real to him, and if he carefully avoids my vagina, he can tell himself he isn’t cheating on his full time lover.
I used to love the dominatrix role I had carefully cultivated and then perfected, but now I think it has brought me only pain. Now I’m not sure who or what I am.
I forgot how it feels to have a man want to put his penis or fingers inside me and his mouth on me.
And omg it hurts so much to say it.
Fuck all the excuses as to why normal vanilla sex was not given to me by Roger or Donny. Fuck all the reasons and excuses for why I no longer got to suck my lover’s dick when the real reason is because he and Vickie were doing who knows what to each other under the influence of a drug that makes you so hyper sexual, cops have stories to tell about what they’ve seen people doing to each other.
They make impulsive, unsafe decisions and have copious amounts of sex. Unsafe sex practices, infidelity, possible shared needles, e coli, retracted testicles, all of it makes me want to crawl away and cry over all I have had to face and accept.
Why did addiction have to take the only person I have ever loved. Why did it have to take someone I loved and needed so fiercely? Why is my pain any less than Lori’s or Vickie’s?
Why, why, why.
I can ask “why” forever but it won’t take the pain away.
Nothing will. But if someone laid a magical drug in front of me that promised to make all the pain I’m feeling now GO away, I’d be hopelessly addicted in no time flat.
I don’t know what to do next, but I know I have to do something.
My life simply cannot go on this way. Losing Roger has laid bare every single one of my burdens, the same ones his love kept at bay.
The only thing I have to take comfort in is my silence. It’s all I have left that I can control.
They say your silence is loudest to those who love you most. That would be my daddy and my lover.
The one who loves me most, who for any one of the past 73 years would have given his life for me, is laying in a hospital bed 2 hours away from me fighting for his life.
And the other has gone deaf.

My mind won’t let me sleep and the tears won’t stop.
I decided to clean my desk off while I tried to watch a show on t.v. and I found a piece of paper. It was filled with words, like notes a student would take for a history exam, and it was in my handwriting. It was penned on the back of a piece of mail dated August 2021.
It was around the time that Roger had sent me a text meant for Vickie, who I now know was the lover I had caught him seeing months earlier that he promised he had gotten rid of. He even made a big show of making me look at the texts he sent her, to prove that he had told her he loved someone else…Me.
So she knew all along he was in love with someone but she didn’t care. She thought she could take him from me.
And she did. So, how did he “love” me and cheat with the same person not once but twice for over a year and a half? Was he building a relationship with her and phasing me out, yet keeping me on a LONG string? Yes he was.
All the words that I furiously scribbled the night of his betrayal WERE an attempt to sort it all out, to see a pattern or find a reason for his sudden and complete change. Now, as I read the unorganized thoughts and jumbled words born of my racing mind that night, I know exactly what was wrong.
Drugs.
Below are the frantic thoughts I wrote on the paper that day…exactly how they looked.
*Everything has changed
*You have never hurt me like this before
*Always felt loved, never like this
*I’m last for a reason
*You lie for a reason
*You avoid me for a reason
*You forget to call for a reason
*You’re always late for a reason
*You don’t spend time with me anymore for a reason
*You have totally abandoned me for a reason
*You abruptly stopped loving me and caring about my feelings, for a reason
*I DON’T KNOW THE REASON
*You lose hours of time
*You have time unaccounted for
*You can’t tell me where you were or why you didn’t call for days
*You are secretive and withdrawn
*You shut me out
*You are irritated with me
*If I try to tell you my feelings you mock me or get angry and punishing
*Why do you hurt me baby
*You’ve lost interest in plenty of other things before, but never me
*My feelings haven’t changed
*I fear yours have
*You text me at 3:00 a.m.
*You never sleep
*You don’t do your best at work anymore
*I have to nag you to call
*You treat me like you don’t love me
*Baby why don’t you love me anymore
*What did I do.
*You left me alone and I still love you and I didn’t know you were leaving.
*I never got to kiss you Goodbye but you didn’t need me to.
*So it doesn’t really matter.
That’s it. The words came from my mind and they only make sense to me.
Reading the words made me relive the anguish I felt when I wrote them.
I’m so sad that my lover hurts enough to try to fill the void with a drug that is killing him and I’m so sad that I can’t save my baby.
Finally saying I can’t do it anymore is proving to be the hardest conviction I’ve ever had to stick to. I’ve been doing this for 15 months, trying to save my relationship with Roger and find out what was destroying it. 15 months. Since January of 2021. That means my baby has been using drugs for over a year. I’m so scared I’m going to lose him if he doesn’t go to some form of rehab.
I was finally getting my lover back and he was gaining sobriety, but I fear he slipped and relapsed last weekend. I feel it in my heart and I hope I’m wrong. He’s also back in his marriage and more (willingly) trapped than ever AND his lover is in contact with him. Meanwhile, I can’t call cuz I’ll piss them both off. Yeah, do THAT math and figure out who gets fucked. That’s right, ME.
There was never going to be room for me. I’m like the cigarette you keep in your drawer so you can continue to stay nicotine free, knowing you can smoke it if you run out of willpower.
He was never going to leave his wife to be with me and he brags about me having stayed with him for 15 years, even after he told me outright more than once that I’d never be his partner outside of the motel bedroom.
He doesn’t give a damn about anything anymore. He chuckled when he told me he got “canned” from a prestigious and well earned job where he should have retired a golden boy and went out with a bang and a pocket full of money. Instead, it’s gonna end worse than it is right now because rock bottom is yet to come. If you can lose your wife, health, girlfriend, sexual ability, sanity and self respect and still say smugly that you got shit canned at 67 rather than having retired or resigned, you ain’t at rock bottom.
The Roger I know would never allow that kind of departure from his long career in community service, where he has helped millions of low income people have homes they could afford. But he didn’t just do that, he made those homes beautiful for the less fortunate, when he could have been designing and building high end homes in nice neighborhoods making bank. Instead, he used his gift and ability to better other people’s lives. Now HIS own sucks. This is the man I love and I just want him to not be miserable and sad and crying all the time. I can’t watch him KILL himself with drugs OR by staying in his horrible marriage. Both will make him sick unless his wife can change for the better and he can get help.
He always said if she started to put out sexually to keep him, it would be too little too late. He lied. They have tons of sex according to her. And he’s right where she wants him. Just wtf? Was ANYTHING he told me true??
I’m taking a stand to prove my worth.
But at the same time, I feel totally worthless.
All of this has made me realize that it’s time to make peace.
With all my broken pieces.

93,https://www.opendiary.com/m/kaleidoscope-eyes/never-too-late-to-go-back-home-6109210/,2022-04-22,Never too late to go back home.,"
Home isn’t where I sleep.
Home is where I do my trade of 36 years. HOME is, and has always been, the Barber Shop.
There is a shop owner in town and we have been personal friends for 40+ years. I’ve worked for her on and off over the decades and we have always had a great relationship.
With all the turmoil and losses in my life as of late, I want familiarity. I want to do my job. I want the soothing that only comes from interacting with someone on a different level, a tactile level.
If you are a giver, you will understand.
My son in law gets his hair cut with the barber downtown when I am unavailable. I directed him there, just as she directs her clients to me when she is unavailable. We respect each other’s work and I helped her to open the shop she solely works out of now.
So, he tells me last week that he saw the barber in town and she told him to tell me that if I work for her, I can keep all my earnings as long as I keep the shop open for her in her absence. She’s getting too physically beat up by the trade to continue to stand for hours alone and frantically work to clear her busy shop of customers.
I gave it a lot of thought and I realized that this may be the last time in my life that I’m physically capable of doing the job that has always been my first love.
So, I rang up my barber friend this morning and I offered my services.
Her reply was “Can you come now? I have four people waiting!!”
It’s 10:00 a.m., Friday.
I just went back to work at 54 years old and I’m kind of afraid but I don’t know why because I’m about to be in one of the three places that fill my heart with joy.
One is the cottage.
One is the barbershop.
One is in Roger’s arms.
It’s too cold to swim and that fucker has a wife AND a girlfriend and a crippling, terminal drug habit.
Looks like I am left with just one option.
Time to dust off my tools and go home.

Going back to work was the best decision I’ve made in years.
Just as I predicted, within fifteen minutes of entering the shop, I was halfway through a haircut and my resting heart rate was normal for the first time in what seemed like forever. It felt like I took a Xanax. Only I didn’t.
An hour in, it was as if I had never stepped away from my barber chair.
I have not been hugged in weeks. But, yesterday renewed my faith in good men. Some of my old clients jumped right in the chair after greeting me with a welcome back and a heartfelt embrace. A few times, I cried.
The shop owner, who over the years has always been my friend and co-worker, told me after we closed the shop that I am the best person to work with her and that she feels I add a great deal to her business. Then she said she was thrilled and grateful that I finally agreed to the job offer she’s been extending to me for the last 15 years.
We hugged and giggled about how two old broads can still pound out a shop full of haircuts.
Then she handed me 120.00 and told me to keep my tips, which amounted to 43.00.
I opened my mouth to protest and she said…
“Take it. And understand that you’re worth it.”
I put the money in my pocket and swept up my hair and left for home.
On the way there, I contemplated how it would feel to work 8 hours instead of 4.
Looks like I won’t have to wonder for long because today, she asked me to work Monday, tomorrow, from open to close.
I’m scared and excited all at the same time and for the first time in a long time, I feel happy about something.
Standing at the current crossroad in my life has brought about the realization that every time I need to dig in and dig myself out of despair, I turn to my shears and clippers.
They have saved me before and they will save me again.
Behind that chair, I will find the sexy confidence I’ve misplaced as of late. Behind that chair, I will find the soul I sold to feel loved and wanted.
Behind that chair, I will do for myself what I did before…I’ll save enough money to rent a house to live in before I file for a divorce from my husband.
I just hope my aging body can hold up as long as my spirit can.

He says it is a 5 day stay. Inpatient. But the dates don’t correlate to any calendar month in the future or past. They simply don’t exist, as he stated they were SUNDAY 4/20/22- THURSDAY 4/25/22.

So this is probably just a lie to keep me dangling in case he feels like having me around when he’s sober.
He did not send an answer to my reply.
Probably because he’s using methamphetamine.
That’s why the message made no sense and why he didn’t answer. Basically the message was to let me know he is still using, and is making up rehab dates to buy time. He wants to buy time to keep using meth while keeping his fishing line in the water on MY pond.
The alarming truth is that once an addict loses a job, it’s downhill from there.
He’s not really even considering getting help because the absolutely staggering statistics overwhelmingly state that only a very small percentage of people survive meth addiction past 5-7 years of use. I’m certain Roger’s heart has been damaged already and I’m certain he won’t live past 70 and will die very, very sick.
The statistics currently on record are for people aged 16-50 years. Advanced age meth users? There aren’t enough to even study, but if it does insane damage to a young healthy body, what will it do to a 68 year old one?
I was reading about how you get so weak that you move slowly and unsteadily. You become less and less strong so your body struggles to do tasks that are second nature for a healthy person. I stared in disbelief as I watched R struggle to open a car door and to remain steady on his feet the last time I saw him. It is WREAKING destruction on him and I can’t do anything but panic.
He’s absolutely killing himself before my eyes.
He has given up and is stuck in the hopeless cycle of addiction and what he fails to realize is that he has had me on the back burner for so long that I forgot what it feels like to be loved and respected and cared for by him. He doesn’t even want to see me or have the desire or ability to spend time with me yet he sends me texts meant to give me hope. 
If he’s still using, then guess who else is around?
Yup. Icky Vickie. She ain’t gone nowhere and still lives in his pumpkin shell and I still have zero place or value.  And she surely still wants to hurt me and he’s surely still willing to gamble with my safety. 
Just thinking of everything he has done sexually with her and with his wife makes me sick inside my heart and stomach. To think of him holding both of them in his arms but never me makes a fire burn in my soul and it’s white hot anger….anger at being last or worse, having no place at all.
He won’t ever be faithful to me and that’s all I will accept from any man. Sounds kinda hypocritical coming from an adulteress, but I never wanted anyone but Roger and I would have remained faithful out of pure adoration if he would have given me the same courtesy.
I’m nobody’s lover.
I’m nobody’s baby.
I’m all alone with a pocketful of broken promises and false hopes and dreams. I’m all alone with the acrid taste of continued betrayal burning the back of my throat and it’s literally eating me alive. I have gone from pants size 22 to size 16/18 in eight months.
I’m dying, too.
My husband isn’t an option for me. Unlike R, I meant it when I said I didn’t want my husband sexually. He was happy to fall back on his marriage when his wife started putting out. It DIDN’T matter that she didn’t for 30 years. HE said “too little too late” and then fucked the hell out of that old bag. He lied about that, too.
But I’m gonna get on my hands and knees and crawl my fucking way through this tunnel of shit that’s before me. I’m gonna find my way to the other end where the light is and ain’t nobody gonna feed me a line of bullshit while I’m struggling to reach it.
If you ain’t gonna be in the lead, guiding me towards safety then that means you’re behind me, trying to drag me backwards to where I will suffocate trying to save you.
An obscure treatment plan outlined in a text is not a sincere attempt at recovery. It’s just a way to keep putting me at risk and to keep holding on to two toxic bitches that can make a sport out of threatening me cuz they suck your dick and let you stick it to ’em. 
They are weak and mean and full of hatred. Hell, evil is a better word. I don’t deserve their blame.
The hardest thing I’ve ever had to do was take this stance and how has it affected him? He’s still playing games with me, living in some world where he gets to dampen the pain with drugs that I cannot compete with. 
I, on the other hand, get to suffer every single awful feeling completely sober and alone. I have nothing to numb the pain but my anger, and that’s fading fast. 
I answered him and got no response. Why? Because I’m not important enough to interfere with whatever it is he’s doing or more like whoever it is he’s trying to make happy. He’s still immune to my pain. He’s busy right now and he didn’t really want to have to talk or interact with me, nope, he just wanted to spend 30 seconds firing off a text he didn’t intend to answer.
After 15 years, I barely occupy any space in his mind. On a rainy Sunday afternoon, I am just an afterthought that popped up on his faulty radar.
I’m well aware,
That I still don’t matter
And he’s almost out of time.

I miss how he used to cherish me.
I know it doesn’t seem like he could have, in light of how he wasn’t satisfied with my love, but it always seemed like he genuinely did cherish me.
I know it’s wrong to miss it, because it is a privilege a lot of women never have.
But I do miss it so very much, just the same. It is selfish of me, I know, because some women are beaten and put down and manipulated every single day and they hurt so bad that they’ve resigned themselves to the fact that they don’t deserve better than that.
I have read all I can get my hands on about meth addiction. Once you start using and you use more than one time a month, your life span is 5-7 years. I’ve literally read that on every piece of literature I have picked up and I laid in bed this morning and wondered again for the millionth time “why” anyone would pick up a drug for which the DEA has coined the slogan “not even once” due to its rate of addiction.
You expel the corrosive chemicals it is made with through your skin as you sweat profusely, because your body’s core temperature overheats. The caustic chemicals literally burn when the sweat is released through the pores and that’s why meth users have sores. Then, they pick at them.
It takes less than a year to do irreversible damage to your heart, organs and teeth. You’ll mount and have sex with anyone. I guess that part he’s proven true.
Meth psychosis occurs in almost anyone if they deprive their brain of enough sleep or if they continue to use it for long enough to do brain damage, which by the way, occurs as early as 3 months after introduction. Brain damage resulting in permanent meth psychosis, like Vickie has, oh AND it also affects and causes permanent damage to the lobe of the brain that feels pleasure. Because meth makes your brain overproduce feel good hormones and they eventually burn the pathways out. Permanent cognitive brain damage. In every user. Let that sink in.
The worst part of all of it is that the huge dopamine release methamphetamine triggers in the brain makes it so that you are never able to feel the same amount of pleasure you did PRE meth addiction and some people are left with severe depression for life. Almost all users experience 9-18 months of withdrawal depression and nearly all of them will fail at recovery if there are not several rehabilitative services in place for their support. For at least one year.
Meth addiction lasts forever. It’s a terrible drug to kick.
You will always crave it.
By the time you realize you have a problem, it is usually too late. It takes 2 years on average to lose everything to meth usage…relationships, employment, your home, your money, respect, and your health, which declines rapidly. Once you lose a job, your usage spirals and that is usually the trigger to go from “just hanging on” to “hopeless” in no time flat.
Recovery statistics? You don’t even want to know. Families and significant others are every bit as devastated as the user.
It is literally a guaranteed death sentence and alarmingly hard to stop using unless you change everything and do extensive in patient rehab with a one to two year recovery plan after you’re released.
Oh, and the biggest trigger to cause relapse once you are not chemically dependent is being in an emotional relationship or living situation that brings you stress…
And he’s doing just that. He’s sabotaging any chance at recovery by continuing to be dependent on his vicious, ugly wife/mommy. The one he thinks he can’t do better than.
I know I made the right choice by disappearing after receiving what I believe to be an insincere text from my lover today.
He is still willing to gamble with me. He was more than willing to gamble with my love to get what he thought was a better opportunity at happiness. With a new lover, and now with the same OLD lover.
He’s been gambling with my love for 18 months. Honestly, after that long, it just boils down to callousness. And what’s up with his cryptic text messages full of inconsistencies, texts that elicit a response from the receiver that he never intended to follow up on? Why send texts you’re not gonna answer?
Nothing has changed. He’s gonna continue to fuck around and tell me he loves me while he continues to prove he really doesn’t.
And I’m still sucking hind titty behind everyone and everything else.
Maybe I’m just done nursing.
Maybe I’m just ready to be weaned. I’m starving and I have a better chance at a meal on my own rather than waiting for crumbs from him to nurture me.
My belly is rumbling but my lover doesn’t hear it. He’s too busy trying to hang on to his youth rather than let go of all his demons and celebrate the remainder of his life with someone that loves him.
I’ve also read a lot lately about serial cheaters and the research says that they do it because at their core, they feel unlovable.
What more could I have done to show him he was worthy of my love and that I loved him? I did what I thought was everything but it didn’t matter in the end because now I know, the problem lies with him and not because I am lacking anything. I am not blameless but I don’t deserve to be hurt by him and one or both of his vindictive lovers.
I knelt at his feet and washed them like he was fucking Jesus.
So where is my messiah now??
He’s laying with women whose words aim to wound his ego and whose claws tear at his flesh. Literally.
And the girl that groomed his feet sits alone with a gravely wounded heart, crying out to nobody with tired vocal chords that make no sound because they fall upon deaf ears anyways.
I don’t feel like your baby anymore. You hurt me enough times that I no longer feel worthy of being anyone’s baby. I just cry, and trust the wrong people that hurt me in ways you never did or would. And I miss who you used to be and I long for your return but you never come for me.
I DO feel like a survivor. I survived this loss. I survived what I thought would surely kill me.
But I was wrong. It didn’t.
I only wish it did.

I hurt so bad.
And I am angry.
I don’t want to feel anger in my heart. I want to feel loved. I want to be healed and held and spoken to. I want my love to be healing and therapeutic and good for someone other than me.
Writing in this diary is all I have to relieve myself of some of my emotional burden. I am anonymous here and nobody can hurt me or threaten me or call me vulgar names. I mean, they could but they never have.
I’ve adapted coping skills that I read about here and there online in my struggle to do something to make myself feel better. One of the things I read said to create a colorful living space and fill that space with only things you love. No color scheme. Color IS the scheme.
I love pastels and I love the 1940’s. I don’t know why, but I’ve been drawn to that era all my life. All but one of my kids has moved out of my two story, 5 bedroom house.
So, in late August of last year, I moved out of my marital bedroom and created a living space upstairs consisting of a bedroom, an office, a living area/landing and a private bathroom.
It was a move that brought about monumental emotional changes.
Things with Roger were terribly wrong and I knew it, but it would be four months before the shit hit the fan.
Also, I was bothered by my husband’s affection in bed at night. He did not want sex and hadn’t for years, but he wanted to cuddle to go to sleep. I would have welcomed the cuddling…had sex and intimacy been part of the package. It might sound petty, but if you get rejected enough times you learn to hate the rejector and I hated him for that…UNTIL I moved out of the bedroom. That move allowed me to distance myself and take control of my own body and who touched it and that was a game changing shift in our relationship.
My husband felt upset at first and I blamed the move on my back, saying the bed he chose without my input hurt my back, which was the truth. The move actually enabled me to be much kinder towards him, in the long run.
I painted my bedroom a soft, cottagey pink and I filled it with pastel treasures like pottery planters and a bright yellow chenille bedspread patterned with two colorful peacocks prancing around in full plumage. There are crocheted doilies and soft antique wool rugs with florals. The floor is white painted pine and all the trim is the same. There are big and small hand painted metal tole trays on the wall and a big screen tv with all the channels I could ever want. There is wicker furniture and a barkcloth cushioned rocker painted a soft green.
It’s serene and beautiful in my softly lit pastel bubble. Sleeping here has taught me to find comfort in myself and to learn what it feels like to be on my own at the most vulnerable part of my 24 hour day…in the silent dark.
I wake up often. All night, on and off. But eventually, my heart and troubled mind are gonna let me rest for longer periods.
In the morning when I open my eyes and the painful memories come creeping in, the beautiful colors seem to remind me to find the beauty in something as simplistic as basking in the morning sun. After I wake, I take time to lay in the sliver of light that finds its way around the edges of my pink polka dot curtains and I catch up on a few forums I follow on my phone.
I spend ten minutes lounging in my big comfy bed, enjoying the serenity.
Eventually, I make coffee and walk across the hall to my office, which I painted bright yellow with red accents, and I begin my work day there. Now, I will split my time between my online store platform and the barber shop and bank what I make.
I’m laying the groundwork for my plan.
There is one thing I had to get used to, though, when I moved upstairs. From every window, I see only the treetops.
At first, it unnerved me that I never saw the ground. But now, I am accustomed to my view and it’s a small price to pay for that first step towards independence. My husband seems to understand a little bit about what lies ahead and believe it or not, he respects my private space. He comes upstairs to visit ME. When he tried to make a final effort like Roger’s wife and used sex as a last ditch bargaining chip, I locked his ass out and when he tried again three nights later, I heard the knob turn and catch in the lock and I silently whispered, “go away, it’s over.” I held my breath waiting for his next move. After ten full seconds, I heard him go back down the stairs. I had finally taken control of the house that for the time being, I own too.
What I wanted to say was this … I’m claiming my half of our house while I’m still here so get your sorry ass hands off my doorknob and go to your own bed. You had 32 years to fix it and it’s too late now.
I think I can safely say he has accepted the first actual stage of separation.
I’m going to walk away from everything I’ve ever known in less than one year. I’m going to be alone for the first time in my life. I will have forfeited my home and all my security in order to be away from him for the first time since I was 22 years old.
But I ain’t afraid like Lori. I will make my own security. I will care for myself.
It’s time to let it all go.
And see what stays.

98,https://www.opendiary.com/m/kaleidoscope-eyes/kicking-rocks-6112390/,2022-05-09,Kicking rocks,"
Today I feel like I’m kicking rocks. 
For anyone wondering…
“Kicking rocks” is the redneck term for booting someone out of your life. You tell them to get packing, take a hike and start kicking rocks down the gravel road.
The sun is shining and spring is finally here. 
I wonder if there is ever going to come a day when HE isn’t the first thing I think of when I wake up.
I wonder if I am ever going to feel happy again.
I wonder if I’m ever going to heal from the pain of this abandonment.
I wonder if anyone will ever love me again and I wonder if I will go to my grave with this undeniable pain in my heart.
I wonder why I was not enough and I wonder if I could have saved him if I had done something different or better or sooner.
I wonder how he could walk away from me and not look backwards to see if I had collapsed or remained standing.
I wonder how you love someone so well for 15 years and then decide you don’t need or want them anymore.
I wonder how it was so easy to forget about me and to leave me behind, not caring if he ever saw me again or if I found someone to replace the love he took with him when he left.
I wonder when the pain in his heart got so great that everything except for quieting it ceased to matter.
I wonder if I’m ever going to wake up NOT loving him.
It hurts to love someone and watch them hurt themselves and replace your love with someone else’s. I wonder when I will no longer be tortured by the what if’s and the why’s.
Roger’s wife said a lot of hurtful things to me. She called me a homewrecker and ugly and immoral and stupid. She called me a whore and said I was nothing but a distraction from his real love…Her. She said I was a bad mother and an even worse wife. She called me despicable and dumb.
All of those insults bounced right off me, and she knew she had to keep going until she found the one thing that would hurt me. She found my weak spot in just a matter of days, like any large predatory mammal that is waiting to snare its next meal.
That bitch kept going until she got me where she knew it would haunt me for the rest of my life.
She blamed ME for his drug addiction.
She put the blame for the destruction of the man we both love squarely at MY feet.
It’s all ME that made him sick.
She exonerated herself and deemed herself blameless. She made it someone else’s fault…like she has ÀLWAYS done to avoid facing her own serious issues and being held accountable for her actions.
Now I wake up every day with her words ringing in my ears and this gaping hole where my heart used to fucking be and she wants to convince me that not only do I deserve what I’m feeling, I caused it.
What about you, you mean, selfish person? What about the torture YOU put him through with your insane ability to never be happy, grateful or satisfied?
What in the fuck is there to love about YOU?? You stomp your feet and scream and threaten and my God, you’re the ugliest woman I’ve ever seen.
It’s obviously something I don’t know about or understand, because I can’t find one single redeeming quality about you.
And that’s where my lover has chosen to be. To stay. In her arms.
Yeah, the sun is shining out my window but there is nothing but darkness in my heart.
I used to be afraid of the dark, but nothing really scares me anymore. It’s as if all of my emotions are numb, deadened, with the exception of sadness. I forgot what hope feels like.
Helen Keller said “it is better to walk with a friend in the dark than to walk alone in the light.”
That explains my sadness.
I’m in constant darkness because I didn’t merely lose my greatest love.
He took my best friend with him.

I’m sitting at work with a little time to kill.
That rarely happens as this is a well established shop. I’m in my hometown and I already have customers scheduled for the future. Word has gotten around that I’m working in town and this may be the busiest and most successful I’ve ever been in my 35 year career.
It’s also the most money I’ve ever made. 
I should feel happy and successful and I do, but I wish I had my lover to talk to at the end of the day. To share it with. To spoil.
I don’t think I’m ever going to stop missing him. Why do I have this giant empty space in my heart and why did he reside there for so long that now I can hardly live without him?
Why does it feel like I can’t make it through the rest of my life alone?
When he called me from the rehab hospital, I was in shock and I struggled to process the news that he was finally somewhere safe, and that he was no longer in the hands of Vickie or her associates or Lori. Once it sunk in, what he was telling me, I cried racking sobs of fear, uncertainty, and worry. I cried tears of hopeful relief. I sobbed out an apology for all the hurtful things I had ever said.
And I haven’t stopped crying since.
After we said goodbye that night, everything changed. He’s gone. I don’t know if he’s dead or alive. I have no way of contacting him and this is the worst I’ve struggled through this whole ordeal.
It feels agonizing to be in the dark and worrying incessantly about his well being.
I am on the outside.
And I’m not even looking in.
The windows to his soul are covered with heavy paper and I can’t see inside.
Every day I educate myself about recovery from methamphetamine. I am so scared that he is damaged forever and what if I never see him again? I can’t shake the fear and pain and worry.
But mostly, I can’t escape the crash, the depression. I’m struggling with disordered sleeping and my appetite is back with a vengeance. I want to eat sugar and salt and everything in between. I’m exhausted and sad. My moods are up and down and I cry so many times throughout the day that my nose is plugged most of my waking hours. I feel scared and alone and helpless. And Angry, but it is not directed at him anymore. 
I miss him so bad. I’m so scared for the future. It can’t get any worse than the present. We are so far at the bottom that there is literally NO way to get any lower.
It’s like the horror and shock of the past year have finally caught up to me and I can’t recover emotionally this time. It’s like I can breathe for the first time but at the same time I’m gasping for air, for any word from him.
He’s no more gone than he was before, it just feels like it because I want him to recover so badly. To come back to me and to be free from pain and suffering and addiction.
But the information I’ve read online about recovery frightens me beyond what I thought possible. I can hardly stand the thought of the suffering he is enduring. It takes a full 30 days to shake the intense cravings for the drug and the crippling depression that withdrawal brings. When I learn about what he is most likely feeling at this stage in recovery, it makes me cry to think he feels bad and I can’t hold him. I cry and worry and I want to touch him and hold him and tell him it’s ok.
He would most likely be irritated with me or too sad to talk. Both those symptoms hang on until your brain starts to build up the stores of dopamine that meth demanded and depleted. It takes a month. Maybe more. The older you are the longer and harder you struggle and I just want to die knowing he’s hurting and I’m powerless.
I’ve been powerless for so long now.
I have an intense need to nurture and hold my lover. My need to comfort him is so strong it’s nearly tearing me apart.
I know this is silly and superstitious and I don’t really believe this stuff, but, I think I’m feeling the things that Roger is going through. I have no reason to feel withdrawal symptoms. I have absolutely no idea what would make my body mimic what he may be experiencing besides empathy.
I think I’m so emotionally tied to him that I am feeling his suffering.
If I could end it for him, I would. I’d gladly do what you do for love and trade places with him.
That’s what you do when the other half of what makes you whole is faltering. You are their strength. You lift them up and you carry them when they can no longer do it for themselves.
Even after all he’s done, I still love him.
And I believe he loves me, although it is hard to believe that because it flies in the face of how he has treated me lately. But he does. Because I felt it for so many years and because even when he was at his sickest, avoidant and addicted, he still reached out to me.
He didn’t completely abandon me until Vickie outed him, at which point he made the decision to be with her and to turn his back on me.
But something keeps making him turn around and look behind him. Maybe it’s to see if I’m still there.
Or maybe he looks back…
With the hope that I’m finally gone.

I would never hurt myself intentionally but the way I feel today, I understand those that do.
I’ve been crying since before I got out of bed this morning. I hurt from a place so deep that I fear my heart may be irrevocably altered.
I don’t understand why I have been crying since the day he called me from rehab, but I SO wish I could STOP.
I feel an overwhelming loss. There is a giant hole in me and I can’t fill it. I feel like I am finally dying and I welcome the relief. It’s never going to go away, this pain, and I am terrified that I am going to feel this way forever and if that’s the case, life doesn’t hold much beauty or purpose. It’s not even pretty anymore.
I have so much to be happy for.
But inside I’m dying from the loss of one person.
It hurts so much but I must face the facts.
The facts are he is staying in the horrible marriage that makes him sick and now he’s going to allow his wife to take control of his life for him. She’s going to convince him that his leaving her is what caused his problems rather than his addiction to drugs. She’s going to shame and scold him for what he’s done to keep him compliant. Her typical M.O.
And in the state he’s in, she will most likely regain control and the rest of his life will now be spent trying to make amends to her. He will be expected to make up for her “pain and suffering” she so loudly told me I was responsible for.
And we all know how that’s gonna pan out cuz there IS no making that bitch happy. She’s the biggest martyr I know. The ONLY reason she wants him well is because she wants him to get back to the business of taking care of HER.
She needs a victim.
I’m starting to think that once he sobered up, he decided she looked better than the life he was living and that he no longer wanted anything to do with anyone or anything BUT her in his quest for sobriety. She can put the pants on and run the show and he can just blindly obey and then it takes the heat off him to recover in any real way.
It will end up the same dynamic, with her being the overbearing mother and him the wayward boy. She will be calling every time she lets him out of the house and he’s not where she thinks he should be. Under her thumb once again, he will soon go back to his old coping skills of fucking around and it will start all over again. The deception. The excuses. The lies.
Yup. He’s gone. I have no way of contacting him and he doesn’t seem to have any need to contact me. I cannot contact him because his wife has threatened me within an inch of my life if I so much as even pick up the phone to text or call. And he knows this…so he is willingly making the choice to let me suffer with no word of his well being. He is willingly letting me go through every day in agony, wondering if he is sick or healthy.
He is absolutely fucking gone. Granted, I told his ass to kick rocks, but once he called me saying he was seeking treatment, I thought that my willingness to support him would render me worthy of some word on his progress. HE knows I love him and that this means everything to me…his health.
I know he’s sick and needs to concentrate on himself but this seems like the final kick in the gut. Re-abandonment.
Or maybe I’m just stupid. It is obvious he doesn’t want me anymore and he hasn’t for a year and a half yet here I am, crying on a Monday and feeling so empty inside that I have to remind myself to breathe.
I have to remind myself that he didn’t want me anymore. He had replaced me and the only reason he kept me hanging on was because the woman he chose to replace me with wasn’t who he thought she was. He was done with me way back then and I just didn’t want to accept it.
Now I have no choice.
With Vickie no longer in the picture, he chose the woman he has always loved and desired. His wife.
Now that she wants him, he no longer has a need for me. All he needed was her to want him, desire him, love him. I was just a fill in and now she wants to actually (finally) PLAY the lead role and act like a wife and give him the sex and affection he was missing.
I guess I should feel happy for him.
I should feel happy that he no longer has to fight for her to want him. After 25+ years, she finally does. And everything I was to him ceased to exist once she decided she wanted him.
I know I’m just feeling sorry for myself and that I need to suck it up and get on with my life and accept the choices he made. I need to put the ring he made me away for good so I don’t have a cruel reminder of what I lost every time I open my jewelry box to choose a piece to wear.
I can’t accept the loss. I can’t accept the emptiness.
I can’t accept knowing I wasn’t enough to keep the man I loved, even though I did everything I could to ensure he stayed, even compromising some of my own values. And he left me anyway.
Today is especially painful because it is my Roger’s birthday and I don’t know if he’s dead or alive. All I know is that my heart knows he’s hurting and struggling and I cannot hold him.
And even if I could, he might just push me away.
Maybe he’s happy and healthy.
Maybe she will make his favorite cake and buy him a small present that gives him hope for the future.
Maybe I will never see him again and maybe he doesn’t feel anything for me anymore.
All I know is that I cannot heal.
And if I cannot heal, that means I will stay in this miserable state forever.
Forever is a long ass time.
When you’re not even sure you can make it through TODAY.

So, let me make sure I have this right…
You’re still awake and texting at 3:00 a.m.
You’re still with Lori.
Vickie is still in your rental.
You did drugs as recently as 2 weeks ago.
So…nothing’s changed.
You’ve ignored me for 2 months now. That’s how you ended our 15 year relationship. I assumed it was because your attempt at rehab was unsuccessful.
You have decided to make contact and I assume it’s because you feel some sort of responsibility for my feelings.
You have not made any attempt to contact me before this, so basically you chose two other women and drugs that will kill you over me. Or, the other scenario is that you just did not want to talk to me all this time.
Now, several months later, you say “Happy Birthday” like I’m some kind of low rate commodity that you send a yearly Christmas card to.
You left me behind so you could go have fun and be with Vickie and then to make Lori happy.  I wasn’t ever going to be a priority. When Lori demanded and cried and threw a tantrum, you caved. Now you’re gonna try to kick a habit living with a person that makes you feel like shit on a daily.
When you chose to shove your final fuck you down my throat, the last thing you said to me was “I love you” but then you dropped off the face of the earth and of all the things you did to me, there was nothing worse.
Now you’re gonna come at me and say Happy Birthday when you basically wrote me out of your life yet again without so much as a backwards glance and if you think I believe you are clean, you’re fucking crazy.
That’s what I’m worthy of after 15 years. A fucking text message. No call, no letter, no you.
Same shit different day, that’s what this sounds like.
You don’t love me or even care about me or you wouldn’t have abandoned me a third time and when you were backed into a corner, you chose to completely vanish. If you “loved” me you would have never entertained the idea. You chose instead to make ME the loss, the price you paid to stay high. Losing either of those two bitches never crossed your mind.
Your wife hates my guts and she blamed me for all your drug use and when she said you could not talk to me, you did what you’ve always done, you capitulated, even though the price you paid was losing me.
Then you disappeared and left me with no answers.
To resume taking up with your skank Lover, no doubt.
If that’s love, I don’t want any part of it. All you are going to do is hurt me some more with your lies and philandering and avoidance.
By the way, on YOUR birthday, I cried all day because I was unable to call.
And I was born on the 26th of June but hey, I’m surprised I even crossed your mind at all, so thanks, even if you were a few days early.
How can you expect me to believe I mean shit to you after a 3 month absence?
Cruel…no answer to any of my texts or emails is cruel and typical and now you’re gonna pop in VIA text! Not even voice to voice. You can’t even face me by telephone. You took the easy way out sending a text message.
Still bullshit and still cowardly behavior, from a man I thought was a fucking Superhero.
Yeah, you left something important behind when you chose to make ME the casualty you paid for your two other women and your new lifestyle.
You don’t care enough about me to even call me and talk to me, but you’ll throw words at me from afar… Nah, you’re right. I AM worth more than the low value you decided to assign me.
And one more thing…
Don’t think I don’t know you are the one that found Vickie her “CERA” money. Her psycho, vile ass wouldn’t know how to do any such thing… but YOU would.
You’re still trying to break my heart but what you fail to realize is that there is nothing left of it.
You left me in a million tiny pieces.
Yup. A million.
Like the confetti left over on the floor from your shit storm of a circus. But you didn’t break me. You made me stronger. And your pathetic excuses of not being worthy ain’t cutting it any more. I loved a proud man. Where did he go?
Bring him back.
And we’ll talk.
Until then, I will let my silence speak for me.
My words had no impact on the outcome you chose.
Which is a good thing.
Cuz I got nothing left to say.

Well… 
 
Happy Birthday.
 
A year ago, I sat here on your birthday with a broken heart, so broken that I did not believe the sun was ever gonna shine on me again. 
 
The nights I laid awake crying for you and the terrifying bewilderment I felt when you just abandoned me, the girl you loved for 15 long years, were too plentiful to count. The tears I cried, fearful you would die alone or with someone who didn’t love you, were endless it seemed. 
 
And then I let you go. Because you didn’t love me enough to stop hurting me or yourself, and you let the woman you replaced me with hurl insults and deny me access to you. She was cruel and so was your silence and abrupt departure. 
 
But you didn’t break me. You did just the opposite. You crippled me emotionally to the point where I had nobody to count on but myself.
 
You forced me to learn to love myself and to set boundaries that I will no longer let anyone cross. You forced me to be the strong woman I am today.
 
So here is my gift to you, Roger. 
 
I forgive you for hurting me. I forgive you for trampling me to death in your run for freedom. 
 
Now, I am willing to bet, you are living in your own kind of Hell. A new but old Hell. One you can’t seem to break free of. And I feel sorry for you.
 
As of today, I feel way more sorry for you than I do myself.
 
The fact is, you gave me a lot of care over the years we were together and I had a very deep love for you, so deep that I am forgiving of you and only want what is best for you. 
 
Forgiveness is something only love can foster. 
 
Happy Birthday, Baby. 
 
I hope joy finds you.

I learned a lot about love this past year. 
 
That’s the thing, I thought I knew what love was, but it had been so long since anyone really loved me that I had forgotten how it felt to be important to another person.
 
When Roger said I would never find someone to treat me as well as he did, I believed him. But like a lot of other shit he told me, that was a lie. 
 
When my lover Jon found me, I was broken and hurt and I didn’t trust anyone. I was scared to death of intimacy and just plain scared to death. 
 
He changed all of that and the herculean effort he put forth doing so is something I never thought myself deserving of in the past. 
 
I don’t have to ask or wonder if this man loves me.  It’s in his actions. I am never cold, hungry, or scared. I am never alone or worried or doubtful. I am never left to wonder about anything and I am reminded every day of my beauty and my worth and my strength. I am praised for any emotional progress I make in trusting him. I am loved unconditionally for the first time in my life.
 
He has provided me a safe arena where I am not expected to perform in order to receive his love and affection. When I say I don’t want to do something, I am immediately reassured that I do not have to do anything to gain my lover’s favor.
 
Instead of wanting to share me with someone else or put me on display, he protects and shelters me. 
 
When I struggle with past trauma, he is patiently there with arms wide open, whispering in my ear that it is not my fault someone didn’t love me properly and that he will never betray me. He patiently repairs the foundation that Roger tore out from underneath me day by day, and he does it without me having to ask. He does it because he wants to be my hero.
 
And he is.
 
110 percent.
 
For a lot of the years I was with Roger, I struggled with body image issues and it used to upset him that I couldn’t let go of my insecurities. It upset him because he had never criticized me or made me feel unattractive in any way. In fact, he told me all the time that I was beautiful but I, too, struggled with why I couldn’t let my guard down because there was nothing I wanted more. Now I know what was holding me back.  
 
In my heart, I always knew Roger had other lovers besides me. And in my head, I was always comparing myself to these other beautiful unknown entities. He may have liked me best at one time, but I was never the ONLY one. There was always a silent, humiliating, internal competition raging in my mind when I was naked with him.
 
To compensate for this disparity, I used female Domination. We both just happened to like the dynamic, but my lover got complacent and lazy and he didn’t do much of anything but direct the script and receive. Whole entire evenings were devoted to his sexual wants and rituals and I dutifully performed them like a trained monkey.
 
Jon spent a month just kissing me and holding me before he even began exploring my body. The first time he made love to me, I cried, for I had never seen such love in a man’s eyes while he was on top of me. It had been at least 10 years since a man had actually BEEN on top of me, with his penis inside me and his body pressing down on mine. It had been ten years or more since I had been on my back with my legs pushed up behind my ears receiving a straight up banging from a raging horny man.
 
I have learned that a man who loves you will buy you 4 new tires at the first sign of a flat and follow you to the gas station, winter or spring or summer or fall, just so you never have to pump your own gas.
 
I learned that a man who loves you won’t continue to bang you in a hotel for years on end, but instead will give you your own space to share with him or alone, and your own bed to make love in. 
 
A man who loves you makes sure you have 20 bucks in your pocket and sends you off with a hot cup of coffee and a kiss that spares no passion. You don’t drive away from a man that loves you knowing you’re on your own if something should happen to render you in need of assistance. A man who loves you won’t forsake you for a wife that won’t even fuck him or make you wonder how you’re gonna get home. 
 
A man who loves you is your lover and your daddy and your helpmate and your protector and most importantly he is where you run to for comfort.
 
A man who loves you wants what is best for you and wants you to feel secure so badly that when he has to leave you to go to work, he sends picture updates and calls every few hours. And he does this despite your protests that he doesn’t have to. He’s where he is supposed to be, where he said he was going to be, every second of every day. 
 
You never find yourself waiting around for hours or maybe even days for a man that loves you to put his other lover or wife aside for a minute or two to call you. Instead, you are connected by a lifeline to the other half of yourself every second you are apart.  The man who loves you is only a phone call away, and you can call whenever you want to, night or day. 
 
The man who loves you throws all Roger’s stupid rules and conditions out the fucking window. 
 
When Roger found the woman he loved enough to do all those things for, he went all in. And he couldn’t ditch me fast enough. 
 
I thought that was going to kill me.
 
But instead, it gave me life.
