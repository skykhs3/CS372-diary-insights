Hello Everyone,
I guess I should say that I wasn’t planning on starting a new diary today.  But the site I have used for years has been having a lot of technical difficulties that have made using it nearly impossible for the last few weeks.  When I reported the issues, I was told that the site wasn’t making enough money, so they can’t afford to fix the issues right now so I will have to deal with it.. Ugh.
This is not the right time to tell me to just deal with something.. because life right now is hard, and I have a lot ony plate. I’m tired.  I don’t want to just deal with it.  So that’s why I am here.  Hopefully my experience will be better.

I don’t remember the castle,
The size nor its shape.
I don’t remember the flowers
Or those sounds you used to make.
They call it healing,
I call it confusion.
Was it all just in my head?
Was the love just an illusion?
How could I just forget
What brought so much pain,
Yet so much joy?
Maybe it wasn’t love,
Maybe I was just your toy?
It doesn’t matter
What once was is gone.
The time has come
For me to move on.
Will I rebuild?
I don’t know where to start.
It seems a structure would be easier
To repair than a heart.
Funny how metaphors twist
And turn in my mind,
But one thing is certain,
I’ll leave the past behind.

Dear Diary…
Have you ever said something in anger to someone, and then caught yourself realizing that you aren’t actually angry at the person you are talking to.
Your anger is much deeper than you thought.
So the other night I was working with EJ. Ugh.. It was a long night. We got into several arguments. But at one point we decided to just stop talking and try to get through the night.
I was playing country music, and the song Whiskey Lullabies started playing.
This song must have set off some kind of trigger in him.
All of the sudden he starts flipping out and commenting on the lyrics.. “Jesus died for me..and I’m going to effing kill myself over some chick?” And continues his little Bible thumping rant..screaming at me on how I can play such satanistic music.
My first response was..just “What the actual fuck??” But as he kept going I got extremely mad and flat out said.. I don’t believe in God and I don’t need you shoving this crap down my throat. We are at work.. This isn’t the time or place.
The kid was actually speechless for a minute. Then said something..I can’t remember what it was, but it sent me on a long rant about how fucked up the Bible is.
He said something about God’s love..and I just started asking questions..
Was it out of love that God sent his own son to die? Of course his answer was yes..
Okay then.. How is Jesus’s death helping you today? He was a man..He died. I do not believe he rose again.
If he did, then he is died again. Otherwise he is the oldest MF on the planet..
And was it love when God told Abraham to sacrifice his son? Can you even for a second imagine the emotional trauma this kid had to go through..just for God to say.. Nevermind, I was just testing your faith…
There are so many fucked up stories.. and people are just brainwashed to think they are okay…Because it’s all in God’s name…
There was a few moments of pure silence. And in my mind I could hear a question being posed. Why are you so mad?
Without missing a beat. The answer came and I broke into tears.
Because every time I have loved someone or something.. They have been whisked away.
I didn’t even realize I was talking out loud..
It’s God’s fault my heart turned black and was run over by rage. I have nothing left.
I went home that night and cried for hours over every lost love…and over every lost friend.
I’ve been upset and mourned in the past, but I don’t think I have ever actually cried real tears..
My eyes hurt so much now.. I can barely keep them open. But part of that is due to pure exhaustion. 😩
So now I have to ask myself? Do I really not believe in God anymore?
Honestly speaking… I don’t think I do.
I mean, I do believe that he existed in history. But all his traits are human traits..The jealousy, the vengfulness..as well as all his love and passion. They don’t make him great.. They make him human.
As for the whole creation story… I can’t say what my belief is? I have a lot of questions. Like if Adam named all creatures, what about the dinosaurs?
To my knowledge, they were extinct before the creation of humans…
The truth is.. no one really knows what happened or how we got here. And I don’t think we are supposed to know.
Just because I don’t believe in God, doesn’t mean I don’t believe in a higher power.
The universe is a wondrous place with
many different energies. There are forces at work that we cannot see or fully understand. It’s possible that there is a greater force at play, but it may not be the God that many people believe in.
In the end, what matters most is how we treat each other and the world around us. We should strive to be kind, compassionate, and understanding, regardless of our beliefs or lack thereof.
