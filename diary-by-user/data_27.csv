A thousand years ago, feb of 2020, I thought I’d come back to OD. Sadly, the universe intervened and… uh.. nope.
This time, I’ve just jumped right in with that yearly membership. Hopefully this becomes a daily practice, as 2023 is the year I devote dedicated energy to words.
 
I’ve started posting bits of work online, mostly to Reddit, and it’s ALL smut. My goal is to write an actual novel, or maybe novella, by the end of year and get that published. Also smut? Yes. Technically, romantic erotica.
I thought I’d want to write erotica, turns out I’m more interested in the feelz than the feels.
A couple days ago I ‘met’ a really cool dude on the internet. He was exactly my type – educated, wordy, and full of compliments. God, I thrive on compliments. I NEED validation. ALL THE TIME. Daddy issues? Yeah that too.
Anyway. We were having a good time. He kept reaching out, I kept replying. Conversation was witty and fun. He’s married, busy. Same, same. My husband, whom I love and adore, has given me his blessing in these online shenanigans. I need people to talk to about the darker things that loom in my mind, and he’d rather not, thank you very much.  So… I outsource. Maybe it’s friendship, or intimacy, or something that’s both of those. Not full blown polyamory, but a step down from it. Flirtatious intimacy through the medium of words with a like minded individual.
Anyway. This dude seemed to be in much the same position. And then, literally mid conversation, he disappears. Like, deleted his entire Reddit account.
I’ll admit, this stung. I don’t know why. I drew a tarot card for understanding, got Temperance. Don’t jump to conclusions. Balance. Let the universe lead the way.
Here’s the thing – I’ve been looking for a long time. It’s like searching for a needle in a haystack except I’m searching for a single piece of straw in a needle stack. And to be fair, I don’t even know what I’m looking FOR, I just know that this dude felt the closest to it that I’ve ever felt.
 
Like, I got this in my inbox the other day:
~~~~~
Good evening Dear.
Would love to know whats the best means to get hold of you. Interested in chatting with you.
Whats yr name?
Hello?
me: hi! I prefer not using real names when getting to know people, what’s up? Why did you want to talk to me?
Cause ur a piece of work.
~~~~~~~
NEEDLES.
Don’t get me wrong. Most people I contact or who contact me are perfectly lovely people. They’re just… either just horny and looking to get off, or desperately lonely and looking for me to fix that. Or we just don’t vibe.
 
So when one comes along who checks ALL my boxes and makes me EXCITED to read my messages?? Well.
And then he just DISSAPEARS?
Makes one rather dejected.
Still, let’s keep positive shall we?

Happy love day!
 
I like Valentine’s Day. Mostly, I like sweets, and Valentine’s Day tends to smash into Easter so you get ALL the candy.
I’ve been trying to get back into feeling myself lately. Taking time every day to love myself unconditionally. Show myself love by dressing up and doing my makeup. Yeah? For Valentine’s Day, I wanted to try and figure out a… sexy… outfit.
Tricky. My husband has sensory sensitivities and loathes the feel of lace, velvet, and anything not soft. Nonetheless, I thought.. ok! I’ll make a super cute shelf bra, or a peek a boo one, etc. THIS was a disaster. It was like… trying to get an over full water balloon into a smaller balloon. My boobs were yelling WE WILL NOT BE CONTAINED.
Abandoned that plan.
New plan – a cute nightie! Easy, right? WRONG. Could not find anything cute.
FINALLY I settle on an excellent plan. I decide I’m gonna find some sexy Valentine’s Day SOCKS. I did, they’ve got sasquatches holding hearts. I’ll wear ONLY those, and voila. SEXIEST OUTFIT EVER.
hmm. Maybe that’s not PG. oh well.
Yesterday I lay in a sunbeam and enjoyed it.  There’s something just really magical about a sunbeam coming in through the window while you’re lying in bed. It’s warm and magical and nap worthy.
What was your moment of pleasure yesterday? Not sexual, just.. something that made you feel good. That’s what I’m trying to focus on, finding one thing every day that brings me pleasure.

Ah. Did I already miss a day? That’s ok.
Yesterday’s moment of pleasure. Cuddling with my husband in the evening. We had to have a really hard conversation but it went really well. And it just felt really really good to connect and snuggle.
It’s currently 6:24 in the morning. Early, but not early enough. I try to get up at 5:50 so I can exercise but it’s been a struggle to implement this into my days. So I didn’t wake up, then got up around 6:15. Too late to jump on my bike but I thought I’d get up anyway and at least do some writing. I’m not gonna judge myself too hard for that, sometimes that’s just how it goes. You keep juggling and sometimes you drop stuff but that’s how you get better. Most of the balls are made of plastic.

My husband has been acting oddly. I keep thinking he’s mad at me, even though he insists he isn’t. I don’t know. He insists he’s not stressed and he’s not mad.
I feel like.. I’ve been asleep for such a long time. And now I’m waking up and seeing the damage that happened while I was away. I’m determined to fix this.
it’s like… so much changed when I had a baby. I know I went insane. The postpartum depression was intense. And I got better (drugs) but then we were still so much in survival mode. Just years of keeping her alive and keeping me alive and so little left over to take care of my husband. And now kiddo is almost six and we’re getting back to some semblance of normal but somewhere along the way… I don’t know.
Sometimes I don’t think he likes the person I’ve become. But I’m a good partner. A good cook, a good housekeeper. I think the Answer might be couples therapy. Or maybe I’m fixating And freaking out over something because of my own repressed trauma from my father leaving. I keep talking to unhappy people and.. I dunno.
I really should change the title of this to I don’t know. Cause that feels like a refrain.
ok.
moment of pleasure from yesterday. After kiddo was in bed I cuddled with my husband for a bit. I forget how warm and lovely it is, I forgot how touched out I’d been and how touch deprived he must be. I want to make a habit of this.

4,https://www.opendiary.com/m/jeweltonegothflamingo/oooohhhh-it-was-the-drugs-6198527/,2023-02-19,Oooohhhh it was the drugs,"
Hmm.
meds are kind of fascinating. I take meds for my allergies. I take them for headaches. I take them to control my moods.
But I’ve never really thought about it, or been able to experience it, that we’re really just… sacks of chemicals doing stuff.
I recently started taking… it’s called an ECA stack. Legal in Canada, used by bodybuilders. It boosts… everything? But also suppresses hunger. And, oddly, helps with sinus issues. The E, ephedrine, was developed for hay fever. Fascinating isn’t it? That you have this drug for noses and sinuses and the big side effect is hunger suppression and…. Energy. It’s illegal in the states because people use it to make meth. Which you think would be a deterrent but nah.
Turns out, a low dose sent me into a depressive spiral. Which is obviously bad. But here’s the thing- it was also incredibly… freeing. Now. Because, I’ve always believed it was ME. That I’m broken, that my brain is broken. That it’s just twisted up in who I am, and that it makes me a bad person that this darkness is inside me.
but it’s NOT. It’s just fucking chemical soup man. The salty soup in the pot doesn’t change what the pot is. The pot is good and whole and perfect. The soup just needs a potato cause it’s too goddamn salty.
And here’s the bit where I probably lose people. You’d think an experience like this, I’d immediately stop. But I don’t want to. I want to… overcome this. It’s just chemistry. Maybe if I practice enough, at low doses, I can… train my brain to disregard and push myself into a better frame of mind. Which, is something you’re supposed to practice when these things happen anyway, when they naturally occur. I’ll keep journaling and keeping track, make sure it’s not impacting my day to day – the way it did yesterday. THAT will not happen again. (Sobbing over pasta. No more of that)
 
ah.

Woke up around 3:30 when kiddo had to pee and couldn’t sleep so… guess I’m up?
mm.
Moment of joy from yesterday: I did some embroidery and it really felt.. nice. I find mysel fidgeting with my hands and not knowing what to do a lot. I play phone games but.. I dunno, embroidery feels real and tangible. I need a project I can take with me on the go. Or maybe just a better travel box for my needles and stuff.
yesterday had no mood swings. Not sure what to make of that, maybe Saturday was a fluke and just my brain freaking out. Ah. Goblins inside my brain again.
I think I’m going to go try and write some.. smut. Hah. It’s good for me, and I haven’t. Every time I tell myself I’m gonna do something and decide not to, it saps a little bit of strength from my day. So if I go do it, and get it done, well. Look at how productive I’ll have been.

This last week has been a blur of activity. I’ve got a very physical project and it’s leaving me kinda bleary to the world.
last night I planned to write, then got high and just wandered around Reddit for far too long. Whoops. I don’t feel badly, sometimes that’s just what your brain needs, though I do kinda regret how many jelly beans I ate.
though.. speaking of eating.
I didn’t take my supplements today and almost immediately felt that desire to just.. eat. Not hunger. Not even remotely connected to hunger cues. Just.. wanting to taste salt. Maybe. Sensation. Sensation seeking with my sense of taste.
hmm. There’s a lot to unpack right there.
tomorrow I’m working and Wednesday I’ve got therapy. My days are gonna be rushed cause they’ve been broken up into chunks. What I should do is take two days off physical tasks and recoup.
When I wake up, I’m so groggy and physically in pain. I am thankful for my body and its ability to work and grow, but also, goddamn it can we tone it down on the endless muscle aches.
oh well.

both my therapist and my spiritualist say I need to write down my thoughts more so here we go again.
happy birthday to me! It’s my 40th. Strangely, I feel more like Im coming back around and waking up.
last night was the first time I’ve cried since being on my new meds. Something isn’t quite right so we’ll have to tweak those. I’m never sure where the balancing point is between living authentically and living comfortably. When the noise is too loud, it’s too much. It’s too much salt, too bright, too loud.
Are the meds, the drugs, just like.. sensory headphones then? When it’s too loud? If only I could be so kind to myself in the assumption.
anywho. Somebody is stirring.
let’s start the day.
