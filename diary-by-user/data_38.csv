Today is January 10, 2001.  It has been almost 15 weeks since my little boy hugged me on Sunday morning (September 24, 2000)at 10 am and went to ride his gocart with his Dad.  He was supposed to be home by 7 pm that night.  He died at 5:19 pm on that afternoon from injuries he received in an accident.  We never got to have dinner and watch the Monty Python movie he told me about that Sunday.  I had just rented it that afternoon.  I had planned to have a movie night in front of the TV with him and his two sisters who were 13 at the time.  They just turned 14 in January.
He was riding his gocart on a barricaded road – closed to through traffic.  Two teenagers in a Camero raced around the barricades and hit my little boy in his gocart.  He died less than 2 hours after the accident.  He was declared brain dead.
I miss him.  He just started 3rd grade in a new school and was doing great!  He loved people and people loved him.  
I am very sad and wish this never happened.  
I want all people to know about gocarts.  I want all teenagers to know how one wrong decision impacted my life and my children’s life.  My oldest son lost his only brother.

Last night I celebrated my twin daughters’ b-day at Chili’s.  They are now 14 – as of 5 Jan 01.  We celebrated at Chili’s last year, too.  They seemed to enjoy this place.  It was different this year without their little brother.  I missed him even though we had a table full of 9 people.  He was so much like me…fun..entertaining….I had to entertain without him.  I missed him throughout the event.  I wonder if anyone else missed him?
The big surprise for the night was the birthday cards.  I gave each of my girls a b-day card.  I am sure they were looking and hoping for $, but it was a better surprise—-tickets to the Backstreet Boys concert next month in Denver.  It was a Kodak moment to see their faces.  I told them it was from me and their younger brother – “J” – who always wanted to do things to make them happy and surprise them.  “J” was with us in spirit, last night.
The dinner came to an end and we came home.  I let them each invite a friend over to dinner and overnight for a sleepover.  I never really cared much for sleepovers, but I am trying to be “normal” and let them be teenagers despite the sadness and emptiness I have since “J” was taken from us on his gocart on September 24.
On September 23 “J” wanted his friend to sleepover.  At first I was against it, but I decided to let him have overnight company.  When I look back on that night – he did have a blast.  “J” and his friend pestered my kitten to no end!  He spit cheetos at my kitten!  He was so much fun….I sure miss having a 9 y/o boy in the house.  Little did I know that would be his last night with us….

Today I made my first big grocery trip since “J”‘s accident.  He was always my shopping buddy.  I had a terrible time going to the store after his accident.  It made me very sad and shaky…I do not talk to anyone in the store anymore – part of my life changing personality.
My daughter “B” went with me.  It was nice to shop and visit with her.  We talked about “J” and her Dad.  We shopped for about an hour and a half then checked out and left.  It was so much easier to shop with someone with time, I think things get easier, but just remember to all my readers – I WILL NEVER BE THE SAME.  IT IS A BIG FRONT THAT YOU ARE SEEING.  I MISS MY SON SOOOOO MUCH.

I went to visit “J” yesterday.  I stayed about an hour and a half.  I noticed some people visiting their loved ones, too.
I spoke to an elderly guy whose wife is buried next to “J”.  She died in 1998.  He was a sad guy.  He missed his wife dearly.  He told me what a good woman she was and how she had given him four great kids.  
He said it is sad when a loved one leaves us.  I looked at him and told him I missed my 9 y/o and wished we could have left together.  I am sad to be left behind….
Then I sat on a rock  in the distance and watched people come and go….I wonder if people watch me, too….
My daughter “R” told me she and her sister “B” and their Dad (my ex) went to visit “J” on Saturday – 6 Jan 01.  They all cried.  It hurt them to see their Daddy cry.
“R” told me that her Dad threw away a pair of “J”‘s pants that he found.  I was so hurt – it is like throwing away “J” to me……
Why does he throw away our son’s stuff? 
I have “J”‘s room – all his belongings are still there.  It’s like I know he will soon be home.
I miss him soooooo much.  Pleae send me a sign “J” that you are happy and that you enjoyed riding your gocart that day and that you went to sleep and did not feel any pain when that boy hit you.
I have to deal with an attorney “J”.  Guide me to do the right thing.  Money never made an impression with us – we want you back, son.  I am now crying and have to go.  I love you son and miss you so much.  16 weeks is a long time to leave your mommy…….

Today there was alot of snow!  I must have had at least 6 inches on my van!
I thought about how much “J” loved the snow.  Today school was cancelled, too;  “J” would have loved today for this reason alone!  He loved the snow and he loved snow days away from school.  School was not really his place of enjoyment, but he did his best.
I am thinking about you “J” – it has been snowing all day.  I am at work – work wasn’t cancelled – is it ever?  I love you and miss you …..

When there is a death of a child, it seems like kids understand better than the adults.  I have had alot of grown ups say inappropriate things….but never a child.  Jake’s friends just seem to miss him so much…like me.  One of his friends wrote him a letter and brought it to his funeral.  Here is his letter.  This was written by a 9 y/o buddy of Jake’s.
Dear Jake,
I hope you have a good time in heaven.  I remember lots of funny things we did, like when we always used to get in trouble.  I liked your jokes alot and how strong you were.  You were very smart to me.  We used to fight alot, but we were still best friends though.  I remember when we always talked together about the book, “Captain Underpants”.  Those were funny books.
You would always make me laugh by making up those funny jokes with me.  I always admired your kindness and your helpfulness.  You always were really fast and you should be a good armwrestler up in heaven.  I remember when we always use to listen to your CD’s, they were really cool.
You were always a Dare Devil on the playground at school.
From your friend!  TS

I read a quote that describes my feelings for my son:
“We cry because we miss him and we laugh because we knew him.”  
9 years, 10 months, and 10 days we experienced you being a physical part of our lives…now you will remain 4ever in our hearts…oh to just hear you laugh again….hug you again, tell you “I love you” again……I will never forget your last hug on September 24, 2000 and your last “I love you, Mom”…..

My daughter is very smart and creative.  When she lost her little brother so suddenly on September 24, 2000 – she wrote this for him.  It is also inscribed on his monument.  She was 13 when she wrote this…
“Goodbye”
Everything that I do,
I always think of you,
And it makes me cry, 
That I didn’t get to say good bye,
But you are up with god now,
And I will make it some how, 
I think that is is so wrong.
That , at nine, you are gone,
Sometimes I get so angry,
Thinking how could this be,
Then I think of those you have touched,
And it makes me miss you so much,
The tears and pain are endless,
But now you will finally rest,
I don’t think I can let you go,
This a pain that I don’t even know,
I am trying so hard to understand,
Hoping some day I can hold your hand,
You are thought of night and day,
This pain just won’t go away,
I can’t help but to cry,
I just want to know why,
They took you instead of me,
I just will never understand and see,
You will never leave our hearts,
Even as you join the stars, 
So I will say it as I cry,
I’ll miss you and good bye.

Jake, it has been 18+ weeks.  I keep thinking I will wake up from this nightmare and you will be eating breakfast with me early each morning.  Since you left, nobody visits with me in the morning.  The girls still sleep in til almost time for school.
I watched “So You Want to Be a Millionare” for the first time since you left, it brought back memories of you and me snuggled on the couch trying to guess all the right answers so I could quit working someday.  I looked really hard beside me – trying to see you.  Please come visit me, Jake.  I need to see you again.  I miss you.
Do you see us when you look down from the beautiful heavens?  I am sorry I am crying so much, but I miss you.
I wish we could email you – your email box would be overflowing.  I bet we would crash your system. I wish heaven had a toll-free number – heck whether it was toll free or not, I would be ringing you up!
I am going to try and not think about you tonite in my sleep so maybe you could visit me by surprise.  Try to lift me up and take me with you – I have lost alot of weight since you left!  I think I would be light enough for you to pick up.
Good night, Jake.  I love you and miss you.

I know your name, birthday, and where you live.  I know your phone number.  I know this because it was on the accident report.
I sometimes want to call and tell you how I feel, but I know you must be feeling very bad, too.  The detective told me that your friend in the car told you to take that shortcut to work and go around the barricades.
I cannot imagine how it feels to have been showing out with a friend on a closed road.  I cannot imagine how it feels to know you killed someone when you were only 16.
I do know how it feels to bury a little boy…my son.  I have an empty bedroom with all his belongings.  A bike that has not been ridden since September 23, 2000.  His skateboard sits idle in his room.  His golf clubs and golf balls are sitting idle, too.  His Sega still has the game he was playing the night before his accident..Men of Honor.
His older brother is very sad and his two sisters miss him, too.
He and I just went back to school shopping all day on September 23.  He wore these clothes once…just to try them on.  He never got a chance to wear them to school.  He wore one outfit to heaven…..
Please do not make another bad decision to speed around barricades on a closed road.
I know you must hurt, but can you hurt more than me?

Tonight I decided to cook chili.  I was cooking when my daughter came into the kitchen and said, “What are we having for dinner?  It smells sooooo good!”  
I haven’t heard something like this since Jake left.  He was always so appreciative when I was cooking.  He was such a wonderful eater and gratious person.
Needless to say – – – supper was nice tonite.  My girls and I sat at the kitchen table and talked like “old hens”.  I let them have 3 friends over for a sleepover last night – can you imagine – 5 14 y/o girls in my house!  Talk about raging hormones!
I spent the afternoon with a good friend from the past.  We have not been in touch for over 5 years, but she knew me when Jake was less than 2 y/o.  She was good for me.  She made me feel good about Jake and heaven.  
I told her we need to stay in touch.  We cannot grow apart again.  It is so sad to know Jake left and my old friend and I met at his funeral.  
Anyway, today was a better day.  I went to Church and visited with Jake in the cemetary 3 times – once on Saturday and twice today.  
I don’t know why I go there – he is 4 ever in my heart.  Maybe because it is so peaceful there and the phone doesn’t ring….who knows.
Does God have a party line?  I wonder when all of us that are left behind – visit with our loved ones all at once at the cemetary – do we all get heard?  Does anyone override anyone else?  I wonder….about alot of things.

This is the speech my 13 y/o daughter gave at her brother’s funeral…
There are so many unsaid things, Jake.  It’s so sad that you had to leave us so early.  You had your whole life ahead of you.  The last time most of us saw you, you were smiling; happy and healthy.  We will all miss you so much.  Some of us are angry and some in disbelief, but we will never forget you.  You will never leave us, you’ll always be deep in hearts and we always will think of you.  There are so many meories to remember, but there should be more.  Jake we love you so unbelievably much.  Even though we have said things in the past that were mean or harsh we will miss you.  We pray that god will take you in his arms and explain things.  There is a new star in the sky.  Also an angel watching over us.  An angel with firey-red hair and dancing brown eyes.  With a smile that made others, happy or sad, smile.  You’ll be with us always and us with you forever.  We will remember the good times and the bad.  We love and miss you so dearly.

The week before his accident, Jake shared with me about a girl.  He said, “Mom, I think this girl at school likes me.”  I smiled at him and asked him why and he said, “She rubs my back when I am in the lunch line and my back doesn’t even itch.”
How cute he was.  How cute he will always be remembered.  
How many other people knew about Jake and this special little friend in his new school.
Dakota is her name.
To all my readers, I am not too good about writing in here every day like most of yall are, but I am trying so hard to keep all my memories alive and share them with you.
I miss Jake so much.  After reading about him, do you understand, too?

I attended a Hurting Moms support group in December and a nice person shard this poem with all of us:
There Is No Word
They call a man a widower,
When he has lost his wife.
The woman is a widow,
When her man does lose his life.
An orphan is the word,
Perhaps for most of us one day.
For it is normal – losing,
Mom & Dad along the way.
But you can look both high and low,
And then look far and wide,
And never find a word for one,
Who’s had a child who died.

Valentines Day is coming up on Wednesday and I wanted to write about it before I forget.  Valentines Day doesn’t mean much for me since I have been divorced almost 5 years.  I usually try to pick up something for the kids.  I remember something cute about Jake that I would like to share….
About 2 years ago – he was about 7, we were in the grocery store.  Of course, he found the “holiday aisle” filled with all the goodies.  He picked out a chocolate something – my daughter says it was a chocolate LOVE car, and he wanted me to get it for him so he could give it to his girlfriend at school.  I thought it was so cute of him to have a girlfriend.  So we bought it and I put it in the freezer overnight.
The next day – Valentines Day – I gave it to him and he put it in his backpack.  I remember how sweet he looked when he went off to school.  Well, after school that day, when I came home from work, I couldn’t wait to ask him about the day!
So I said,”How was your day, Jake?”  He said, “It was ok.”  I asked him what Felicia (his girlfriend) thought about the surprise.  I asked him if she liked it.  He said, “I didn’t give it to her.”  I said, “Why?”  He said, “I ate it!”  I said, “Jake! That was for her NOT you!”  He said, “I know, Mom, but I got hungry and ate it for my snack!  But it’s ok.”
He was such a little charmer.
I miss him.
I went to the cemetary today to visit with him.  Someone had came by and brought him flowers and a helium balloon with a Valentines Day card attached.  It was signed “Amy D”.  It put a warm feeling in my heart on this chilly day to know someone else was thinking of my little charmer.
I miss you, Jake.  Not a day goes by that I don’t think of you.  I still think it is all a mistake and you will be home, son.  I guess you are “Home”.  Thanks for the 9 year visit – my little Angel.

15,https://www.opendiary.com/m/j8xmom/meditating-5-5367919/,2001-02-11,Meditating,"
I was reading a book called Blessings From the Other Side and I came across something in my reading that reminded me of Jake….meditating.  Just the words described Jake so well when he would pretend to meditate,…”And you can form little Os with your thumbs and forefingers if you want,….”.  Jake learned this somewhere – who knows where – probably watching his sisters do something like this with their friends.  Anyway, he used to love to take a shower and get dressed and come upstairs and sit in the livingroom floor and assume that “Lotus” position (not the spreadsheet program!) and form little Os (Ohs) with his thumbs and middle fingers and hum!  He sounded like a big bumblebee!  I would look down at him and ask him what he was doing and he would say, “Meditating, Mom.  Do you know what that means?”  And I would smile and say, “Yes, Jake, I do.  Do you?!”  He would laugh and continue to meditate and I would leave him alone.
Boy I miss that guy!  Is it really real?  Is he really gone?  Why?…….What did we do to deserve this pain?  
Did I tell you readers that the teenager that hit Jake was not charged?  How can you take away the life of a beautiful red headed little boy and not be charged?  This teenager was going 55mph on a closed road and hit my little boy – my baby – my kids’ youngest sibling – my oldest son’s only brother….
Well, it doesn’t seem right to me or my kids.  I think I will go sit in my bed and meditate…..I LOVE YOU JAKE!  It has been 20 weeks since the accident occurred.  It hurts!

Sigh!  Is it really forever that Jake is absent from my current life on Earth?!  I can’t believe it!  I am making myself sad – so I better take some meds and get ready for bed…

I received this on email and a meditation and wanted to share it with you.  It is not authored by me – it was sent by Wilma U. Masignon
Please Tell Me My Angel’s Name
Once upon a time there was a child ready to be born.  The child asked God, “They tell me you are sending me to Earth tomorrow, but how am I going to live there being so small and helpless?”
God replied, “Among the many angels, I chose one for you.  Your angel will be waiting for you and will take care of you.”
The child further inquired, “But tell me, here in Heaven I don’t have to do anything but sing and smile to be happy.”
God said,  “Your angel will sing for you and will also smile for you everyday.  Andy you will feel your angel’s love and be very happy.”
Again the child asked, “And how am I going to be able to understand when people talk to me if I don’t know the language?”
God said, “Your angel will tell you the most beauriful and sweet words you will ever hear, and with much patience and care, you angel will teach you how to speak.”
“And what am I going to do when I want to talk to you?”, the child asked God.
God said, “Your angel will place your hands together and will teach you how to pray.”
“I’ve heard that on Earth there are bad mean.  Who will protect me?”, asked the child.
God said, “Your angel will defend you even if it means risking life.”
“But I will always be sad because I will not see you anymore,” said the child.
God said, “Your angel will always talk to you about me and will teach you the way to come back to me, even though I will always be next to you.”
At that moment there was much peace in Heaven, but voices from Earth could be heard and the child hurriedly asked, “God, if I am to leave now, please tell me my angel’s name.”
“Her name is not important,.  You will simply call her Mom.”

18,https://www.opendiary.com/m/j8xmom/the-milkman-5367922/,2001-02-14,The Milkman,"
Once upon a time – at least 2 years ago, Jake asked me what I was going to do when he and his two sisters grew up and moved out.  He wanted to know what I was going to do with my house.  I told him that I was going to sell it and live in a nursing home.
He told me, “No way, Mom.  I am going to grow up, get married, get avorced (meaning divorced) and live with you….just like Uncle Bob does….he lives with Granny.”  I remember smiling at him and saying, “No Jake!  I have to go to a Nursing Home – they do not allow kids.  I need a break!”  …and we laughed together..and hugged each other that night.  
Boy, I miss him, readers.  
I had a terrible Valentines Day.  I took a huge helium filled ballon out to the cemetary for Jake.  It said “I Love You”.  I signed it with a permanent marker – “Love, Mom” and drew a sad face.  I wrote “20 weeks + 3 days is a long time without you, Son.  4-Ever Loved.”
I was sad when I left the cemetary.  I came home and made a delicious spaghetti dinner for me and the girls.  
Wednesday morning, I cried at work.
Sometimes I sleep fitfully and sometimes I wake so rested.  Still, I go downstairs to his room to see if I am still living a nightmare…hoping it has ended and I can pinch his toes and tell him to come up and eat oatmeal with me.
Oh no, I am making myself cry again.  Time for another happy pill.
You can email me at minus1son@aol.com
Thanks for all your notes.  I may seem strong, but I am hurting so deep – deeper than the ocean depths…tears more wet than a hurricane coming through…an emptiness that cannot never be filled.  Sometimes I want to just give up and “catch the bus” to heaven to be with Jake.  
There is just too much unfinished business though.  I still need to pay the milkman  – I forgot to leave him a check on Monday night.  If I died tonite – who would pay the milkman?

19,https://www.opendiary.com/m/j8xmom/missing-goldfish-5367923/,2001-02-15,Missing Goldfish,"
I remember when Jake was about less than 3 years old and the goldfish disappeared.
My girls were about 6 y/o and we all went to the State Fair.  The girls won goldfish at some event.  We took them home and put them in a fishbowl.
Well one day when the girls were at school and it was just Jake and me at home – my oldest son was about 14 and in school, too – the goldfish were MIA – Missing In Action.
I was in a panic!  The girls LOVED those fish!  Where were those missing fish?  They did not jump out of the bowl.  They were not lying on the floor or stuck to the ceiling…they just disappeared!
As I was racking my brain trying to figure this out, Jake was playing in the house riding his Big Wheel.  As he was riding past me – I was on my hands and knees looking through the shag carpet to see if I could find the fish – I asked him, “Jake, have you seen the fish?  They are not in their bowl?  The girls will be sad when they come home and the fish are missing.  Do you know where they are?”  He stopped his Big Wheel, looked at my concerned face and got off his Big Wheel.  He walked to the back of his Big Wheel and reached in the back compartment and grabbed the two half dried – half dead gold fish and said, “Here! Fish went ride!”
Wow!  I immediately put them back in the bowl – they didn’t last much longer after that day.  I guess that Big Wheel Ride was too much!

Who is this guy?  He was born on May 14, 1991.  He weighed 7lbs and 11oz.  He was a good baby and grew into a wonderful young boy.
His favorite color was green, but his favorite truck was a RED Dodge Ram – one of those big trucks.  If I ever decide to buy a truck, I will buy a red Dodge Ram because that is what Jake always wanted.  His Dad bought a Ford F-250 and he and Jake always bantered back and forth…
He loved to skateboard and ride his bike.  
He loved to watch WWF wrestling on TV.  The Friday before his accident, a co-worker had planned to get some guys together to take Jake to see WWF either at the World Arena or in Denver.  It was going to be a big surprise for Jake.  The guy that planned it with me, came to my door less than 24 hours after the accident to hold my tired, tear soaked body in his arms.  I just looked at him and said, “Well, I guess he doesn’t get to see WWF…”
He really wanted to have one of those hot new scooters that everyone has these days.  I was going to get him one either for Christmas or his next birthday.  He also wanted a new bike with those “pegs” on the back so he could do “tricks”.  Everytime I see one of those bikes or scooters, I think of my son.  Maybe someone in Heaven has one and will let Jake try it out – you do have to share in Heaven, right?
He loved all those things that little boys like.  He wanted to go see the Monster trucks when they were in the area.  So I bought tickets and asked my ex if he could take Jake, but he didn’t feel up to taking him.  So I took Jake and became a big Monster truck fan, too!  I think little boys should do these kind of things with their Dad, but since his Dad was busy – I did it with him and I DO NOT REGRET IT!  Jake was 5 when we saw the Monster trucks together.
I took him to an NSYNC concert in August 1999.  I think my ears have finally recovered from all the screaming fans.
I took him skiing for his first time in March 2000.  He took to the slopes like white on rice.  We had a blast.
I did alot of firsts with that little guy.  I have no regrets.  I JUST MISS HIM SOOOOOO MUCH IT BREAKS MY HEART AND MY HEART IS NOW BEYOND REPAIR.
I rode his go-cart – another first – when he asked me to on September 16, 2000.  He said, “You looked soooo cooool, Mom!”  I smiled and said, “Thanks, Jake, but old middle-aged Moms shouldn’t be riding these things – they shake me up too much on the dirt mounds.  I bet I lost 10lbs on that go-cart ride – shook it all off me!”  He just laughed and climbed into his go-cart to take his turn.  I took pictures of him. Two of my favorite pictures were taken that weekend.
How do you post a picture on this OD?  Tell me how or email me at minus1son@aol.com and I will share his picture with you.
Other things, he liked:  eating oatmeal with me in the mornings, watching “So You Want To Be a Millionaire”, KidRock CDs, washing cars, washing his go-cart, Taco Bell, McDonalds, reading Captain Underpants books, brownies.  
One thing he loved?  His family!
One thing I wish?  That he didn’t leave us behind.
One thing to remember?  Life is too short not to hug and tell your children “I love you” each day.  I always did and Jake knew we loved him.  We had our final hug at 10am on September 24, 2000; we just did not know it was going to be the last one.  I told him good-bye that night around 11pm when I left the hospital.  He actually died at 5:19pm that afternoon (less than 2 hours after the teenager hit him) and I didn’t know about it til about an hour afterwards…when his Dad left messages on my phone to call the hospital and come right away.  I reached his Dad on my cell phone enroute to the hospital just after 6pm that evening and told him I was on my way.  I said, “We are coming. How’s Jake doing?”  He paused on the other end and said, “He’s dead.”
One thing that is hard for me to do each day?  Live without him.
One thing I need?  More kleenex…see you all soon.

I remember when my husband had our dog put to sleep.  The dog had been ill and old.  I did not know anything about it til after dinner that night.  I had fixed a big plate of scraps for our dog – Bear.  Jake was close to 3 years old, I reckon.  
Anyway, Jake reached up on the counter into the scrap plate and said, “Bear’s food?”  I said, “Yes, stay out of it;  I just fed you!”  He shook his head side to side and said, “Bear gone gone!”  I looked at him and said, “What?”  He repeated himself.  So I proceeded to look for our dog.  I could not find him.  Jake was standing outside in the back yard at this point and was motioning me to come to him.  He pointed to a large mound of dirt and walked over to it and said, “Bear gone gone.”  Confused, I found my husband and asked him where our dog was.  He said he had him put to sleep.  I asked him why Jake was pointing to the yard – surely he did not bury our dog in the yard!  Well, he did!  I couldn’t believe it!  Anyway, later on friends told me it was illegal to bury animals in the city so I was worried about what would happen if anyone found out…but in time I quite worrying.
Several months passed and I was working in the yard cutting grass and sucking up the leaves with the lawnmower bag and noticed Jake in the distance pointing to the place where Bear was laid to rest.  I saw Jake’s lips moving, but could not hear him over the mower, so I shut off the mower and yelled across to him, “What is it, Jake?”  Jake was sitting on his Big Wheel and was pointing to Bear’s resting place and yelling, “ere’s Bear’s tail.” Alarmed, I looked at him and said, “What?!” Jake repeated himself again.  I thought to myself, oh my goodness, the neighbors are going to hear him.  They will know we buried our dog in the city and arrest us! I could not believe our dog’s tail was sticking out of the ground after this long period of time, so I rushed over there!  I started sifting through the leaves looking furiously for signs of my dog’s tail as Jake rode off on his Big Wheel.  I said, “Where is Bear’s tail, Jake?  Come show mama.”  He just tilted his head back in laughter and said, “Ha! Ha! Made you yook!”  He couldn’t say his letter L back then.  What a memory!

Okay – here it comes – the BSB experience from a middle aged Mom with her twin 14 y/o daughters.  TOTALLY AWESOME!
We headed to Denver around 4pm on Tuesday – hit rush hour traffic – but made it to the Pepsi Center parking lot by 6pm.  The weather was WICKED.  It was cold, foggy, damp, but filled with totally awesome excitement.  We stood in line about 30 minutes (we bought our tickets in December 2000) and the door to the Pepsi Center opened and the screams of the fans was almost deafening!  Actually, the screaming made me think the BSB were right in front of us!  We went in and were totally impressed with the Pepsi Center.  If you ever come to Denver – check it out!  We found our way to Section 116, Row 2, Seats 4,5, and 6 – what GREAT SEATS!  It was just totally AWESOME.  The stage was right there!  
The intro band was a chick named Crystal.  She was great.  She is supposed to have a new CD out soon – “Me and My Piano” – she sounds alot like Mariah Carey – but is more talented (my opinion).  So we listened to her for about 30 minutes and then a guy came out and said one of the BSB would not be there tonite due to the Denver airport closing for foggy conditions.  He offerred refunds to all the Kevin fans.  Then for about 45 minutes we sat and listened to some “oldies” and did the “Wave” around the Pepsi Center – you know where different sections throw up their arms at different times.  It was fun – killed alot of time.  Then that guy comes out at least 2 more times to tell us that Kevin will not be performing with the BSB…then about 8:45pm the music stops, the lights go out, the special effects start taking place and BOOM!..the BSB rise on stage – Nick, AJ, Howie, and Brian!  Lots of screaming again – then the music by the BSB themselves!  IT WAS TOTALLY AWESOME!  Jake would have loved the special effects.  About half way through the show, the lights go out and some BSB music plays while the BSB are being brought closer to us – hidden by security guards – and they take refuge under this large platform directly in front of our section!  Alot of screaming again as fans spot them.  Then the spot light is put on this platform and the BSB rise out of this platform – like Star Trek – Beam them up, Scotty! Yea!  By this time, I am being pushed almost over the railing by the fans behind me!  Well my two girls are waving and acting like typical BSB fans and having a great time.  I get this great view of all of the BSB – Nick and Brian are absolute heartthrobs!  Howie makes direct eye contact with my daughter Becky and he smiles, points at her, and waves.  I thought Becky was going to die and go to heaven with Jake!  It was so cool to see her soooo happy!  
I just loved this concert!  The BSB are coming back to Denver, Colorado in June 2001.  Buy your tickets and come to the Pepsi Center!  
This was truly a night to remember.  The drive home was slow, foggy, icy, and tiring.  We were finally in the house by 12:45am!
Oh…what a night….Jake would have loved it….

Hello.  I just wanted to tell you how Jake recently made me smile.  
I was going outside recently and noticed the evergreen tree by my door was unusually green for winter.  Well, I studied the tree and wondered why one area was green and most of the tree was winter brown.  The closer I got to the branches – LOL – I noticed that Jake had spray painted my tree green!  Like I would never notice – not in his lifetime – literally!  I remember letting him spray paint his toy Ford truck and how I reprimanded him because he did not put newspaper under the toy truck before he painted it.  He got green paint on my stoop by the door.  Now I will never move from this house – Jake has left too many personal memories for his Mom.  I used to hate looking at the paint on my stoop, but now I look at it AND the 4-ever evergreen tree and smile about my mischievious little boy.  I miss him so much but he sure is making me smile by surprise these days.
I love you, Jake!  I love my unique tree, 2!
By the way, my computer is hosed still.  A dear friend thinks this OD is very therapeutic for me so she has loaned me her nice laptop.  Everyone be sure and leave a note for my friend, Phyllis, and tell her thanks for letting me join the OD community once again.

splattered on my newly detail van by some bored kids looking to entertain themselves!  Yep, that is what happened on Sunday night after my oldest son did a splendid job cleaning my Sienna van.  Well, I decided I would take care of that from ever happening again.  I bought me a blow up man to sit in the van and stand guard!  Yessiree, so I went to one of those sex toys stores to buy me a man – yes, I was on a mission for revenge!  So I bought “Butch”.  I asked the lady to blow him up for me so I could put him the van on the way back to work.  She asked me if I wanted the attachment, too?  I kinda looked at her with a puzzled look and said, “No, just the man.”  So she inflated him and then I had to deflate him because it is not legal to walk out of sex toy stores without your items in a bag.  Inflated, Butch, would not fit in a bag so I squeezed his air out and stuffed him in the bag.  Still, I cannot figure out why it was illegal for me to tote Butch out to the van – afterall – he DID NOT have his attachment on.  Anyway, trying to find a place to write a check on that counter was another story.  There was a whole stack of dildos sitting on the counter – I kept pushing them aside so I could put my checkbook on the counter and the stack of them kept falling on me – so I finally picked one up and studied the box and was amazed what that type of toy could for a small price…NO, I DID NOT BUY ONE OF THOSE, too!
Anyway, I put Butch in a bag and put him in the back of the van so I could go back to work.  Yes, he is folded up in the bag still.  I bought him yesterday.  I thought about stopping by the Conoco station to inflate him and see how he rode in the van on the way home, but I was scared he might come detached from the air hose and fly across the busy street and cause havoc – seeing a nude blimp at rush hour could cause problems you know.  So anyway, I still have Butch in his deflated state.  I think I am going to return him and buy one at Spencers novelty store – at least their dolls come wearing a swimsuit and have movable arms and legs – more realistic – and NOT ATTACHMENTS!  I hate paying extra for attachments that you are not going to use anyway – what a waste of money!
So, stay tuned for the latest update on my Mystery Man who will guard my van.
Going in that special store is worth another OD entry ….maybe I will tell yall what you can find in those stores…quite an assortment of…..well…you can imagine!

Well – I have not made it back to the store to return Butch.  I was going to do that today, but we have had snow all day.  I didn’t want to take a chance driving in this weather and have an accident.  Gosh!  What would the cop say about Butch!
I called Spencers – a novelty store – and they have inflatable guys that are nicer – absolutely no attachments –I have yet to look in the box at that additional piece of equipment.  Then again – if it is bored mean male teenagers – maybe having Butch guard the van WITH his attachment “in Hand” – would be enough to deter those vandals!  Tee Hee….
Okay, I must tell you, Butch has been quite the talk at work!  I told those co-workers of mine that they better leave me alone or I will bring Butch in to work!  I kidded a couple ladies this week.  I was standing outside of my office door smiling when two co-workers walked down the hall and said -“What are you smiling about?”  I smiled and pointed in my office and said, “Look – doesn’t Butch look cool sitting in front of my computer!”  They about both broke their necks rushing down the hall to look in my office.  Tee Hee.  He wasn’t there!  R U kidding – I could lose my job with that kind of distraction!
I may try to take him back tomorrow.  I wonder if those stores are open on Sunday.  I have my proof of purchase and I hope they take Butch back.  I hope they don’t offer me an exchange for something else….if they do, what should I get this time….do anyone of you readers have any special requests?  Tee Hee.  Boy, this whole Butch thing has cracked me up…I bet Jake is cracking up to think I want a ballon man to protect my van….

Have any of you heard of this book?  It is a good book.  
When Jake started Kindergarten, I took time off work to take him there for his first day.  His teacher read this book to all her new students.  It is about a raccoon that leaves his Mother and she kisses his hand so that he can always have her kiss.  All the raccoon has to do is put his hand against his cheek and his Mother’s kiss will be with him always.  
When the teacher finished reading this story, she asked all the kids to go to the person who brought them to school and get a “kissing hand”.  Well, I searched out Jake and found him with his arms around his daycare pal – like chums.  I called out to him and said, “Jake, come here.”  He knew I was going to give him a “Kissing Hand” and he just beamed his smile towards me and said, “I’m okay, Mom.  See you later.” And he turned away with his chum beside me.  It broke my heart!  He didn’t need me.  He was a smart and independent young boy at the age of 5 already.  
I sure miss him.  He was truly a unique little guy.  I am so glad I was his Mom for 9 years, 4 months, and 10 days.  I will always be his Mom and he will always be my son.
All you Moms out there who read my OD, if you have kids 5 years old or less – check out this book and think of me and Jake.  It is a good book.  All of you Moms out there that have 9 years olds, give them a hug for me and tell them to send a hug my way – I cannot hug my 9 year old anymore – my last hug with him was on Sept. 24, 2000 at around 10am.  I need a hug…I miss those hugs.

I remember when Jake was about almost 4 months old and I had to register his older brother for Middle School.
It was a hot day in that gym for orientation, but Jake did just fine.  He was a wonderful baby, boy, and now angel. (I miss you, Jake.)
Anyway, I noticed some women staring at me from across the way.  It was obvious they were talking about me.  They sure were spending alot of time staring and pointing in my direction.  The first thing I did was make sure my zipper wasn’t unzipped or something amusing like that! But, I was fine – they just found me interesting, I reckon.
Well, when the time came to leave that terribly hot sweaty gym, I proceeded to work my way through the crowd with my oldest son who was 12 and Jake who was about 4.5  months old.  I was manuevering the stroller so carefully to avoid hitting people.  Then – there they were – those 2 women!  They were walking towards me and it was obvious they wanted to chat.  So I stopped walking.  
Then the one lady asked, “We were just wondering if both these boys are yours?”  I smiled and said, “Yes.  This is my son Joe.  He is 12 and will be starting Middle School this year.  And this is his little brother, Jake.  He is 4 months old.”
They just looked puzzled as they stared at both my kids.  Then one commented that there was quite an age difference.  I just smiled and said, “Yes.  They are 12 years apart.  Don’t trust the shelf-life on those Trojans.”  Then I quietly walked away.  
I am sure they were shocked and confused!
I did not feel obligated to offer to them that I had twin girls that were 4 y/o, too.
Of course, I had my 12 y/o son asking me, “What are Trojans, Mom?”  I just smiled and told him they are something we would talk about later when the time was right.
For those that want to know – Trojans are condoms.   Get it?  Condoms….2 boys…1 is 12 and one is 4 months…shelf-life….

Just thought I would share with you about Jake’s academic success.
He was a young 5 year old when he started Kindergarten.  His teacher thought he should repeat Kindergarten and mature a little more, but Jake’s Dad (we have been divorced since Jake was 3) did not want to hold Jake back.  So he went on to first grade and struggled – the same with 2nd and 3rd grade.  Well, I decided to hold Jake back in 3rd grade and move him to another school so he would have a fresh start – new teachers, new pals, new environment to start over.  His other teachers talked about Jake amongst themselves and I just thought Jake needed to start fresh – September 5, 2000 was Jake’s first day back to school in 3rd grade again. 
He LOVED his new school!  He volunteered to serve food in the lunch room and loved wearing his little white cook’s hat – made of paper.  He loved his teacher with “white hair” and he was amazed that his principal was a “girl”!  Actually, the principal was a woman, but to Jake that was “cool” to have “girl” for a principal.  All through Kindergarten up to 3rd grade at his other school – the principal was a man.  So this was a new exciting experience for my little red-headed boy!
He brought home his schoolwork on September 15 in his backpack and was so excited to show me all his great grades!  Lots of positive notes on his school work and happy faces.  I was so proud of him.
The last time I saw his schoolwork was on September 22, 2000.  He brought home his new Friday folder filled with great papers and new artwork.  I remember looking at his schoolwork after dinner that Friday at the kitchen table.  He said, “Look, Mom!  I have good papers!  I am not dumb like people think I am.”  I just hugged that little guy so tight and told him, “Jake, you are not dumb.  People never thought that about you.  You just needed to be with kids that learned at the same speed as you.  Don’t ever think you are dumb!  You are a smart little boy.”
You know readers, all I wanted for Jake was to feel like a success in school and he was.  He left me in his gocart to heaven – and arrived as a very successful 9 y/o in 3rd grade.  And I miss him….. 
I can’t believe I am crying and taking an anti-depressant.  But it is okay – I cry because I miss him and that means I will never forget him.  I am still his Mom and very proud of him.

A few weeks ago, the leader in our Church fellowhip group asked us to introduce ourselves to the person sitting next to us and share with them a good choice we made in our life.
I do not remember the lady’s name next to me or her choice, but I do remember what I shared with her.
I told her that 2 years ago my little boy was struggling very hard in school and I made the choice to choose him over my full-time job.  I went to my boss and went part-time due to Jake’s school problems.  I gave up alot for a good reason.
I started working after I dropped Jake off to school each morning at 8:45am and I returned home before 4pm to meet him (and my daughters).  Jake was in 2nd grade at the time.
Every morning for 6 months, I sat at the table and did spelling words and other homework with him.  I remember how he used to not try to spell the “challenge” words and I encouraged him to at least try.  He tried so hard and did so well!  His eyes lit up when he told me he made 100% on his spelling.  All it took was a little more “Mommy” time everyday to see my little boy succeed in school.
His grades made a steady rise and his self-esteem grew in leaps and bounds.
I loved dropping him off each morning and seeing him blow me kisses as he ran over the hill to play with his pals.
Yes, I put my little boy’s needs before my job and that was a good choice.  When I did this 2 years ago, I never knew that Jake would be leaving me so soon.  This 6 months that I enjoyed with Jake will always be cherished.
To all you readers, life is too short to not take the time to enjoy it.  
Thank-you God for helping me make the decision to do this 2 years ago.  This is a choice I made that will NEVER be 4 gotten.
Jake – you did well on the “challenge” words.  Without you, everyday is a challenge.  I miss you, son.  I miss you more today than I did yesterday…but less than I will miss you tommorrow.  Missing you is what I do best, Jake.

Well, I am sorry that I do not write everyday.  I cannot think of enough interesting things to share with you and I do not want to bore you.  
I started this OD to talk about Jake and remember him because nobody really talks about him at home.  Maybe its because his brother and sisters do not want to make me sad, but talking about Jake makes me happy.
I have started receiving emails from teenagers that my OD has touched.  I would like to tell all you teenagers that I am moved that you write me.  Being a teenager is so hard these days – I have two of my own you know….
I want all you teenagers to know that life does get better later – teenage years are just full of difficulties.  You will be fine…trust me.  Your parents love you very much and they struggle with you – trust me.  I have been there and done that…
I used to think the hardest thing in the world was geometry…until Jake was taken from me.  It is probably the hardest thing I have endured.  I had my first son when I was 20 and not married.  That was hard, but I did finish college and took a commission into the United States Air Force and spent over 10 years in the military.  While I was in, I married a guy and we had 3 more children – the twins and Jake.  Then I decided to leave the military to stay home with my family.  I gave it all up – everything that I worked for – to be with my 4 kids while their Dad went remote.  He came home after a year and we were divorced soon after.  Then I was a single parent again with 4 kids…they were 3, 7, 7, and 15.  Now that was a challenge —let me tell you!
So there you have it – single parent for 6 years at the age of 20, marriage, more kids, divorce, and single parent again!
That stuff is nothing compared to losing Jake.  He was my baby.  He looked like me and joked like me.  He loved people and people loved him.  He was me made over again and he had a big heart….and now he has gone ahead of the rest of us and I miss him.  Prozac helps, but it still hurts.  His older brother told me that Jake had all my characteristics…when Jake left…a large part of me left…and I know if I have made it through these trying times….you teenagers will, too.  Keep writing me and I will keep encouraging you.  Life is way too short to not enjoy everyday.
I don’t let anything stress me anymore because life is truly too short to sweat the small stuff.
Now, I have made myself cry..so I must leave.
I love you all and I am glad you read my OD.

So I took my Chesapeake Bay Retriever to the store with me one day several years ago – he is in Heaven with Jake now.  He passed on in 1994 – the dog.  
Anyway, we pulled into the Safeway parking lot and my dog, Bear, got a bit particular with this woman walking past my old 67 Ford (POS – Piece of S___t) truck.  So he leaned over the edge and starting yiping at her with his ugly teeth and terribly bad breathe.  She was so alarmed she jumped back and hit her head on the side of a van parked beside me.  Of course this ticked her off to no end and she proceeded to scream at me using that F word more times than I cared to count.  She told me she liked dogs and dogs should be put on a leash….blah…blah.!She told me she could tell he was Registered (and he was) …blah…blah….you should put a leash on him!
She said he was dangerous…blah…blah…blah…
Well, by this time, we had drawn quite the crowd in the parking lot at Safeway and her husband appeared.  He tried to take her in the store and quiet her down, but she kept screaming at me and my dog and the leash thing and using the F word.  Well, I really never got a chance to say anything until she paused towards the end there.  Her husband put his arm around her and tried to lead her away and I finally got to put my two cents in…I said, “You should put a leash on her when you take her out in public.”  She lunged at me and I knew it was going to be bad, but thank goodness her husband took her in the store.  Now, that was a close call!
Of course, I still had to go in the store, too, so she continued to follow me around, point her fingers, and talk loudly with the F word…but I bought what I needed and drove my dog home.
Boy – when I got home I gave my husband a piece of my mind about his dog!

….One night after dinner, after I had cleaned up the kitchen…I had to make a pit stop and noticed the door was closed.  I thought….hmmmmmmm Jake is sure quiet in there….I hope he is okay…….I slowly opened the door and there was not any sound, but the shower curtain was closed.   I pulled the curtain slowly to peek in the tub and there he was naked lying under the water….no motion!  I screamed and jerked him up from underneath the water and screamed, “JAKE!”.  He slowly opened his eyes and said, “Awww Mom….I was up to 52….I was holding my breathe and counting….now I have to start all over.”  I was so shaken, I just sat on the toilet with tears running down my cheeks saying, “Jake, please don’t ever do that to me again.  You scared me!”  He just giggled and said, “Why, Mom?  Did you think I was dead?”  I just hugged his wet little body and kept shaking.
About the pit stop – I lost the urge!  He almost scared it out of me!
It’s odd – I thought about that story when I saw him at his funeral.  I couldn’t even reach in to hug him – I am too short – around 5 feet – and his casket was up too high.  Things that get in the way for short people….
I sure miss him.  Jake, you left too soon.  You were only 9 y/o buddy:(  
It has been a lonely weekend without any kids – the girls are with their Dad til Wedenesday night.

I remember when I was in the delivery room trying to birth the twins……January 1987 – this day will live in my memory 4ever!
I was having extreme back pain and the medic (we were in a military hospital – Army at that!  It was almost like a real M*A*S*H episode!) came by and told my husband if I needed any pain medication to let him know.  Well, my husband volunteered to the medic that everything was just fine.  (Isn’t like a man to make decisions about things they do not really have a clue about…)  Anyway  I was having such intense pain and breathing so hard that I did not quite hear what the medic said so I asked my husband what he said.  He said, “He asked me if you needed any pain medication and I told him no.”  I told my husband, in a not too pleasant tone, to tell that medic to come back and give me something.  So the medic returns and I tell him I want something because my back is killing me.  
So the medic – who I found out was called a Corpsman in the Army – proceeded to try to give me something in my IV.  I think he was just a beginner in the delivery room and I think he was nervous.  Picture this…I am in excruciating pain and his shaky arms are trying to inject something into the IV line above my head.  I am about passed out and all I can see is that the IV bag of fluid is shaking on the hook about 2 feet over my head and is about to come off and this medic is totally clueless!  Then it happens…!  The IV bag falls off the hook and lands on my head —kerplunk!  Luckily this happened between contractions….and I was able to speak.  I picked up the IV bag and told the startled Corpsman…”Hey!  I am in alot of pain still so you have to throw this at me a little harder to knock me out!”  The scared Corpsman just looked at me in surprise and started apologizing….
This is a delivery in a typical Army hospital.  I was active duty in the Air Force as a Captain when I had this enlightening experience…never again!
Anyway..after like 12+ hours of labor and one of the twins getting “stuck enroute”, I had an emergency C-section.  They were fine ….both were just a bit over 5lbs each.  
The pain killer incident came in the early stages of my labor.  The entire delivery staff left me alone at one point so they could eat pizza!  Yep, they left me on that cold stainless steel delivery table to go eat.  I remember begging a volunteer Red Cross lady to get me a warm blanket because I was freezing.  When the delivery staff returned, the doctor asked me if I was ready to have these babies.  I just looked at him and bit my tongue…I so much wanted to say, “Hey, buddy – that is why you get paid the big bucks for…to know how to answer that stupid question!”…but I didn’t.
The morale of this story….don’t ever ask for pain killer in the delivery room at an Army hospital.  Also, if you have a choice – do not go to an Army hospital to have a baby…go to a civilian hospital or Air Force hospital….Jake was born at the Air Force Academy Hospital….he is another story….

People have all kinds of priorities.  Sometimes I think people have their priorities in the wrong ranked order.  
Kids.  Kids are a priority.
If anyone out there in OD land has children, you should make them a priority.  Let them come first when it is necessary and you will know when it is necessary.
For instance, one time Jake’s babysitter called me at 6am in the morning and said she was taking a “personal day” off and not keeping any kids.  How about that?  No notice…just a phone call.
Well, that day I decided to stop stressing about work and other things that are not important.  I decided to take the day off, too.
Jake and I had a wonderful day.  He rode his bike up to Big O Tire and I asked one of the guys there if he could put some air in his tire.  And he did.  From Big O, we continued our morning walk and went to Block Buster to turn in some videos and stopped by Cub Foods to get some cash out of the ATM machine.  Then we stopped by Village Inn and had a nice breakfast together…just the two of us…it was a great day and it was just beginning.  He loved sausage so I gave him mine, too.  He drank juice and ate all his breakfast.  Then we started our long journey home.
Jake had such a great morning that he told me, “Hey Mom, I wish everyday was like today, don’t you?”  I just smiled and kept walking behind him as he rode his bike down the sidewalk all the way home.
Yes, the good old days when Moms stayed home and the Dad worked is so rare today.  Of course, as a single parent, I have to work, but I never regretted taking that day off with Jake.
There will always be jobs, but you only raise your kids once.  Little did I know that Jake’s life would be cut so short.
I love you, Jake and I miss you everyday.
All you stay at home Moms – take pride in your job.  Your job is priceless.  My hat goes off to you.
I took yesterday off with my girls.  We had a great day.  It was a surprise to them to wake up and find Mom home.  We went out to lunch and did some Spring clothes shopping.  Renee treated us all to Italian sodas!  It was fun.

I wonder if a person senses or knows that their time on Earth is about to come to an end?
I learned from my nephew that Jake asked him about Heaven this past summer.  It was June 2000 and Jake was visiting my family in GA and he asked his cousin, “Jack, what do you think Heaven is like?”  Jack shared this moment with me in December…Christmas Eve 2000.  I asked him what he answered to Jake and he said, “I told him I think it is whatever you want it to be.  You skateboard and worship all day.  You play golf and worship all day.”  Jake loved his skateboard and just got into playing golf.  
I was so surprised when Jack shared this story with me.  Jack is Jake’s 14 y/o cousin.  Jake and Jack argued alot this summer, but they both enjoyed each other, too, I think.
Then, just yesterday, the girls told me Jake wanted to be an organ donor.  Jake was an organ donor.  I just thought donating his organs was the right thing to do.  I was surprised that I did the right thing for Jake when the girls told me an interesting story yesterday.
They told me in July 2000, Jake was watching a show on TV with great interest.  Renee said, “Jake was just studying the show with all his attention.”  It was about a kid that needed bone marrow donated.  Jake apparently told the girls, “Give all my stuff away when I die if you are still alive.  Tell Mom to give all my stuff away if she is still alive.”  
Wow…what a story.  I learn something everyday about Jake from his sisters.
Well, I am still alive, Jake, and I did donate your organs.  I never expected to outlive you.  Some things in life are just out of sequence…leaving before me was waaaaaaaay out of sequence, son.  I miss you and I am glad I did what you would have wanted me to do for you.  I will be an organ donor, too, Jake.  We were so much alike and we continue to be…..
Afterall “Death ends a life…not a relationship” (from the play, I Never Sang For My Father)
I look into the sky everyday and try to see your smiling face and fiery red hair.  I miss your dimples, Jake.  I miss all of you.  Life will never be the same for those you left behind.
Eric Clapton’s song, Tears in Heaven, has taken on a whole new meaning for me now.  I had this played at your funeral and I cry each time I hear it…..

Ok…remember on those job applications where they ask you to check a box and tell them what ethnic background you hail
from?  Well, look at yourself.  Are you really “white”?  Are you really “black”?  What are you…really?
Well, I always checked “other”.  Then I would write in “FWS” for “Foreign White Stock”.  Yep, that is what I am.  I learned this term in a high school Sociology class.
So what is Foreign White Stock…you are wondering.  Well I will tell you in a future OD entry….
April Fools!  I will tell you now.
I am Foreign White Stock because my mother is from the islands and my dad was a “white” man, thus….on Dec. 12 I was born…Foreign White Stock.  
My Mom is from the Philippines and my dad is from the US.  My dad had red hair and beautiful blue happy eyes and lots of freckles.  My Mom is a typical Filipino lady..olive skin, black hair, and black eyes.
Me…I have auburn hair with shades of red (of course my hairdresser only knows for sure), olive skin, a hint of freckles, and brown eyes.  I have my dad’s wonderful Irish sense of humor and my mom’s short height.
Jake was truly a wonderful mix.  He had fiery red hair, lots of freckles, deep dimples, and he loved to laugh and make others laugh.  I miss him…..

41,https://www.opendiary.com/m/j8xmom/why-2372-5367945/,2001-04-01,Why?,"
Why are children so mean and say things with such little thought?  I am not talking about little children;  I mean Middle School age kids….14 y/o kids.
Today my daughters told me a friend of theirs lost their Mom on March 23.  Their friend – K (14 y/o)- and her mother and brother (12 y/o) were enroute to Kentucky to visit K’s dad.  The mother fell asleep at the wheel and flipped the car.  The mother was thrown from the car and was killed.  K was in a seatbelt and uninjured.  Her brother is in critical condition.  K is now in Kentucky with her Dad.  Her parents were divorced and she lived with her Mom.  This is very tragic.  I cannot even imagine how K must be feeling.  
My daughters told me a friend told others that this is worse than losing a brother.
Loss is not measurable.  Loss is tragic…any type.  This comment made my girls sad.  They are sad for K and they are sad for the loss of their own brother.
There is alot of sadness in this world and some people just add to this with comments that are not well thought out before being spoken.
I am sad because I cannot imagine being 14 years old and not having my Mom.  I cannot imagine being my age today and losing my Mom!
I am sad because Jake has gone on ahead of us.  I miss Jake.  I imagine K misses her mother very much.
The child that made the comment about losing a mother versus losing a brother…I am sad that she doesn’t understand the pain she creates with those thoughtless remarks.
Also, about a month after Jake’s funeral, a middle school girl was walking home with my girls and said the only reason my girls had friends is because their brother died.  She told them people feel sorry for them.  That is why they have friends.  This was hard for all of us….
Today was a hard day for me.  Everyday has been hard..
I just don’t know why there is such cruelty in the world…intentional cruelty.
Life is so hard to understand,isn’t it?
Have a good day tomorrow and try to do something nice to someone.  This will offset some of all the bad things that happen in the day.
Good night, my dear readers.

Today a co-worker came to visit with me and to talk about her 9 y/o daughter.  The conversation was enjoyable until it led to Jake’s accident.  She made me sad.  She told me I needed to move on to the next stage of grief.  She told me I cannot waller in this and I have to move on.  She said she didn’t know what to say except..I am so sorry, but things happen….
I cried today at work.  But it is okay, “I cry because I miss him, and I laugh because I knew him.” (Quoted from an unknown source)
I will always miss him…so I will always be sad….gee..it is only Tuesday, too…I still have 3 more days to get through this week at work.
I am sad because I really was never able to grieve for Jake without having to go back to work….
His b-day is next month…May 14.  He would have been 10.  I had planned to get him a Razor scooter…one of the hottest things today with the boys his age.
Remember Jake on his b-day and light a candle for him.  I miss him….

..it just doesn’t seem like my little boy went to Heaven already.  The weather has been warming up here in Colorado and he loved to be outside. I still wonder today – 7 months since his accident – is it really real?  Is Jake really gone and not coming back?  I want so much to think that he is on a long trip.  I want to plan a big surprise when he comes home.  I keep looking forward to the door bursting open and him running up the stairs with his big smile saying “Honey, I’m home!”  I think he heard this on TV or something.  His next line would always be, “I’m hungry.  What are we having for dinner, Mom?”  I am so lost without him, readers.  I don’t feel like a mommy anymore.  I have teenagers, but they are so independent.
More kids are coming out and enjoying their skateboards, bikes, scooter, etc.  I miss Jake.
Jake loved to do “tricks” with his skateboard.  He liked to make it “grind” – whatever that meant.  I always worried he would fall and hit his head and get hurt really bad on his skateboard…but he didn’t.
He loved to ride fast on his bike and slam on the brakes and look “cool”.
He wanted one of those Razor scooters…I planned to get him one for his b-day next month.  Now he won’t be here on May 14th for us to celebrate his 10th b-day.  How will I make it through that day?  Maybe I will take the day off and just remember all the good times we had with Jake.
I just do not understand.  God, please talk to me tonight and bring Jake into my dreams…just once.  Let me hear him say, “Mom” one more time.  Let me hug him really tight and kiss his freckled face one more time.  Let me run my hands through his thick red hair.  Let me tell him one more time, “I love you, Jake.  I miss you so much….”  Please, God?  Amen.
To those teenagers that took Jake from us – do you hurt as much as me?  Is it possible?  Why did you have to drive around those barricades on a closed road?  Why did you have to speed and not see my little boy until it was too late?  You were just 16 – you knew better than to do something like that.  Jake was only 9.  He loved to drive his gocart.  He will never drive a car.  He will never be 16.  He will never date a girl.  He will never sit in his chair at the dinner table….and we will never be the same without him….  
Good night OD land….

I remember when my girls graduated from 5th grade.  It was an exciting day. After all the hoopla we left the gym to get in the car.  Well, there were 2 stretch limos outside.  Some parents went “all out” to celebrate this step from elementary school to middle school.
My girls looked at the limos with envy and said, “Mom, can we go look?  Please?  We were invited to ride by our friends, but then they changed their mind and invited other people.”  Well, I told them, “Sure, go look but don’t touch!”  They raced over there and it was just a Kodak moment.  Those girls wanted so bad to ride in that limo and be a part of all the activity.  So after staring with envy, they came back to me.  They sure wanted to ride in that limo!
Well, I told them, “Hey, guess what?  I don’t have a fancy limo but the Mom-mobile is stopping at McDonalds.  Does anyone want to ride with me?”  There faces lit up and I knew I had scored a brownie point!  So off we were to McDonalds after the 5th grade graduation – not in a limo – but in Mom’s stationwagon….Hey, what can I say.  Single parents have to be spontaneous and creative!

I remember once when my girls were about 1 or 2.  We were shopping in the Base Exchange for Valentines Day cards.  I had them in the shopping cart and told them to sit down in the cart.
Well, I was busy looking for cards and decided to step behind the card rack and look on the other side.
While I was looking at cards, something hit me on the head!  I looked down on the floor to see what it was.  It was an unwrapped TAMPON!  Yes it was.  At about the same time I heard my girls laughing.  I quickly looked into the cart where my girls were and they were having a blast.  They were unwrapping my tampons from my purse and pulling the string and saying, “Firecracker!” and tossing them in the air!  I was so embarrassed!  I looked on the floor all around me and there were several tampons by the feet of the card customers!  I slowly got down on my knees and starting collecting them as quickly as I could.  Can you imagine how embarrassed I was surrounded by all these young GIs shopping for Valentines Cards in the sea of tampons!?
Needless to say, I quickly took my girls out of the store.  4get the cards!

Well,…how does that song go…the weather outside is frightful….
We are having a spring snowstorm.  The snow has blown so hard and horizontally that all our windows are frosted.  I woke up this morning to get ready for work and turned on the TV for the weather report.  There are accidents everywhere so I am staying inside for the moment.  We have endured too much for me to risk another accident.
The highways to Denver are closed – so all those commuters from the Springs get to relax with their families.  Personally, I think people should relax more with their families – not just on the days they cannot get to work.
Cars are apparently blowing around on the icy roads.  It is not worth going outside to drive or just take in the scenary.
I miss Jake.  He would love to be home with us.  I imagine him getting all bundled up in his snowsuit trying to shovel the driveway despite the constant wind and snow that is blowing around.  He loved to be outside til his cheeks were redder than his hair.  When he was outside, weather was oblivious to him.  He lived for the moment.
I slept good last night…with assistance from tylenol’s Simply Sleep.  The blowing storm did not awaken me…like Jake…I was oblivious to the weather..I rested well.  I need to figure out how to rest well more often…this restful sleep every 5 days is wearing me down.
Today, I plan to stay home with the girls.  Their school is closed anyway.  Maybe we will just build a fire and chill in front of the TV.  Maybe I will put a pot roast in the oven to slow cook…maybe we will just enjoy each other’s company..
Maybe I will reappear on OD sometime today to write another funny story about my life.
KweenC wrote an entry recently in her OD and she mentioned Jake and a song about the soul.  Maybe you should go read it.  Maybe…I will read it again.
KweenC – thank you for remembering my little boy.

I hope alot of you 16 year old drivers are reading this.  I have a small favor to ask that will have a LARGE impact on everybody.  
Could you please drive cautiously in memory of my 9 y/o son, Jake?  Could you just remember him each time you get in your car?  
He was driving his gocart on a closed road.  The road was barricaded to through traffic.  On September 24, 2000, two teenagers drove around the barricades in their Camaro and “floored the accelerator”.  They said they did not see Jake.  Jake was innocently driving his gocart in that area that was closed to traffic.  It was Sunday about 3:48pm when the Camero slammed on the brakes and hit Jake.  Jake died at 5:19pm that Sunday – less than 2 hours after his accident.  He never joined us again for dinner.  My last meal with him was that morning.  We ate oatmeal together.  I miss him.
He loved his gocart.  He had it 2 weeks.  He rode it to Heaven.
Please slow down for Jake.  When you see road barricade signs, please yield to those signs…in memory of my son.  He was such an important person in our lives and has been taken from us too soon.  
Remember him each time you get in your car.  Remember him especially on May 14 – he would have been 10.  He will never be 16 and drive a car.  
Thanks for reading this.  If you would like a button to wear in his memory – email me at minus1son@aol.com and give me an address to mail it to you.  Depending on the responses, it may take awhile to get your button.
Thanks for slowing down for Jake.  This will protect you as well as others.  If you have a younger brother Jake’s age – hug him in memory of Jake…for me.

Well, my office phone rang just after lunch on Thursday.  It was about 1:10pm.  My daughter was crying on the other line.  She said there had been a big fight at the school and she was attacked from behind and had a fat lip.  I said, “Becky, I am on my way.”
After a 20+ minute drive across town to the Middle School I was still upset when I got there.  I was angry. I did not understand why the child that hurt Becky did not have her parents there.  This was serious.  This was assault.  Why did the other girl choose not to notify her parents.
To make a long story short, I guess some parents just don’t care about their kids and obviously this child felt she could not tell her parents about what happened.  This is sad.  Parents need to take care of their kids.
I was not too kind to the assistant principal.  I was not ugly either….just not happy with the school policy.  I can’t believe there are 4 principals at that school!  There is the #1 principal and 3 assistants!…one for each grade…6th, 7th, and 8th.
They suspended Becky for “defending herself”!  Can you believe that?  What was she supposed to do?  Remain docile and take all the hits to “conform to school policy”?  I think not!  Of course they suspended the other girl, too….supposedly longer than Becky.  I told the staff that I understand their policy, but I will not agree with it.  They asked me if I wished to discuss this with the #1 principal.  I said, “No. He and I have met before about this policy and he is not worth my time or oxygen.  I will elevate this to the District Superintendent now.”  In the past, this principal said to “wait til things escalate” and in my opinion they had and this could have been prevented if he did his job.
Well, the 8th grade assistant principal asked me to at least work up the chain in the right order.  She told me to go see the lady in between the #1 principal and the Superintendent.  So I made 3 phone calls to this lady and NONE were returned.  I have an appointment to see the Superintendent on Tuesday afternoon.  If that middle lady asks me any questions about what this concerns, I will tell her if she really cared she would have returned my calls.  I will invite her into the meeting, too…a great opportunity to display her incompetence.  We have an overpaid educational staff..overpaid and incompetent.  
So Becky was suspended on Thursday afternoon.
On Friday morning, my office phone rang and they told me they were suspending Renee (Becky’s twin sister).  Why?  Because she was defending her sister from this overgrown out of control dangerous child.
Sigh.   Life is just too much sometimes for me.
I will be okay.  Becky goes back to school on Monday and Renee goes back to school on Tuesday.
I have the option to press charges on this girl that hurt Becky.  I will and hopefully the other parents will show up in court.  If not, we win and the other child has lost more a court issue – she has lost touch with her family to care for her.  I am sorry this happens to teenagers.
Boy, I bet you never expected to read an entry like this, huh?  Well, I have to make up for lost time at work, but when my kids need me – I will be there for them – whether they are in the wrong or the right.  They have to know I care.  You have your kids only once in a lifetime and even that lifetime is sometimes shorter than you think.  There will always be another job.  Thank goodness my job is flexible.
P.S.
Tomorrow is Easter.  I miss you, Jake.  I will always miss you.  I know if you were here, you would have defended Becky, too.  Because you all love each other.  That’s the way it is supposed to be, right.  We all loved you and we all miss you.

50,https://www.opendiary.com/m/j8xmom/you-have-a-lot-of-anger-5367954/,2001-04-13,You have a lot of anger…,"
…that is what my grief counselor told me.  Yes, I do.  I decided to tell you OD readers “the rest of the story” as Paul Harvey would have said on his radio talk show.
I am angry at my ex….Jake’s dad.  I have 3 reasons.
The first reason is the summer of 1999.  He asked if the girls and Jake could spend some time in Alaska with him.  I was hesitant to say yes since he never really takes much time off to be with them.  I worried about 3 young kids without supervision in a new strange environment….Anderson, Alaska. Jake had just turned 8 and the girls were 12.  Jake’s dad asked me if I would feel better about it if Jake had a babysitter.  My answer was yes.  So he said he would look into getting childcare for Jake.  He didn’t follow through.  I received a phone call one day from Renee.  She called me at work.  She said Jake had gotten hurt.  He was riding his bike down a street and hit a rock.  He flipped over his handlebars and hit his head.  He also chipped his tooth.  She had heard him crying.  She found him bleeding and walked him home.  She put him on the couch and told him to suck a washcloth filled with ice…”just like I remember you would always do, Mom” is what she told me.  I asked her where her Dad was and she said he was away playing racquetball with Becky.  I was so far away and helpless.  Well, the kids arrived back home in August after 2 months in Alaska.  I was glad to have them home.  I took Jake in to see the dentist and he fixed Jake right up.  He asked me why I waited so long to repair the damage so I told him the story.  
Reason number two took place June 2000.  Jake was hit by a car while he was visiting his Dad the first weekend in June.  He told me about it the next day.  He told Jake to tell me about his weekend and Jake just said he had fun.  His Dad looked like something was bothering him so I asked his Dad, “What happened this weekend?”  He said, “Jake got hit by a car.”  I was speechless.  I looked at his dad and said, “Where were you?!”  I then looked at Jake and then at his Dad and said to his Dad, “Did you take him to the hospital?”  He said no.  It was Sunday so I took Jake to the doctor to be checked out the next day.  Again, the doctor asked me questions I could not answer because I was not with Jake.  Jake had a bruise on his chest from his handlebars, but otherwise he was fine.  He liked missing half a day of school, too.  We stopped for a milkshake on the way to the doctor.
Reason number three took place September 24, 2000.  Less than 3 months after his most recent accident, Jake was hit by a car on his gocart while in the care of his Dad.  After his Dad told me on the cell phone that Jake was dead, I nervously said, “No he’s not….no he’s not.  What happened?  Where were you?”  He said, “Some teenagers ran him down in his gocart.  I was there.  I saw the whole thing.”
…yes, I am angry.  I am also angry with myself.  It was my weekend with the kids and Jake’s dad, as usual, wanted to spend sometime with Jake.  He always seemed to favor Jake over the girls, but I guess that is a dad and son type of relationship.  I let Jake go and he never came back.  I fed him breakfast and hugged him goodbye.  I wonder what he had for lunch.  I hope he was happy that afternoon.  I will never know til I see him again.
I went to visit Jake today.  It is less than 10 miles to the cemetary, but why can’t I just go downstairs and visit with him in his room…like the good ole days?  
Help me OD readers.  I am so sad today and my PROZAC was just increased on Thursday.  I think maybe it has just been a stressful week with the kids and school.  Tomorrow is Easter…my first Easter without my little boy since May 14, 1991.  I miss him and am hurting so bad…….I read a quote from another OD – “Tears are unspoken words.”  This is so true.  I think I read it in Cloudy’s OD.  If I ceased to speak tomorrow and just cry, you would all understand, I think.
P.S.  Jake I know you would not want me to be mad at your Dad.  I am just having such a hard time, son.  I close my eyes so tight hoping that maybe you will just reappear, but I have not seen you in so long…you would not want to see the sadness in my eyes.  Your heart was always so big.  Becky and Renee do not go with me to visit you because it hurts them so bad.  Becky told me today that the next time I go she will go with me.  I told her it is okay to cry for Jake…I do it all the time…I love you, son.  I miss your dimples, red hair, and great appetite.  I miss most just seeing you everyday.  You used to aggravate me so much with being a “boy” and farting, but it is okay, Jake…you are a wonderful boy.  Today I love you more than yesterday but less than I will love you tomorrow.

Hey readers..I am back.  I have been so drained from work and life.
I went to a grief conference in Denver for the weekend.  The conference went okay…I was with people just like me.  My daughter Becky went with me.  She was surprised to see Moms looking at her in tears…only to find out they lost their 14 year old daughters.  Becky gave out alot of hugs and I think this drained her.  I hope I did not expose her to too much grief.  We both enjoyed the weekend together – just the two of us.
I nominated my employer for the Compassionate Employer Recognition award in March and I was notified in Monday’s mail that they were one of the companies picked!  They will receive recognition at The Compassionate Friends national conference in DC in July.  I am planning on attending…for my own healing and to represent my company.  Give me the strength..readers…to tell Jake’s story.
My girls are throwing a “boy-girl” party at our place Saturday night…this should be interesting.  My neighbor has volunteered to be the “bouncer” for rude kids! Ha! Ha!  My oldest son is going to grill for everyone.  I am sure the teenagers will be just fine.  
The weather here is beautiful, but brings much sorrow.  Jake should be doing tricks on his skateboard with his hair blowing in the wind……
I did a Random Act of Kindness in Jake’s memory Sunday night.  I went to the grocery store and as I was checking out, the employees were making fun of a homeless guy.  They said he comes every night and asks for food so they sent him to fetch carts.
I told the cashier, “Hey, when that guy comes back with the carts give him this.”  I reached into my pocket and gave him money and a “Random Act of Kindness” card.  I told him to tell the guy to have a hot meal in memory of my son Jake…and I briefly shared Jake’s story.
They were not laughing anymore as I left…..

I miss you guys!

….when the man and his little girl asked for their bill at the local Red, Hot, and Blue BBQ place on Monday night. The waiter brought them a small card that said ""This Random Act of Kindness Done in Memory of Our Beautiful Child Jake"". There was no bill – Jake and I took care of it.
 
When I asked the waiter to do this, the look in his eyes as he read the card and looked at me was moving. He kept coming back to my table asking could he tell the man and his little girl anything about me. I just told him, ""No. I must remain anonymous."" Then I told Jake’s story and showed him the family picture in my wallet. I told the waiter to just tell the guy, ""Jake loved to eat ribs here. He and I cannot come here anymore together.""
 
The waiter for my table was a young teenager, but he was touched about Jake. He put his hand on his heart with misty eyes and said, ""You just don’t see people doing this."" I said, ""Well, more people need to do nice things. Please tell your friends to slow down on the roads – in memory of my little boy. He loved his gocart and that was the closest he ever got to driving. He wore his seatbelt and his helmet…but he never came home on September 24, 2000…..""

….my poor adopted cat from the Humane Society.  She probably thinks she left that dreaded place and landed into a worse place.
She had to go to the vet on Friday to be spade and declawed.  So I picked her up on Saturday afternoon…a couple hours before the girls’ boy-girl party was scheduled to begin.  I put her in a quiet room away from the excitement.
On Sunday morning I was preparing to give her some pain medication.  This medication came in a syringe type thing and was a gel type substance.  I was supposed to put a small amount on my finger and rub it on the inside of her left ear.
So I am carefully trying to squirt a tiny bit on my finger, but for some reason nothing is coming out.  So I press a bit harder on the syringe and …..THERE GOES MY CAT’S MEDICATION…..across the kitchen counter!  I felt soooo bad….But I was able to scrape some off the counter and put a little in her ear.
That poor cat – adopted by someone who can’t even administer a little gel to her ears…..
Moral of this story:  Let the vet demo the meds for your pet!

When my little boy was lying on that hospital bed with life support keeping him alive for organ donation, I was so lost.  If he had been sick, I would have been there with him all night.  Why didn’t I stay all night with him then?  Why didn’t I ask someone if it was okay to stay with Jake?   He was so alone in there when we left.  The organ donation nurse told me he would take good care of Jake.  But I still wonder why I left and did not stay?  Is it because I didn’t know what else to do?  I got to the hospital about an hour after they pronounced him dead – due to brain death.  It was after 6pm on Sunday – Sept. 24, 2000.  He was driving his gocart and was hit by a 16 year old driver.  I left the hospital after 11pm to take my other kids home.  I don’t think I slept for at least 48+ hours and only then because I was given some medication.
When I went to his services, it really shocked me to see him in that casket.  I guess I just didn’t think it was true.  I was told I tried to shake him and kept saying, “Please wake up, Jake.  Please wake up.”
He had just started taking an interest in golf.  I put a golf ball in each of his hands and he was so cold.  I tried so hard to warm his hands.  I brought his favorite Austin Powers t-shirt…it was folded neatly and smelled “Downey” fresh.  I placed it on his chest.  I placed his favorite Austin Power videos next to him, too.  His brother, Joe, picked a golf club (a 5 iron, I think) and placed it by Jake’s side.  Joe’s heart was just broken to see his little brother in this situation.
I also put his favorite Captain Underpants book in with him.
I wonder how come I did not stay all night with him in the funeral home prior to his services.  I didn’t think about it.  A friend told me she sat with Jake the night before the funeral.  If I had known, I would have been there, Jake.  Please forgive me, son.  I would have spent every minute with you.  I would rather have been with you than at home with all the visitors.  I wish I could have been there throughout your hospital stay.  I wish I could have been with you at the coroner’s office.  I wish you never left the house on Sunday, Jake.  I wish you had went to the mall with me and the girls.  I just want you to know, Jake, it was hard to let you go.  It is hard to live without you.  I miss you so much, Jake…….every sec..every minute…every hour…everyday….always and 4ever…..
Mother’s Day without you is going to be very sad – May 13.  Your birthday is going to be sadder – May 14.  Your school is having a Memorial Ceremony in your honor on May 17. The school is dedicating a garden – planted just for you – in your honor.  
I wish it was not you, Jake.  I want you to come home…………I love you.  Love, Mom
P.S. Jake, your sister wrote another poem in your honor.  It will be published in a book.  We will put this special book on your bed.  Maybe we can all read it together one night – you, me, and the girls.  They miss you, too.  Your brother Joe is just so sad without his little “bro”.

This was written by Jake’s sister.  She wrote this for him.  She is 14.  Jake was 9 went he left us.
Tears
Tears stream from my eyes,
As I say my last goodbye,
I take your hand in mine,
As I watch you sleep for one last time.
I stare at you lying in that hospital bed,
Memories of you spin all through my head,
All the good times and the bad,
All the happy ones, yet, some are sad.
Sometimes I say,
“Just give me one more day,”
But what good would that do,
I would just have to let go of you.
Someday I will be able to think of you and not cry,
Sometime I will understand why,
But until that day, I will just cry,
And wonder why.

Thursday was the Memorial Garden Dedication to Jake from his school.  It was too much for me, Readers.  I walked into the school gym for the ceremony and his pals raced up to me with smiles and open arms.  I hugged them so tightly – I miss my little boy hugs.  I miss my son, Jake.  I couldn’t let them go.
It was a very rainy day – so the ceremony started inside. There were about 8 of Jake’s classmates playing an emotional role in the dedication.  They either wrote something for Jake or drew a picture.  Just b4 the ceremony was to begin, the little kids were crying very hard.  I had to leave my seat and hug them and hold their hands.  I wiped the tears from their streaked faces and said, “You guys have to be strong for Jake.  Don’t cry or you will make me cry (as tears were pouring from my eyes).  Jake is watching you. He will think you are wuzzes.  He knows I am a Wuzz!”  They gave me a brief smile then nodded their heads as if to say, “ok”.  Then they each did their presentation.  The choir sang, “The Healing Song”.
Then the rain stopped and we were able to go outside to see his garden.  It is so beautiful.  I plan to spend some special time out there to be lost in tears and memories of my son.  He loved to plant.  He planted a garden with me.  He watered our garden daily to keep it wet.  He overwatered it.
I gave a book to the school library – “The Book of Questions” – because Jake always asked questions.  
I looked through the book but could not find my question:  
Why did Jake have to go on September 24, 2000?

For the record, Readers – he has been my ex-husband for almost 7 years.

…just a few lines to say I miss Jake.  I was just wondering why he left.  
Is it something I did?  Did I do something wrong?  Please let me know.  Is it because his Dad and I divorced and we loved Jake so much that he was taken from us?
If it is not too much to ask, could you let Jake peek through the clouds so I can see his face?  I miss him so very much.  I have cried so much that I think I have set a new record for crying.
I went to see Jake today and left him something that Becky made him in her metals class. I know he probably sees everything from his strategic Heavenly location…but I just wanted to go out and visit. I looked at the mountains…it is so beautiful from where Jake was laid to rest.  I just wish I could see him, God.  I am having a hard time with life.  Jake’s sisters are wearing me out.  Jake used to help me make it through their PMS days.  I miss him, God.
Tell him I love him and miss him very much.  Tell him to give me a “sign” that he is okay and happy.  God, do U allow gocarts in Heaven?  I hope so…Jake loved his gocart.
Tell him there is a beautiful garden planted at his school in his memory.  I know he probably was at the dedication.  We miss him, God.  His friends were so sad, but they participated in the dedication.
Tell Jake I am so sad and I cannot help myself.  I cry alot, God.  My eyes are so puffy that I could be a rap singer with the name “Puff Patty”.  Jake would probably think that is a funny name….like those Captain Underpants books.
God, is it true John Edwards can communicate with those that have “crossed over” to the other side?  I hope so..I have to have something to believe in.
Why do I think Jake is coming home after a long trip?  Why did he leave us?….
Jake’s Mom
P.S.  God, I did another Random Act of Kindness for Jake today.  I went to the DQ to get something to drink and told the teenager at the drive through to keep the change for the next person who drives through.  I felt good about this.  
Please let Jake’s face peer through Heaven.  I need to see him and make eye contact.  I know you get alot of requests like this, but I will gladly take a number and wait my turn…please?

It is a breezy sunny Colorado day….and I saw someone jumping up and down on the corner as I was on my way home from work.  It was a little girl holding up a bright sign that said “LEMONADE” in bright colors.  I did a U turn and turned around and stopped.  She directed me up the street two houses.  I asked her before I drove up the street,”Is this cold lemonade?”  She smiled at me and said, “Yes!”  Then she looked up the street to her little friend at the Lemonade stand and screamed, “Hey!  Heads Up!”  So I slowly drove up the street and pulled over to the side.  The little Lemonade stand girl had a cup of ice filled with lemonade.  I asked her,”How much?”  She smiled and said, “Twenty five cents.”  I gave her a $5 bill and said keep this.  Then I handed her a card that said “This Random Act of Kindness Done in Loving Memory of our Beautiful Child – Jake.  5-14-91 – 9-24-00”  She was so happy to have so much money – she ran to her front door to show her mommy the money and card.  I almost spilled my Lemonade driving away…another Kodak moment.
I miss you, Jake.  Every second, minute, hour, day, week, month….since you have left us.  I used to be so afraid I would forget you because my mind has never been the same…but how wrong I was.  I want to see your smiling face, red hair blowing in the wind, and your  body cruising on your skateboard……saying..”Hey Mom!  What’s for dinner?”
I remember when you and the girls had a Lemonade stand a summer or so again and how happy you were.  You guys thought you were rich!  Then the wind blew your lemonade stand down and broke it.  But it was okay, Jake.  That was a small incident.  You leaving us on September 24, 2000 was a very SIGNIFICANT thing to ALOT of people.  
I have to go get some kleenex, Jake.  I did it again, I cried my eyes out and I have to go to the store for something.  I will dry my eyes and put your picture button on my shirt.  You can go to the store with me.  Remember our trips to the store…..just you and me?  I do.  I will never forget them……..

….but it must be beyond words.
Dear Mrs. S….
OMG!  I do not know what to say.  I understand your son was 16 and driving with a friend when it occurred.  It  happened on a Sunday afternoon.  Your son was driving his Camero with a friend…when he hit the other person.  They said they were going about 35mph and did not see him.  The other person was a child; he died less than 2 hours after the accident.  I heard your son missed alot of school after it happened and was in counseling for at least a week.  I heard he almost faced felony charges, but was not charged.  I know you were relieved to know he would not go to prison.  I bet you are just “beside” yourself.  I cannot imagine how you must feel.  It must be mixed emotions.  Your son “E” had just got his driver’s license recently…b4 the accident.  I heard “E” was a good kid and felt really bad.  With the passing of time, maybe you think less about what happened.  I hope “E” drives more cautiously now.
I know you don’t know who I am and you don’t recognize the name.  You are probably wondering ….”who is this person…?”  Well, Mrs. S…..I am the mother of the child who died.  He was hit at a speed of 55mph in his gocart.  His gocart was no match for your son’s camero.  He was only 9 years old.  He will never be 16 and be able to drive.  He was a great kid, too.  He loved life.  He loved people.  He loved life.  We loved him.  His name is Jake.  
Your son was not charged, but my youngest son is no longer with me.  I miss him.  His brother and sisters miss him, too.  His school mates miss him.  He had just started 3rd grade in a new school and was off to a great start last Fall.  He came home from school on September 22, 2000.  He was in school less than 3 weeks and he brought home all his schoolwork.  His papers were great!  He had a new Friday folder to show me and told me where to sign so his teacher would know he showed me his schoolwork.  The folder did not go back signed on Monday because Jake never returned to his class.
Like I said, I cannot imagine how you feel….but if it is possible…..I feel alot worse.  Yes, your son did not go to prison or jail or whatever else….you can see him everyday at every meal.  You can laugh and hug him everyday.
Jake is gone.  There is less laughter in our house.  There is an empty seat at the table.  There is a quiet bedroom downstairs.  There is a PlayStation in his room with the game he last played on September 23.  His golf clubs are collecting dust in his closet.  He just learned about golf last summer.  He loved it.  His skateboard is worn and resting by his bed.  
He and I shopped for school clothes all day on Saturday, September 23.  He was so excited to wear them to school on Monday.  He picked out some “cool” bright outfits.  He never got to wear them to school.  I picked one out to bury him in.  He went to Heaven in his new school clothes…bright and noticeable.
You and I live in the same town.  I do not know you.  I wonder if you know me.  Do we shop at the same grocery store?  Maybe we have chatted in a busy line at one of the fast food places.  Maybe we buy gas at the same gas station.  
I know you probably know my address from the accident report.  I know yours, but I have never driven by your house.  I cannot even shop at the new shopping area that was a construction area when the accident occurred.  They opened a new Lowe’s store there.  Did you know the speed limit is 35mph…it is posted now.
I just cannot imagine how you feel about “E” and what happened.  Can you imagine how I feel?  It is hard to put into words…yes, I know.
I sometimes wonder what would happen if we met.  I don’t know what I would say.  Can you understand?

When I went to see Jake, it was painful to see an unmarked grave.  It takes soooo long to have a monument made.  He was buried on September 28, 2000 and his monument was placed on December 23, 2000.  3 months seemed like 4ever.
I wanted something special for Jake, but I did not have the strength to shop in flower stores in person.  So I shopped in the quiet privacy of my home on my computer.  Then I found something interesting….FlowersForHeaven.com.  This is a special place run by a very special lady that has had experience with “loss” and pain.
She has brought me such comfort and happiness in the special arrangements she has made for Jake and my family.  Jake has a nice topper on his monument specially made to order just for him.  It contains green and blue flowers and racing cars.  I have a matching arrangement in my home – minus the cars.  She also made a special arrangement for Jake with a wrestler and an angel in the center.  Jake loved WWF.  She just recently sent me a special arrangement for his bday.  I am just so moved by this special “angel” at FlowersForHeaven.com.
I tried to meet her in person when I flew into GA after Christmas this year, but circumstances prevented us from meeting.  The weather was just too miserable and she could not leave her home in the mountains due to icy road conditions.
I have called her and visited with her on the phone.  She is a very special lady on a very special mission with a very much needed service.
I am glad I found her.  Please visit her site if you ever need something special for someone you have lost.  Visit her and tell her “Patty sent me.”  Maybe she will share with you her story on how FlowersForHeaven.com came into existence.  It is a very special story.
Her name is Lindy and she has been very good to me and Jake.  She also made some lovely arrangements for my girls.

66,https://www.opendiary.com/m/j8xmom/dear-daddy-29-5367970/,2001-05-26,"Dear Daddy,","
It has been over 12+ years since you left.    I thought I would share some things with you.
You did not get to meet 4 of your grandkids.  Mark got married – again – and has a wonderful wife and 3 kids.  Teresa is 9…Anna is 2….and Samantha is 1.  Mark has a wonderful wife, Nancy.  She is a great Mom and sister-in-law.  She sure has alot of patience to put up with Mark sometimes.  But they all seem happy.
Bob never remarried and his son Jack is 14 now…like the twins.  Jack is really growing into a handsome and well-behaved young man.  Bob is a schoolteacher.  Can you believe it!?  I was surprised myself.  
The twins – Becky and Renee – are growing into 2 beautiful young ladies.  They are still a handful now as when you saw them at 11 months of age.  I think they are more work now since they are so mobile and mouthy.
The fourth grandchild you may have met already.  He left us on September 24, 2000.  Daddy, this is the hardest thing I have ever experienced in my life!  He was only 9 years old and was driving his gocart.  He was with his Dad that Sunday afternoon.  I guess I should tell you I got a divorce in 1995.  I guess that is something you would never have thought, huh?  Well, I did and I am a statistic…a divorcee now of 5+ years.  Sorry that I didn’t make it work – but it lasted longer than Bob and Mark’s previous marriages added together – I think.  It lasted 10+ years.
Anyway, Jake is the redheaded guy up there.  He has fiery red hair like you did as a kid.  I guess he got that recessive gene.  He has a happy laugh and deep dimples.  His face is filled with freckles and he was wearing one of his new school outfits when we sent him up there.  
Let him know who you are, Daddy.  He asked alot of questions about you when he visited Mom in Georgia.  He wanted to see your grave.  So he and I walked out to visit you.  He would love to know you are his Grampa Frank.  Explain to him about his red hair and how he got it.  I never saw such red hair until I married his Dad.  Remember, the twins? One was red-headed and one was not.
Mom is doing great.  Can you believe she turned 76 this year!  She is still like the Energizer bunny…has alot of energy.  Filipino women just never age, I guess.  She loves all the Grandkids.  She sure was strong when she came out for Jake’s funeral.  She stayed with me for 4 months.  She just came out again this month to attend Jake’s Memorial Garden dedication at his school.  
Mom misses you and we talk about you alot.  Bob, Mark, and I miss you, too.
I miss Jake, Daddy.  When you see him, tell him we love him and miss him very much.  He may be driving his gocart.  Get him to stop and visit you today or tomorrow.
Love,
Your only daughter, Pat.

I splurged on my backyard!  I had a retaining wall rebuilt that has been neglected probably for many many years!  This house is old – built in 1971.  Anyway, there was this ugly place in the back, but as of right now it is beautiful!
I hired this crew that really knew what to do!  It is beautiful.  I planted a smaller version of Jake’s Memorial Garden.  I really am not the expert in plants, flowers, or gardening, but my neighbor made a list of everything in Jake’s garden and I got most of those things in my backyard now.  I bought everything last night and the crew planted them for me.  I am so excited!  I plan to spend alot of time sitting back there thinking of my special little boy and what I plan to do when we meet again.  I miss him so much.  I have so much to share with him.
I hope he will visit me soon in the peaceful evenings as I sit and think about him.  I will call this my “Secret Garden”…like the movie.  Jake liked that movie.  I took him and the girls to see the musical, too.
I will tell you what the flowers and plants are in the next entry.  I have to find my list.  I can see the garden from my computer room, but I am clueless to what is what.
I remember last Spring.  Jake found an Iris growing wild on his walk home from shool.  He pulled it out and planted it in my yard.  I wish it was still there.  
I remember he said he planted a flower by my wood pile last summer, too.  It looked like a weed to me.  He would give me a hard time when I did not water his weed when I watered the yard.  Oh – I wish I could find his weed…I miss Jake and all his special gardens he planted for me.
Jake and I always planted something cute by the mailbox, too.  Now that spot is overcome with weeds.  I think I will muster up the courage to plant something there.  Maybe I will get a stepping stone that says “Jake’s Garden” and put it there, too.
I MISS YOU, Jake!  Today was beautiful and for a brief moment I felt good.  I was standing in the parking lot at work and the breeze felt good.  I thought to myself, “Wow, this is a beautiful day…but I miss you, Jake.  I always will.”  Save me a spot up there, Jake.  I want to come Home, too.
Love, Mom

Today after work a guy came by to give me an estimate for a deck.  I think Jake sent this special person to me.  I shared my story about Jake and how much I have become a recluse – keeping to myself and wanting privacy.  This guy remembered reading about my son.
We spent more time discussing God and his plans than we did discussing square footage on the deck.  This special guy really brought me a message about Jake and God and tomorrow…..
I am glad he came to give me an estimate and share about things most people don’t discuss openly ….religion and God.  He is going to send me a special book that I cannot wait to receive.
Also, a good friend from work came over with his 9 year old daughter tonite.  It was so nice to have company over and small children again.  We walked to Jake’s Memorial Garden tonite, too.  It was nice to have company on the evening walk, too.  His daughter was so generous with her hugs, too.  I miss my hugs from Jake, but I think he came to see me tonite in those hugs.
Thank-you God for a very interesting evening.  Kiss Jake for me and tell him I love him.  I know God is not supposed to give us more than we can bear, but he is really testing me.  Gee, and I thought essay exams were the worst kind – this test with losing Jake tops all.
I will try my best God to do what you think I should do, but I am weakening so fast……Jake’s Mom
P.S.  I want so much to sleep in Jake’s room, but I am not sure I am ready.  I put his sandals in his room tonite.  It was an empty feeling holding sandals that will never be sandy with Jake’s dirt.  I miss him so much.  Help me, God.  I am trying to do what I have to do.  Thank you for taking good care of Jake.  I guess I am selfish and did not want to share him, but I guess I am human, right?  Was Jake ever mine?  I wonder……whether he was or not…it is okay to miss him, right?  Well, right or wrong, I miss you, Jake.

Well, I stopped in to grab a Starbucks coffee this morning.  I ordered my favorite – – White Chocolate Mocha Grande.  The lady rung me up and said, “You know that card you left last week?  The next person to come in and get coffee got your card (Random Act of Kindness in memory of Jake)free coffee and thought that was special.”
So…Jake will not ever be forgotten if I keep doing these kind deeds.  I sure miss my son.  He would have loved White Chocolate Mocha coffee.  He always drank most of my Vanilla cappuccino when I stopped at the Conoco for gas.  I miss my coffee buddy, but people will continue to meet Jake for the rest of my Earth days as long as I don’t run out of those cards.  I better order some more.
Jake’s Mom
P.S.  The ice-cream truck came by the neighborhood after work…I flagged him down to give him cash and another Random Act of Kindness card.  I think he thought he was getting a tip.  Oh well, when I hear the ice-cream truck, I think of Jake yelling throughout the house, “Mom!  I need money!  The ice-cream man is here!”  I miss that demanding voice.  I love you, Jake.  I will love and miss you forever.  I guess that ice-cream man never runs out of ice-cream these days…without Jake’s appetite to deplete his supply.  I wonder if they have ice-cream trucks in Heaven?  Do they, Jake?

Hey,
It is me.  I know you probably wonder why I do not speak much to you or talk to you on the phone.  I just want you to know that I will never forget the day you picked up Jake on my weekend and never brought him home.  One of his last statements was…”See ya, Mom.  I will be home at 7.  I am having dinner with Dad.”
Jake loved you so much and wished we were not divorced.  I was very generous letting you have all that extra time with him.  You would always call me in the middle of the week and ask to take Jake out to dinner or go to Starbucks for morning coffee.  He loved you so much.  
Do you miss him as much as me?  Do you cry as much as me?  Do you visit Jake as much as me?  Can you ever understand the pain and hurt I am going through for the rest of my life?  Was it not enough to divorce me and leave me to fend on my own with our four kids – ages 3, 8, 8, and 15?  I guess it wasn’t enough.  You really got to me this time.  It is one thing to move on after a divorce, but how can I forget who was with Jake when he left us on September 24, 2000.  What were you really doing when the accident occurred?  Were you watching him or were you tinkering with your truck or reading a new book?  I guess I really do not want to know the answer.
You picked him up at 10am.  Did you take him out to lunch?  Did you give him an afternoon snack?  What did you plan to have for dinner with him?  He was coming down with a cold.  Did he have his jacket on when you were out with him?  It was a chilly damp day that Sunday.  When I saw Jake at the hospital, he was covered with white blankets with a towel over his forehead.  He looked like he was sleeping so peacefully with all those machines monitoring his body.  I want to think he was sleeping, but we both know different.
Did you hug him and tell him you loved him before he got in his go-cart?
I want to know so much, but I will probably never ask you, because I cannot look at you anymore.  Your voice upsets me.  Your diesel truck noise causes panic attacks.  When I see ambulances rushing around me, I think of September 24, 2000.
Do you remember when Jake was hit by a car in June – 3 months before his gocart accident?  He was in your care then, too.  It hurts.  It hurts so much.  You cannot imagine.  
I am Jake’s Mom.  I took care of him for his entire life.  You were absent from his life with 2 military assignments.  You missed 2 years of his life – 730 days.  You missed alot – considering his life was cut short so unexpectedly.
I should have left with the kids when you left us behind.  I wonder if Jake would still be with us.  Sometimes it hurts just to think about it.  I should have moved with the kids and started over a long time ago…..I am sorry I did not leave this state.  I am sorry that I married you and had children.  Most of all….I am sorry I let you have Jake that afternoon.  Are you sorry for anything?
Jake’s Mom
P.S.  I plan to cut all ties to you when the girls are of age to be on their own.  I have less than 5 years left.  The girls will be 19 then and Joe will be 27.  I am leaving this state and changing my name.  I am starting all over…..but I will never forget Jake….or why he isn’t with me anymore.  I just had to tell you how I feel.  Life is too short to hold too much in.  I have tried to not feel so bitter, but I cannot help it.
Today you took the girls to 6 Flags Over Elitch Gardens in Denver.  You never did that before in your life!  I am glad you did this.  I am sorry that you dropped them off for the day and went to pick them up hours later.  Do you ever worry about what might happen to them left unattended?  Do you even care about your girls?  They are your children, too.
Remember last June when I took a day off from work and spent the entire day with all the kids at Elitches?  Remember, I made a video of that trip and shared it with you.  You told me they looked like they had fun.  They did!  Remember I told you that you should do stuff like this with them, too?  I remember…you said, “I don’t like to do things like that.”  I remember I told you, “Sometimes you have to do things you don’t like…like going some place the kids like.  It is not all about you.  You have kids.”  You just looked at me.  Well, I have all those memories whether on video or not.  Thanks for taking the girls to Elitches.  I don’t think I can ever go back there without Jake.  It just seems too strange buying 1 less ticket.  
If you hook up with that lady friend of yours, watch her son more responsibly than you did your own.  He is only 3.  Don’t let him ride a gocart.  Most of all, don’t let him replace Jake in your life.  Jake was YOUR son.  Don’t move on so quickly…it hurts so much to see you go about life like nothing ever happened.
Stay away from me 4-ever.

This is what the little boy in the checkout line ahead of me kept repeating to his mother.  I could tell she was getting tense because I remember the times my kids would do that to me and it would drive me nuts!
When he finally said, “Mom, can you find two quarters?” I had to step in with my Random Act of Kindness.  I said to his mom, “Hey, I have two quarters.  Can I give them to  your son in memory of my little boy who died in a go-cart accident?”  The action in the line ceased and everyone became quiet.  She looked at me with that mother’s pain only us mothers can understand or even attempt to understand.  She said, “Thank-you,” as I handed her the Random Act of Kindness card.  Then 3 little hands reached out – all 3 of her kids looked into my eyes.  I smiled and dropped 2 quarters into each open hand.  Then they raced to those kid attracting quarter machines in the grocery stores.
Well – I did it 3 times for you, Jake.  You are worth so much and more to us.  Just to hear you say, “Hey, Mom, got any change?” one more time would make me so happy.  We miss you, son and I am keeping your memory alive every chance I get to share something with other kids or people.
Love, Mom 
P.S.  I still think you are going to pop in any day now.  Please do, I need to hold you – even if it is a brief visit.

Jake only attended his new school about 3 weeks, but he was certainly off to a good start.
I remember when I went to open house.  He took me to his room.  He pointed out his teacher and said, “That’s my teacher in the red dress.  The one with the white hair.”
She was a very sweet lady who obviously loved her classroom and children.  Jake’s face just beamed when she ran her fingers through his red hair as she bragged about what a good student and hard worker he was.  Jake was so happy in his new school with his new friends.  He even bragged about the principal being “a girl”.  I remember that day like it was yesterday.  Jake just could not believe women could have important jobs like a principal!  Boy – I miss that little boy.  He was such a character.
Well, I went to his school last week to see if there was anything of Jake’s that I could round up.  It has been 9 months since I went there for his open house.  It was a hard thing to do without Jake.  
It broke my heart to see his new WWF wrestling folders – never used.  Just to hold them and imagine his little hands holding these and showing them to his buddies…Stone Cold, the Undertaker, and the Rock – all of his favorite wrestlers.  I remember buying him his school supplies.  He was so excited.  He just loved those wrestlers!
She also gave me his picture that she took the first day of school.  I will always cherish those pictures.  He looked so happy.
She gave me a letter his friend wrote to us – To: Jake’s Parents.  I opened the letter and it said….it was typed …probably on a computer….
September 25, 2000
To Jake’s Parents:
Jake did not deserve to die.
I can name three different things that he was good at:  Soccer, tetherball, and go carting.
The most important thing to me is Jake died doing the thing he really like to do.
From,
Andrew R.
Kids really know how to say the things that mean so much.  I wish I could write Andrew back.  I would write…
Dear Andrew,
I do not think Jake deserved to die either.
I can name three different things that he was good at too:
swimming, skateboarding, and roller blading.
The most important thing to me is that Jake was a part of my life for 9 wonderful years and part of your class for 3 weeks. I miss him.  His brother and sisters miss him, too.  
Thanks for writing about Jake, Andrew.
From, 
Jake’s Mom
I have more to share with you OD readers, but right now I am very sad.  I have to go.
I saw Jake’s best friend today.  His name is Johnny.  I can see how much Johnny misses Jake, too.  Johnny and Jake were a special pair.  Johnny will always be Jake’s friend because…”Death ends a life, not a relationship.”  I will always be Jake’s Mom.  
Next time I write, I will share with you what his class shared with me.  It is a poster with a list of things his class wrote about him.  They all signed the poster.  I plan to have it laminated and possibly framed.  I will hang it by my computer.
Goodnite dear friends, I have made myself very sad.  I love you all and thanks for listening.
I don’t know what I am going to do tonite – I am out of my anti-depressants.   I was so busy today in the yard that I did not make time to refill the empty container.  I think I will be okay.

Can U believe it!  I met someone from OD.  She came to see me yesterday…after a 10 hour drive from NM!
She had dinner with me and the kids.  I treated her to her favorite candy – Cadbury chocolate bar.  I know so much about her from her OD.  She brought me a surprise from NM – a cool southwestern coffee mug.  I plan to take it to work with me this morning.
She saw Jake’s special garden in my back yard.  She and I plan to go to Jake’s school sometime during her 3 week visit.  I want to show her his Memorial Garden.  We plan to visit Jake, too.  It will be nice to visit Jake with someone who understands my pain.
This week she is going with me to The Compassionate Friends (TCF) local meeting.  She brought some special things to share with our group.
We also plan to hit Starbucks, too.  She has been deprived of Starbucks since she left CO.
Just had to let you know about my OD friend.

He loved his go-cart so much that he would hurry home each day after school to wash it!  He even washed the tires!  He was so proud of this go-cart.
He had it for 9 days.  He drove it to Heaven on September 24, 2000 just before 4pm.  It was a Sunday afternoon.  We miss him so much.
He was 9 years old.  He celebrated his 10th bday in Heaven on May 14, 2001.

Hey everybody.  Just to catch you up on me and 1958mouser….we had Starbucks on Wednesday night and attended a Compassionate Friends meeting on Thursday night.
Today she and I went to check out the Memorial Garden done in memory of her son and 2 other middle school kids.  We went to her son’s Middle School in search of the Memorial Garden, but our efforts were fruitless….BUT we came upon something we were NOT EXPECTING!
It was a beautiful reddish brown fox as big as a collie! He was studying us from a distance…a fairly safe distance, but we were a bit intimidated.  Mouser said foxes are supposed to be afraid of people, but I think it is just the opposite.  I was a bit scared of him even though he was several feet away from us – about half a block.  He was just staring at us and not moving.  I kept looking at Mouser wondering if we should go back to our safe haven in the van.  She was studying this parked truck thinking we could run for our lives by climbing up on that truck.  It was a big truck.  I knew I couldn’t reach the bumper so I was beginning to wonder what it would feel like to be bitten by a fox!  I wondered how many times he would bite me b4 mouser could hoist me up onto the truck.
Anyway, as I was studying the fox, he decided to take a dump!  Yep – right in front of us!  So I looked away to be polite.
Mouser made eye contact with the fox and stretched out her arms to appear scary to the fox then she turned facing me and started walking towards me.  Being the jokster that I am, I looked around her and made a fearful and face and said, “Here he comes!”  The look on her face was a Kodak moment and she started to increase her walking pace.  I started laughing and said, “No, just kidding.”  GOTCHA mouser!
IT WAS TOO FUNNY!

Pregnancy is a long time period is it not?  I remember going through 3 pregancies – one with twins.  I remember the excitement at the beginning and the tiredness that followed right away.  I remember having the babies and being so happy and tired at the same time.
I was just thinking on the way home from work tonite – yea I had to go into work today to get ready for our big upcoming week – today is 9 months since Jake’s accident.
I have alot of mixed emotions:  sadness,anger,loneliness etc.
I will always be sad and lonely without Jake.  He is the missing piece in our family.  I hope one day I can process the anger, but I cannot fathom when that day will come for me.
I continue to leave my Random Act of Kindness cards.  The latest thing is to leave them at payphones and gumball/toy machines with some change.
You people in ODland have really supported me with your kind words and emails.  I don’t know how I would have gotten this far without you.  
Mouser was a tremendous help to me when she reached out to me via letter a week after Jake’s accident.  Now I have really met her in person!
It has been 9 months without that little guy in our lives.  It is very hard to describe the “emptiness” in our hearts and home.  
The first Halloween without him was hard.
The first Thanksgiving without him was very hard.  He helped me plan the trip to South Dakota to see his brother Joe and Joe’s wife, Holly.  Joe and Jake always played the Playstation together and fought over the last piece of Holly’s delicious pumpkin pie.  He was really looking forward to it.  We all were looking forward to that trip.  When it was time to make that trip without Jake…it was difficult.
The first Christmas without Jake was difficult.  Becky and Renee were always the secret elves shopping many days in advance to collect stuff for Jake’s stocking.
The start of a New Year without Jake was difficult.
Valentines’ Day was hard for me.  I always bought things in 3s – one for Jake, Renee, and Becky.  It was hard to buy just 2 things.
President’s Day weekend was hard.  Jake, Renee, and I used to go sledding.
Spring Break was different.  The girls had nobody to boss around.
Mother’s Day was very sad for me.  One of my children was not home.
Jake’s 10th bday on May 14 just did not seem right.
May 17th was the Memorial Garden dedication.  It was like reliving his funeral at an elementary school.
The last day of school was different.  We usually go out and talk about how great it was to finish school and start a fun summer.  I hope Jake likes school in Heaven.  We went out to eat without our little guy; it was not the same.
I am sure Father’s Day must have been difficult for Jake’s Dad.
The girls have just left for vacation in FL, GA, and NC…without their tag-along brother.  This is their first vacation without Jake.  I am so used to them leaving together as a group.  I keep hoping for some odd reason that they will return home and bring Jake to surprise me.
Why do I keep holding out for the things that I know will never happen?
I don’t understand why life threw me this punch.  It hurts so much for all of us.
Anyway – tomorrow will be another day.  Soon it will be the anniversary of Jake’s accident.  Where does all the time go?  Please God…help me…..

I always had fun with the kids at amusement parks and water parks.  I have not been to either since Jake’s accident.  The girls went to an amusement/water park with their 8th grade class this month.
I don’t know when I will ever be able to do the things we did as a foursome.
This is a picture of Jake and me taken last June.  We were visiting family in GA and went to a place called Wild Adventures.  We had so much fun!  I remember how “stinkin'” hot it was in GA with the humidity at about 100%, too!  I parked myself under the Mist hoses!  I could not stand the heat!  This was taken by my brother as we entered the park….b4 I got soaked.  
I miss Jake…we all miss him.  I cannot imagine being this happy again…any of us….  He made us all laugh.  We all laughed with him.

I raced to the bookstore after work yesterday.  I wanted to pick up a present there.
I went into the Children’s section to look for the Captain Underpants series of books.  They are written by Dave Pilkey.  
I couldn’t find them anywhere so I went to ask for assistance.  The guy at the desk helped me out.  He brought me to the right shelf and said, “My 9 year old loves these books…that’s why I know where to find them.”  That comment went straight to my heart.  Jake and his buddies loved these books, too.  I said, “Yeah, my 9 year loved these books, too.”  
Slowly I squatted down to check out all the titles.  This was really bringing back memories of my little boy.  He used to crawl into bed with me at night while I was reading.  He would bring his favorite Captain Underpants book and read while I read my book.  The names in those books are so funny —like Professor Poopypants!  I remember Jake just laughing as he told me this guy’s name.  I remember not believing him until he showed me. We laughed together.  Boy – I miss that 
little guy so much….
Well, I picked out two books and went to check out.  The cashier rung up the books and said, “I hear these books are so funny.”  I smiled and I wrote out my check.  As I was handed the receipt, I said to the cashier, “Hey, do me a favor.”  I reached into my bag of new books and pulled one out.  “Give this to the next 9 year old that comes in.  I lost my little boy in a go cart accident and he loved these books.”  I stuck a Random Act of Kindness Card in the book like a bookmark.  She looked me in the eye and assured me she would take care of it.
I was thinking on the way home that if Jake was the one to receive that book he would have been so happy!  I can almost hear him telling the cashier, “Gee, thanks.  I love these books!”  I could see him climbing in my bed with his new adventures of Captain Underpants and both of us giggling until we fell asleep.
I love you, Jake and we miss you so much son.

…today….I married Jake’s Dad.  It was in Panama City, Florida, in a doublewide trailer with a Justice of Peace.  It was a Wednesday night.  The Justice of the Peace was married.  Her husband was watching the Wednesday night movie on TV.  It was an interesting movie because I remember watching it with him out of the corner of my eye and forgot to say my vows!  LOL  
The Justice got made at her husband and yelled at him to turn off the TV so, “I can marry these kids!”  Kids?  We were both old!  I was 26 and he was 33.  Anyway, I remember him  hitting the power button on his remote and letting out a loud belch!  Then he got up and left the living room.
Us?  We had to start all over!  I remember I had to write the $25 check to pay her.  What a marriage!  What a life.
I miss Jake.

P.S.  Jake would never have been a part of my life if I did not marry his Dad…as Brian Paisley would say..it’s because two people fell in love….

Hey!  I need your opinions.  I decided to get personalized plates in memory of Jake.  My daughter, Becky, came up with this one “J8XMOM”..Jake’s Mom.  I thought that was pretty original so that is my first choice.  My second choice is my email address 
“-ONESON”…minus1son.  My third choice is “4EVRMST”…Forever Missed.
Tell me what you think.  I hope to hear from them soon.  I have to renew my tags in August.  Wish me luck.  I am almost sure my first choice is so original that it has not been taken yet.
Jake’s Mom

Tonite I was scheduled to eat with a lady friend from a previous employer.  We were scheduled to meet for a late dinner at 7pm at Grady’s.
I arrived on the dot and told the hostess I was meeting a friend and gave her the name.  She was taking me to the table when I saw someone I knew.  As I was turning the corner following the waitress, there was Jake’s Dad on a dinner date.
We live in a big city with lots of places to eat.  What a coincidence.  This is the third time this has happened to me in 3 years!  I am never prepared for these things.  I have not seen him since the Memorial Garden dedication.

91,https://www.opendiary.com/m/j8xmom/dc-conference-5367995/,2001-07-13,DC Conference,"
This was a good trip.  I met a lot of wonderful people. There were 90 workshops to choose from!  I went to 7:
1.  The First 2 Years of Bereavement.  This showed me how “normal” I really am.  This was a good workshop.
2.  Children Hurt Too:  Helping and Understanding Your Child.  This was OK.  It talked about teenagers.
3.  Grief in the Workplace.  This was excellent!  I may suggest to our HR department to do something like this so people can understand “bereaved” employees.
4.  Creating a Financial Legacy in Memory of Your Child.  This was very interesting.
5.  My Music and How It Helped Me Through the Grieving.  This was a great workshop.  Cindy Bullens, a 2 time grammy nominee, conducted this workshop.  She told us how she lost her 11 y/o daughter to cancer in 1996 and how she wrote the beautiful songs that comprise her CD – Somewhere Between Heaven and Earth.  I bought her CD after hearing her sing and play her electric guitar.  She autographed her CD, too.  I was able to speak to her and tell her that her daughter and Jake had something in common – RED HAIR!  She also performed at the Friday and Saturday night dinners!
6.   With Bronze on Stone We Say Their Names:  Creating a Public Memorial to Our Children.  This was very interesting.  I am going to share this one with our local TCF chapter.  Maybe we can fund a bench in the park with our children’s names etched in stone.
7.  How Can We Get Our Book Published.  I found this one very interesting, too.  I thought about publishing my OD, but I didn’t want to let Butch “out of the bag”…LOL!
Anyway, it was a nice break from here to get away.  The 2 Mile Walk to Remember was the highlight of my trip.  I love to be outside and enjoyed walking with the 1000 people there!  I hit Starbucks on the way back to my starting point and that was so yummy!  I should have gotten a cold drink like a frappacino because it was so warm back there …and humid…ugh!
I also attended a sharing session after dinner Saturday night.  I shared my Random Acts of Kindness stories and gave out several cards!  They seemed to like the idea.  I enjoyed telling them how I used the cards, too.  I left these cards in the St. Louis and Reagan International airports.  I left them at payphones with some change.  I also tipped the maids with these cards plus $ because you know those hotels make lots of $$, but the worker bees make a pittance.
TCF made a video of all our children..”gone too soon”…and showed it at both dinners.  I remember having my mouth full when I saw Jake’s picture on the screen when I starting pointing and saying, “There’s Jake!”  I normally don’t talk with my mouth full, but I wanted people to see my little guy before he disappeared off the screen.  It was his picture in the go-cart – the close up picture that I have on my buttons!
It was an EXPENSIVE trip!  My dinner on Thursday night when I arrived was about $25!  I stayed at the Hyatt Regency-Crystal City.  This is the hotel that hosted the conference.  I ate at the rooftop grill to see the beautiful view of DC.  I ordered a crabcake sandwich with fries and an iced tea.  When the waitress brought my ticket and I saw that the tea was $2.95, I wondered if she charged by the glass or pitcher! LOL.
Well, I discovered McDonalds on Friday morning and thought I was in Heaven…but I couldn’t find Jake!  It was nice to have food and something to drink for less than $4.  A bagel with cream cheese at the Conference was $3.25.  Coffee was around $2/cup!  Lunch was too ridiculous to write about.  I skipped lunch on Friday and Saturday and napped!
I remember coming to my room after dinner Friday night and decided to have a drink of the bottled water in my room.  I opened the small bottle and as I was drinking my second glass, I noticed the tag on the bottle said I would be billed almost $6 for drinking this water!  That was enough to make me choke on my second glass!  It is so nice to be home!  The cooler climate and rocky mountain scenery is more relaxing that the rush of the big city life in DC.
The next national conference will be in July, 2002.  It will be held in Salt Lake City, Utah.  I have never been to Mormom country; I think I will make it a road trip next July and attend the conference!  The 2003 conference will be held in Atlanta, GA in July of 2003.  I am not sure about going to that one – the south is just too hot for me.  Andando talked about how hot Spain was in his OD and I started sweating just reading about it!
Take care.  I will see you in another entry soon.

…what that must feel like – to be truly loved by someone.
I noticed alot of things at the DC conference.  I noticed there were alot of kids there to attend the sibling workshops.  I thought that was so neat that they wanted to be there.  I know my girls are on vacation in the southeast.  I know they are having fun and would rather do that than go to a conference with me.  I just wonder what a nice warm feeling it would be to know that they are thinking of Jake…but I KNOW people grieve differently.
Another thing I noticed at the conference was all the men that accompanied their wives…cried with their wives…held their wives…  I was so amazed and envied all those women to have such special husbands.  I was able to actually shake their hands (husbands!) and get hugs.  Wow, what a concept.  Men so sensitive to accompany their wives to something so special as this DC conference.  You women are so lucky.  I have had to face this all alone.  Grieving alone is very sad and lonely.  
I hope one day I meet some special guy that realizes how much my kids mean to me.  I hope one day this special guy will walk into my life and miss Jake as much as we do.  I hope one day this special guy will hold me tight as I cry because I miss Jake.  One day this may happen and I can almost picture him walking in the mountains with Joe, Holly, me, and the girls.  We will watch the sunset and know that Jake is with us.  I can only imagine….but you have to believe in something…right?

I got up just after 5am this morning.  I went for a stroll in the neighborhood.
I walked up to Jake’s Memorial Garden and decided to be productive.  I started weeding the garden at 6am!  Can you imagine what people were thinking – seeing me bent over in a garden at that hour!?  LOL  There were quite a few weeds to pull.  After I was done, I grabbed up the mess of weeds and walked over to a nearby trash can and made an enormous contribution.
Anyway, as I was walking home, I felt good about myself.  I felt I had done something useful this morning and that somehow Jake was with me.
Gotta run and get ready for work.  It is 6:37am and I need to shower and hit the road!

P.S. I don’t know what happened to all the pictures I posted…I cannot even access the site I posted them at…photopoint.com.  I think they are having technical difficulties.  I just paid for a year’s membership, too, so I could continue to share Jake’s pictures with you!  Murphy’s Law in action again, I suppose.
Check out Helpinghands’ diary.  She wrote an entry in memory of Jake.

Do any of yall believe in signs from those who have left us?  
I have always heard people talk about them, but I have not had any from Jake unless………
B4 my girls left on vacation something interesting happened at dinner time.  I was fixing spaghetti and I fixed 4 plates and there have only been 3 of us since Jake left.  Wow – I was overcome with confusion.  As I was handing out the plates to the girls and was getting mine and heading to the table….there was an extra plate I fixed…..probably subconciously thinking of my little guy.  The fourth plate I fixed was sitting on the counter.  It was so strange that I did that!
Jake loved to eat and he loved my spaghetti.  Maybe he was stopping in to let me know he could smell dinner cooking.  He used to always come in from playing outside to tell me he could smell dinner cooking….”Hey Mom!  What’s for dinner?  It smells good!”…he would say ….I miss his sweet words and I miss him so much.
I am crying again so I must leave.  It is okay to cry, you know.  If I did not let it all out, I am sure I would just explode one day.
I love all you readers for listening to me and my stories about my special little boy.  We all miss him so much.
Jake – I launched a balloon for you Thursday night at the Compassionate Friends meeting.  I sent a note with it.  I sent my email address, too.  When you find a computer up there – email me, Son….I will be waiting patiently until I can hug you again and this time I will know nothing can ever come between us.  Maybe if they have Taco Bells up there, we can try one of those Gordito Crunches you told me about on September 23, 2000…our last lunch together at Taco Bell…I will never 4get our fun time that day, Jake……Love, Mom

95,https://www.opendiary.com/m/j8xmom/library-visit-4-5367999/,2001-07-20,Library Visit,"
This afternoon I went to the library.  I found a long overdue library book in Jake’s room in the Fall – after his accident.  It was a Goosebumps book.  I had asked him way b4 his accident did he have this book, because the library sent me an overdue notice…of course he said, “No, Mom.”
Well, I have been putting it off – taking the book back because it is one step closer to the fact that Jake is not going to be back to read it.  So I headed to the library around 4pm today.
I went to the “Fines” desk and gave the clerk my library card to look up any overdue books.  Wow!  I had almost $30 in fines!  I gave her the Goosebumps book and she charged me $2 for returning it instead of the $5 replacement fee.  There was also a book my girls – at least one of them – checked out and the charge was $16 for replacement.  I told the clerk I thought we had brought it back, but was not quite sure.  She decided to put a “search” on the book and not charge me today.  So I ended up paying less than the $30.
Anyway, I thanked the lady for taking time to catch me up to date on my account at the library.  I also apologized for the late Goosebumps book.  Then I told her I would like to donate a book to the library, “The Class in Room 44”.  I told her it was a grief book for children.  Then I told her about Jake’s gocart accident.  I had written a brief note on the inside cover of the book and enclosed a copy of the article on Jake’s accident plus a copy of my favorite picture of him driving his gocart.  Then I handed her the Random Act of Kindness card and left.
This was a hard task to accomplish!  It has been almost 10 months and I am beginning to try to accept the fact that Jake is not at summer camp.  He really went Home and not back to our house.  He will no longer be physically present in my everyday life.  This is hard to swallow.  I miss him and still think I will wake up and have breakfast with him.  Am I insane or what?  Why have they not taken me away in a straight jacket yet?
I will just look for more signs from him.  It will make each morning worth getting up for……it will b a game…a game Jake and I can play 4ever til I meet him..like hide and seek…..but saying, “ally ally in come free,” doesn’t work…sigh…..

..from vacationing back East in GA, FL, and NC.  
The girls came home on Tuesday.  I took Wednesday off to spend some time with them.  We relaxed in the backyard, drinking Starbucks’ Caramel Frappacinos..it was nice..having Mom and girl talktime…”quality time” is what all the psychologists call it.
I came home to have lunch with them on Thursday and Friday.
Today we went to the movies.  We saw “Legally Blonde”.  This was a great movie – funny.  You should check it out next time you are in the theaters.  
The girls surprised me – they bought me lunch and movie tickets!  This was a pleasant surprise.
I took them to the bank today so they could open a savings account.  They make so much money babysitting!  I thought it would be a good idea for them to have an account to put their money away for “rainey day” things.  The lady that helped us just could not get over how much they looked alike – LOL.  They look like night and day to me – but to strangers – they see them differently.
Ok – R U ready for my latest idea for a Random Act of Kindness?  I want to buy Jake’s 4th grade school supplies and donate them in a Random Act of Kindness box to his school.  I think kids 4get to bring their supplies to school or 4get to tell us moms what they need.
I would like to write a memo to explain the purpose of this box and laminate it on the box with his gocart picture.  Maybe others will contribute extra things to Jake’s box to help others.  What do U think?  If this sounds dumb, let me know.
I plan to put money in the box, too, for kids that 4get their lunch money, field trip money, snack money….
I just don’t want them to 4get Jake – am I selfish….?
  This is Renee sitting on my new retaining wall with Jake’s miniature garden in the background.  See the deer?  This is in my backyard.

Subject: A Good Reminder
(This is a commencement speech made by Anna Quindlen at Villanova) 
It’s a great honor for me to be the third member of my family to receive an honorary doctorate from this great university.  It’s an honor to follow my great Uncle Jim, who was a gifted physician, and my Uncle Jack, who is a remarkable businessman.  Both of them could have told you something important about their professions, about medicine or commerce. 
I have no specialized field of interest or expertise, which puts me at a disadvantage talking to you today.  I’m a novelist.  My work is human nature.  Real life is all I know.  Don’t ever confuse the two, your life and your work.  The second is only part of the first. 
Don’t ever forget what a friend once wrote Senator Paul Tsongas when the senator decided not to run for re-election because he had been diagnosed with cancer:  “No man ever said on his deathbed I wish I had spent more time at the office.” 
Don’t ever forget the words my father sent me on a postcard last year: “If you win the rat race, you’re still a rat.” 
Or what John Lennon wrote before he was gunned down in the driveway of the Dakota:  “Life is what happens while you are busy making other plans.” 
You will walk out of here this afternoon with only one thing that no one else has.  There will be hundreds of people out there with your same degree; there will be thousands of people doing what you want to do for a living.  But you will be the only person alive who has sole custody of your life.  Your particular life.  Your entire life.  Not just your life at a desk, or your life on a bus, or in a car, or at the computer.  Not just the life of your mind, but the life of your heart.  Not just your bank account but your soul. 
People don’t talk about the soul very much anymore.  It’s so much easier to write a resume than to craft a spirit.  But a resume is a cold comfort on a winter night, or when you’re sad, or broke, or lonely, or when you’ve gotten back the test results and they’re not so good. 
Here is my resume: 
I am a good mother to three children.  I have tried never to let my profession stand in the way of being a good parent.  I no longer consider myself the center of the universe.  I show up.  I listen.  I try to laugh.  I am a good friend to my husband.  I have tried to make marriage vows mean what they say.  I am a good friend to my friends, and they to me.  Without them, there would be nothing to say to you today, because I would be a cardboard cutout.  But I call them on the phone, and I meet them for lunch. 
I would be rotten, or at best mediocre at my job, if those other things were not true.  You cannot be really first rate at your work if your work is all you are. 
So here’s what I wanted to tell you today: 
Get a life.  A real life, not a manic pursuit of the next promotion, the bigger paycheck, the larger house.  Do you think you’d care so very much about those things if you blew an aneurysm one afternoon, or found a lump in your breast? 
Get a life in which you notice the smell of salt water pushing itself on a breeze over Seaside Heights, a life in which you stop and watch how a red  tailed hawk circles over the water or the way a baby scowls with concentration when she tries to pick up a Cheerio with her thumb and first finger.  Get a life in which you are not alone.  Find people you love, and who love you. 
And remember that love is not leisure, it is work.  Pick up the phone.  Send an e-mail.  Write a letter.  Get a life in which you are generous.  And realize that life is the best thing ever, and that you have no business taking it for granted.  Care so deeply about its goodness that you want to spread it around.
Take money you would have spent on beers and give it to charity.  Work in a soup kitchen.  Be a big brother or sister.  All of you want to do well.  But if you do not do good too, then doing well will never be enough.  It is so easy to waste our lives, our days, our hours, our minutes.  It is so easy to take for granted the color of our kids’ eyes, the way the melody in a symphony rises and falls and disappears and rises again.  It is so easy to exist instead of to live. 
I learned to live many years ago.  Something really, really bad happened to me, something that changed my life in ways that, if I had my druthers, it would never have been changed at all.  And what I learned from it is what, today, seems to be the hardest lesson of all.  I learned to love the journey, not the destination.  I learned that it is not a dress rehearsal, and that today is the only guarantee you get.  I learned to look at all the good in the world and try to give some of it back because I believed in it, completely and utterly.  And I tried to do that, in part, by telling others what I had learned.  By telling them this: Consider the lilies of the field.  Look at the fuzz on a baby’s ear.  Read in the backyard with the sun on your face.  Learn to be happy.  And think of life as a terminal illness, because if you do, you will live it with joy and passion as it ought to be lived.
———————————————————
I liked this email and it says alot.  If you read it too quickly – please read it again slowly and savor each word.
This is what jumped out at me….”It is so easy to take for granted the color of our kids’ eyes….”  
I will always remember Jake’s eyes because he has my eyes.  He has my heart, too.

Not much else to report.  Long and tiring week.  I haven’t taken my Prozac in at least 4 days.  I thought it made me tired, but maybe I am tired just cuz I am TIRED.
Took the girls out to eat at Souper Salad.  They really liked the waitress.  They told me, “Big tip, Mom!”  LOL -they are so good at spending my money – LOL.
I have some pics to share so I will share really soon.
I did want to tell you a few things in my backyard garden are:  snapdragons (different colors), geraniums, daiseys, decorative grass, mugho pines, bleeding hearts (plants – not mine!), roses, etc.  I will share more pics.

I saw this picture in my oldest son’s photo album several months ago.  I think it was at Easter.  I looked at it briefly.  I will never forget the day that picture was taken – it was on my birthday in December 1999.  
My kids surprised me with an assortment of bath stuff when I woke up that morning.  They even ran a bath of water with bubblegum bubblebath.  They hooked up my boom blaster in the bathroom and put on my favorite country station CS 102.  I lounged in that tub to my hearts content and they entertained each other until I came out.
Boy!  That hot tub drained me.  I got dressed and went right to bed to take a midmorning nap!
This picture was taken after I woke up.  My kids made my birthday so special.  I will never 4get that day.
I asked my oldest son for this picture so I could scan it.  I think I am going to get it enlarged to put in my room.
I miss Jake – he had my eyes and my heart.  When he left in September…a part of me went with him.
This OD has been the best thing for me…to talk and have you listen.  I love you all – even the bad note leavers.  Life is too short to be judgemental.

My neighbors had alot of extra flowers she did not plant and she gave them to me.
Today after work, I planted them in my wheelbarrow!  Yep – I put that ole rusty garden utensil to good use, I hope.  Most of the flowers were on their last leg…so I don’t know how they will turn out.  I will take a picture of this creation and post it for all of you to see.
I plan to put some Plant Power on them.  This is a super flower and plant helper!  Market America distributes this product.  Along with Lawn Power – Plant Power has done miracles for me!
Well, it is quiet tonite.  My girls are attending a sleepover bday party tonite.  They are supposed to go out to see a movie, too.  I am sure they will fill me in with all the details sometime tomorrow.
I am throwing my girls a “back-to-school” party in a couple weeks – why I suggested this idea I will never know!  Anyway, my friend is going to make a nice cake for it.  I told her to write this on the cake:  Class of 2005…maybe            LOL!
I still have to take them shopping, too.  Where does all the time go?
Next month is going to be a hard month for me!  Help me make it through…dear readers…….I feel the sadness coming on full force……..

…the rose bush that was destined to possibly not make it in Jake’s garden.

Yep, I was told roses are hard to grow in Colorado.  I always thought roses were beautiful and admired those in my neighborhood when I went walking.  Now I have a special rosebush in Jake’s backyard garden.  I have successfully made it happen!
Please go to Andando’s OD and thank him for successfully teaching me how to post pictures. He is such a wonderful person.  His garden diary entries inspired me to try my hand at gardening.  It has been a very therapeutic thing for me and keeps me focused at times.
I have been very tired lately.  I am wondering what is wrong with me.  I thought the Prozac made me tired so I started taking it at night.  Then I decided on my own…not doctor-directed….that I didn’t need this medication anymore so I was weaning myself from it.  I would skip like 2or 3 days and go without it.  Then a friend said that depression caused fatigue, so I resumed the meds.  For some reason I am still tired.  I am wondering if the blood donation I did at work on July 22d made me anemic…..who knows……but I was so tired today that I left work at 2:30pm and came home and went to bed.  I got out of bed around 7:45pm and now it is 10:19pm and I am struggling to stay awake.
Good night OD land…..til tomorrow.

Hey, my best friend in 8th grade lives in GA and she has been reading my diary.  She just sent me this email and it made me smile.  I thought I would copy and paste it in here for you to read.  Her name is Rhonda and we both thought this one guy was so cute in Middle School and High School.  His name is Sam.  When I met up with Rhonda at our 10th High School reunion – we found out he was gay!  
Anyway – here is the email she sent to me:
ALso…..
You were the shortest person in 8th grade!
You used to write, on a daily basis, comments about
your peers in those “Slapstick” books (were they
called that)  – remember those books that you had to
sign in and then answer questions about “stuff?”
You were a fun loving, joking, wonderful friend
You grew up across the street from a lot of dead
people!
You used to hide in the 8th grade bathroom from
annoying friends (Regina)
Your mom made all those cool pants for you to wear to
school
You look the same as you did in 8th grade – you
haven’t aged a bit
Oh well, I could probably come up with a lot more to
add to your collection – but gotta go.

Wow..time flies…too quickly.
Saturday was High School orientation for Freshman parents…that would be me for the girls.  Yes, they are in high school this year.  I must be really getting old.
Saturday afternoon I did the Back to School Party thing with my girls.  They invited about 10+ people.  Of the crowd…only one boy.  I think the boy really liked being the center of attention.
We grilled hotdogs and had chips and soda.  My friend made me a cake with a Fall theme and the words…Class of 2005…maybe….LOL!  It was a  beautiful cake and very tasty!  So the party lasted from 2 – 8pm.
Sunday we were up early because the girls had an appointment at the University of Denver to participate in a Twin Study.  Yea…they have been studying my girls since they were 7 months old….and me!  LOL – yea – they have videos with me in there, too.  The girls were very tired since they babysat til 3:30am Saturday morning, but they earned $70 each!  So it  was not too bad for them.  I earned $25 for filling out some long questionaires + mileage reimbursement + $20 to go out and eat lunch.  Some university studies are worthwhile.
After returning to town around 5:30pm – we did the school supply shopping thing and then finally got home.  I put the girls in charge of housework and I cut the lawns.  They got the better end of the deal…trust me!
Today was their first day in High School.  They were so excited and a bit nervous and scared.  I was the designated carpool Mom – so we were out the door by 7:20am to pick up 2 more neighborhood girls and off to school.  The car was filled with some interesting conversations…..
Anyway..just thought I would catch you up on my life.
It was a bittersweet day – first day of school for the girls – first time school has started 6 years and Jake was not with us….
I miss him and cannot understand why this has happened to all of us….still
Jake’s Mom
P.S.  If you are reading this Kyle – let me know how your school day is going in Australia.  I love those 10 year old hugs you are sending me thru OD.  Tell your Mom thanks for sharing you with me.  Send me some more emails.

Hey – I just wanted to share something with you guys.
I read in a magazine about Back to School Treat bags and decided to make my girls some.
I started collecting things I thought they might like:
Gel Pens
Jewelry (from Delias.com)
Buttons to pin on their shirts (from Delias.com)
Keychains that look like cell phones – you open them up and there is lip gloss inside
Little books for notes:  Hottie Book and Secret Crush Book (from Delias.com)
Pagers (I ended up giving them these last week!)
Hair gel
Bath gel
Discount cards (high school cards sold by the football team that give discounts at several fast food joints)
Then I took out two plain brownbag lunch bags and decorated them with stickers:
Good Luck Becky
Class of 2005
Go Freshman!
Ditto for Renee….
Then I closed each bag with clothespins.
Then I stuck some more decorative stickers on them and poured packing bubbles in the bags to fill them up.
They loved them!
I was worried that it might be a bit “juvenile” for them, but it was a success.  I told them to get used to it because without Jake I have nobody to make things for anymore……

I just wanted to share another email for you to read that was passed on to me.  It says alot!  There is alot of meaning in this email.  So…all you mothers …..take pride in your number one job:  Being a Mother!
__________________________________________________________________________________________
I’m Just a Mother? Excuse Me???
A few months ago, when I was picking up the children at school, another mother I knew well rushed up to me.
Emily was fuming with indignation. “Do you know what you and I are?” she demanded.  Before I could answer and I didn’t really have one handy she  blurted out the reason for her question.  It seemed she had just returned from renewing her driver’s license at The County Clerk’s office.  Asked by the woman recorder to state her occupation, Emily had  hesitated,  uncertain how to classify herself.
“What I mean is,” explained the recorder, “do you have a job, or are you just a …..?”
“Of course I have a job,” snapped Emily. “I’m a mother.”   “We don’t list ‘mother’ as an occupation. “Housewife’ covers it,” said the recorder emphatically.
I forgot all about her story until one day I found myself in the same situation, this time at our own Town Hall. The Clerk was obviously a career woman, poised, efficient, and possessed of a high-sounding  title like “Official Interrogator” or “Town Registrar.”
“And what is your occupation?” she probed. What made me say it, I do not know.  The words simply popped out. “I’m a Research Associate in the field of Child Development and Human Relations.”
The clerk paused, ball-point pen frozen in midair, and  looked up though she had not heard right.  I repeated the title slowly, emphasizing the most significant words. Then I stared with wonder as my pompous pronouncement was written in bold, black ink on the official questionnaire.  “Might I  ask,” said the clerk with new interest, “just what you do in
your  field?”
Coolly, without any trace of fluster in my voice, I heard myself reply, “I have a continuing program of research (what mother doesn’t) in the laboratory and in the field (normally I would have said indoors and out).  I’m working for my Masters (the whole darned family) and already have four credits (all daughters). “Of course, the job is one of the most
demanding in the humanities (any mother care to disagree?) and I often work 14 hours a day (24 is more like it).  But the job is more challenging than most run-of-the-mill careers and the rewards are in satisfaction rather than just money.”  There was an increasing note of respect in the clerk’s voice as she completed the form, stood up, and personally ushered
me to the door.
As I drove into our driveway, buoyed up by my glamorous new career, I was  greeted by my lab assistants – ages 13, 7, and 3.  Upstairs I could hear our new experimental model (6 months) in the child-development program, testing out a new vocal pattern.
I felt triumphant!  I had scored a beat on bureaucracy! And I had gone on the official records as someone more distinguished and indispensable to mankind than “just another mother.”
Motherhood…what a glorious career. Especially when there’s a title  on the door.
Send this to another Mother you know.  Whether a stay at home Mom or a career Mom, we should all carry this title.

109,https://www.opendiary.com/m/j8xmom/frisbees-and-cats-5368013/,2001-08-27,Frisbees and Cats,"
Guess what?!  I have discovered a new use for frisbees.  Do you remember what these are?  They are those flat saucer shaped toys that you throw around to entertain yourself.  LOL.  I am sure you have heard the game of “ultimate frisbee”.
Anyway, my cats have been driving me crazy!  My kids found a kitten last August – about a year ago – in the backyard.  It had somehow became separated from her mom during a torrential rainstorm.  They found her in the backyard under a rug that had blown off the deck during the storm.  We adopted the kitten and named her Nova.  Well, she took up really well with another cat member of the family – Selena.  Selena was given to us by my neigbor’s friend who could no longer keep her in their apartment.
Well, Selena, died about a month after Jake’s accident.  I think she was hit by a car.  I discovered her lying in my driveway.  I think someone hit her and brought her home because she had tags on her listing who she belonged to.  That was a tragic rainey day in October last year.
Well, after Selena left us, I felt that Nova was lonely.  She was less than a month old when we found her and Selena kinda mothered her a bit.  Selena was about 2 or 3 years old.  So I decided to find Nova a playmate/companion at the Humane Society.  We were initially looking for another young kitten …6 months old or less, but there were none available.  My daughter insisted that I adopt this older cat – Haley.  Haley was about 3 years old.  So I did.  I brought her home and she was quite timid and jumpy.  I think she was abused at one time in her life.  After about a week or so she became more relaxed.
The first thing I did not like about Haley and learned about cats is that cats DO NOT share a litter box.  It must be some cat custom or something.  Haley decided she would let me know this by leaving some smelly tootsie roll objects by my sofa.  The first time I saw this I immediately showed her the litter box.  She did not like sharing a litterbox.  How did I discover this?  I bought a new litter box and put it where she left me those unwelcome tootsie rolls and put her in it and told her this is where she was to do her “business”.  Then she seemed to catch on really quick!
But unbeknowst to me, after several weeks, I decided she should be used to the new abode and could share a litter box with Nova.  So, I put one litter box away and guess what?  Yep – those tootsie rolls reappeared by my sofa.  Boy!  This made me mega tense with that #%@% cat!  So back to two litter boxes we went again.
This seemed to work just fine until several weeks later…those tootsie rolls appeared again!  So, I took Haley out to punish her.  I put her in the garage for quite a few days.  She had food and water and a litter box out there, too!
Eventually I let her come in again when she could behave.  But each time those not store-bought tootsie rolls appeared…out she went to the garage! 
Well, it was during this period of punishment of Haley that I noticed something!  She was outside all day in the garage, but tootsie rolls appeared again!  Darn cat!  It was Nova!  It was probably Nova all along.  She was probably doing this to watch me punish Haley!  Boy!  We don’t give cats enough credit for their intelligence!
Anyway, to make a long story short, these cats keep me busy!
So what does this have to do with Frisbees?  Well, I am getting there.
During one of the punishment ordeals with Haley in the garage, I noticed Jake’s frisbee was flipped over like a bowl.  Guess what!  You are not going to believe this!  Haley was using his frisbee as a toilet!  Now, I have heard you can train cats to use the toilet in your house, but how many people can train a cat to use the frisbee!
I think I have driven this cat crazy!

1.  His favorite color is green.  I never knew.  His sister shared this with me.
2.  His favorite drink is a “Suicide”.  He takes his drink cup at the restaurant (Hardees, Capt. D’s, etc.) and fills it up with a little bit of everything.  He let me taste it one time.  It has an interesting sweet taste.  I prefer drinking water.
3.  He loved people.
4.  People loved him.
5.  He never met a stranger.
6.  He loved things that went fast.  
7.  He loved to skateboard.  I always worried about him when he did tricks on his skateboard.  He always wanted to skateboard in the parking lot at Albertsons when I went shopping, but I would not allow it.  I felt it was unsafe.  He always got mad at me….but he got over it.
8.  He loved to ride his bike and have his hair blowing in the wind.
9.  He loved to do his “Detroit Lean” as he was cruising in his gocart.

14. He liked to watch “Who Wants to Be a Millionaire” with me.
15. I miss him so much.  I hope he misses us, too.

I am having dinner with Jake’s 2d and 3d grade teacher.  It is one teacher who taught Jake in two different grades.
I am excited.  I have alot to show her.  She is coming to my house for dinner.  I plan to eat on the new deck so she can see Jake’s special garden in the backyard!
I am going to fix a potroast, potatoes, carrots, brown rice, and a salad.  We are going to have peach cobbler with French Vanilla ice-cream for dessert.
She is bringing me pictures from the Memorial Garden dedication held in May.  She is also bringing me a picture made by a student for Jake.  I am so excited!
I will scan the pictures and post them in my diary!
I have been sooooo tired lately.  I fall asleep easily in meetings at work or during discussions with co-workers.  Do you think there is something wrong with me?  I wonder if I have narcolepsy – when you fall asleep during the daytime.
I am going to buy some iron pills and see if it helps any.

The Labor Day weekend went well.  Stayed out on the deck for most of it.  I will post a picture of the deck soon.
I decided I would see my doctor about all this fatigue.  I hope it is depression.  My appointment is September 24…of all days…the anniversary date of Jake’s accident.  Maybe I will be too tired to get up for that 8:45am appointment.  I am planning to take the day off that Monday.  I don’t think I would be 100% efficient at work on that day.

I wish all you OD readers could come over and drink coffee with me on Saturday mornings out here.
I have been so happy since this was built.  The guy that did this is awesome!  He understood me very well and built this so my kids and I could have a private place to visit and remember our wonderful family member who left us too soon…Jake.
I miss you so much, Jake!  You would love this deck.  You and I could eat our oatmeal out here in the early mornings and watch the birds and squirrels.  I am sure your view from your strategic Heavenly location is more awesome.  I miss you so much son…all of us miss you.

117,https://www.opendiary.com/m/j8xmom/his-room-5368021/,2001-09-07,His Room,"
I have reached a difficult situation in my home.  One of my girls wants her own room.  We have 2 to choose from – Jake’s and this spare one with the computer in it.  Jake’s room is downstairs next to the girls’ room.  The computer room is upstairs.
I think it would be easiest to move her into Jake’s room.  She would like that and she plans to have some of his personal belongings become a permanent part of her room.  For example, Jake has a wooden treasure box with skeletons on it.  His Aunt made it for him for Christmas one year.  Becky really likes this and wants to keep it in her new room with his skateboard and some other items.
The problem is Becky’s twin is angry that Becky would change his room and cannot believe Becky wants to move in there!  She has really told us some angry words.
I think Becky’s sister – Renee is not processing her grief very positively or at all.  I took them both to counseling and they both did not like it.  They do not like to discuss their brother with strangers.
I am in quite the dilemma.  I told Becky I would not participate much in the transition because I do not function well at all in his room at this time.  I do plan to try to think it through in my quiet time.
Becky would like us to paint his room to brighten it up like we did their room 2 years ago.  Painting a room is quite a job!  We did some critical research in selecting the paint for their room.  We blended two colors and did the WallMagic paint job.  It turned out very nice and peaceful.  We ordered their bedding from a Brylane catalog and matched the paint we wanted off the catalog picture.  We also special ordered the butterfly border to go along the trim.  The most expensive part was their beds.  They were using a bunkbed that was a double bed on the bottom and a single bed on top.  It was an old frame that I bought from a friend.  Well, when I was trying to move the frame across the room to paint a wall, I broke the frame!  Wow – what an expensive move!  I bought them new single beds with solid oak bookcase headboards and that was quite an investment!
Anyway, I was reading their CosmoGIRL magazine and came acoss an interesting article on “cool rooms”.  You can send a picture of your room into this address with a letter on why you think you need a room facelift (150 words or less) and you could win a room makeover!  I think I am going to do this and explain Jake’s story.  Maybe they can do a great room with a taste of Jake in there, too!  I am not going to tell the girls though.  They would die if they knew I read CosmoGIRL magazine!
The address for this “cool room” idea is:  CosmoGIRL Magazine,  Box 1404, Radio City Station, New York, NY  10101-1404.  Check out the Oct 2001 CosmoGIRL mag and turn to pages 104-105.

119,https://www.opendiary.com/m/j8xmom/the-surprise-package-contained-5368023/,2001-09-08,The Surprise Package Contained….,"
…3 very interesting items.
The first item I pulled out was a a fleece pig’s face.  It is huge!  It is pink and can be used to hold a large pillow.  I laughed when I pulled this out.  I gave it to Becky.  She wanted it to put in her room.
Item number two was a pair of wooden screens that you put on your window sill for privacy.  They are really cute and country looking.  They have a barnyard scene painted on them.  The have cows on them.  I put them in my spare bedroom upstairs so when I am on the computer at night I can have some privacy.  I have the cows facing the outside so the neighbors will be pleasantly surprised to see them staring right back at them!  LOL!
Item number three was precious.  This box contained two porcelain dolls with a certificate of authenticity.  Renee just fell in love with them and gave them to the 9 year old girl she babysits.  This little girl collects porcelain dolls in her room.  I was actually out to her house yesterday afternoon and she invited me into her room to see her collection.  They are beautiful and she showed me the special shelf she choose for the two additions that Renee gave her.
I have decided that I am going to order about 5 of these surprise boxes and put them under my XMAS tree this year.  Why?  Because I will be home alone this year and I have to have something to look forward to!  I will put tags on each box:  To Mom from Jake, To Mom from Renee, To Mom from Becky, To Mom from Joe and Holly, and To Mom from Santa!
The girls are going to North Carolina with their Dad and his family this year.  My oldest son and his wife will be spending Christmas with her parents.  This is their first XMAS with her family in 2 years because they just returned from an assignment to Egypt. 
I will have to write all about it in OD – so stay tuned for Patty’s special Christmas 2001!

Becky and I worked in Jake’s room last night.  Taking apart the beds was a task – one Jake would have enjoyed.  He loved taking things apart – he wasn’t too skilled on bringing them back together…but that is another entry….
We decided that Jake is a part of our hearts and life forever and that toys are NOT Jake.  We did set aside a few sentimental items to be placed in various areas of our home.  I could only do so much last night.  I helped Becky move her bed into his room and she slept there last night.
It was interesting to hear music coming from a once quiet room and see lights on in there from the deck.  I have alot of mixed emotions that I cannot discuss at this moment.
His closet and clothes are going to be a very hard chore for me.  I definitely will keep his school work for now because THAT is Jake’s accomplishments.  I will keep his first and only soccer trophy – he played one season.  This will probably have a special place at my office.  His skateboard and treasure box will be a part of Becky’s personal belongings, too.
I gave his largest squirt gun to my neighbor girl – Meagan.  She is 6 and she has great stories on how Jake terrorized the neighborhood kids in a squirt gun battle.  So now Meagan is the owner of Jake’s “lethal weapon”.  Jake would fill this squirt gun to the brim and it would take all he could muster to tote it around the neighborhood.  I have at least 3 more to hang on to …maybe for his school buddies.
There is a lady in Rye Colorado that makes stuffed bears out of favorite clothing.  Becky and I each plan to send her a shirt of Jake’s – his wild Hawaiian shirts – and have her make them into stuffed bears.  I will put his necklaces on them and they will be a permanent part of our rooms.  Renee is not ready for this step – so in time she can choose whatever she wants to remember her brother.
All the pictures that his school buddies drew have been matted and presented to me.  I will have them all framed and hung throughout my house.  I will not give any to Jake’s Dad because I feel he will just toss them in the trash like he has other belongings of Jake.  Children have always meant alot to me and their work is something to be treasured..so these pictures will be the Monet and Picasso prints hung throughout my home.  I will be sure to share these with you in the future.  Of course there will be original framed art of Jake’s,too.
Ok – I must leave now – I feel a surge of sadness enroute and I need to go to work.
I love you all and your support has been phenomenol!
Jake’s sad mom…..

Well, I hosted a Party Light candle party at my place on Wednesday night.  If you don’t know what this is…Party Light candles are sold like Tupperware and Pampered Chef stuff…through home parties and catalogs.
Anyway, it was fun.  I had about 17 people show up for it and have earned at least $150 in free stuff so far.
The holiday catalog has alot of neat things for the upcoming holidays…Halloween, Thanksgiving, XMAS…etc.  I love the scent of all the candles!
Just for hosting a party, I was entitled to some great holiday discounts!  
It was fun.  You know me…I light candles.  I think I am going to order the votive holder that looks like a golf ball and sits upon some golf tees.  I will order this with some peach scented votives and set it in a special place by Jake’s picture and some special memories.  What do you OD readers think about that?
I miss him soooo much.  I quit taking my Prozac because it will never make me the same without Jake.  It is just a crutch.
I will always be heartbroken and sad because my heart is missing a special part….Jake.  I don’t want medication to keep me from missing him……

I have a very special daughter that I have not told you about.  Her name is Thulasamma.  She lives in India.  I have sponsored her since she was about 4 years old.  It costs so little to provide so much for a child who struggles everyday just to survive.
I recently received a letter from her through her caseworker.  Thulasamma and her family and her community were very sad to hear about Jake.  The village was very sad for me and my family and mourned our loss.  They placed his picture in  a frame in their home.  I was so touched to hear from them.  They live in Karnataka, India.
My sponsored little girl will be 10 years old on 25 Dec 01.  I never forget her birthday.
I originally sponsored her so my girls could learn more geography and understand other cultures, but they lost interest very quickly.  They were only 9 or 10 when I sponsored Thulasamma.
If you are interested in sponsoring a child for $21.00/month – tax deductible – let me know!  You can write Christian Children’s Fund, 2821 Emerywood Parkway, Richmond, VA  23294 and request a child (boy or girl) from several countries!  I requested a child that is most needy.  It is very rewarding to know you can do so much for so little.  I am sure people waste $21.00/month on less rewarding experiences.  Below is a picture of my Indian little girl.
My lastest letter from India told me she has  2 goats and 2 cows and takes great care of them!  I cannot even get my American kids to change the litter box or feed and water their 2 cats!  Imagine that!

Jake’s 3rd grade teacher at his school called me Thursday night.  She asked if I would be interested in coming to his school Saturday afternoon to meet at his garden for a ‘celebration’ of Jake.  I said I would.  I was so moved that people have not forgotten Jake.
The Saturday afternoon celebration was very nice.  We said a prayer for Jake and the others on the East coast that lost their lives on September 11, 2001.  
We shared memories of Jake and I was able to talk to the kids about what “really” happened to Jake – head injury -brain death, etc.  I told them Jake died like the babies that die from “Shaken Baby Syndrome”.  I was asked about him being on “machines” and was able to explain to the kids that Jake was already gone, but his body was kept alive for organ donation.  I was also able to tell them that Jake looked fine…like he was sleeping.  I was asked how the car hit him and was I able to tell Jake goodbye.  I told them Jake was gone when I went to the hospital was able to hold his hand one last time.
Two of the boys and their Moms came to visit me at home afterwards to see Jake’s garden in my backyard.  It was nice to share memories of Jake, but I still cry and miss him so very much.
Tomorrow – September 24, 2001 – will be the one year anniversary of his fatal accident.  Please light a candle in Jake’s memory and say a little prayer and let him know we all miss him so very much.
I will be taking the day off tomorrow.  Tomorrow is my day with Jake.  I can cry as much as I want and can take off the “mask” I wear each day to greet the world.  Tomorrow is “Jake’s Day”.
I have a doctor’s appointment in the morning and then I plan to go visit with Jake.  I will return to visit again in the late afternoon with the rest of my kids.
I still don’t understand why I have to go visit my little boy in the cemetary.  Why can’t he and I have our oatmeal every morning like we used to?  Why can’t we both laugh together anymore?  Why is his seat always empty at the dinner table?  Why did this happen to a little boy who just loved life and his family?
I don’t know why he had to leave, but I know he never left my heart.  Unlike Jake, I cannot be an organ donor because my heart is broken.  A broke heart can’t help anyone….I am sorry…but I will donate the rest of my organs.

You were so filled with excitement and energy that morning.  I close my eyes and replay that day over and over again.  I try so hard to remember that last hug you gave me.  I just never knew it would be the last time I hugged you and told you “I love you” back.  I just never knew you would never come home again.  I just never knew what it would be like to face living life without you, son.
It has been so hard for all of us, Jake.  Your friends miss you so much, Jake.  I met one of your friends on Saturday.  His name is Tyler B.  You and Tyler rode your skateboards together.  He was in the 4th grade and you were in the 3rd grade at Fremont.  He is now a 5th grader going to Keller.  He came to visit your garden in our backyard on Saturday.  He and his mother came.  Also, another nice Mom and her son Josh came to see your garden, too.  Josh did not know you, but he came to the ceremony on Saturday with his Mom.  They came to celebrate your wonderful memories, Jake.  People that don’t even know you want to be a part of you and your life Jake.  You are loved by so many people.  It just amazes me how much your loss has impacted so many people.
I am taking today off from work to spend it with you, son.  I will be going to the cemetary with your brother and sisters, too.  It will be so hard.  We will all cry so much.  But it is okay, Jake.  Our tears fall because we remember you.  I hope to be crying for the rest of my life because you meant so much to all of us.
Love, 
Mom

Wednesday, September 05, 2001 9:43 AM
ARKANSAS CITY (EAP) — A Little Rock woman was killed yesterday after
leaping through her moving car’s sun roof during an incident best
described as “a mistaken rapture” by dozens of eye witnesses.  Thirteen
other people were injured after a twenty-car pile up resulted from
people trying to avoid hitting the woman who was apparently convinced
that the rapture was occurring when she saw twelve people floating up
into the air, and then passed a man on the side of the road who she
claimed was Jesus.
“She started screaming ‘He’s back, he’s back” and climbed right out of
the sunroof and jumped off the roof of the car,” said Everett Williams,
husband of 28 year-old Georgann Williams who was pronounced dead at the
scene. “I was slowing down but she wouldn’t wait till I stopped,”
Williams said. “She thought the rapture was happening and was convinced
that Jesus was gonna lift her up into the sky,” he went on to say.
“This is the strangest thing I’ve seen since I’ve been on the force,”
said Paul Madison, first officer on the scene.
Madison questioned the man who looked like Jesus and discovered that he
was dressed up as Jesus and was on his way to a toga costume party when
the tarp covering the bed of his pickup truck came loose and released
twelve blow up sex dolls filled with helium which floated up into the
air.
Ernie Jerkins, 32, of Fort Smith, who’s been told by several of his
friends that he looks like Jesus, pulled over and lifted his arms into
the air in frustration, and said “Come back here,” just as the Williams’
car passed him, and Mrs. Williams was sure that it was Jesus lifting
people up into the sky as they passed by him, according to her husband,
who says his wife loved Jesus more than anything else.  When asked for
comments about the twelve sex dolls, Jenkins replied “This is all just
too weird for me. I never expected anything like this to happen.”

…and left them at my door on Tuesday morning.  There were 3 of them – 2 purple ones and 1 pink.  The card had my name on it.  I opened the card.  It said, “You are in our thoughts and prayers today.”  It was signed by a neighbor up the street.  She was a lady that Jake obviously knew and visited as he walked to school, rode his bike, or skateboarded by her house.
These flowers brought me comfort.  Because I know someone else knows what I really lost when I lost my little boy that Sunday afternoon…a year ago.  She knew Jake.  He talked with her and waved to her.  She remembers that redheaded little boy who was so full of life.  She was so lucky to have met him.  He left so soon.
I miss him.

…since I last wrote to you.  I have been so busy with work and the family.
It is Fall in Colorado and it is beautiful.  The leaves are changing colors and I think of Jake so much.  I always pointed out my neighbor’s beautiful maple tree to Jake.  I always said, “That tree is so beautiful.  I wish we had one, don’t you?”  He would always laugh and say, “Oh, Mom!  You really want one of those trees don’t ya?  You always talk about it when you look over there.”  Now I have nobody to share this beautiful tree conversation with.  I miss Jake so much.
I will try to post some pictures of the changing colors for all of you.  First, I have to take the pictures..so don’t hold your breath!
Grief is a strange thing.  When you think you are doing okay – you take an emotional nose dive.  I am so lonely without Jake.  Yes, I have my other kids, but that “little boy” laughter and mischief is gone and I miss him.
Our company is doing some lay offs and terminations.  My days are numbered, but I am okay.  Losing Jake was the worst thing in my life…jobs are a dime a dozen…Jake is not coming home.  No job stress for me.  I have pegged my stress meter long ago.
I think I would like to own my own business …how does this sound …”Maid With a Masters!”  I think it is creative enough to attract some clients.
I may consider the teaching career field – public school teaching.  I am sure that would be a challenge!
How about a home childcare business?  I would have alot of laughter and mischief once again.  It would not replace Jake, but it would help me feel the void a tad.  I could call my business “Jake’s Place” in his memory.
Well, I am going to volunteer to speak about organ donation and my loss.  I am attending a workshop on 12 Oct – finally…a Friday night is booked!  Yay!  I will let you know what that workshop was like when it is over.
Maybe I will just do the workshop and consider speaking.  I don’t think I am ready to stand up in front of people and talk about Jake yet.  Then again, maybe I will because it is OK TO CRY!  Maybe I will wear a WWF wrestling shirt with Stone Cold on the front when I speak in front of people.  Jake loved WWF.  I wonder if they make t-shirts big enough for middle aged women that have Stone Cold’s face on the front?  LOL!  Maybe I will wear some baggy Pipes jeans.  Jake would probably roll with laughter seeing his Mom trying to look “tight” – that is the cool word these days – trust me – don’t take it literally – I don’t wear tight clothes. Middle age women wear elastic banded pants – at least some of us.  Hey, that gives me another business idea…maybe I will open a boutique for short middle aged women that are not anorexic and call it “Chunkies”…LOL!
I am just on a roll tonite with these business opportunities to bring to fruition.
Well, this was a long entry tonite.  It amazes me what I can write about these days.
Good night OD Land.  
Good night, Jake.  I love you and miss you sooooo much.
I was wondering…when I leave this world and don’t make it to Heaven to see Jake, do you think they would let me ride the elevator up to see him if I asked?  I hope so.  I just have to see him as soon as I leave this world.

I like to read about fun things to do with your kids.  A long time ago – Jake was about 3 – I read about having fun in the winter doing a summer thing – like going to the beach.
One Saturday morning – probably a freezing morning in Colorado, I spread sheets all over the living room floor.  Then I poured bags of flour on the sheets – to pretend it was sand.  Then I let the kids put on their swimming suits and play at the fake beach in the living room!  They pretended they were at the beach!  They used cups and bowls as buckets and scooped the fake sand up!  They could even wear their sunglasses if they wanted, too.  I spread out beach towels so we could eat “on the beach” for lunch.  I eventually poured my bags of rice and grits on the sheets to supplement the flour as sand.  You know, grits are very dear to me, but I sacrificed them for a good reason.
I had forgotten about this fun day until recently.  My daughter reminded me how much fun it was for all of them.  I remember the neighbor kids looking thru the window thinking we were insane.  We were having an insanely amount of fun.  So this was my trip to the beach in January and it was cheap!  No tickets, gas, or packing.
I am so glad that I did this with the kids.  I am glad they remembered and shared it with me.  I imagine Jake had fun, too.
Just thought I would share this cheap thrill with all the mothers out there.  Can you imagine what an insanely fun home daycare business I could create!  Wow!

One day after a busy day at work and a busy day at school for the kids, I decided to have a special dinner.  Now how do fix a special dinner without too much time?  Easy.  I popped a couple frozen Tombstone pizzas into the oven.  They were ready in less than 20 minutes.  I cut up the pizza and served all the plates.  Then I lit a candle and turned off the lights.  We had a wonderful candlelight dinner.
Another tip – turn off the ringer on the phone so you do not have any interruptions.  Also, turn the TV off and enjoy each other’s company.
Today I washed the van and had the help of 3 little kids from next door – ages 4, 6, and 7.  I rewarded them with a trip to McDonalds.  It was fun.  I sure miss Jake.

She has Jake’s red hair and freckles.  She has his heart – big and compassionate.
She once stayed in Jake’s room a week to get away from her sister.  She and Jake had a blast.  They played his Playstation and Sega together.
She loved to fix Jake’s hair so he would look cool in school.  She loved to spike it and gel it.
She misses him so much.  She has moved into his room.  It has been about a month now.  
Jake would always stick up for her when she was ridiculed at school for her acne.  No, she doesn’t have acne now, but Accutane did the trick for her.
This entry is dedicated to my friend, Krystal.  Her OD is Cloudy.
Tomorrow or sometime soon, I will write about her sister, Renee.

Renee is very smart and does not really have to try hard in school.  She is an A and B student.
She is very generous.  She likes to play Santa’s elf at Christmas and surprise me on Christmas morning.
She always remembers my birthday, Mother’s Day, etc., and always has something special to give me.
She has Jake’s eyes – also – my eyes.  She misses him, but doesn’t speak his name often.  She works through her grief by writing.  She is the one who writes poetry. 
She likes the outdoors and went to turkey camp with her Dad and Jake in March of 2000.  
She would be the one to join Jake and me charging down a steep hill on a sled.  Her sister prefers to watch videos and camp out on the couch on cold days.
Renee is the tomboy.  Becky is the “girly girl”.
I love them both.  They are a blessing to me but can sure try my last nerve at times, too.

“I WISH YOU ENOUGH”
Recently I overheard a father and daughter in their last moments together. They had announced her plane departure and, standing near the security gate, they hugged and he said, “I love you. I wish you enough.”
She in turn said, “Daddy, our life together has been more than enough. Your love is all I ever needed. I wish you enough, too, Daddy.”
They kissed and she left. He walked over toward the window where I was seated. Standing there, I could see he wanted and needed to cry. I tried not to intrude on his privacy, but he welcomed me in by asking,”Did you ever say good-bye to someone knowing it would be forever?”
“Yes, I have,” I replied. Saying that brought back memories I had of expressing my love and appreciation for all my Dad had done for me. Recognizing that his days were limited, I took the time to tell him face to
face how much he meant to me. So I knew what this man was experiencing.
“Forgive me for asking, but why is this a forever good-bye?” I asked.
“I am old and she lives much too far away. I have challenges ahead and the reality is, the next trip back will be for my funeral,” he said.
“When you were saying good-bye I heard you say, ‘ I wish you enough. ‘May I ask what that means?”
He began to smile. “That’s a wish that has been handed down from other generations. My parents used to say it to everyone.” He paused for a moment; and looking up as if trying to remember it in detail, he smiled even
more.
“When we said ‘I wish you enough,’ we were wanting the other person to have a life filled with just enough good things to sustain them,” he continued, and then turning toward me he shared the following as if he were reciting it from memory.
“I wish you enough sun to keep your attitude bright.
I wish you enough rain to appreciate the sun more.
I wish you enough happiness to keep your spirit alive.
I wish you enough pain so that the smallest joys in life appear much bigger.
I wish you enough gain to satisfy your wanting.
I wish you enough loss to appreciate all that you possess.
I wish enough ‘Hello’s’ to get you through the final ‘Good-bye.’
He then smiled and, as he walked away, said softly, “I wish you enough.”
To my family and friends . . . I love you all, and I wish you enough!  We shouldn’t wait until the last chance we get to say that.  We should say it every chance we get.

I have to tell you about this wonderful dream I had this morning.
I dreamed I was at work on the military base and saw an angel formed from the clouds.  Yes, I was with a bunch of people at work and happened to look out the window and saw this beautiful cloud creation.  I told everyone, “Look!  An angel is in the clouds!”  I then raced over to the window to point out the angel formation to everyone.  Then a magical thing appeared; a cherub angel came to life from the clouds and was decending from the sky!  He was just a breathtaking sight!
I was so psyched in this dream that I yelled to everyone, “Look!  An angel!  A cherub angel is coming down!”  I was so fascinated with this beautiful once in a lifetime site (although a dream – it did seem so real) that I could not take my eyes off the cherub angel.  It was a wonderful sight…a perfectly formed angel was decending down from the Heavenly blue sky and I was seeing it take place!  Then the strangest most beautiful thing happened…. a pastel-colored angel dove came from the cherub angel and was flying down towards my building!  Yes – a baby blue, soft pink, and white-colored angel dove was coming to our building door!
I raced to the door and quietly looked through the glass doors and was completely taken aback by this wonderfully strange tri-colored bird.  The bird did not show fear of people.  The bird was about 6 to 8 inches tall.  The bird came to me!  I gently lowered myself to the ground, in a crouching position, and put my hand out to the bird and gently brushed his feathery soft wings.  The bird looked at me in his technicolor body as I touched his wing.  I slowly stroked his wing and quietly asked, “Did Jake send you?  I am Jake’s Mom.  Jake is my little boy who died a year ago.  Are you coming to see me for Jake?”
My heart was so filled with warmth when I talked to that angel dove and touched his wing.  Then….I woke up.
Is there a such thing as an angel dove?  If not, don’t tell me so.  I have to believe in something.  Jake came to see me last night.  I just know he did.
I waited all day to tell you readers this dream.  It is almost 10:45pm and tears are rolling down my cheeks.  I miss Jake so very much.
I hope the angel dove visits me again tonite.

“LEARN TO WRITE THE SAND”
A story tells that two friends were walking through the desert. In a specific point of the journey, they had an argument, and one friend slapped the other one in the face.
The one, who got slapped, was hurt, but without anything to say, he wrote in the sand: “TODAY, MY BEST FRIEND SLAPPED ME IN THE FACE”.
They kept on walking, until they found an oasis, where they decided to take a bath. The one who got slapped and hurt started drowning, and the other friend saved him. When he recovered from the fright, he wrote on a stone: “TODAY MY BEST FRIEND SAVED MY LIFE”.
The friend who saved and slapped his best friend, asked him, “Why, after I hurt you, you wrote in the sand, and now you write on a stone?”
The other friend, smiling, replied: “When a friend hurts us, we should write it down in the sand, where the winds of forgiveness get in charge of erasing it away, and when something great happens, we should engrave it in the stone of the memory of the heart, where no wind can erase it”
“Learn to write in the sand”.

Up in Heaven, looking down
Is a carrot-topped boy, freckles all around
With a mischievous grin and a wink of the eye
He kicks a soccer ball, as Jesus watches it fly by
Jesus runs to catch up to those fast little legs
He returns the volley and a smile escapes
Down here on Earth, we cry and weep
For that cute little boy, with those rosy cheeks
We look for signs that he is still here
They’re all around us, far and near
When he kicks the soccer ball, it’s the thunder in the clouds
When he laughs, it’s the rain that falls all around
We will see him again, that I’m sure
He’ll be waiting at those gates with a hug so pure
Jake and Jesus will welcome us into their game
Where once again, we’ll be able to cheer and shout his name
Written by Holly – she married Jake’s brother Joe
Holly read this in the cemetary on September 24, 2001 – Jake’s anniversary date of his fatal gocart accident.  He was only 9 years old when he left us.  Joe looks at Jake’s marker and says, “Mom, I look at that and I still cannot believe it” with tears running down his cheeks. I quietly look up at Joe and nod and say, “I know, Joe..I can’t either.  I keep thinking he is coming home and I keep looking forward to seeing him after work, but he has not been home since he left.” 
His soccer ball sits idle with his things.  He played soccer one Spring season – 2000.  He loved it and he team mates loved him.  He was not an olympic player, but he loved to play with his friends.  I loved to watch him and cheer him on.  His brother Joe was a great soccer player and Jake wanted so much to be good like Joe.  All that matters in life is that you enjoy the game.  His brother Joe loved to watch him play, too.
The game of life ended for us on September 24, 2000 when Jake left us.  He was only 9 years old… 
We miss him so very much.  This pain must be the worst pain a person can experience;  a pain that never goes away.

It has been several weeks now that I have noticed this person.  He is an elderly guy that helps kids cross the street on the corner of Murray and Pikes Peak.
I noticed something special about him a few weeks ago.  Those speedy drivers get an evil look from him that seems to make them think twice.  I am glad Ralph Waldo Emerson Elementary has such a responsible adult on that busy street corner.
I wanted to bring this man a hot breakfast one morning so I drove through the McDonalds drive through window to get him a sausage and biscuit.  When I arrived at his usual spot, he was not there.  I wondered about him that day.
Just this week, I spotted him again and I pulled into an apartment complex.  I walked about a block to personally meet this special guy.  I told him I had been watching him for a long time and said, “You do a great job out here and I just wanted you to know that.”  He proceeded to tell me how kids only look to their left and right.  They NEVER notice the person behind them making a right hand turn off the corner stop.  He has to always remind them.  What a wonderful crossing guard.  He has such an important job and does not get compensated enough for what he does each morning.
I gave him a $3 gift certificate to Starbucks with a Random Act of Kindness card and said, “Here, take this, and have a drink of coffee when your morning ends…in memory of my little boy who died in a gocart accident last September.”
Next time you see a school crossing guard, take a moment to stop and tell him/her what a great job they are doing for parents and children.  You will feel so good afterwards.

Hey, just thought I would tell you about this movie.  
I saw the new Drew Barrymore movie on Saturday afternoon with my daughters.  This movie was great.  It has a mixture of everything…humor, sadness, reality!  I would recommend this movie to all mothers with teenagers – middle schoolers (7th grade and up) and high schoolers.
This movie was based on a true story.  It is about a young Catholic girl who gets pregnant when she is 15.  She marries the father of the child (a real loser in general but he loves her and the baby!).
This is reality UP CLOSE and PERSONAL.  Having a baby when you are 15 and not finishing high school is very traumatic for this mother.  She misses out on the Prom and everything else…going to college, working, etc.  She lives in public housing surrounded by people she would rather not be living next to everyday.  She has a beautiful child.  His name is Jason and he is so handsome all grown up, too!
Go see this movie – it is a keeper.  I think I will buy it on video when it comes out!
I was a single Mom at 19 and it was not a cup of tea.  I did finish college, but it was not as fun and easy as it could have been for me.  
I am glad my daughters and I saw this movie together.  I think it gives a lesson that cannot be learned in school.

I miss you so much.  I still sometimes think (alot of times) that this accident did not happen and you are off on a trip somewhere.  
I sometimes think I am going to rush home and there you will be waiting for me.  It has been over 12 months – actually tomorrow – 24 Oct 01 – it will be 13 months ago that you left us.  I just cannot understand how mothers live each day without their children – especially those that were taken from us so suddenly.  Your Uncle Ben says you were “stolen” from us.  I thought that was an interesting way for him to describe it.  I think stolen things at least have a chance of being found again.  “Stolen” is sure an interesting word.
I was thinking of writing about all the things I miss about my 9 year old son.  There are more than 10, but this is a start:
1.  I miss you telling me to wake you up early so you and I can eat breakfast together – our favorite…oatmeal.
2.  I miss the twinkle in your eye and the deep dimples in your cheeks.
3.  I miss your flamin’ red hair – so perfectly gelled each morning b4 school.
4.  I miss you saying, “What’s for dinner, Mom?  I’m starving!”  You always made me think you were from some 3rd world country with those remarks!
5.  I miss us wearing our “twin” t-shirts – the one with Grumpy on the front pointing his finger saying, “Is that your final answer?”  We both loved to watch that Who Wants to be a Millionaire show together.
6.  I miss how happy you always were each day.  You made us all so happy.
7.  I miss your laughter and frivolity in the house.
8.  I miss your stories about life.
9.  I miss arguing with you to go to bed because it is a school nite.
10. I miss your hugs and your “I love you, Mom,” actions.
11. I miss seeing you lying on the floor watching your favorite wrestling shows.
12. I miss you crawling into bed with me to read with me.
13. I miss cooking for you, Jake.  You were always so appreciative.  I remember when Holly put too much salt in the potatoes, but you said, “They taste great, Holly!”  You ate all the potatoes.  You always aimed to please people, Jake.
14.  I miss doing your laundry.
15.  I miss life, Jake.  Life without you has been so very hard on all of us.  We love you so much!  “Death cannot kill that which doesn’t die….” (William Penn)  Our love for you is immortal, Jake.

By H. Norman Wright
A CAMPFIRE, OR A FOREST FIRE?
We have all seen the devastation a raging forest fire can
produce in a lovely forest. It’s hard to imagine that such devastation begins with a seemingly insignificant little spark. But the wounds produced by that spark will be visible on the land for several decades.
Your tongue has the same potential for destruction as a spark of fire. Some individuals and couples need a damage control engineer with them at all times because they constantly misuse their gift of speech. There are 
many ways to misuse the tongue. Here are three: gossip, rationalized hurtful comments, and insensitive comments.
Malicious gossip is a deliberate attempt to hurt another by telling untrue or exaggerated stories about him or her. No too many marriage partners use this hurtful device against each other, but unfortunately many use it against their in-laws!
Sometimes you will rationalize yourself into making hurtful comments you ordinarily wouldn’t make about someone. But you wrongly convince yourself that what you have to say, as hurtful as it is, is necessary for his (or her) own good.”  But the only comments which are for 
someone’s good are those that build up.
A third way a tongue is misused is through comments which are spoken with insensitivity to another’s feelings. Tragically, this is all too common in marriage!  Ask yourself, does it need to be said?  Can my partner handle emotionally what I’m going to say at this time?  Is it really true, or is it just one person’s perception or opinion?  Is Jesus Christ in control of my tongue as I make this comment?
If you want to measure your maturity as an individual or a couple, start by evaluating whether what you say is a blessing or a curse. Does it create a warm, inviting campfire or a raging, destructive forest fire?

CUTTING SOME SLACK
By now you’ve probably noticed parents aren’t perfect. We make mistakes. We can be overly strict when the situation calls for leniency. We can be too lenient when we should be strict. We’re learning.
Most parents do what they do only because they want what’s best for their children. Chore assignments may seem like the ultimate drag to a teen, but to a parent they’re a great way to teach self-discipline. (They 
also keep the nation’s ants from holding their annual convention under your bed.)
Your curfew may not make any sense to you, but to a parent who paces the floor worrying, it makes a perfect sense. My mother could not sleep until she knew I was safe at home (and that continued even after I’d been married twenty years!).
Making you do your homework, wanting to know who your friends are, scheduling a family night, or limiting your telephone time are all for your benefit…whether it seems like it or not. You have to do your homework, unless you want to be gray haired and pushing a walker to your senior prom. Your parents have to limit your telephone time. After all, they don’t want you appearing in your class pictures with a receiver to your ear.  If you ask them, you might be surprised to find out they have good reasons for their rules.
Remember, it’s not parents versus teenagers. We’re all on the same team. We might fumble the ball from time to time, you might miss a few passes, but we’re all trying to do the best job we can.  And we will 
eventually make it across the goal line if we work together, pray for each other, and stop for plenty of huddles along the way.
“Train a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not turn from it.”  (Proverbs 22:6)

I was alone last night.  I made some awesome spaghetti sauce with hot Italian sausage. 
I made my salad and spaghetti and sat alone at the kitchen table. Renee was spending the night with a friend and Becky was with her Dad.
As I was eating, I felt a need to call out to Jake.  So I called out his name a few times.  I kept looking towards the stairs – mindlessly hoping he would come racing up to eat with me in the kitchen.
He did not answer.  I miss him so much, readers.  He was only 9 years old – too young to leave his Mom.

This morning I carved a pumpkin.  I haven’t did this since Jake’s accident.  I was never good at this chore, either.  The last time I carved a pumpkin for Jake, I messed up the eyes.  He had an oriental looking pumpkin, but he actually liked it!  Of course, I don’t think Jake would ever tell me something I made for him was not good.  Oh, how I miss that little guy.
Anyway, this pumpkin I carved is a patriotic pumpkin.  I saw the idea and tried to recreate it with my amateur artistic ability.  It has a flag on the face.  I am not too good at carving out stars, but pumpkin carving is supposed to fun.  It is not like I am getting graded on this art project!  LOL!  My oldest son, just stopped over and said it looked okay so maybe I was successful.  I think I am going to put a candle in it and put it in a dark room and see what it REALLY looks like.  If it looks good, I may enter it into our pumpkin carving contest at work on Wednesday.
Since I am in the space career field, I had another idea for the pumpkin carving contest at work…”Pumpkin Sat” -short for Pumpkin satellite.  I think I will stick some straws in a pumpkin and put some aluminum foil  across the straws – the billboard affect – but my plan is make it look like solar array panels for my pumpkin satellite.  Hmmm…at least it will be original.  I need to work on its mission statement…To provide communications where pumpkins have not gone b4….something like that.
See, if I don’t entertain myself with these things, I would be soooo depressed…
Love to all my readers…how about carving our pumpkins and putting their pics in our diaries?  How fun!
I wonder if I should carve a pumpkin for Jake and take it out to him.  Maybe I should carve my wrists and join him…NOT!  I was just being silly – I have 3 more kids that I don’t know what they would do without Mom.  Then again…I wonder if they would miss me?

It was a BEAUTIFUL Fall day in Colorado.  My neighbors were having those dreaded garage sales.  So I went to chat and check it out.
Well, while I was outside, I noticed the mailman’s truck.  So I decided to grab my mail while I was out.  As he was getting out of his truck, I hollered out to him, “Hey! I will take it!”  He started towards me and handed me the mail.  That’s when I saw them – those postal baby blue latex gloves!  I found them interesting looking and said, “So, is this safe mail?”  He smiled and said, “Yes and they are color coordinated to match my outfit.”  LOL!  They are kinda sexy, too!

25 GREAT PARENTING IDEAS
1. Believe in your children so they can believe in themselves.
2. Turn accomplishments {big ones and little ones} into a celebration.
3. Praise your kids in public {but make sure not to be embarassing}.
4. When they come home dirty, say it looks as if they had a great time.
5. When your children talk to you, turn off the TV or put down the newspaper so you can give your complete attention. Get down on the ground and play with your kids, even if they’re big.
7. Be patient when they’re talking. Don’t keep saying, “Hurry up and get to the point.”
8. Give your little ones an appreciative smile or hug when they’re gentle with animals.
9. Treat your children to a soothing foot massage. It will relax them and give the two of you some special time together.
10. Bestow sweet nicknames on them to use only in private.
11. Show how pleased you are when they’re kind to younger kids.
12. When your family is out to dinner or at home, let your children invent and deliver a toast.
13. Learn how to say “I LOVE YOU” in sign language, and send “secret” messages to one another.
14. Notice your children’s bright ideas.
15. When your kids are home alone after school, call from work just to say “I LOVE YOU.”
16. Secretly wink at one another when you are in public, especially in a serious environment.
17. Give each of your kids one beautiful rose tied with a ribbon.
18. Thank them for showing respect to the elderly.
19. Share stories of something positive or wonderful that you each accomplish every day.
20. Sing, dance and get really silly together.
21. Let them know how much you like the way they’re growing up.
22. Take a class together.
23. Tell your kids what they’ve taught you.
24. When your children admit the truth about something they have done wrong, be sure to express thanks for the honesty.
[ AND DON’T FORGET…]
25. Speak to them as if all the angels could hear you.

Kelly’s Hill (orig. title)
NO MORE GOOD-BYES
“Is it Saturday morning?” I asked as my mother entered my sister’s and my bedroom.
“Yes, it’s Saturday morning — and yes, Daddy will be home today,”  she said with a smile.
“Oh, goody! Can we go to meet him?”
“It’s pretty cold. We’ll see what it’s like later.”
This same conversation took place many times in years gone by when I was a little girl. We lived in a small village eight miles from the farm close to my sister’s school. My father drove to the farm in the warm, lazy days of summer. But once rains and snow came, he had to walk back and forth.
Monday mornings were always sad as we watched our daddy sling a gunny sack full of groceries over his shoulder and trudge off to the farm.  We would stand at the front window and watch him get farther and farther away. It wasn’t until he disappeared over the hill that we slowly returned to the day’s activities.
The week would drag by, but then it was Saturday and all our gloom vanished! Daddy would be home today!
My sister and I loved to meet him along the way. All day we would wait for our mother to decide if we could. If it wasn’t too cold, she would bundle us up in our warmest clothes. A wool scarf encircled my head with only a small slit left so I could peer out at the snowy world around us.
My heart raced as we started on our hike, my stubby legs could hardly maneuver in the deep snow drifts. I clung to my big sister’s hand, and she encouraged me and pulled me along with her.
East of our village was a fairly stepped hill —Kelly’s hill.  We would struggle to the top, huffing and puffing, spurred on by the thought of who we hoped to see once we reached the top.
“Can you see him?” I asked anxiously as we crested the hill.
“Not yet,” Doreen replied, searching the horizon.
Finally, we could make out the form of one lone figure plodding along in the distance.
“It’s him! It’s him!” I shouted, jumping up and down in the snow. When the figure got closer. we’d start to run. Daddy would spot us and he’d start to run. He would open his huge arms and both of us would leap into them, laughing and squealing as he hugged and kissed us — one more joyous reunion.
My father, mother, and sister are in heaven now, and when I envision my own arrival there, I think about those Saturday mornings on Kelly’s hill. This time, Jesus will run to meet me first —and I will leap into His open arms, laughing and basking in His love. Then my family will spot me and they will rush toward me with arms wide open. What a joyous reunion!  And this time, there will be no more good-byes.

Where does the day go?  It just zipped by today.  I did not accomplish anything to write about….but my daughter treated me to a movie tonite!  Are you ready for another movie review?
Monster, Inc is a great movie.  This is wonderful movie for the entire family.  
I really do not go to the movies, but Renee wanted to take me.  She earned a small fortune babysitting twins today.  
The theater was interesting, too.  I was sitting in a love seat – imagine that – an old middle-aged woman sitting in a lovers’ seat – LOL.  How exciting that would be if some strange man sat next to me – LOL.  Anyway it was nice to have that room to stretch out and not worry about rubbing someone else’s body by accident!
Anyway this movie is really cute.  It is an animated movie – like Toy Story.  I think kids of all ages would enjoy this – maybe 3 years old and up to Senior citizens – I will be a Senior citizen in no time!  Hey being a Senior citizen has some perks…like discount tickets!  Our tickets were $7/each!  Soon we will be using our VISA card at the ticket counters!
As I watched this movie, I thought of Jake.  He would have really enjoyed this movie.  The monsters were hysterically funny!  So, tonite was a funny and sad  evening.  I miss him like nobody could imagine.
Here’s to you, Jake….this song is for you pumpkin – You’re Always On My Mind….

I will always wonder why Jake left us at such a very young age; he was only 9 years old.  Even if I was elderly and Jake was in his 50s’ or 60s, I would still not have been ready to release him, God.  If Jake had a terminal illness, I still would not want him to leave us.  Why?  I was told it is because we are human and selfish.
I have been thinking about this alot, God.  Someone in my grief support group once said that losing our children is your way of knocking us down.  It is like a reality check.  It is like wearing a new outfit and walking down the street so pompously…that if we fall and get embarassed…that’s your way of making us humble.  It is a slap into reality.  Wow – what a stinger!
Okay, if that is true, I want to say something.  I have been knocked down and am having a hard time getting up again.  Once I do get up, I can never walk the way I used to walk.  I am filled with deep sadness and loneliness.  I have learned to be very compassionate, God.  Please….use me in whatever way you have planned.  If your desire is to use me to reach out to others in their grief, I will do it!  I will be there for anyone that needs to share or cry or whatever they need, God.  Just let me say one thing, PLEASE do not let anyone else go through what I am going through.  Let me be the one to be there for everyone else and show compassion and tell my story about Jake.  Please do not let anyone experience my type of loss.  I will work overtime reaching out to others to save someone else this hurt.  Ok, God?  Are you listening?  It is me…Jake’s Mom…asking for this one favor.  Amen…
P.S.  Tell Jake we love him and miss him.  Hug him for all of us, God.

Well, here it is, Sunday again.  Where does the time go?  I was busy being the “handy woman” today.  I finally finished a project I have meant to start months ago.  I painted the walls going up the stairs.  I painted the walls going down the stairs sometime in Feb.  Is this procrastination or what! 
I must say it looks very inviting and bright.  I am a big fan of Wall Magic.  This is a technique of blending 2 colors on a wall using a double roller and divided paint tray.  I chose “Texas Yellow” and “Starlight”.  The results are great!
I started sanding and staining my new oak hand rails to go up and down the stairs.  Boy!  That is work!  It got chilly outside – so I brought them in and put them on the kitchen table to dry.  I need to stain some more, too, ugh!  The beauty of home projects is that you enjoy doing them and take great pride in your work.  I started doing these things after Jake’s accident to focus on something other than the accident.
Nobody ever told me how messy stain was!  Yuck!  I had to wash my hands with a Brillo pad just to scrape it off!  
I know Jake would have a blast getting messy staining with me.  Maybe he was with me today in his special kind of way.
I decided to take a chance flying to Georgia for Thanksgiving.  I bought 3 tickets for me and the girls.  We leave on 17 Nov and return on 24 Nov.  It is still a ways off, but I will miss writing to yall.
I got my tickets off Hotwire.com.  The tickets were very reasonable.  When you shop for fares, Hotwire finds the best deal, but you don’t know what airline or times of travel until you book your flight.  I am not too crazy about catching my plane back to Colorado at 7am in Atlanta!  Atlanta is at least a 3.5 hour drive from Mom’s place.  Of course I have to plan to be there even earlier for check in! Maybe I will leave Mom’s on Friday afternoon and turn in the rental car in Atlanta and catch a shuttle to the nearest motel…relax…sleep…and get up and catch the early shuttle back to the airport on 24 Nov.  What would you guys do?

*TAKE A WALK AROUND YOURSELF
When you’re criticizing others,
And are finding here and there
A fault or two to speak of,
Or a weakness you can tear;
When you’re blaming someone’s meanness
Or accusing some of self,
It’s time that you went out
To take a walk around yourself.
There’s a lot of human failures
In the average of us all,
And lots of grave shortcomings
In the short ones and the tall;
But when we think of evils
Men should lay upon the shelves
It’s time that we all went out
To take a walk around ourselves.
We need so oft in this life
This balancing of scales
Thus seeing how much in us wins
And how much in us fails;
But before you judge another,
Just to lay him on the shelf,
It would be a splendid plan
To take a walk around yourself.

…I read your Mom’s OD (*madgal*) and learned of the death of your Daddy.  For a 10 year old boy, that is sure a lot to loose.  I wish I could bring him back to you, but I do not have that magical power.  This background music is for you because I read that you like this song. 
When I think of you, I think of a little boy with a wonderful heart – like Jake.  I know Jake would be very sad like you if he lost his Daddy.  So I am sending this big (((((HUG))))) to you, Kyle.  Just remember – “Death ends a life not a relationship.”  He will always be your Daddy and you will always be his little boy.  Whenever you feel sad, go climb into your Mom’s lap – she will always be there for you.
Email me and send me your address.  I would like to find a special book for you and send it across the ocean.
You will be in my thoughts.

Life is Not a Dress Rehearsal
Compiled by Alice Gray,
Stories for the Extreme Teen’s Heart
RACHEL
If you know the Lord Jesus Christ as your Savior, you are a child of the King. Each one of God’s children has a Royal call on their lives (1  Peter 2:9). I had the privilege of knowing a beautiful young girl who took 
her reign on earth seriously. She was a true princess who kept her divine appointments every day of her life. Her name was Rachel. She went to a public school that was more like a war zone than a place to learn. Drugs were everywhere. Gangs terrorized the students. Godly values were 
non-existent.
During her freshmen year when she was thirteen, Rachel began to feel tired all the time and lost her appetite. A trip to the doctor brought tragic news: Rachel had Leukemia.
The diagnosis left Rachel with a choice: become bitter or better. Rachel had no room for bitterness in her life. “I don’t know how long I have to live,” she told her parents, “and I know that God can choose to heal me. But I’m going to bring as many people home with me into eternity as I can. I’m committed to making every day count for Jesus.”  Rachel asked her parents to hold her accountable and pray over her every day before school that God would give her a divine appointment with a schoolmate.
The rumor had spread through her school that she had cancer, so all eyes were on her every day. This trial gave Rachel a chance to show her classmates the peace and joy only God can bring in such a tragic situation. In a way, she was blessed in her affliction because she could grasp more intently the truth that our days are numbered. In the Bible, Peter reminds us that we are strangers and aliens in this place.. We are only visitors.
The kids in the school could not understand why, even though she was dying. Rachel was so concerned about them. She shared the love of Christ with everyone she could. On her sixteenth birthday, she told her parents, “I’m ready to go home and be with the Lord now. I just want to bring my high school with me.”  That night she wrote a letter to her school. A few weeks later, Rachel answered God’s call to be with Him in heaven.
Rachel’s mother asked the principal if her daughter’s classmates could come to the funeral to hear the letter Rachel wrote. It was only when the principal announced Rachel’s funeral that the full impact of her three years of evangelism became clear. Hundreds of students requested permission to go, and a fleet of school buses carried them from the campus to the funeral. I was in the enormous crowd as the pastor began to read, “Dear  Classmates: I told my parents I was willing to die and go home into  eternity if  I could bring all of you with me. My Savior made a way for you to get to the other side…”
After the letter was finished, the pastor looked up and asked, ” How many of you want to see Rachel someday on the other side of eternity?” Almost every student in the room surged forward to give their lives to Jesus Christ.
How many of those kids will grow up to be godly parents? How many will become pastors, teachers and evangelists? Because one princess understood she had a royal call on her life and kept her divine 
appointments, she changed people’s lives for eternity.
I challenge you today: when you’ve gone to be with Jesus, what will you be remembered for? And what do you want to be remembered for? Life is not a dress rehearsal. When it’s over, it’s over. Live this day as if it’s your last, and watch what happens to you and everyone around you.

don’t go together.  I have a Texas office mate and she is a riot!  She sent me this email and I had to share yall!
TERRORISM-WHAT IS THAT?
I get a big laugh at the dialogue of Osama bin Laden, the Taliban, politicians,and the news media. They say terrorists will hit us again in the oncoming weeks and months. What a joke!
You have a better chance of getting killed on Interstate 35E than by a terrorist. Osama has probably seen 100 degree plus summers in Afghanistan, but he doesn’t have fire ants to go with it. If he did he wouldn’t be sleeping on the ground in his cave. 
He talks of pain and suffering he is going to inflict on us. He doesn’t know what pain is until he gets kicked by a  green broke, two year old colt in a freezing rain. 
Germ warfare? Texas ticks will give you Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever and Lime disease, blister beetles kill your horse, green bugs destroy a wheat crop, and termites eat your house. 
Anthrax has killed Texas cattle for over 125 years. What’s new?
Our prairie dogs carry the plague, armadillos carry leprosy, and our bats and skunks carry rabies. We have rattlesnakes, copperheads, and water moccasins. 
Ho hum.  They talk of gas and biological warfare. They have never pulled in behind a cattle truck while its raining, or ridden in the front seat of a pick-up
between two cowboys after they just eaten a big bowl of Texas Red.
Texas ain’t for sissies! We have posted signs all over the state that say “Don’t mess with Texas!” 
Osama, consider yourself warned!

163,https://www.opendiary.com/m/j8xmom/i-saw-a-psychic-today-5368067/,2001-11-09,I Saw a Psychic Today,"
Today was busy.  I had a Home and Garden Party at 11am this morning.  By the time that was done, it was almost 2pm.  Then I went to see a psychic in Manitou Springs at 4pm.  
It was a very interesting visit.  She used the tarot cards and read my palms.  She had me pegged pretty much on the button.  I did not volunteer anything about Jake because I didn’t want to “give anything away”, if you know what I mean.
She noted right away that this year was quite a year for me.  How true she was.  She said next year would bring me closure and change around September.  Can you believe she came up with that month!
She asked me some questions about my ex and sees a change in that relationship.  I did not agree with that at all, but I am hoping the change is that he will leave this state.  My son told me my ex mentioned moving to FL in January.  I am wondering if this is what the psychic meant.  She picked out some traits about him that truly identified him.
She knew alot about my relationship with my older son and his wife.  I was a bit surprised a stranger could pick up this info from cards!  The cards had some interesting pictures on them, but I never knew they had actual meaning!
She thinks my personal life is going to change in the next two years.  She sees a man coming into a serious relationship with me.  She says he is not available now.  That was very interesting to me.  I know I meant my soul mate in Denver in 1982.  He was separated from his wife at the time.  He called me in 1989.  He was available, but I was married.  He took me to lunch in 1999 and met my kids.  Jake really liked him.  Becky was a bit standoffish towards him.  Renee liked him, too.  He was married at the time and unhappy.  The last time he spoke to me was shortly after Jake’s funeral.  I wonder if this is the person the psychic is talking about.
She described me perfectly – especially about me doing so much for others and not enough for me.
She really was on target about the flux my job is in at this moment, too.  The project we are working on is in turmoil at times and I was almost laid off in October! 
She said I am a good person and like people.  True.  
She tilted her head to see if any psychic messages came in for me.  I was so hoping Jake would come through…but maybe next time.

164,https://www.opendiary.com/m/j8xmom/school-project-2-5368068/,2001-11-11,School Project,"
Yesterday I helped a co-worker with his school project.  He needed to do a newsreport-type project involving pictures and video.  He had asked me on Thursday last week if I would be interested in doing this project about Jake and his accident. I told him I would help him.  All of you know how important it is to me that people remember Jake.
Yesterday afternoon we did the project.  He came over and talked with my girls.  The girls took him into the backyard to show him Jake’s garden.  Then he and I took a short stroll to Jake’s school to see his garden there, too.
I invited Jake’s friend, Meagan, next door to go with us to the cemetary.  She always like to ride out there with me.  The guy doing the project asked her some questions about Jake while we were there.  She became quiet, but answered the questions.  He asked her about Jake’s go cart and she said she helped him wash it.  She said she remembered he liked to skateboard.  It was hard for her to share about Jake; I could feel it.  She will be 7 in January.  She is much younger than Jake, but they enjoyed hanging out together.  He would skateboard and she would watch or ride his bike.  They had squirt gun wars together.  I actually gave her Jake’s “lethal weapon” this summer; his super soaker.
After the cemetery, we stopped by the funeral home briefly for some more pictures.  Then we stopped by the hospital for a picture of the Pediatric ICU where Jake was brought after the accident.
We finished the afternoon with a visit to the scene of the accident.  I have not been to the scene in over a year!  It was hard to determine the exact location since that area was mostly contruction.  Now it is a booming shopping area with restaurants, grocery stores, and an IMAX theater.  It was strange to be there, but I wanted to help my friend with this project.  I will probably never return to that site…never go to the movies there…

165,https://www.opendiary.com/m/j8xmom/stressing-56-5368069/,2001-11-12,Stressing,"
Today my teenager ( 1 of the twins) skipped school and lied about it.  I was so disappointed in her.
I stopped by the house around 1:30pm to pick up something and noted that there were some dishes in the sink and her backpack was by the door – inside.
I decided I would call the school and check her attendance.  When they called her into the office, the classroom teacher said she was not in today.  Looking at the attendance records – she skipped the entire day!  Imagine that!  Her Dad dropped her and her friends off for school and then she and her friend just came back to the house.
To make a long story short – my day at work ended at 1pm today.  I am so glad I decided to stay home in the afternoon and research her activities.  I called her friend’s house who she usually visits after school and there was no answer.  I went to her house twice with no luck.  So I waited to see if she would check in with me at 5ish and she did.  I asked her where she was today – she said school.  I told her I knew better.  Then she dug a deeper hole for herself.  She said she was tardy and was counted absent.
Well, she could not lie to her Dad.  Through tears, she confessed she blew off school.
For punishment besides the usual grounding, I am considering leaving her in CO when I go to GA for Thanksgiving.  My oldest son offered to keep her.  Now I have to make a decision.  I really want to impress upon her that she made a bad choice and  must pay the consequences.  The Dean of Freshman students told me today that he would assign her Saturday school.  She would be in school as we head to GA.  I think she would get the point that bad choices have consequences.  What do you  moms of teenagers think?
I cannot leave her with her Dad because he has his own plans to leave to Thanksgiving, too.

I am flying to GA on Monday.  I got some great rates last minute!
My first tickets did not go thru on 4 Nov 01 and I had to rebook the following Wednesday and the tickets had doubled!  I had resigned myself to just driving on Saturday.
I was really stressing getting everything ready for the trip.  I was wondering how I was going to get everthing done b4 o’dark thirty on Saturday morning.
This morning my officemate found some deals on the internet at http://www.travelocity.com.  I am booked on the airplane again.  Roundtrip tickets for Renee and me were only $206/each!

167,https://www.opendiary.com/m/j8xmom/i-close-my-eyes-13-5368071/,2001-11-15,I Close My Eyes,"
and I am back in the past with my little boy.
I just don’t understand why I keep thinking that Jake is still with us…just away on a trip…and coming home soon.
He is still with us in my heart, but I still cannot believe I will never see him after work anymore.  I will never float down the lazy river with him at Water World.  I will never share special moments with him again.  I am so glad I had him for those short 9 years.
When I feel these sad moments, which come upon me each day at different times…I close my eyes and there he is again.  I looked in the rearview mirror today driving the van and imagined Jake sitting in the very back looking back at me in the mirror.  I remember he used to sit back there and think he could get away with not wearing his seatbelt.  Imagine that!  It seems like yesterday that I looked back there and said, “Jake, are you wearing your seatbelt?” and he looked at me with that twinkle in his eyes and said, “Yea”.  I would look back at him and tell him, “Don’t make me pull over and check and find out you are lying to me, Jake.”  Then he would say, “Well, I am, Mom.”  I would continue looking at him til I heard the seatbelt click.  I sure miss him.
Jake used to always argue about wearing his seatbelt.  He always thought I worried too much.  He would always tell me I was a good driver.  And I would always tell him that you never know what other drivers are not being safe so we have to prepare ourselves always.
When I saw him ride his gocart the first time, he was a safe driver.  He put on his helmet and he locked his seatbelt in place and slowly headed down his path.  He told me that day, “See Mom.  I am careful.  I can drive my gocart.  You worry too much.”  Then he would look at his Dad and grin and say, “Mom worries too much, huh, Dad?”
Jake is not here anymore because there was a driver not being careful.  See, Jake, I always worried too much, but I had reason.  I am an old bag that has been around alot longer than you and I have seen alot of things.  I never expected to see you leave us behind, son.  You were doing all the right things to be a safe 9 y/o, but what was your Dad doing that afternoon?  Was he watching you?  I cannot ask your Dad this question, Jake, because I do not think I can bear to hear the answer.  We will have to talk about this when I come Home to you.  Then maybe we should not discuss it because it won’t matter anymore….there are no more tears in Heaven….
Today I saw the place we visited the last time I was with him – Jamba Juice.  It was September 23, 2000.  He and I were just leaving the mall and he wanted to stop and get a Jamba Juice.  I went in with him and had no clue what to order.  The girls always went in there with him.  I told him to get whatever he would like.  He ordered this monster big cup of some strange concoction.  I tasted it and it was way too sweet for me.  He always shared whatever he had with us.  He had such a big heart.  I shared this memory with the girls when we went out to dinner tonite.  Becky told me I had good memories of Jake.  I told her she did, too.  We all have different memories of Jake and we all miss him so very much.
I just close my eyes and there he is again.  I have those memories forever imprinted in my mind.  We all have these special memories of you, Jake.  In our hearts, you will remain.
I have to close my eyes…..

I had a good weekend with the girls.  They shared alot with me.  I think they have the ability to make the right choices, but sometimes they make the wrong choices because they just have to learn for themselves.
So – yes, Becky will be in Colorado with family.  We had a great time this weekend…so if life ended tomorrow…I know we left each other on good terms.  I hope there is not a terrorist on my flight, but if so…I hope to see Jake…..Happy Thanksgiving to all of you in OD land….Jake’s Mom is signing off for the holidays.

Today I decided to get a few people together to play scrabble.  My partner was a southern teenager, 15 y/o, from across the street.
It was our turn on the board.  She spelled “LUAR”.  I looked at that word and said, “L, U, A, R.  Is that a word?”  She said, in her most syrupy southern twang, “Yes. Like a luar (loo er) that you put on a fishing pole.”  I said, “Oh!  Lure.”  Then I proceeded to spell it like us Colorado people – L- U – R- E.
I really got a kick out of that.  I declare!  That is something I have heard alot down here —I declares!
The weather here is rainy, but I like the cooldown factor it brings with it.  I has probably been in the 60s and 70s since I came home.
I am hoping to take my Mom out to a movie this weekend.  Any ideas?  I thought about “Domestic Disturbance” or “Shallow Hal”.  I heard 13 Ghosts was good, but I don’t like scary movies.  I didn’t bring my body pillow to sleep with at night!  I left Butch at home, too.  He really hasn’t been out of the bag since I left the store with him stuffed in there.  
Until next entry….

about my trip to GA for Thanksgiving.
Well, I was really scared to fly but the tickets were so reasonable and made driving seem tiring.
When I arrived at the Springs airport, everything went smoothly.  We checked in 2 hours prior and proceeded to our gate to wait.  While I was sitting at the gate, things started to weird me out.
This total stranger – guy – was listening to my daughter’s and my conversation.  Renee was reading the paper and asking me about drugs.  She was reading about the people who got busted – Crime Stoppers.  I think her question was something about Class 2 controlled substance.  I was clueless so I guessed at the answer.  THEN this weird guy leaned over to volunteer the appropriate answer.  You can imagine what I was thinking…He seemed to know all about drug types.  Well this conversation finally passed.
Later, during our 2 hour wait for boarding call, this guy asked me if I had any superglue.  I looked at him all puzzled and said that I didn’t have any but he could probably buy some in one of the airport shops.  I looked at him and asked him what he needed it for.  He then pointed to our aircraft (TWA jet) and said he wanted to make sure the tailpiece was secure and didn’t fall off.  He was laughing in reference to that American Airlines jet that crashed earlier in November in New York; this accident was attributed to the tailpiece falling off…remember.  He then proceeded to tell me he should develop a “tail – yanker” to test the tailpieces of all aircraft and get rich.  I just looked at him and smiled.
Then he asked me where my “final destination” was on my flight.  Unfortunately he was boarding our same jet to St. Louis.  I told him I was going to Atlanta.  Then he proceeded to tell me how that airport in Atlanta was shut down for 4+ hours a few days earlier because a guy ran thru security.  Fortunately, I had read the story so I was familiar with the incident.
Anyway, we finally boarded our plane.  As I was getting into a paperback that I purchased to read on the plane, my daughter told me this guy on the plane was speaking a different language.  THIS WAS NOT WHAT I WANTED TO HEAR!  I said, “What guy?!”, and she pointed out the steward on the plane.  So I started studying him.  My first thought was that he was a “terrorist”!  I was uneasy for a awhile, but I eventually nodded off and everything was fine.  Our 1 hour+ flight into St. Louis was uneventful. 
Our connecting flight into Atlanta was fine, too.
We arrived into Atlanta on time and picked up our rental car and headed south for our drive to Nashville, Georgia.  All went well.
We enjoyed visiting my Mom and 2 brothers.  I was able to see my nephew and 3 nieces, too!
Thanksgiving was wonderful.  I cooked the turkey and my sister-in-law made the best pecan and pumpkin pies!  Check this out for a pecan pie recipe:
1 cup pecan nuts (chopped)
1 cup sugar
3/4 cup light karo syrup
3 beaten eggs
Mix them all up together and pour into a frozen pie shell.  Bake for 1 hour at 350.
My sister-in-law made this pecan pie and it was awesome!  I tried to make one when I came back to Colorado, but it was all jacked up.  My sister-in-law left off a key ingredient – EGGS!  My pies were so hard you needed a jack hammer to pierce the crust – so I tossed them out.
Next time – I will tell you about my visit with my best friend from 8th grade!  If she is reading this – Rhonda, can I post a picture of us from the trip to the beach?

Well, my friend has been reading my OD for quite some time.  I cannot recall exactly when she started reading it, but it was great because we were able to communicate.
So I went to GA for Thanksgiving.  I was able to hook up with Rhonda after the big holiday – the Sunday after Thanksgiving.  I drove to see her in Brunswick, GA.
It was about a 2 hour drive.  With a lot of coaxing, I was able to get Renee to drive over there with me.  It was a nice drive.  We went by some interesting towns – Lulaton, Schlatterville, etc.
Rhonda lives in a beautiful place on a gorgeous lake!  I would love to have been able to drop a line and see what kind of fish would bring me some excitement.  I imagine bass are the big things to catch there…surely not Rainbow Trout…like around here.
Rhonda has a little girl that is about 3 years younger than Renee, but age was not a factor.  They had a blast together.
We went walking along the beach at St. Simon’s Island.  It was a nice evening to enjoy the beach.  Of course there were alot of tourists (Northerners..for lack of a better term)hanging out, too.  We found an awesome sandcastle that was built with quite the detail!  
The highlight of our walk was when Rhonda and I recalled our days in middle school.  We just laughed and had a wonderful time.  We had a friend that chose between Rhonda and me – depending on what day of the week it was – either I was her best friend or Rhonda was!  LOL!  Whoever was the chosen one could not speak to anyone else…LOL …so Middle Schoolish, huh!?
Here we were…2 middle aged women cruisin’ the beach and enjoying every moment.  Rhonda is an RN now and I am a defense contractor working with space-related stuff.  Wow…2 different spectrums….living many miles apart…one in Colorado and the other in Georgia.  Brought together again after about 14 years.  Where does the time go?
I would love to go back to St. Simon’s Island and spend more than a couple hours.  Rhonda and I must do this again soon.  How about next summer sometime, Rhonda?  Or maybe you could come out here with your daughter?
Readers, life is just too short not to enjoy it with friends from the past.  Take some time out of your busy life to hook up with a friend from the past.  It is worth your time.
Jake’s Mom
P.S.  Rhonda has met all my kids except Jake.  She missed out on one special little guy.  I will never forget when she said, “He is the only one I never met.”  Well, Rhonda, you have met him;  he was so much like me!  Knowing me is knowing Jake……

I am not going to make it through this XMAS.  I know now that Jake is not coming home.  The shock and numbness have gone away.  The truth is exposed.  It is devastatingly painful…
I was full of anger tonite after work.  Life is unbearable these days.  So I came home and went for a walk – 3.5 miles worth.  I was gone more than an hour.  I walked thru the neighborhood with Jake tonite – just the two of us…no distractions.  I looked at all the XMAS decorations and lights with tears streaming down my cheeks.  I am so glad it gets dark early – I could cry freely without people noticing it….
It’s funny, but I could almost hear Jake next to me pointing out the houses with the cool lights saying, “Hey Mom – look over there!  See the house with all the lights and the Santa on the roof!?”
I just happened to be walking past his best friend’s house when his parents were stepping out to shop.  I said hello to Johnny’s Mom and got a big hug – you cannot imagine how much I needed that tonite.  Gee – I have to walk a mile or so…just for a hug these days.
If Jake were still home, he would have walked with me.  He and I could have zipped into Starbucks for a hot chocolate and fun conversation.  We could have played Scrabble – just the 2 of us.  Maybe we would have pigged out on some of those sweet things behind the glass counter, too.  Well, Jake wasn’t with me tonite…so I didn’t do the Starbucks…it would be too light in there and people would stare at me crying.
This is the 2d XMAS without Jake and I am hurting MAJOR!  The sad thing is that nobody seems to notice.
Well, I bought this neat solar decoration for Jake’s Garden in the backyard.  It is an elf holding up a lantern that glows at night.  I think I am going to get up early tomorrow and take that elf out to see Jake.  I am going to leave it with Jake.  I may just spend the entire day with Jake……who would ever miss us?

This Holiday Is Different!  This is another email I felt it was appropriate to share with OD Land…Amen.
1.    Last Holiday, we were thinking about all the things we didn’t have; we were placing wreaths on the doors of our homes; this Holiday, many are placing wreaths on the graves of our heroes.
2.    Last Holiday, many were letting our children play with toy guns; this Holiday, maybe not.
3.    Last Holiday, we were counting our money; this Holiday, we are counting our blessings.
4.    Last Holiday, we paid lip service to the real meaning of the season; this Holiday, we are paying homage to it-whatever yours may be.
5.    Last Holiday, we were lighting candles to decorate; this Holiday, we are lighting candles to commemorate.
6.    Last Holiday, we were digging deep into our bank accounts to find the money to fly home for the holiday; this Holiday, we are digging deep into our souls to find the courage to do so.
7.    Last Holiday, we were trying not to let annoying relatives get the best of us; this Holiday, we are trying to give the best of ourselves to them.
8.    Last Holiday, we thought it was enough to celebrate the holidays; this Holiday, we know we must also find ways to consecrate them.
9.    Last Holiday, we thought a man who could rush down a football field was hero; this Holiday, we know a man who rushes into a burning building is the real one.
10.    Last Holiday, we were thinking about the madness of the season; this Holiday, we are thinking about the meaning of it.
11.    Last Holiday, we were getting on one another’s nerves; this Holiday,we are getting on our knees.
12.    Last Holiday, we were giving thanks for gifts from stores; this Holiday, we are giving thanks for gifts from above.
13.    Last Holiday, we were wondering how to give our children all the things that money can buy-the hottest toys, the latest fashions, the newest gadgets; this Holiday, we are wondering how to give them all the things we can’t-a sense of security, safety, peace.
14.    Last Holiday, we were thinking about all the pressure we are under at the office; this Holiday, we are thinking about all the people who no longer have an office to go to.
15.    Last Holiday, we were singing carols; this Holiday, we are singing anthems.
16.    Last ,Holiday we were thinking how good it would feel to be affluent; this Holiday, we are thinking how good it feels to be alive.
17.    Last Holiday, we thought angels were in heaven; this Holiday, we know some are right here on earth.
18.    Last Holiday, we were contemplating all the changes we wanted to make in the New Year; this Holiday, we are contemplating all the changes we will have to make in this new reality.
19.    Last Holiday, we believed in the power of the pocketbook; this Holiday, we believe in the power of prayer.
20.    Last Holiday, we were sharing/spreading/listening to gossip; this Holiday, we are sharing/spreading/listening to the Word.
21.    Last Holiday, we were complaining about how much of our earnings went to pay taxes; this Holiday, we comprehend that freedom isn’t free.
22.    Last Holiday, we valued things that were costly; this Holiday, we value things that are real.
23.    Last Holiday, the people we idolized wore football, basketball and baseball uniforms; this Holiday, the people we idolize wear police firefighters and military uniforms.
24.    Last Christmas, “peace on earth” is something we prayed for on Sunday mornings; now, IT IS SOMETHING WE PRAY FOR EVERY DAY

His name is Aaron and he is 15 years old.  He lives in a group home run by Social Services.  I really do not know him;  I picked his name off the XMAS tree at Safeway on December 21, 2001.
He listed several things that he wanted from XMAS…a wallet, lava lamp, tennis shoes (10.5 for size – he must be a strapping robust young teenager), cologne, portable CD player, etc.  Well, for teenagers – who knows what is hip for cologne.  Shoes really have to be tried on for the fit…etc.
I decided to buy him the portable CD player.  I picked out a nice one from Best Buy.  I also bought the 2 year replacement plan so if anything happens to his gift, he can have it replaced.  His CD player came with the adapter and earphones.  I probably should have picked out a XMAS CD for him, too, but decided he probably had CDs…
I took home his gift and wrapped it up and put in a Christmas card to wish him a Merry Christmas.  I explained to him to keep his gift receipt and Service Plan in a safe place so he would have it if he had any problems with his CD.
I told him this gift was bought in Jake’s memory and told him about Jake and how much I missed Jake.  I put in picture button of Jake to “personalize” his gift from us.  I asked him to drive safely and wear Jake’s button in memory of Jake.
I stamped an angel picture in his card and signed it..Jake’s Mom
Merry Christmas to all my readers in OD Land.  I am leaving now to take a walk this morning…and spend time with Jake……
My daughter called me from NC and left a nasty message on my answering machine….it ruined my day….but I can’t let it ruin my walk and time with Jake..
I spent Christmas morning with my oldest son, his wife, and her family.  It was nice; I needed something to make me smile.
If my girls are reading this entry….Renee, that was a nasty message to leave your Mom on Christmas.  I am sorry you feel that way about me.  Have a happy “material” XMAS in NC.  Don’t worry about rushing home..enjoy your relatives…I am fine.  Don’t call to apologize…I am unplugging the phone…sometimes I need to block this type of stress.

I was in my hometown for Thanksgiving..Nashville, Georgia.  I was driving thru my old red neck community when I saw this interesting bumper sticker on a truck while I was stopped at a redlight.
It puzzled me when I first read it….”Hog hunters do it til the squeal is real”…I studied momentarily…then I smiled…I GOT it!
I must be getting old in my years to not figure things out as quickly as I used to…thank goodness Jake wasn’t in the car to ask me what it meant!

P.S.  I made it through Christmas.  I cannot believe it is my 2d XMAS without my son….I have his ornaments on the tree and the hand print he made in ceramic when he was in childcare at the age of 5.  Boy…it seems so unreal….I MISS YOU SON!

This is another touching email.
LEARNING FROM ROSE
The first day of school, our professor introduced himself and 
challenged us to get to know someone we didn’t already know. I stood up to look around when a gentle hand touched my shoulder. I turned around to find a wrinkled, little old lady beaming up at me with a smile that lit up her entire being.  She said, “Hi handsome. My name is Rose. I’m eighty seven years old. Can I give you a hug?”  I laughed and enthusiastically responded, “Of course you may.” and she gave me a giant squeeze. “Why are you in college at such a young, innocent age?” I asked. She jokingly replied, “I’m here to meet a rich husband, get married, have a couple of children, and then retire and travel.”  “No seriously,” I asked. I was curious what may have motivated her to be taking on this challenge at her age. “I always dreamed of having a college education and now I’m getting one.” she told me. After class we walked to the student union building and shared a chocolate milkshake. We became instant friends.
Every day for the next three months we would leave class together and talk nonstop. I was always mesmerized listening to this “time machine” as she shared her wisdom and experience with me. Over the course of the year, Rose became a campus icon and she easily made friends wherever she went. She loved to dress up and she reveled in the attention bestowed upon her from the other students. She was living it up. At the end of the semester we invited Rose to speak at our football banquet. I’ll never forget what she taught us.
She was introduced and stepped up to the podium. As she began to deliver her prepared speech, she dropped her three-by-five cards on the floor.  Frustrated and a little embarrassed she leaned into the microphone and simply said “I’m sorry I’m so jittery. I gave up beer for Lent and this whiskey is killing me. I’ll never get my speech back in order so let me just tell you what I know.”
As we laughed she cleared her throat and began: “We do not stop playing because we are old; we grow old because we stop playing. There are only four secrets to staying young, being happy, and achieving success.  You have to laugh and find humor every day. You’ve got to have a dream.  When you lose your dreams, you die. We have so many people walking around who are dead and don’t even know it. There is a huge difference between growing older and growing up. If you are nineteen years old and lie in bed for one full year and don’t do one productive thing, you will turn twenty years old. If I am eighty-seven years old and stay in bed for a year and never do anything I will turn eighty-eight. Anybody can grow older. That doesn’t take any talent or ability. The idea is to grow up by always finding the opportunity in change. Have no regrets. The elderly usually don’t have regrets for what we did, but rather for things we did not do. The only people who fear death are those with regrets.”   She concluded her speech by courageously singing “The Rose”.
She challenged each of us to study the lyrics or live them out in our daily lives. At the year’s end Rose finished the college degree she had begun all those years ago. One week after graduation Rose died peacefully in her sleep. Over two thousand college students attended her funeral in tribute to the wonderful woman who taught by example that it’s never too late to be all you can possibly be.

since I have really written an entry.  I made it through the holidays, but it was not a calm journey.  This year is the hardest because I know Jake will never be back from his journey.  I wonder if it is normal to continue thinking that this is all a nightmare and I am going to wake up soon.
The girls announced that their Dad is moving out of state and desires to take them with him.  He wants to rotate them every year…one year with me and one year with him.  That has got to be the most silly thing I have ever heard about!  I told them they could not go because I felt they needed to be with their mother..afterall…they are growing into beautiful young ladies..soon will be 15 this Saturday.  Wow – 15 years with twins girls…what an accomplishment.
I have always felt their Dad was not responsible to parent alone…Jake’s death pretty much proved this…short visits could not even warrant his full undivided attention.  Of course the teenagers argued with me, but I decided to stop the arguing and change the subject.  I told them when they are 18 – they are free to leave the nest and go whereever they desire…fly away.
I figure we will discuss this issue b4 a judge in court.  
So you can tell I have been a bit stressed over the past few days.
I decided to play down their 15th bday…they are inviting 2 friends each to our place Saturday afternoon.  I plan to call out for pizza and let the teenagers entertain themselves.  I bought each of my girls a cute purse.  If they look close enough they will find a surprise.  Hidden in the pockets of their purses are 4 LINKIN PARK concert tickets.  I thought they could each invite a friend.  I think it is time they went to a concert without Mom.
Oh well…does anyone know where Andando went to?  He like “disappeared” after his 22 Dec entry.  I miss him.

183,https://www.opendiary.com/m/j8xmom/forgiveness-181-5368087/,2002-01-03,Forgiveness,"
I received this most moving email on forgiveness.  I thought it was worth sharing….
The most creative power given to the human spirit is the power to heal the wounds of a past it cannot change.  (Like forgiving my ex for his part in Jake’s accident and death…)
We do our forgiving alone inside our hearts and minds;
what happens to the people we forgive depends on them.
The first person to benefit from forgiving is the one who does it.
Forgiving happens in three stages:
we rediscover the humanity of the person who wronged us;
we surrender our right to get even; and  we wish that person well.  (This would be major hard to do for my ex)
Forgiving is a journey; the deeper the wound, the longer the journey.  (Jake’s death is unfathomable – like major deep — deeper than the ocean depths…)
Waiting for someone to repent before we forgive is to surrender our future to the person who wronged us.  (I don’t think life is long enough for this to happen…Jake’s Dad telling me he repents for his wrong doing and neglectfulness…)
Forgiving is not a way to avoid pain but to heal the pain.
Forgiving someone who breaks a trust does not mean that
we give him his job back.
Forgiving is the only way to be fair to ourselves.
Forgivers are not doormats; to forgive a person is not a signal that we are willing to put up with what he does.
Forgiving is essential; talking about it is optional.
When we forgive, we set a prisoner free and discover
that the prisoner we set free is us.
When we forgive we walk in stride with the forgiving God.
OKay…I need to say this….Jake’s Dad is forgiven but what happened will NEVER be forgotten…..(tears rolling down my cheeks…)
Dear God,
Help me to forgive Jake’s Dad.  I need to be set free. 
Amen.
Jake’s Mom
P.S. Hug Jake for all of us and tell him we miss him so very, very much.

The girls celebrated their 15th bday and I survived!  I cannot believe I have had twins for 15 years and consider myself still sane…LOL.
It was a small family event…the girls, Joe, Holly, me, and 3 of their friends.
I felt like baking them a cake so I made a cherry chip cake – Betty Crocker mix, of course.  It turned out really nice came out of the pan soooo easy.  
As I was scraping the mix out of the bowl and into the pan…IT HIT ME REALLY HARD!  Not that the girls are growing up….but Jake wouldn’t come running up the stairs to lick the bowl.  I was actually trying to leave some in the bowl for him then it hit me….teary eyes, napkins, cake mix almost missing the pan….
I ordered out pizza and hot wings.  We had soda and lemonade.  We had your choice of chocolate or vanilla ice-cream to go with the cherry cake with cherry icing.
We also had a nice cozy fire in the fireplace.  It was the a nice family gathering…..it seemed so different without Jake…as it was last year.  He would have LOVED the cherry cake.  He was so easy to please.  I miss him more than you can ever imagine….readers.
Anyway, the gift opening was fun, too.  My gift was kind of different.  I got each of the girls a cute purse to take to school and whereever.  The purses had neat pockets….LOTS of POCKETS!  I told them they should check out the pockets and they might find something useful in them.  They looked at me and said, “Money?”  I just smiled and said, “maybe something useful”.  They started looking deperately in the purses and Renee found her prize first…2 LINKIN PARK concert tickets at the World Arena.  The teenagers screamed with excitement.  Becky stopped looking in her purse and looked at me with a puzzled look and said, “Is that it, Mom?  Two tickets in Renee’s purse?”  See, this is a “twin thing”.  Becky thought their were two tickets only because there were two of them – her and her sister.  I just smiled and said, “There might be something useful in your purse, Becky.”  At this point her friend grabbed her purse and was going to help Becky find her prize.  It was quite an exciting moment!  Then they found it!  Two more tickets to see LINKIN PARK.  After the screaming excitement, both my girls looked at me and said, “4 tickets?”  I just smiled and said, “Sure.  I thought you would enjoy inviting a friend and not having your old middle-aged mom hanging out to embarass you guys.”  
They were pretty excited.  They hugged me more than once on Saturday night.  It was a special bday for them.  It was a nice afternoon and evening…but I still didn’t 4get that my little guy wasn’t there to lick the bowl..(tears welling up in my eyes)…sigh….  We were all there…Joe, Holly, Renee, and Becky…I am sure others missed Jake, too.  We just miss him in our own individual special ways.
During the evening, I heard my girls arguing and I walked into the room to see what the problem was…and Becky said, “Mom, Renee won’t let me see Jake.”  I was taken aback at this statement.  For a fleeting moment, I thought I woke up from this nightmare and Jake was home!
Apparently Renee was rewinding a home video from May, 2000.  It was a video we made at Elitches.  I was a bit surprised to have this brought to my attention.  So I said, “Renee, I would like to see Jake.  Lets look at Jake.”  She hit Play on the VCR and stormed out of the room.  The video brought back memories of happier times.
After I saw the video, I went to check on Renee and asked her what was bothering her.  She made it very plain that seeing Jake was hard for her.  I do not think Renee is dealing well with our loss.  I shared with her how happy Jake and all of us were in the video.  Then…I left it alone.
WE MISS YOU SO MUCH, JAKE!

I went to Longs tonite to pick up some firewood.  The checker offered to carry it out to my car.  I told him I would just tote it myself but he insisted.
He thought it was so cool that I had a power door on my van that opens and shuts either by using the button on my keychain or using the button in the van. I did a demo for him and he and I started into a conversation.
He was telling me how his headlights on his 1994 Camero open up.  It is hard to explain in writing, but they are like eyes; they open and close with a “whooshing” sound.  This guy was so full of excitement to share his car stuff with me.  He is 17.  
As we ended our conversation, I asked him to drive safely and told him about Jake.  He just looked at me and let me know right away that he had heard about Jake’s accident about  a year ago.  I told him it happened in September, 2000.
He remembered the story and to such detail that he recalled the driver had a Camero, too.  Wow.  Then he pointed his name tag out to me…”Jacob”.  I thought I was going to pass out in the icy parking lot tonite!  I know my heart fluttered.
I didn’t have a picture button with me, but I gave him a Random Act of Kindness card…one I made that said:
This is a Random Act of Kindness done in memory of my little boy, Jake.
He rode his gocart to Heaven on Sunday, September, 24, 2000.
I miss him very much and want to remember him always by doing something special in his memory.
In Memory of Jake S. 5/14/91 – 9/24/00
I then explained to him how I use these cards.
I asked him to remember Jake whenever he drove his car.  He said he would and he would keep the card in his wallet.  
I could tell this young teenager will make a difference in this world with his careful driving.  I could tell in his eyes that he was moved by Jake’s accident. He looked in my eyes with deep sincerity in his words.
When we parted, I called him Jake and then quickly asked what he prefers to be called…Jacob or Jake?  He said, “Jake”.  I just smiled and got in my van to come home.
It was so nice to talk to “Jake” and hear a voice talk back.
To my little angel in Heaven, Jake…thanks for visiting your Mom tonite.  I cried all the way home and shared this visit with your sister, Becky.
I know in my heart that this could not be coincidence.  It was you, Jake….coming through for me from the “other side”.  Thanks, son.  I miss you so much….(tearing running down my cheeks…too blurry to type any more……)

This is a very inspirational story I received via email this week.
A Janitor’s 10 Lessons in Leadership 
By Col. James Moschgat, Commander
12th Operations Group 
William “Bill” Crawford certainly was an unimpressive figure, one you could easily overlook during a hectic day at the U.S. Air Force Academy.
Mr. Crawford, as most of us referred to him back in the late 1970s, was our squadron janitor. 
While we cadets busied ourselves preparing for academic exams, athletic events, Saturday morning parades and room inspections, or never-ending leadership classes, Bill quietly moved about the squadron mopping and buffing floors, emptying trash cans, cleaning toilets, or just tidying up the mess 100 college-age kids can leave in a dormitory.
Sadly, and for many years, few of us gave him much notice, rendering little more than a passing nod or throwing a curt, “G’morning!” in his direction as we hurried off to our daily duties. 
Why?  Perhaps it was because of the way he did his job-he always kept the squadron area spotlessly clean, even the toilets and showers gleamed. 
Frankly, he did his job so well, none of us had to notice or get involved.  After all, cleaning toilets was his job, not ours. 
Maybe it was his physical appearance that made him disappear into the background.  Bill didn’t move very quickly and, in fact, you could say he even shuffled a bit, as if he suffered from some sort of injury.  His
gray hair and wrinkled face made him appear ancient to a group of youngcadets.
And his crooked smile, well, it looked a little funny.  Face it; Bill was an old man working in a young person’s world.  What did he have to offer us on a personal level? 
Finally, maybe it was Mr. Crawford’s personality that rendered him almost invisible to the young people around him.  Bill was shy, almost painfully so.  He seldom spoke to a cadet unless they addressed him first, and that didn’t happen very often.  Our janitor always buried himself in his work, moving about with stooped shoulders, a quiet gait, and an averted gaze.  If he noticed the hustle and bustle of cadet life around him, it was hard to tell.

188,https://www.opendiary.com/m/j8xmom/not-just-a-janitor-part-2-5368092/,2002-01-10,NOT Just a Janitor (Part 2),"
So, for whatever reason, Bill blended into the woodwork and became just another fixture around the squadron.  The Academy, one of our nation’s premier leadership laboratories, kept us busy from dawn till dusk.  And Mr.
Crawford… well, he was just a janitor. 
That changed one fall Saturday afternoon in 1976.  I was reading a book about World War II and the tough Allied ground campaign in Italy, when I stumbled across an incredible story.  On September 13, 1943, a Private
William Crawford from Colorado, assigned to the 36th Infantry Division, had been involved in some bloody fighting on Hill 424 near Altavilla, Italy. 
The words on the page leapt out at me: “in the face of intense and overwhelming hostile fire … with no regard for personal safety … on his own initiative, Private Crawford single-handedly attacked fortified enemy
positions.”  It continued, “for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at risk of life above and beyond the call of duty, the President of the United States…” 
“Holy cow,” I said to my roommate, “you’re not going to believe this, but I think our janitor is a Medal of Honor winner.” 
We all knew Mr. Crawford was a WWII Army vet, but that didn’t keep my friend from looking at me as if I was some sort of alien being. Nonetheless, we couldn’t wait to ask Bill about the story on Monday. 
We met Mr. Crawford bright and early Monday and showed him the page in question from the book, anticipation and doubt on our faces.  He starred
at it for a few silent moments and then quietly uttered something like, “Yep, that’s me.” 
Mouths agape, my roommate and I looked at one another, then at the book, and quickly back at our janitor.  Almost at once we both stuttered, “Why didn’t you ever tell us about it?” 
He slowly replied after some thought, “That was one day in my life and it happened a long time ago.” 
I guess we were all at a loss for words after that.  We had to hurry off to class and Bill, had chores to attend to.  However, after that brief exchange, things were never again the same around our squadron.  Word spread like wildfire among the cadets that we had a hero in our midst-Mr. Crawford, our janitor, had won the Medal! 
Cadets who had once passed by Bill with hardly a glance, now greeted him with a smile and a respectful, “Good morning, Mr. Crawford.” 
Those who had before left a mess for the “janitor” to clean up started taking it upon themselves to put things in order.  Most cadets routinely stopped to talk to Bill throughout the day and we even began inviting him to our formal squadron functions.  He’d show up dressed in a conservative dark suit and quietly talk to those who approached him, the only sign of his heroics being a simple blue, star-spangled lapel pin. Almost overnight, Bill went from being a simple fixture in our squadron to one of our teammates. 
Mr. Crawford changed too, but you had to look closely to notice the difference. After that fall day in 1976, he seemed to move with more purpose, his shoulders didn’t seem to be as stooped, he met our greetings with a direct gaze and a stronger “good morning” in return, and he flashed his crooked smile more often. 
The squadron gleamed as always, but everyone now seemed to notice it more.
Bill even got to know most of us by our first names, something that didn’t happen often at the Academy.  While no one ever formally acknowledged the change, I think we became Bill’s cadets and his squadron.  
As often happens in life, events sweep us away from those in our past. 
The last time I saw Bill was on graduation day in June 1977.  As I walked out of the squadron for the last time, he shook my hand and simply said, “Good luck, young man.” 
With that, I embarked on a career that has been truly lucky and blessed.   Mr. Crawford continued to work at the Academy and eventually retired in his native Colorado where he resides today, one of four Medal of
Honor winners living in a small town. 
Move on to Part 3 next!

A wise person once said, “It’s not life that’s important, but those you meet along the way that make the difference.”  Bill was one who made a difference for me. While I haven’t seen Mr. Crawford in over twenty years, he’d probably be surprised to know I think of him often.  Bill Crawford, our janitor, taught me many valuable, unforgettable leadership lessons.  Here
are ten I’d like to share with you. 
1.    Be Cautious of Labels.  Labels you place on people may define your relationship to them and bound their potential.  Sadly, and for a long time, we labeled Bill as just a janitor, but he was so much more. Therefore, be cautious of a leader who callously says, “Hey, he’s just an Airman.”  Likewise, don’t tolerate the O-1, who says, “I can’t do that, I’m just a lieutenant.”
2.    Everyone Deserves Respect.  Because we hung the “janitor” label on Mr. Crawford, we often wrongly treated him with less respect than others around us.  He deserved much more, and not just because he was a Medal of Honor winner.  Bill deserved respect because he was a janitor, walked among us, and was a part of our team.
3.    Courtesy Makes a Difference.  Be courteous to all around you, regardless of rank or position.  Military customs, as well as common courtesies, help bond a team.  When our daily words to Mr. Crawford turned
from perfunctory “hellos” to heartfelt greetings, his demeanor and personality outwardly changed.  It made a difference for all of us.
4.    Take Time to Know Your People.  Life in the military is hectic, but that’s no excuse for not knowing the people you work for and with.  For years a hero walked among us at the Academy and we never knew it. Who are the heroes that walk in your midst?
5.    Anyone Can Be a Hero.  Mr. Crawford certainly didn’t fit anyone’s standard definition of a hero.  Moreover, he was just a private on the day he won his Medal.  Don’t sell your people short, for any one of them
may be the hero who rises to the occasion when duty calls.  On the other hand, it’s easy to turn to your proven performers when the chips are down, but don’t ignore the rest of the team.  Today’s rookie could and should be tomorrow’s superstar.
6.    Leaders Should Be Humble.   Most modern day heroes and some leaders are anything but humble, especially if you calibrate your “hero meter” on today’s athletic fields.  End zone celebrations and self -aggrandizement are what we’ve come to expect from sports greats.  Not Mr. Crawford-he was too busy working to celebrate his past heroics. Leaders would be well served to do the same.
7.    Life Won’t Always Hand You What You Think You Deserve.  We in the military work hard and, dang it, we deserve recognition, right? However, sometimes you just have to persevere, even when accolades don’t come your way.  Perhaps you weren’t nominated for junior officer or airman of the quarter as you thought you should-don’t let that stop you.
8.    Don’t pursue glory.  Private Bill Crawford didn’t pursue glory; he did his duty and then swept floors for a living.  No Job is beneath a leader.  If Bill Crawford, a Medal of Honor winner, could clean latrines and smile, is there a job beneath your dignity?  Think about it.
9.    Pursue excellence.  No matter what task life hands you, do it well.  Dr. Martin Luther King said, “If life makes you a street sweeper, be the best street sweeper you can be.”  Mr. Crawford modeled that philosophy and helped make our dormitory area a home.
10.    Life is a Leadership Laboratory.  All too often we look to some school or PME class to teach us about leadership when, in fact, life is a leadership laboratory.  Those you meet everyday will teach you enduring lessons if you just take time to stop, look and listen.  I spent four years at the Air Force Academy, took dozens of classes, read hundreds of books, and met thousands of great people.  I gleaned leadership skills from all of them, but one of the people I remember most is Mr. Bill Crawford and the lessons he unknowingly taught.  Don’t miss your opportunity to learn.
Bill Crawford was a janitor.  However, he was also a teacher, friend, role model and one great American hero.  Thanks…
Isn’t this a heartwarming lesson on leadership?  #10 is so true….

My pictures have disappeared from my diary.  I wondered what had happened to them.  I found out today, after I did some internet research, that the company hosting my pictures went out of business…photopoint.com
I am disappointed.  I paid for a 12 month subscription and was able to use it about 5 months.  I am sad that I no longer can see my pictures in my diary.  If you know another site that I can upload my pictures on, please let me know.
Not much else to report.  I am headed out the door with the girls to do some shopping.  
I checked out OD+ and it seems like a neat place. 
I also heard from Andando via email.  He is no longer writing in his OD.  He is currently on vacation to keep warm during the winter.
I just got the registration information on the National grief conference this year.  It is going to be held in Salt Lake City this year.  I can DRIVE to this one!  It seems more reasonably priced, but there is not too much variety in the topics being discussed.  There are going to be some noted authors there and I have read both their books:  The Christmas Box and The Bereaved Parent.
I guess I will be going alone if I go because my girls will be at the beach.  It is over the July 4th weekend.
I wonder if there is anything to see in Salt Lake City if I decide to break away from the conference for some quiet time.  Does anyone know anything about Salt Lake City, Utah?

I went to the movies this afternoon.  I had planned to see the new Sissy Spacek flick – Into the Bedroom – but saw A Beautiful Mind..by accident.
For some odd reason I went in the wrong entrance.  So I was sitting there by myself..munching on some buttered popcorn and washing it down with a cherry slurpy…then I noticed that A Beautiful Mind was NOT A PREVIEW..IT WAS FOR REAL!  I am in the wrong show!  
Hey – I stayed and this is super movie!  On a scale of 1 to 10..I would give it a 10+ without a second thought.  Russell Crowe is in this flick.  It is based on a true story…I learned something at the movies this afternoon.  I learned who John Nash is – Nobel prize winner…for what?  Can’t tell you – it would ruin this movie.
Gee..I still have no clue how I managed to walk in the wrong door at the movies.  These large theaters overwhelm me..I guess.
If you know anyone that is nerdy..likes math…and talks with big words…send them to this movie.  This movie will make you laugh and cry.  It will make you wonder, too.  I thought I lost the story line at one point…but what an awesome ending!
Jake’s Mom
As you know, I have been walking since December..either in the am or pm.  Well, Jake walked with me on Wednesday morning.  I was up b4 6am and out on a brisk walk..then SPLAT!  I fell!  Right in front of Jake’s daycare – Junior Academy!  Thanks alot, Jake!  That fall definitely woke me up – I was alert for the rest of my walk.

I just HAD to share this email.  It made me smile alot!
THE GIRLS!
When I was in my younger days, I weighed a few pounds less.
I needn’t hold my tummy in to  wear a belted dress. 
But now that I am older, I’ve set my body free; 
There’s comfort of elastic where once my waist would be.
Inventor of those high-heeled shoes – my feet have not forgiven;
I have to wear a nine now, but used to wear a seven.
And how about those pantyhose–They’re sized by weight, 
you see,
So how come when I put them on, the crotch is at my knees?
I need to wear these glasses as the prints were getting smaller; 
And it wasn’t very long ago I know that I was taller. 
Though my hair has turned to gray and my skin no longer fits…
On the inside, I’m the same old me, just the outside’s 
changed a bit.
On a positive note… I’ve learned that no matter what happens, or how bad it seems today, life does go on, and it will be better tomorrow.  
I’ve learned that you can tell a lot about a person by the way he/she handles these three things: a rainy day,
lost luggage, and tangled Christmas tree lights.
I’ve learned that regardless of your relationship with your parents, you’ll miss them when they’re gone from your life. 
I’ve learned that making a “living” is not the same thing as making a “life.”
I’ve learned that life sometimes gives you a second chance.
I’ve learned that you shouldn’t go through life with a catcher’s mitt on both hands. You need to be able to throw something back.
I’ve learned that whenever I decide something with an open heart, I usually make the right decision. 
I’ve learned that even when I have pains, I don’t have to be one.
I’ve learned that every day you should reach out and touch someone. People love a warm hug, or just a friendly pat on the back.
I’ve learned that I still have a lot to learn. 
I’ve learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.

Sunday afternoon I was taking my long walk and I noticed a moving van in the neighborhood.  Being the friendly person I am, I said to the woman, “Moving in or moving out?”  She says, “Out”.  So I say, “Moving is such a big job.”  Then she comes up to me to share her story.  After 26 years of marriage, her husband tells her he doesn’t want to be married to her anymore.  Wow!  What a XMAS present, huh?  He told her this last month b4 XMAS.
Well, I wished her the best and shared with her that I, too, was divorced.
Well, today, a friend and I decide to take a morning walk and we bump into this lady again.  Wow!  What a coincidence…my friend is divorced, too.  I was married 10+ years and my friend was married 15+ years.  So we briefly share our stories and try to give her some moral support.  She is so sad and teary eyed.  I felt great anger towards her husband for doing this to her.  Thank goodness she had one grown son…unlike me…when I was divorced, I had 4 kids..15, 8, 8, and 3!  So we exchanged phone numbers and plan to get together sometime soon after she settles into her new abode.  We plan to share our experiences and what we learned and give her some useful advice.
She works at a movie theater and says she can get us in to see movies with her.  Wow..what a perk on this morning walk!
Divorce is a loss, too, readers.  26 years she gave herself to this husband of hers.  26 years her life revolved around him.  Now she is told to hit the road.  It is a loss and there are going to be alot of tears.  This is another type of grief.  I hope I can help her.  I think I would like to take her out to dinner sometime..random act of kindness…in memory of my son.
I MISS YOU SO MUCH, JAKE!

I do not understand why things happen to people.  I need so much for you to leave me a note and explain why children leave this world so soon.  I was contacted by another single Mom like me.  She lost her 9 year old son on December 21, 2001.  Why, God?  He has Christmas presents he never opened.  He was the youngest child of 4 … like Jake.  His Mom just adopted a dog for him.  His dog died last night as this grief stricken Mom was calling me from Missouri.  It hurts so much, God.  I live so far away and I wish I could just go visit this person and hold her hand and listen.  If I could just go there and wipe the tears away.  If I could just go there and….cry with her….if I could just do something…to keep another person from experiencing this pain.
An 11 year old boy was involved in a tragic ski accident last Saturday.  He was on ski trip with his CHURCH GROUP.  Why?  His Dad is a pastor, too.
I just don’t understand…..please help me, God.
Hug Jake, Nick, and Dustin for me, God.  Tell them we miss them so very much.  Please give their parents the strength to make it through this out-of-sequence event in their lives.  Amen.

I received a couple emails from Dustin’s Aunt in Texas.  Somehow they all made it through the funeral, but now it is all uphill.  
It is a journey NOBODY with children expects to go on.  It is a journey beyond description.  
I have let her know that I am here to journey with Dustin’s family.  I don’t think I have alot to offer, but I can offer to be here for them.  I cannot ease their pain or stop their tears or make them quit missing him.  
Pain is so natural for us because we didn’t want to let go – ever – of our kids.  
Tears are good because tears let us feel our emotions..our love…for our kids.  
I never liked it when a grief counselor said, “You will always miss him.”  Just this statement made it all too final for me…Jake is not coming back to my kitchen table.  I didn’t want to hear that, but I listened to him and cried.  
I think I have discovered something biology overlooked.  I think my tear ducts hold endless tears…they never run out.  But that is good…as long as I cry…I remember.  
God, if you choose me to endure Alzheimers disease, PLEASE do not let me FORGET MY SON, JAKE.  You can let me forget my hometown, my failed marriage, my C in geometry in 7th grade…but please do not let me forget my little boy.  You can let me forget most anything else..but not Jake.  I have to always remember him so if I make it upstairs to where he is …I will know him.
I talk about Jake alot because he was such a part of my life.  Let’s always talk about Jake, Nick, and Dustin.  They were wonderful, all-American kids.
Desert Castaway says it so well when she talks to you, God.  I am not that eloquent with words, but know that I hope I get better at it.
Desert Castaway, please say another prayer for all of us grieving parents.  Include my dear friend’s son, Nathan, too.  He was called Home at the young age of 12…over 5 years ago.  We have not forgotten Nathan.  It was Nathan’s Mom that encouraged me to talk about Jake.  At first it was awkward around my other kids, but now they have accepted that I need to do this.  Two of my kids talk alot about Jake and one remains silent.  The silent one writes her feelings out in poetry.  Thanks, Michelle.  Michelle also encouraged me to write about Jake – this is how I met all of you.  Thanks, Michelle, for leading me down this path.  Because you reached out to help me, I find myself doing the same because it is lonely to walk down this path without someone with you.
Let’s pray (okay – I am going to try really hard now)
Heavenly Father,
Please give us grieving parents the strength to carry us through life without our kids’ physical presence.
Help us find the strength to help others in these same sad circumstances.
Help us to understand the things that we cannot figure out and patience to deal with life as it seems to charge onward despite our losses.
Amen
P.S. 
Also, give me wisdom to figure out the true value of refinancing my house with this “low interest rate in years” advertising.  I have nobody here to help me make these decisions and my decisions must be made wisely since I am the Head of Household single-handedly and my decision affects everyone in the household.

Jake was crying as he was yelling these words when he was about 5 years old.  It was a Friday night and Joe and his girlfriend (now wife) were watching videos downstairs.  
Jake’s face was tear streaked as he came up the stairs to tell on his big brother.  So I told Jake, “Go downstairs and tell Joe I want to see him NOW.”  Jake turned around and went back downstairs to tell Joe to come see me.
Joe came up the stairs like a typical cocky 17 year old  – baggy pants, ear ring in his ear, attitude…etc.
I sternly told him to grow up and let his little brother sit beside Holly to watch a movie and eat popcorn.  I told him, “Jake is only 5 years old – he is NOT going to steal your girlfriend! He just wants to be a part!  If I have to come down there and make you behave…it will not be nice!  You are 17 years old and Jake is only 5.  Grow up!”
Well, Jake was able to sit beside Holly and eat popcorn and enjoy the video.  I sure miss his voice, readers.  Sometimes I just walk and try to picture him riding his bike ahead of me with his red hair blowing in the wind.  I try so hard to hear his voice say “Hey, Mom!  Hurry up!  Look at me – no hands!” Then I close my eyes, and I see him…just like it used to be…just like it should still be…then I wipe my tears and head home without my little boy and wonder…why?

I would like to meet John Edwards.  I have watched his show and seen how he can connect with those who have “crossed over” to the other side.  I want to connect with my 9 year old son who left us on September 24, 2000.  He was driving his gocart and was hit by a 16 year old driver.  Jake died as a result of his injuries in this sudden accident.  I miss him so very much.  He was my youngest child.  It has been 16+ months since his accident.  I just want to know that he is okay.  I want to know so much about that day.  His Dad picked him up at 10am that Sunday morning and took him out to ride his gocart.  He was so excited about going with his dad to ride his gocart.  I started my OD to share Jake with everyone and let them know how special he was to all of us.  I want to know what really happened that day.  Did Jake see the car coming?  It was a barricaded road and these teenagers drove around the barricades drag-racing style.  Jake was living his dream – driving his gocart on a beautiful brisk Colorado afternoon.  He was hit at 3:50pm and died at 5:19pm that Sunday afternoon.  We never knew our hugs would be our last.  I hugged my kids everyday and told them I loved them and they did the same.  I never knew Jake would not come home.  I would like to meet John Edwards and connect with my little boy.

Well, Valentines Day hasn’t really been special for me in a long time.  It seems it was only during those romantic times of my life…like when I had a boyfriend in grammar school..or when I was engaged…it ends when you get married…at least it did for me.
I do enjoy getting the kids a little surprise.  This year I got the girls each a stuffed animal that sang – Renee’s animal sings – “I Just Called to Say I Love You”.  Renee’s animal is a monkey with fashionable dred locks – long braids.  He is really hip looking.  Becky’s animal is a cute gorilla or baboon or whatever you want to call it.  He sings something like “I Want to be Your Valentine”.  They each got a candy, too – Hershey Kisses.
I got Joe and his wife these cute kissing monkeys.  They have velcro on their lips and stick together.  They are adorable.  Of course, they got chocolate candy, too.
Valentines Day this year was special for me.  I was surprised by a visit from Joe and Holly.  They came to my office!  They brought me a large heart-shaped box filled with chocolate and a very sweet card.  They visited with me at work for over an hour.  It was so sweet that they came to see me.  They made my day very special. 
Tonite I am going to Joe and Holly’s place for dinner – they promised me a good southern dinner.  I can hardly wait!

My best friend from 8th grade used this term to describe her car when I went to see her over Thanksgiving.  This was the funniest term I think I have ever heard in reference to a car.  This is what it is – directly cut and pasted from her email.  Thanks for sharing this with me and my readers, Rhonda!
A “Grocery gitter” is just a big ‘ole car that is a
road hog…and…almost worn out.  My grocery gitter
is gray, with the side moldings missing, the hood
ornament broken off, the passenger window doesn’t roll
down cause it’s off the track, AND there is no air
conditioning, and the radio is missing a knob, (I have
one knob for both dials and I just take it off and put
it on the other), the seats are torn and the piece of
plastic that goes on the front of the dash (that fits
around the radio, glove box, etc, has come loose and
it flaps and rattles when you drive down the road!

Jake’s Dad has a friend (woman) with a little boy – Carter.  He is about 5 y/o now…making him about 5 years younger than Jake.  It seemed like Carter took priority over Jake at times.  Jake’s Dad would seem to spend more time with Carter than Jake at times.  I always thought it was because he was babysitting for his woman friend.
One day Jake came home and said, “Mom, know what? Carter called MY Dad – DAD.”  I looked at Jake and said, “Well, what did you think about that, Jake?”  Jake said, “I looked at Carter and said, Jeff is MY Dad.  He is JEFF to YOU.”  I then asked Jake what Carter said then.  Jake said, “Carter said – MY Jeff.”  I asked Jake, “What did you say?”  Jake said, “I said that’s ok.  Jeff is MY Dad and he is YOUR Jeff.”
I think Jake was just trying to claim his Dad to himself.  I really never thought about it again.
Well, yesterday, my daughter Becky had an emotional day.  She is having a hard time without Jake.  So we cried together.  She says she misses having a little brother.  She said she likes spending time with Carter, but Carter’s Mom and her Dad are no longer friends.  Then she dropped an emotional bombshell on me.  She said “Carter is my half-brother, Mom.”  I looked at her and asked her why she would think that.  She sobbed and said, “Dad told me about 3 months ago.”  I was speechless.
Jake never knew Carter was his brother…..Jake would have made a great big brother for Carter….
I miss Jake….

I watched Sally Jessie Raphael – the talk show today.  Actually I faded in and out of it in my flu-like stupor.  It was about Little People – midgets.  It was a nice show.  There is actually an organization called LPA – Little People of America.  I will probably check it out when I feel better.  I am not a midget, but I found this show very interesting.
There was a little man with no arms on this show.  He was very compassionate.  He married a “normal” sized lady and they have a beautiful daughter.  This guy was born with no arms and his Mom was told to put him in a home.  Apparently, he was born in a Catholic hospital because a Nunn overheard the discussion at his birth and convinced the mother to take her son home and raise him like her other 3 kids.  Well, the Mom did a wonderful job.  This guy is now 44 and loves his family…the family that almost wasn’t…

Gone Too Soon

Today I helped a friend do a video for her school paper.  She is working on her doctorate in Psychology.  My part?  I did a short clip on losing Jake and how it changed my life.  Talking about his accident still brings me to tears…which I hope always happens because he meant so much to me and my family.
I told her about my diary and how it has helped me to share Jake with so many people.  I told her about using the Random Act of Kindness cards to keep Jake’s memory alive for me and others.  I told her how much it meant to lose this special little boy…a part of me was lost that day in September 2000….a part of me that will never be replaced…
Tomorrow is a big day for me.  I am going to decline the loan for the refinancing of my house.  After studying the fees – $8000 is an insane amount of money to refinance…especially when I have a friend who refinanced for less than $3000!  I plan to march into the mortgage company office and give the signed letter to cancel the loan and tell them thanks, but no thanks…your fees are too high and I can get the same job done somewhere else for lower fees.  Wish me luck!
Desert Castaway, I have not forgotten your picture button and Random Act of Kindness card.  This flu bug jacked up my entire routine.  I will get it in the mail this week; I promise you…in Jake’s name.

Well, I cancelled my refinance loan.  During the 3 day window to review documents and cancel, I decided $7900+ was too expensive to refinance.  Yes, $3600 alone was a broker fee and the rest of the fees were inflated.  
So, I went to their office yesterday morning and told them to cancel the loan.  The broker came out with this surprised look on his face.  I just told him his fees were too high and I could have it done alot less elsewhere…like at a bank.  I told him I was sorry that it didn’t work out and it was nothing personal.  Then I left.
My friend’s bank called me.  It seems they charge around $2000.  Can you imagine?  This broker at the mortgage company was taking me for a ride that ended abruptly!  $5K extra costs …..boy am I glad I took time to review those documents and speak to some professional people this weekend…like a licensed realtor and professional banking personnel.
It never fails to amaze me how people try their hardest to take advantage of single parents…especially a single parent consumed with grief.  Thanks, Jake for making Mom focus on this minor detail of $8K!
I miss you so much, Jake.

Well, I am emotionally drained.  Today I had an appointment with my attorney to resolve a couple issues over my past divorce with Jake’s Dad.  Jake’s Dad came, too.  Basically, we agreed and decided to go somewhere to talk afterwards.  He chose Starbucks.
It was a nice visit.  It was good to hear Jake’s name.  I can tell Jake’s Dad is having a very difficult time.  Men just do not see the value in going to counseling so I did not suggest it.  We just talked about life in general.  He said something that really lingered in my mind.  “Pat, soon it will be just you and me left dealing with this.  We will be the only ones left.  We will be the only ones that remember.”
Readers, promise me that you will always remember Jake.  Please?  This statement from Jake’s Dad scared me.  I tried not to show it.  I just looked into his eyes and studied him.  I don’t want anyone to ever forget Jake.  Please remember him…please (tears running down my cheeks)….goodnight
I will try to write more later.
Jake, we will NEVER 4get…Dad,me, Joe, Holly, Becky, and Renee.  All your friends will NEVER 4get you son.  Never…I promise you…always…….my readers will never 4get you Jake.   Help me, Jake….I am not doing well tonite.  Your Dad is leaving to go to a remote island to work…he is having a very difficult time.  Give your Dad a sign that you still with him.

207,https://www.opendiary.com/m/j8xmom/thanksgiving-1997-5368111/,2002-02-28,Thanksgiving 1997,"
I remember a nice trip to Texas in November 1997.  I wanted to tell you about it.
It was Thanksgiving 1997 and my oldest son was in Air Force tech school in Wichita Falls, Texas.  He was lonely and homesick so I planned a road trip.
Becky, Jake, and I went on this trip.  Renee was acting out at the time and was staying with her Dad.  Becky was 10 and Jake was 6.  We left on the Wednesday b4 Thanksgiving and drove to Texas.  It was a fun road trip.  Becky had packed a “fun” box for Jake to keep him busy.  It included markers, crayons, coloring books, reading books, etc.
I will never forget eating at that DQ in Dalhart, Texas…YUCK!  Anyway, just b4 dark, we were passing a cotton field.  Jake asked about the “white stuff”.  I told him it was cotton and that his clothes were made out of that “white stuff”.  The kids were so fascinated with this “white stuff” that I pulled over and told them to go “pick some cotton”.  They were so excited.  They jumped out of the car and ran into the cotton field.  They filled their hands with cotton and brought it back to the car.  I thought this was the “teachable moment” that all parents look for!  LOL.  They were so excited to have picked cotton.  
Then we continued our drive into Wichita Falls and got on the Base – Sheppard AFB.  There was “no room at the inn” so we called my son on the cell phone to meet us on Base.  He drove me to a Comfort Inn and out to dinner.  He stayed with us that night, too.  Jake and Becky were so happy to have Joe back with us for awhile.
We ended up eating at some buffet place for Thanksgiving…another YUCK…and then out for a movie.  We had a nice few days in Wichita Falls.  We left on  Saturday and it was hard for all of us to say goodbye and leave Joe.
I will never 4get this Thanksgiving trip because it meant alot 4 us to b together again.  I also will never 4get how hot it was in Texas in November!  I know those people at the Comfort Inn must think I am a nut case because I had the windows open in my room trying to get the air to circulate.  Also, I was running the AC in November!  My oldest son could not believe how hot I was.  He had been in Texas since July so he was used to this mugginess!  Not me….Colorado has ruined me.
I remember entertaining Jake on the way home to Colorado.  I had an atlas with all kinds of animals on the cover.  I gave Jake a marker and directed him to circle certain animals.  He loved sitting in the front seat with me playing that game.  I bet I still have that atlas somewhere.  I need to find it.  It meant alot to me and Jake on that drive back home.  Becky was asleep in the back and she missed out on this home-made game.  
See…it is the simple things in life that matter the most in the end…road trips, family, etc.  I miss you, Jake….everyday….it isn’t easier after 17 months….but life was never supposed to be easy….
Jake brought his Texas cotton to school after Thanksgiving for Show and Tell.  I sure wish I still had some of it.  I will always have this memory like it was yesterday.

Okay – deep breath – I have accepted an opportunity to speak about organ donation.  It is next Tuesday night to a Boy Scout Troop.  After I committed, I am beginning to wonder if I can look at those boys ages 11+.  Jake would have been 11 on May 14, 2002.
Deep breath…in…out…ok
I think I can do it.  I will tell Jake’s story and tell a few facts about organ donation.
If any of you have an ideas…please let me know and pray for my strength…I have to do this ….for Jake.
I guess the important thing to remember is…it doesn’t cost anything to be an organ donor.  The gift of life is free……
I miss you, Jake.  You will never know how much, son….
your Dad is leaving to go to the Marshall Islands to work.  It is very far away.  I hope he does ok….he is having such a very hard time.

Actually, it is a volunteer job, but I am excited about the newness of it all. 
I am going to work in the libray today.  They were looking for people last month and ran two blurbs in the local paper.  I responded and off I am today to a new adventure.
I was thinking maybe I could suggest a grief table..for the month of July…since that is when The Compassionate Friends always hold their national conference.  This July it is in Salt Lake…and I plan to go…for Jake..it will be a road trip dedicated to him.
I thought I could put together some books on grief and literature about The Compassionate Friends and the conference.  What do you think?

Well, I met the person I will be reporting in to at the library.  She is very nice.
When she asked me what I would like most to help out with, I told her to put whereever there is a need. 
I did mention about doing a display table for grief.  She thought it was a great idea and said the director is always looking for things to put into action.  So…I think I can do the table and lots of other things.  I am sure I will be very, very busy.  I am so psyched about this volunteer job!
I just got acquainted with my supervisor there today.  I hope to start next week..either one night a week or one afternoon on the weekends.  I have so much to look forward to now!
It flurried a bit in the parking lot at the library and it is really cold here….brrrrrrrrr.  It is 17 degrees now, but it was below zero Friday morning.

Tomorrow night is the big night.  I am going to tell your story and how you were an organ donor.  I am going to tell everyone how all your organs were assigned to receipients, but you could not give them up because of an infection that set in.  I will tell people how much it meant to me for some part of you to help someone else and it wasn’t to be.  Our intentions were so good and I did not understand why things happened the way they did in the end.  
It will be hard to look at a group of Boy Scouts that are 11 years old and up…knowing you would have been 11 this May.  I will take a deep breath, Jake, and do my best to tell your story.  I so wanted your heart to beat for someone else, your lungs to breathe for someone else, your corneas to show someone else the beautiful world we live in, …I wanted so much for a part of you to help someone else…but medically…it was not to be.
I will tell them how your sisters shared with me the story about the organ donation you watched on TV…long before your accident and how you told them to “give all all my stuff away when I die…tell Mom that if she is still around” ….You were so young Jake to be so generous.  You were so smart to think that I might not be around when you left this world.  I was not supposed to see you leave, son….it was not supposed to happen this way.  Why did a 41 year old mother have to bury her 9 year old son?  Well, things happen and it happened.  I miss you so much, Jake and I will tell your story because I never want anyone to think I will ever forget you…..
Organ donation is free and there are not many free things in this world that make a lasting impact like the gift of life.  People die while waiting for organ and tissue transplants.  The receipients that were designated for Jake’s donation were not in a life or death situation or they would have transplanted his organs with anti-biotics.  They told me this.
One thing I will never 4get, readers, is when the RN from the Donor Alliance organization came to talk to me in the hospital that night on September 24, 2000.  He said, “I will be Jake’s nurse and I will take good care of him.”  I will never 4get those compassionate words.  This is from a man with two small boys.  It was those words that enabled me to hold Jake’s hand one last time and say, “Jake, we loved you so much.  We didn’t expect you to leave us so soon,” as tears rolled down my cheeks looking at you rest for the final time.  Your hair was so beautiful and you looked just like you were in a deep sleep.   Your Dad stood next to me and hugged me so tight.  It is hard, Jake…to live each day without you…I still wonder if I had squeezed your hand tightly and yelled at the top of my lungs, “Jake!  It’s me, Mom.  Open your eyes and look at me!”….would you have heard me?  I guess not because you were declared brain dead….I still find that hard to grasp.  You were so full of life that morning and then it ended at 3:48pm on that Sunday afternoon.  The sun stopped shining on me that day, son….I live in a total eclipse…now.  Elton John wrote, “Don’t let the sun go down on me…”…it did on September 24, 2000.
I wear this mask everyday that looks like I am okay…but I am not okay…not ever..again…….I wonder if this mask will make it through the Boy Scout presentation….
Did you know that Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts can earn a patch from learning about organ donation?  Yes, they can.  This talk tomorrow night is educational.  The decision to donate is a personal one and it is ok to NOT be an organ donor.  It’s a personal choice.

then I shared with Troop 181 Jake’s story.  Those boys had excellent eye contact.  I am sure my voice was unsteady, but I told them I had to take deep breaths because it was hard to be around all these boys again….
I ended it with a few facts….every 13 minutes someone’s name is added to the list of those needing organs….15 people die everyday waiting for an organ transplant….and finally..it doesn’t cost anything to be an organ donor.  The Gift of Life is free.
Also, one of the troop Moms is a RN.  She was great to talk and share with.  Nurses are special people…compassionate and understanding…excellent eye contact, too.  Madgal is a nurse…visit her diary and tell her how special she is…
Did you know one organ and tissue donor can help 25 people?
Did you know in Colorado and Wyoming there are over 1300 children and adults awaiting organs?
Did you know that I miss Jake?

we will have as a family will be Saturday.  I am planning a BBQ with all the kids over (Joe, Holly, Becky, Renee, (Jake in my heart)).  I am inviting their Dad over.  He is not doing well and is leaving the country.  He plans to work in the Marshall Islands.  This is a tropical group of Islands near the Equator.  I thought it would be a good idea to have a final get together b4 he leaves.  He seems to need to be with family members.  I think it will be good for all of the kids, too.  I thought about inviting Carter, too, but I think that would be too much.  Carter really does not know me or Joe and Holly.  Maybe Jake’s Dad will do something special with Carter b4 he leaves.
I plan to marinate some pork and chicken.  We will also have baked potatoes and corn on the cob.  We will have drinks and dessert (prepared by the twins – chocolate cake).
I am a little concerned about Jake’s Garden in my backyard.  I think it might upset Jake’s Dad.  Well, it is not like I can hide it.  
I am wondering if this is a good idea.  It seems like we all have issues to deal with amongst ourselves.  I am hoping everyone can put aside the issues for a few hours.
I think Jake would look favorably on this last family get together b4 his Dad leaves…and he may never come back…..
OK..it is 3 days away…how does that song go…I Breathe In…I Breathe Out…….
I may need CPR!  Help me make it through the weekend, Jake.  I am hosting this get together as a Random Act of Kindness…in memory of you, Jake……
July, 1985 I married Jake’s Dad.  January 1987 the twins were born.  May 1991 Jake was born.  February 1995 the marriage was over.  September 2000 Jake left us behind.  It is now March 2002 and all the broken pieces of this puzzle will come together for a brief BBQ and reunion…then the pieces will disperse to their personal spaces once again.  Am I crazy to do this?  Maybe I am having Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome and cannot think clearly.
I will let you know how it all turns out.  I did ask Jake’s Dad if he would like to join us in this BBQ and he was very happy to join us.  I think I told him it would be good for everyone to be together one last time b4 he leaves the country.  Sigh…I Breathe In…I Breathe Out……I am choking!

Well, I was on my way to the library today after work.  It was about 5pm and I was headed down Fountain Blvd. on my way to I-25 when I saw it.
I noticed a teenager – probably Jr. or Sr. in highschool.  He was near the edge of the street.  He was pulling down his pants!  He was mooning traffic!  The strangest thing about this was he was wearing what looked like an inflatable woody!  I thought I was going to rear end the person in front of me!  What a distraction.  He was really getting a kick out of his interesting behavior.  He was laughing so hard I thought he was going to fall on this “enormous woody he was sporting” and pop it or spring back into the air like a rocket launching!
I don’t know why someone would do something this silly, but it added to the routine of rush hour traffic.
You know, I never did look at Butch’s “attachment” when I purchased him.  I am wondering if this is what it looked like…lol.  I must say, I have never seen anything like what I saw today.  I just had to tell you about this incident.
Anyway, I went to the library to get some more ideas of where they need help as a volunteer.  I am excited about working there.  They really welcomed me and made feel valued.
Have a nice evening.
P.S.  I cannot even imagine what Jake would have said if he saw that guy mooning us.  I am sure he was have cracked up…especially when he saw that guy’s attached fake “woody”.  I am still laughing to myself as I think about this site.

A 16 y/o highschool Junior at my girls’ school died early Sunday morning.  She was in a car accident with her 19 y/o boyfriend.  The boy was drunk and lost control of the car.  She died instantly.
I heard the police went to her house to inform her mother.  Her mother thought they were mistaken because her daughter was spending the night with a friend. 
So the mother called her daughter’s friend.  The friend said her daughter was in bed asleep.  The mother then told her the police were at her house telling her that her daughter was in a fatal car accident.  All she wanted to know was the truth.
The friend then told the mother the girl was not at her house.  She was out with her boyfriend.
The boyfriend was apparently drunk and was driving in excess of 100mph in a residential area.
The viewing is tonite.  The funeral is tomorrow.  The boyfriend is in critical condition; he probably doesn’t know what happened.
It was supposed to be a sleepover with a friend…now it is final rest for a 16 y/o high school student.
I am sorry this happened.  I just don’t understand…..

It was fun and different.  I entered at least 50 applications in the computer.  I know there are at least 250 more!
I think maybe I will try to finish those applications on Wednesday night and do something different next Saturday.  There is SO MUCH to do as a volunteer.
I think I will learn about pulling “holds” next weekend.  This seems to be an overwhelming job that  volunteers are always welcome to participate.
I saw the bookmobiles Thursday night.  Wow!  They are pretty fancy looking.  They look like motorhomes!  I was told I could take a ride on one anytime I decide to take a day off from my regular job.  This was an offer I cannot refuse.  
You should check our your local library and volunteer.  It is quite an impressive operation at the library.  They ALWAYS can use volunteers.

One organ and tissue donor can save 25 people?
Every 13 minutes someone’s name is added to the Organ Donor list?
15 people die everyday waiting for an organ transplant?
It doesn’t cost anything to be an organ donor.
Your heart could beat for someone else.
Your lungs could help someone else breathe.
Your skin could help heal a burn victim.
The choice to help someone is yours; it is a very personal choice.
Books you don’t read anymore you can donate to the library.
Organs that you don’t need anymore can be donated to help someone else live.

Well the BBQ went well.  Jake’s Dad seemed to enjoy being with all the kids for a nice dinner.
I marinated alot of food!  Joe does such a great job running the grill.  We had so much food leftover that I fixed “to go” plates for Joe and his wife and Jake’s Dad.
Jake’s Dad thanked me more than once for having him over.  He said he joined being with everyone again.
He seemed so excited about leaving the metropolis of the city and going to those remote Marshall Islands.  He shared a book he had with Joe about snorkeling in Micronesia.  He showed Joe all the flies he tied (fishing lure stuff) in preparation for his journey to the islands.  
I pretty much stayed busy and tried not to hear about his excitement.  I just don’t understand how a person would want to leave his kids behind….especially his 4 year old son that we recently learned about.
I wonder if he will have access to email to communicate with his kids?  I wonder if he will come back?
I am going to quit wondering these things because it takes too much time and energy.  His kids will know where he is at and if they want to contact him I am sure they will figure it out on his own.  He is lured by the “tax free” income he will be earning.  I guess it is all about money for him, but we all know the love of money is the root of evil.
Anyway, tonite I go back to the library to volunteer; it is the highlight of my week!  
It is almost 6am now and I have to get ready for work.  The girls are having state testing Tues thru Thurs this week and I have to have them there b4 7:05.  I am the lucky carpool Mom this week….is that something to brag about this early in the morning….I think not!

No – I did not speak on Tuesday.  I was invited as a guest and I only wanted to observe.  I had the opportunity to speak, but bowed out.
The topic was something to do with President Bush’s policy on pursuit of the terrorists after what happened September 11.  Of course, I am backing Bush 100%, but chose not to speak.  The 3 people who spoke did an excellent job.  The one lady who spoke personalized her feelings so well.  She was in Saudi Arabia at the time the attacks occurred.  She was so worried because her parents and family live 3 blocks from the WTC!  Wow – was this close to home or what!?
So – now I have someplace to hang out on Tuesdays at lunch time – the ToastMasters meeting at the local Air Force Base – Peterson AFB.
I just finished another 3 hours volunteering at the library.  I really enjoy helping them out.  Time really flies when you are busy.  The people there are so nice and appreciative of my time spent helping them.

Ok – my maiden name is Sullivan.  My Dad’s name is Frank Sullivan.  He died suddenly on Oct 12, 1988.
I am telling you this because my friend was watching John Edwards and all of a sudden my Dad’s name came to her mind…13+ years after he left us. 
This is her email:
———————————————————
Hi,
I want to tell you about something that happened to me
today…but first of all, I don’t want you to make
more of this than is really there.  I was watching
John Edwards…usually I just watch rather blandly. 
Well today, I was all into it…even emotional at one
point because the feelings were so strong and the
people he was communicating with were coming across so
strongly…anyway, I was just sitting there and
thinking how great it would be if I could go there and
Jake would come across….how neat it would be for you
to get some assurance…etc….anyway, all of a sudden
it was like FRANK SULLIVAN!  The name just blew into
my head!   And I was thinking….Frank Sullivan….oh,
that’s Patty’s dad…so I was just sitting there and
wondering what all that meant….I haven’t thought of
your dad, I guess, since way back then, when he first
died.  Anyway, then it was like this calming effect –
almost like…don’t worry, Jake is with me…he’s
fine.  Then, nothing.  All this took place in a matter
of 5-6 seconds.  Very briefly.  Anyway, it was really
eerie and I just had the strongest urge to tell you. 
I almost couldn’t wait to get to work tonight. 
Anyway, like I said…it was probably nothing and I
don’t mean to be putting myself on the level with
Edwards, but something did happen today and I just
wanted to let you know about it.

While you are writing in your OD, you should check out this website.  When you get there click the button that says “The Vault” then click the button that has the songs listed alphabetically.  Go to the “w” songs and click on Walking Around in Women’s Underwear – it is hysterical.  Then go to the “y” songs and click on “You Chesty Thing”.  These songs are so funny.  A friend at work told me about these songs and they certainy add some levity to your day.

I think I may write a story for their newest book – Chicken Soup for the Grieving Soul.  What do you think?  At least if it gets published I will have something to add to my resume under the heading “Publications”…LOL.
I thought I might write a story about Jake and the Random Act of Kindness cards that seem to help me deal with his sudden departure.
Tell me what you think and any ideas.
Check out their website and look at all those Chicken Soup books!  It is an interesting sight.
I hope this new idea about me submitting a story to the Chicken Soup for The Grieving Soul doesn’t make you think I have lost my noodle….

224,https://www.opendiary.com/m/j8xmom/something-a-teacher-should-never-say-5368128/,2002-03-16,Something a Teacher Should Never Say,"
“Jake, you know where boys like you go when they grow up?  To prison.”  This is what one a 3rd grade teacher told Jake one day in May, 2000.
I remember it like it was yesterday.
Jake had brought home some type of “bug” and I caught it and it put me down for 3 days.  I was home for 3 days recovering.
It was on one of those days that Jake came home from school to tell me what his teacher said to him.  He thought it was funny a teacher would tell him that, but I knew it was not funny.
I wrote the teacher a note to tell her what Jake had shared with me.  I told her I knew that Jake could get on her nerves and maybe we should move him to another class for the last few weeks of school.  I also told her that teachers should be careful with what they say because kids will think it is true and it will be become a self-fulfilling prophecy.
I know this because I was told in 8th grade that “math is just not your bag” by a counselor.  I never tried to do well in math because I knew it wasn’t my strength.  I was also advised that tech school would be best for me…not college.
Well, I finished high school and went to college and did fine.  I actually took a commission into the United States Air Force after graduation.  Actually I have 2 degrees now.  I never went to tech school.  I actually did fine in all my math classes, too.
Jake was just “such a little boy”.  He was filled with life and fun.  He was not crazy about school, but he did enjoy his friends there.  One time his teacher (same one) called me to report that Jake was in the hallway “making his bottom talk” to the amusement of his peers.  I didn’t ask if he was farting…it was enough to just contain myself on the on the other end of the phone.  
I remember coming home from work that day and saying, “Jake, guess who called me today at work?”  He was sitting at the table eating his snack and looked at me and said, “My teacher?”  I said yes and related the story to him.  He giggled and continued to eat.
I did talk to Jake about his behavior.
I also received a phone call from his teacher after she received my note…several days later.  She seemed to think that Jake misunderstood, but I did not think he did.  I honestly felt Jake had reached his limit with this teacher.  He was riding her last nerve.  I understood him well…he was always riding my last nerve, but I am Mom.  We talked about it and the issue was put to rest.
After Jake’s funeral, this teacher and I sat and shared memories of my son.  She brought this story up.  Even after Jake’s funeral, I still felt my son should never have been told something like what she told him.
Kids are our future; we have to believe in them.  
I think the teacher was trying to tell Jake that kids that act up like him would not do well as an adult.  
Well, I know in my heart Jake was a wonderful all American kid.  He would have grown up just fine, but his life was cut short.  I had Jake for 9 years.  He went to Heaven on September 24, 2000.  The teacher was wrong.
I miss you son so very, very much.

Ok – this story is true, names will not be used to protect the foolish one.
When I was pregnant with Jake in 1991 I was on active duty in the Air Force (AF).  I was stationed at Schriever AFB, CO flying satellites.
My crew commander was an arrogant AF Academy graduate.  He didn’t seem to have anything better to do than irritate people.  For example, when I was first assigned to his crew, he gave the crew a lecture on NOT SLEEPING on mid shifts (11pm – 7am).  He made it a point that if you did not fly satellites for several hours, you were NOT to go to sleep.  You must find something useful to do such as read regulations (if you ask me – that would put anyone to sleep!).  Sleeping on duty was derelictin of duty in his eyes.  Ok – so he made his point.  He was a Captain and so was I.  Rank among Captains is like virtue among whores (if you know what I mean).
Ok – so it was about 3am and one of the crewmembers was looking for this Captain.  When I heard he could not be found, I decided I would look for him.  I discovered him in a back office with his feet propped up, regulation resting in his lap, and evidence from his breathing that he was indeed in deep slumber…the Sandman had captured him that night.  I thought this was hysterical.  So I rounded up some crewmembers to let them know I discovered our fearless leader…follow me and I will show you.  
So a small group of us quietly tip-toed into the office and surrounded him and studied him for a few minutes.  Smirks were on all our faces.  I took the courage to quietly tip-toe up to him and placed a note on his open regulation.  I wrote, ” Captain, sleeping on crew is dereliction of duty!”  I signed the initials of our squadron commander.  Then I quickly tip-toed out of his office and continued my evening with the rest of the crew.
We all gathered in the planning room and let our laughter escape us.  Then it was time to do some commanding on a satellite.  I was in my crew position reading the command plan and commanding the satellite with an engineer crewmember working with me.  Suddenly, I felt the presence of someone looking over my shoulder.  What but to my surprise, the sleeping beauty Captain had awoke from his deep slumber and looked like he got up on the wrong side of the bed.  He was not happy.  I just looked up at him from my seated position and smiled.  I tried to look at him like I was puzzled.  I said to him, “Well hello, my do you look refreshed.  You look like you just woke up.”  Somehow he knew it was me that caught him “napping”.  I finished my commanding activities and prepared to join some crewmembers for breakfast in the chow hall.
The moral to this story is “practice what you preach”.  This was certainly a funny night to remember.  Imagine that…an AF Academy grad spouting off rules of conduct and he cannot even model them.  I still laugh when I think about that.  A male Captain giving a female Captain (me) a hard time..but I got the last laugh.
I have another funny story to tell you about this same guy next time.  It is about how his Academy days did not prepare him very well academically.  This story is a riot.  I am surprised he did not kill me and hide my body after this happened.   Hee, hee, hee….it still makes people laugh when I tell this story.
Not all Air Force Academy cadets are like this guy.  This guy was just too full of himself…it isn’t really about being an AF Academy grad…if you know what I mean……

I wrote this last night, but it would not save.  So this is my Saturday entry.
Today Joe came over to visit awhile this morning.  It was a nice visit.
I was invited to have dinner with him and his wife.  They called me on the cell phone…about the time I was driving home from another day at the library.  I told them manicotti sounded great!  I would be over after I checked in with my daughter at home.
After dinner Joe and I went for a walk – about 40 minutes.  We took their dog – Angus (means “prosperity”) – for his evening walk.
Joe and I talked about Jake.  He said sometimes he thinks about Jake on slow days at work and it hits him, “Man, I am never going to see Jake again.”  As we walked in the dark on the path in the park, it was good to hear Jake’s name over  and over in the conversation.
Someone asked me once about “unfinished business” with Jake.  I shared this with Joe.  I told him I think I did just about everything I could with Jake.  I know there were probably some things we didn’t get to do, but I know I spent alot of good times with Jake and I don’t have any “unfinished business”.
We talked about Thanksgiving 1999.  I drove up to SD to see Joe and Holly that year.  I had Jake, Becky, and Renee with me.  We had such a wonderful visit.  We recalled how Jake loved to play Playstation with Joe.  Joe told me he never played that Playstation but with Jake because you cannot play it by yourself.  I told him how good he was with Jake and patient to sit there in front of the TV for hours playing with Jake.
I was glad it was dark on the walk tonite.  I am sure we both had teary eyes, but we kept walking.  We kept talking.  Our walk ended, but our thoughts of Jake will be with us always…..
Good night my wonderful dear friends in OD land.  
Jake’s 11th birthday will be May 14.  Remember him with a Random Act of Kindness.  Remember him always.  Remember he is a part of me and you have helped me so much for just reading my ramblings….
Jake’s Mom is signing off for the night……

So this Captain is on my crew, remember?  Well, I am nominating this engineer that I work with for “Crew Member of the Quarter.”  I busily working on my write-up getting information and organizing it, etc.
So this Captain comes up to me and tells me I am wasting my time because he is nominating someone else and I don’t stand a chance.  OK – so I let this roll off my back.  Afterall, verbally assaulting him in return will not make matters any better.  Plus, who want to lower one’s self to his toddler level, right?
OK – so it is about 2 or 3 am in the morning, and I am still working on my write-up during my free moments that I am not flying satellites.  Here is the setting:  I am in the Planning Room sitting around this large table with about 5 or 6 other crew members.  This “I am so in love with myself” Captain enters the room in all his cockiness.  So I announce, “Is there anybody here that is good in English and Math?”  Everyone kinda looks around and the Captain steps up to the plate to take on the challenge.  OK – remember – he is a United States Air Force Academy grad and is full of himself.
So I tell him…”You know, in English, if  you have a compound subject you use different verbs than when you have a single subject.  For example, if 2 people were going to the store, you would say, “Steve and Patty ARE going to the store.”.  If only one person was going to the store, you would say, “Steve IS going to the store.”  You would NOT say, “Steve ARE going to the store.”  Right?  So, in using 2 numbers, would you say 6 and 5 ARE 12 or would you say 6 and 5 IS 12?  Is it the same in math as it is English or is Math totally different?  He pondered this question briefly and said, “I would say 6 and 5 ARE 12.”
I looked at him with the audience gathered around our table, and said, “Gee, the last time I added, 6 and 5 was ELEVEN.”  Everyone started laughing at the table.  The Captain’s face turned red.  I said, “You may be an Academy grad, but you are not very proficient in Math.”  Then I left the table to fly a satellite.  He followed me and said, “Patty, you really got me.”  I smiled and said, “You Academy grads really set yourselves up as  easy targets.”
The moral to this story…not ALL males are better in MATH than females….especially Academy grads.  Imagine that!

I went to an interesting conference on March 22.  It was about “Adolescents: What are They Thinking”.  Basically, it was about how teenagers’ brains development.  It was an interesting learning experience.
Here is the True-False quiz they gave us.  Try it out!
Typical teenage behavior is the result of hormones.
Teenagers are not as capable of juggling multiple tasks as an adult.
Teenagers are far more interested in novelty than younger children or adults.
An effective way to deal with a teenager’s inappropriate behavior is to shoot a warning glare in his/her direction.
Our weight-based culture is the sole cause of anorexia.
The baffling behavior of teens is primarily a reflection of stubborness and a need to assert their independence.
Teenagers need no more than 8 hours of sleep a night.
Teenagers who fall asleep in class should go to bed earlier.
Teen brains function more like those of children than those of adults.
The brain is fully developed structurally by the time a child reaches puberty.
This quiz came from an handout given out at the conference.  The facilitator is from Grand Rapids, Michigan.  Her name is Pat Crum.  If you want more information you can email her at pat.crum@spectrum-health.org
Write down your answers to the quiz and I will tell you the answers in the next entry.

This afternoon, I went to the store to get some Easter surprises for the kids (Joe, Holly, Becky, and Renee).  As I was cruising down the Easter aisle looking for some goodies, I noticed this little boy.  He turned to look at me and stared at me like he had seen a ghost!  He was absolutely speechless.  He just stood and looked at me.  I smiled at him and recognized him as one of Jake’s classmates.  He was the one that wrote that letter to Heaven for Jake at his funeral.  I slowly said, “Tyler?  You are are one of Jake’s friends, right?”  He smiled and nodded his head and said, “Hi, Mrs. Smathers.” I said, “You are probably getting ready to start Middle School next year, right?”  He smiled and said, “Yes.”  I asked him if he was excited and he nodded his head and smiled.
Then he looked at me and said, “What are you looking for, Mrs. Smathers?” as we stood surrounded by all the Easter goodies.  I said, “I am looking for a chocolate bunny for Jake’s big brother.  He likes chocolate.”  He smiled and said, “I like chocolate, too.  My Dad and I are looking for something for my Mom.”  I smiled and wished him luck.
I think seeing me brought back memories of Jake for Tyler today.  I could see the loss in his eyes.  It was nice to know that Tyler remembered me as Jake’s Mom.
I also noticed at the store today that my favorite teenage checker was in.  His name is “Jake”, too.  I wrote about him in January.  He wears “my” Jake’s picture button and tells everyone about Jake’s story.  So I grabbed an extra Cadbury chocolate bunny for my friend, Jake.  His line was too busy so I was checked out in another line.  Before I left the store, I pulled out the Cadbury bunny and one of my Random Act of Kindness cards and went up to Jake and said, “Happy Easter, Jake…in memory of my Jake.  My Jake loved chocolate.”  He smiled and blushed.  He is 18.  He said, “Well, I love chocolate, too.”  I smiled and said, “Great!”  He said, “I am going to buy you something, too.”  I said, “Don’t worry about it.  Just being able to talk to a Jake and hearing a voice respond is all that matters to me.  Have a Happy Easter.”  As I left, he was reading his Random Act of Kindness Card and holding his tall Cadbury chocolate  bunny.
I had another fun day at the library, too.  I checked out some books today and had to pay an .80 fine on a book about Raccoons.  Jake checked this book out in the Spring of 2000.  It tugged at my heart.  I left extra money for the attendant with a Random Act of Kindness card to be used for the next patron that needed money.
Jake, as Willie Nelson sang last Wednesday night in Colorado Springs….”You are ALWAYS on my mind…..”  I miss you, son…so very, very, much.

Wow!  The past 2 weeks have been unreal at work.  Today is Friday and what an ending to this week!
I came home and a big package was on my doorstep.  I did not recall ordering anything from the address:  Terry’s Village.  So I took the box inside and opened it.
I grabbed the receipt and looked at the purchaser.  It was not me!  It was an OD reader!  She had sent me 2 beautiful angels to put in Jake’s garden.  One is holding a harp that is also a windchime.  The other is holding a gazing ball.  They are just BEAUTIFUL and look wonderful in Jake’s garden.   Renee helped me carry out to the backyard garden after they arrived.
I immediately sent an email to this wonderful person.  I told her how surprised I was because I had just looked at a Terry’s Village catalog and picked some things out I wanted to put in Jake’s garden, but was not quite sure what I wanted.  So I did not order.  Then 24 hours later – there is a package on my step from Terry’s Village.  I thought I was going crazy!  I will share my email and her email in upcoming entries.  
Wow – what an ending to a week.  I sure needed something uplifting this week and I got it!  I am so happy with my garden angels.  I will take pictures and try to figure out how to post them since photopoint.com didn’t follow through for all of us that paid our membership dues.  If all else fails, I can scan the pics and email them to you guys if you want to see them.  First, I have to take the pics so give me some time.

I was so surprised to see a package from Terry’s Village on my door step today!  I just looked at the newest catalog yesterday and could not decide what to order.  Then I came home and saw a package from Terry’s Village and thought I was going crazy because I did not recall placing an order.  So I carefully opened it and looked at the receipt and saw your note and your address.  OMG!  I was so excited to open the boxes and see what was awaiting placement in Jake’s garden.  Then I opened the first angel with the windchime harp.  It is beautiful!  Then I opened the other box and saw the angel with the gazing ball…OMG…it is just precious!  I handed one to Renee and I took one and out we went to the backyard garden to place them.  They are just beautiful.  It is like you could read my mind!  How can I EVER thank you enough?!  I will take pics of the garden and send them to you.  Thank you so much.  It is like  you were reading my mind this week.  I was looking for things for the garden in all the catalogs.  OMG.  Yes, I believe in Angels.  They even come in the mail unannounced.   I just love them so much.
Patty – 4ever Jake’ Mom
My friend wrote this back:
Dear Patty,
As I write these words I have goose bumps from my head to my toes. Would you believe that I only placed that order with Terry’s Village on WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON??!!
It seems physically impossible for you to have received the order already! The girl on the phone told me the order would be delivered sometime before April 17th! I did not order rush delivery or anything special! And yet, I know in my heart that Jake has something to do with this.
Let me explain how I know….
For a couple of weeks now, I have felt the need to send you something special for Jake’s Garden. So, I started looking around in the garden center at Wal-mart and the other stores, but nothing caught my eye. Then, I saw those items in Terry’s Village catalog, but I hesitated to send them, because sometimes items in catalogs are deceiving and when you see them in real life, they don’t look as good as they did in the catalog.
There is a store here in the mall that sells alot of “stuff”, the name of the store is My Gift Cottage. I decided to go there on my lunch break to see if they had anything similar, so I could get a look at it before I ordered from the catalog. As it turns out they had a gazing ball angel that was very similar to the catalog one in size, so I decided to go back to work and place the order to your home.
When I left my job to go to the mall, I told my friend that I would probably be gone more than 30 minutes (my usual lunch “hour”) because I was going to the mall. You see, there is construction going on at the corner of my building, and this is the ONLY road out from where I work. BUT…when I left my building there was NO TRAFFIC. And when I got to the main road I made EVERY LIGHT. I went to the mall, walked to the restroom, went to the store, talked to the clerk, browsed and touched a lot of stuff, went back to work….and….I still had TEN MINUTES LEFT OVER!!! I did all that in 20 minutes…this was impossible…I know I was under the influence of an angel named Jake.  Another reason I know this is that I had such a great day! I had such a feeling of peace about me. I was joyful and smiley and genuinely happy that day.  Patty, I know in my heart that this is because Jake was pleased. 
I am so happy that the items came so soon and that you like them. I hope they bring you peace and joy in Jake’s Garden.  I look forward to seeing the pictures that you send.  It was MY PLEASURE (and Jake’s too I think) to share those angels with you.
I still cannot get over the fact that they arrived already…..AWESOME!  🙂
I hope you have a wonderful weekend.  As for me, I am ALREADY having a wonderful weekend, now that I received this e-mail from you.  
PEACE & HUGS!!
_________________________________________________________
This is totally an awesome experience, Readers.  Wow…I sure hope I dream about Jake tonite.  Tell him to come to me and tell me about how he and my OD friend worked out this totally unexpected surprise.
Jake, I miss you so much and “thanks” for helping my friend surprise me (and her!)today.  
In the beginning, I was so grief-stricken when I lost you, Jake, that I was forgetting alot of things.  My biggest fear was that I would forget you.  I have let go of that fear, son, because I know in my heart that you never left.  Plus, there are so many people outside of Colorado that are wearing your buttons…even as far away as Australia!  I am putting another one in the mail tomorrow.  It is going to Angela in Iowa.  You are becoming quite the world traveler, Jake.
I miss you so much, but so do alot of people that haven’t even met you!

3.  Teenagers are far more interested in novelty than younger children or adults.  True
4.  An effective way to deal with a teenager’s inappropriate behavior is to shoot a warning glare in his/her direction.  False
5.  Our weight-obsesses culture is the sole cause of anorexia.  False  **It is interesting to note that I learned that teenagers with eating disorders have a  higher than average level of serotonin.  This causes them to be obsessive, anxious, perfectionists.  Starving feels good because levels of serotonin are lowered by reducing nutrients necessary to serotonin production.
6.  The  baffling behavior of teens is primarily a reflection of stubborness and a need to assert their independence.  False
7.  Teenagers need no more than 8 hours of sleep a night.  False  Note:  I learned that the circadian timing system sets natural sleep and wake times, regulating sleep inducing melatonin.  Teenagers’ biological clocks change.  Melatonin levels are elevated into the school-day – telling them it is nighttime.  Most teens are not chemically ready for sleep until 11pm.  Teens need at least 9 hours of sleep.  **I remember this as a teenager – decades ago!  I remember sleeping in til almost noon on Saturday and Sunday.
8.  Teenageers who fall asleep in class should go to bed earlier.  False
9.  Teen brains function more like those of children than those of adults.  True – very young children.
10.  The brain is fully developed structurally by the time a child reaches puberty.  False  This occurs in the mid 20s for women and about age 30 for men.
***Basically, all the brain research indicates that teen brains are still in developmental stages.

Today I am very sad and drained.  A very dear friend, a former childcare provider for Jake when he was 2, talked to me today.
I called her to see what was new with her.  She has been ill for a few years.  She talked to me like she was nearing the end.  She said she was actually looking for a place near Jake. She actually took charge and planned Jake’s funeral for me.  How can this be happening?
I am trying to read a book – When Bad Things Happen to Good People – but I am usually so tired when I start to read.   
I just do not understand life much anymore.  I am going to let you down.  I cannot be strong today.  My strength is draining……

Last night, Jake’s Dad came to visit.  We had words.  The words needed to be said.  I was so tired of being “silent”.
He slammed the door when he left.  The girls heard it and of course I am the bad person.
I left for an early morning walk this morning.  Then I stopped and had breakfast on the way home.  There is a Dennys nearby.  I remembered the good times the kids and I had when we would go out to eat.  Then I remembered I would not have anymore of these adventures with Jake.  Then I thought about how much my girls are going through being in the middle of a divorce and death of a loved family member.  Then I thought about Jake’s Dad leaving because he told me last night that he just needed to be alone.
I became sad and the waitress kept popping up during my deep thoughts.
Maybe when/if Jake’s Dad does come back I should let the girls go live with him for a year so I can be alone.  Then I would not have to hear his voice or see his face.  Then I would not have to be in between him and the girls.  Then I could disappear and be at peace….I could truly grieve for my loss of Jake without wearing this mask everyday.
Maybe….
I want so much to tell Jake’s Dad that I hate him but “hate” is such a very deep and emotional word.  I just wish things were different…I wish I was someplace where I could start over…without him and his daughters linking us….someplace far far away…no communication…nothing…
He leaves tomorrow for the island adventure to “be alone”.  I am counting the hours, minutes, seconds……I hope he NEVER comes back…that would send the true message to his kids….he always leaves when things get tough…but he knows I will be here for his kids…..

Well, I thought I would let you know that I think Jake has found me at the library.  One of his favorite videos is Austin Powers.  In the last 2 weeks, I have processed that video at least twice.  Each time I hold it, I hold it a little longer and remember how much he LOVED to watch that goofy movie.  He would play it all day on the weekends and laugh.  He could entertain himself with the simplest pasttimes.  He would call out to me, “Hey Mom!  Come here!  This is the good part; you have to sit with me and watch it!”  I would sit with him and say, “Jake, I have seen this movie already.  How can you watch it over and over?”  He would just laugh with those dimples creasing his cheeks and say, “I KNOW Mom, but it is so funny!”
I also processed a John Edward book – the guy with the TV series, “Crossing Over”.  It was an eerie feeling.
Anyway, when I see those Austin Power videos they bring back fond memories.  Jake loved to imitate one scene and would say, “She’s the village biker.  Everyone’s taken her for a ride.”  I know at such a young age he truly did not understand the raw humor in that scene.  I would always encourage him NOT to say these things at school.  I sure didn’t want people to think I was some wild hoochie coochie Mom!  LOL.

Well, I have not been good about writin’ regularly.
This past week was interesting.  I took Wednesday morning off to visit my girls’ high school.  The school has had quite a few tragedies and it has been difficult for the staff and students to deal with all the losses.  I read about it in their newsletter this month.  I decided I needed to stop by and visit with the principal and offer some type of  help.  I donated 3 books to the school:  
Grief Comes to Class
When Death Impacts Your School
Straight Talk About Death for Teenagers
I also shared about the Random Acts of Kindness cards.  I hope these cards will help the students in some small way.  I explained how it has helped me so much to use these cards.  I also left a picture button of Jake to share my loss.  I volunteered to help out with their grief support group if they needed any help. 
It was hard to talk about Jake and I could not hold back the tears.  It is okay to cry because he meant so much to me and my family and his friends….
Last night Renee invited me out to the movies.  We saw The Rookie.  It is a great movie!  I enjoyed going out and eating my favorite buttered popcorn without any interruptions!  I like going out once in awhile.  I stayed awake, too!
I am also having a sprinkler system put in.  Yay!  I don’t have to spend all my free time moving my sprinkler and hose around the yard.  They are going to put a “drip system” in Jake’s garden, too!  I am so excited!  Now I can just enjoy the quiet time on the deck looking at Jake’s garden…sipping my coffee, iced tea, or wine.
I also received a nice letter from one of my OD readers.  I have to share a very special part with you.  “This is really going to sound weird.  It is a bright, sunny day here.  My sliding glass door is open and a breeze just come up from out of the blue.  It’s like, as I am writing this, Jake is saying to me, “Thanks for writing this letter to my Mom and making her feel better by being her friend.  I was her best friend and I know she misses me so much it hurts.” (Tears running down my cheeks and eyes blurry….)
Yes, I did lose my best friend and the pain cannot be alleviated…ever.  Thanks, V, for such a wonderful letter.  You are so kind to take the time to share with me.  This diary writing has been very good for me.  You have all been kind to listen and leave inspirational notes.  Your prayers have been very good for me and my children.
Jake’s Dad arrived in the Marshall Islands and he has called the girls.  I was real quick to pass the phone when I heard his voice Wednesday night.  I just said, “Hold on and I will get the girls.”  That was the extent of it.  He has the girls excited about maybe flying to the Figi Islands to visit him sometime.  His description of the tropical paradise that surrounds him makes them jealous.  I still feel he doesn’t deserve to be enjoying life without responsibility.  It just doesn’t seem right……
I think I will jump in the shower and cruise the mall.  My girls are swimming at the Base pool with friends.  I am free to shop without them….

Hello – it is me.  Just had to tell you how WONDERFUL my shopping trip was!  I had a great time!  Dillards is my type of store.  They have such a selection for Petites!  Yes…several dollars later….I walked out very content.  I cannot even remember the last time I shopped in the mall for myself.  I remember the last fun Saturday in the mall….Sept. 23, 2000…shopping with Jake…just the two of us.  I still have all his things.  I am sure when the time comes…if it ever does…I will know where to pass on his new school clothes and supplies….I hope the time never comes…what fun we had that day.
I have taken my girls shopping, too, but Sunday was fun to splurge for myself for a change.
The weather here is weird.  Sometimes it is warm and sunny…in the 70s…then boom….30 degrees or less and icy cold!
I thought about stopping to visit with Jake after work today.  It has been awhile since I went to visit with him…maybe tomorrow b4 work.  The weather is really nice.  I know he is here and not there…but you know…sometimes I feel I have to be out there…where I last saw him…..
Thursday is Take Your Daughter/Son to Work Day – April 25.  I am orchestrating the event this year again.  One of the activities is a  scavenger hunt.  The kids will locate items using a Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) System receiver.  This is really “hands-on” with space!  GPS is a navigation system of satellites.  Cars actually have GPS systems installed these days to help you not get lost!
Thursday is also the Volunteer Recognition luncheon at the library….so it will be a busy Thursday!
Jake’s Dad called tonite to talk to his girls.  The girls were not home.  They were working on a Spanish homework assignment with friends.  We made small talk, but then the girls called for a ride home…SAVED BY THE BELL!
Did you know where he is at it is very humid and tropica?  The temperature is between 80 and 82 degrees year round.  I could not stand the heat.  I am happy to be in Colorado and have my girls BOTH home every night and weekend.
He mentioned that he did not have a place to call “home” anymore.  He has been away so long from his family back East that he doesn’t consider that home.  I told him that is what happens when you join the military and move away.  I also shared with him that in November of 2002 will be 20 years for me in Colorado…except the one year I was assigned to the Aleutian Islands.  Colorado is now my home.  
He sounds so all alone out there…but that is what he wanted, right?  I cannot be his keeper anymore…he chose to leave OUR home….OUR family…OUR lives….when Jake was about 3….Jake would have been 11 on May 14.  May 14 will be a very difficult day for me.   If I disappear….you will know why…..but I will return in time…..
He has been gone more than a week, but I really haven’t noticed….when we were married I was used to doing everything anyway.  When we divorced…I was responsible for running the  house.  When Jake left….my life turned upside down and somehow I have made it without his Dad.  Now his Dad is very, very far away….and I am OK…probably very much OK….distance is good.  I don’t have to hear his diesel truck drive up and take our girls away for the weekend.  That diesel truck picked Jake up at 10:00am on Sunday September 24, 2000, and it did not bring Jake back at 7pm as planned.  Jake closed his eyes and never woke up at approximately 3:48pm that Sunday when the teenage driver smacked into his gocart at a very high rate of speed.  Tomorrow will be 19 months ago that Jake left us behind.  19 months is a long time.  Sometimes I think he is away at summer camp…then the summer ends and he is not home.  Sometimes I think he is back East with his Dad’s family for the holidays….then the holidays are over and he is still gone.  Sometimes I think he is visiting overnight with his friends…then morning comes and he is still not home.   Sometimes I think this is all a dream…then I wake up and I still cannot find him.  Sometimes I wonder why this ever happened…..and I still wonder…(tears rolling down my cheeks…..)…good night my dear friends.  If I didn’t have you guys…..I just don’t know who I could share this with…….
Good night, Jake.  I miss your hugs and your complaints about an 8:30pm bedtime…….I miss you so very very much…son…..

This week was busy!  
Thursday I hosted Take Your Daughter/Son to Work Day.  It was fun.  We had about 17 kids – 5 were boys.  I forgot how busy little boys can be!  The youngest was 5 and the oldest was 12.
We served them breakfast and lunch.  The kids had 2 activities to participate in:  Mock job interviews and a scavenger hunt using a Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) receiver.
I also had to slip away for a luncheon at the library – Volunteer Recognition Luncheon.  It was very nice.
Today, I walked for the March of Dimes – WalkAmerica.  I walked 5.5 miles and I am feelin’ it now!  I am sore.  It was fun.  There were about 1500+ people there.  There was food and snacks along the way with lots of water.  Renee walked with me.
I am feeling my age creep up on me…..
Also, last night I accomplished something that I never thought I could  do….I took my girls and their friends to the IMAX theater.  Jake’s accident occurred as you turn out of the parking lot…..It was a strange feeling.  I don’t plan on doing this regularly.  It is always so hard to read that street sign – Tutt Blvd.
In answer to an earlier note – No, the boy that hit Jake was not charged.  All I can really say…It’s not over til the fat lady sings…..if you know what I mean.

I had a very nice weekend.  I volunteered at the library for 3 hours.  I think Jake passed through again.  He loved to watch WWF wrestling.  As I was processing books on “hold” I came across a book about wrestling…WOW – World of Wrestling.  Once it again, it caught me by surprise.  I paused and flipped through the book thinking about how much Jake would have enjoyed looking at it.  Yes, I believe Jake periodically stops by the library when I am there.
After my library time, I went home and picked up my girls and went to see a movie – The Sweetest Thing.  This was a funny movie.  There were a few parts that I didn’t think were too cool to be watching with my 15 y/o twins daughters.  I won’t go into detail, but I will caution you….it was interesting.  I am so glad it was dark in the theater!
After the movie, the girls wanted to go shopping in the mall for swimsuits.  So we spent about 3hours shopping…and several dollars later…we dragged ourselves home all pooped out.  We even ate at the mall!  The food court is not my idea of a nice dinner, but it worked out…since we were so tired.  I had teriyaki chicken over steamed rice and the girls did the Subway sandwich thing.
Something interesting happened at the mall.  Renee talked about Jake.  Remember now, she is the one that hardly ever says his name.  We were cruising the mall and Renee said, “Remember when Jake got his ear pierced, Mom?  He sat in one of those picture booths to have his picture taken on a ‘Most Wanted’ background with his face turned to show off his earring?”  I smiled and said, “Yes, I do remember.”  Then the girls walked ahead of me and I had a quiet moment with Jake.  I sure miss him, readers.
Sunday we cleaned out the garage and washed the car.  Then we went to Sonic for ice-cream.  We ended the evening taking pictures in the backyard..in Jake’s garden.
This was probably one of the best weekends I can remember since my last weekend with Jake.  
I miss you so much, Jake!  I went to visit your friend, Johnny, last week. I was able to look at the scrapbook he made for you, Jake.  It was hard to see those newspaper articles again about your accident.  He also had pictures of you and him at his 9th bday party.  You and him were so happy, Jake.  He misses you, too, son.  He is taller than me now, Jake!  So I am sure you would have been taller than me now, too.  You both may be taller than me, but I weigh more than the 2 of ya!  His little sister will be 2 in June.  Remember how excited you were when you found out Johnny had a new baby sister on the last day of school in June 2000.  Who would have ever known that  3 months later you would have left, Jake?

I was leaving the salon after getting my hair cut today and it was about 6:45pm.  I heard a little boy screaming.  I stopped in my tracks and looked across the parking lot.  It seems he and his Mom had just finished going out to dinner at Dennys and had a disagreement.  I so wanted to go over and chat with the little boy.  He looked liked he was throwing a “Jake tantrum”..probably not getting his way about something.  I don’t know how long I stood there thinking about the situation.  The mother had already climbed into the driver’s side of her big truck.  I could hear the crying from her little boy who was sitting on the curb in the parking lot.  I finally got in my van and sat quietly.  I then decided to drive by them slowly.  By the time I drove by he had already got in their truck.  I sure miss Jake.  I wish I could have used a Random Act of Kindness card and helped the Mom out, but she looked a bit tense.  She probably would have thrown a Random punch at me….
So I ended going home.  It was so late, I grabbed a bowl of cereal for dinner.  Jake’s older brother turned 23 today.  Imagine that.  Jake would be 11 next Tuesday – May 14.  11 years difference…don’t trust the shelf life on those Trojans!  LOL.  Just kidding.  Remember in those 11 years between them…I had twin daughters!
I asked my girls to go with me to visit Joe and bring his bday present.  We stopped at Baskin Robbins on the way over to get him a special birthday sundae…us too!  Then we visited with him briefly – about 45 minutes.  We brought his wife ice-cream, too.  She is at school tonite.  I think it will be refreshing to find Baskin Robbins Jamocha Almond Fudge ice-cream in her freezer when she comes home.
Now, I am back home.  Another long day in life.  I got in a fuss with Becky.  It must be her red hair!  She and Jake have beautiful red hair.  I think it bothers me that she seems so in love with herself.  I don’t remember being 15 and brushing my hair 24/7 and looking at myself in the mirror every 5 minutes..then again…since I lost Jake…I lost alot of my ability to recall things.  And that music habit she has is driving me up a flippin’ wall.  Everytime we take a drive somewhere, she pops in one of her CDs or changes the radio station to some unintelligible garbage.  Then she sings along with it!  UGH!  I do not know how I am going to survive a road trip with her the last week in May.  I think I will ask her to crawl in my luggage top carrier and keep her portable CD player with her…LOL.  She and Renee have been out of school since Wednesday afternoon.  They have today and tomorrow off from school!  What a life of leisure, huh?  The kids seem to have alot of time off in District 11!  Tomorrow one of their friends’ Mom is taking a gaggle of them to see Spider Man.  Tonite she is visiting overnight with a friend.  Speaking of her friend..check this out…her friend’s Mom PAYS her daughter to go to school!  Yep, you heard right.  She gets paid $50/week to go to class! I think this is the most enabling thing I have ever heard in my life!  This kid is smart but has practically failed her Freshman year!  I imagine when this kid drops out of school, her Mom will pay her to stay home to keep her off the streets.  Boy..I have to get off my soap box….now….
Anyway, I saw a note in my OD to write a twin entry.  I will collect my thoughts and share a story sometime.  I still have not figured out what I did in a previous life that God is punishing me for a lifetime with TWINS!  The girls are 100% different.  They are fraternal twins – separate placentas and two different eggs.   I had sex twice one night and this is what I get for it!  Just kidding.  One is very sharp academically and the other is average.  One has red hair and one had brown hair.  The red head was bald for about her first 3 years and the other was born with a head full of hair.  You can’t trust them too much with secrets because they share too much….must be that twin thing.  I cried when the ultrasound indicated 2 babies!  I still cry…LOL!  More to come in a future entry…stay tuned….

246,https://www.opendiary.com/m/j8xmom/23-years-ago-today-3-5368150/,2002-05-08,23 Years Ago Today,"
I gave birth to a beautiful dark skinned, dark haired, 8lb 9.5 ounce baby boy in Hahira, Ga.  May 9, 1979.  I was an unwed mother.  He was the most beautiful baby I ever saw…like all Moms say.
I remember thinking about having an abortion in the Fall of 1978.  I was engaged to someone that did not want to get married.  I was ashamed of getting myself in this predicament.  I was a Sophomore in college.  I was visiting my boyfriend (fiancee) in California.  I was miles away from family in GA.  He was not nice to me alot of the time.  What was a pregnant 18 y/o girl going to do?  I scheduled an abortion.  I thought that would put this problem behind me and I could leave him and 4get him.
The morning of the abortion, I called and cancelled.  I decided that I would probably never get involved with another guy and that this baby would be my one and only child.  I thought it was the right thing to do….keep the baby and leave CA.
So on Feb 3, 1979, I told my fiancee that I was leaving him and going back to GA.  I had packed all my things and closed my bank account.  I gave notice at work – Ralphs Grocery in Newbury Park, CA.  I had bought me some new maternity clothes and a plane ticket to catch the Red-Eye flight out of LAX.
He tried to convince me that it was not a good idea to leave.  He said this is “our” baby.  I left anyway.
He took me to the airport that night.  When they called for final boarding, I hugged him goodbye and walked on the plane and never looked back.
Joe was due on April 18 but stayed in the greenhouse until May 9.  Today he is 23 years old.  He is married to a wonderful girl and both are very happy.  I am glad I made the right decision 23 years ago.
If you are pregnant and not married and are reading this, have the baby because life is too short to regret not having the baby.  Things can only get better for you.  After Joe was born, I went back to college full-time and finished my last 2 years.  I graduated in Dec. 1981 with a degree in Psychology.  In June of 1982, I was commissioned into the US Air Force as an officer.  I finished my second degree in May 1999.
So, I did get married after having a child out of wedlock.  I had 3 more children.  Then I got divorced 10 years later.  If it wasn’t for Joe, I don’t think I would have survived losing Jake.  He was there for me when I needed someone most….to stand by Jake’s casket.  He will be with me next Tuesday when I go to the cemetery.
How in the world I ended up telling this story…who knows…I didn’t plan this entry.  Good night.

the Mother’s Soul 2 by Jack Canfield, Mark Victor Hansen, Marci Shimoff,
and Carol Kline.             
TO HAVE AND TO HOLD
In the summer of 1959, I flew from Washington, D.C., to Los Angeles accompanied by my father. Nineteen years old, pregnant and frightened, I was flying to this distant city to live with total strangers, so that my 
unborn child could be born far away from prying eyes and gossiping mouths and then be put up for private adoption.
On September 3rd I gave birth to a little boy and though I saw him only once, lying in the nursery, I was not allowed to hold him. The doctor and nurses felt it would be too painful for me, and I suppose they were 
right. Shortly after birth, I flew back to Washington, signed the adoption papers and, as my doctor had suggested, continued with my life.
Although the pain of the parting diminished with time, I never forgot for a moment that I had a son. Every September 3 for the next 33 years, I silently mourned, grieving for the child I had given away. Mother’s Day was always the worst. It seemed that every woman I knew was a mom. I’m a mother, too, I wanted to say but couldn’t.
And so the years passed and turned into decades, and the memory of my only child lingered just beneath my conscious mind, ready to explode at a moment’s notice.  Then on March 26, 1993, I received this message on my 
answering machine, “Elizabeth,” a woman’s voice said, “I have some news which I hope will be of interest to you and bring you great joy and happiness.”
Her voice broke, and it was quite evident she was crying. “If you are the same Elizabeth Thring who did me a favor thirty-three years ago, please call me in Newport Beach, California. I would very much like to have a chat with you.”
I called back immediately and was connected to an answering machine. Three days later, when I finally got through, the woman said her name was Susie. She thanked me profusely for calling and asked if I knew who she 
was.  “I believe so,” I replied, “but I’m not 100 percent sure.”
“Oh, Elizabeth,” she said, “I adopted your beautiful baby boy 33 years ago, and I’m just calling to tell you what a wonderful son you have. Bill is married to a terrific girl, and you have two absolutely beautiful little granddaughters.”
I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. I had fantasized about this very moment in some form or another for years, and now it was a reality. I told 
her that I couldn’t think of another woman I knew with such generosity of spirit. Susie said that one day while watching her two little granddaughters playing, she thought to herself, “What woman wouldn’t want 
to know about such beautiful children?” and so she began to search for me.
She told me that although Bill knew generally that she was looking for me, he had no knowledge of this most recent attempt to locate me, since there was always the possibility that I might not want to see him.  Soon 
after, I sent Bill a letter. In it I wrote: “Oh, what joy – what pure, absolute, sheer joy, to discover after all these years that you are here, on the same earth, under the same blue heaven and stars and moon at night 
as I – and that you, my darling boy, want to know me as much as I yearn to know, hold and love you. Billy, it is important for me that you know I never, ever forgot you or ceased loving you. I thank you from the bottom of 
my heart for wanting to know me and not giving up on me. Your loving mother, Elizabeth.”
In the middle of April I flew to Los Angeles. On the way, I wrote 33 birthday cards to my son with a short description of what I had done for each year of his life. Bill needs, I thought, to learn about me, 
too.  DeAnn, Bill’s wife, videotaped me coming down the ramp at the airport. With her were my granddaughters, and standing just behind her was a very tall, blond, impeccably dressed man.  When he saw me, Bill stepped 
from behind his wife and walked toward me with arms open wide. Into this circle of love I stepped, feeling just like every other mother in the world holding her baby for the first time.

Today was a nice day.
I put in 4 hours at the library.  I had fun.  Today was data entry work, but it kept me busy.
Then I came home and ran a couple errands.  
At 6pm, the girls and I went to Red, Hot, and Blue for dinner.  We were meeting Joe and his wife for a Mothers Day out for dinner.  We had a wonderful time.
I am planning a road trip to GA the last week of May.  Joe and his wife were going to join us, but Thursday night Joe said they could not make it.  Tonite they said they are going to try really hard to come along with us.  I sure hope so.  It will be alot of fun.  We will have a packed van – me, Becky, Renee, Joe, Holly, and Angus – their lab/retriever mix do. We will throw all our stuff in the roof top carrier.  It will look like the Simpsons on a cross country road trip!  I am sure I will have alot to share with you all when I return.  I will take notes along the way so I will have lots to jog my memory when I write for you.  I really hope Joe and Holly come along….because I will have all my kids home in GA for the first time since about XMAS 1994.  This will be a very big surprise for my mother, too.  Having 3 drivers will make the drive alot easier, too.  
I hope I can spend some time fishing in GA.  I love to fish with my brothers.
Tomorrow is Mother’s Day.  My second one without Jake.  Tuesday is Jake’s 11th bday.  Please do a Random Act of Kindness in his memory for us, ok?

Jake was 5 years old on Mothers Day 1996.  It was late afternoon on that Sunday…actually I think Jake’s birthday may have been on that same day (May 14)…and I could not find Jake and the girls.  I had a friend visiting me that day.  I started to get worried about the kids because they disappeared.  My friend offerred to drive me around the neighborhood.
As we left my house and came to the first stop sign (aobut a block or less) there they were!  Jake was running down the sidewalk with flowers (store bouquet) in his hands.  He was so proud and excited.  “Happy Mothers Day” the kids shouted!  I will never forget that special day in 1996.  They had pooled their allowances and Jake’s bday money to buy me a surprise.
It is memories like these that make this day special.  NEVER would I have imagined that 4 years later I would have my last Mother’s Day with my little red-headed little boy.
Happy Mothers Day to all you mothers.

250,https://www.opendiary.com/m/j8xmom/great-sadness-tonite-5368154/,2002-05-12,Great Sadness Tonite,"
It is the eve of Jake’s 11th bday.  We are not doing well.  We had a late dinner and the girls talked about Jake’s funeral.  We ended up very teary eyed.  The girls went downstairs to be alone.
We recalled things about Jake’s funeral…mostly the large amount of people there.  The girls talked about people that I did not recall seeing on September 28, 2000 – the funeral was 10:00 on that Thursday morning.  The viewing was from 9 – 10 am.  
I remember going to see Jake early – around 8am.  Seeing him was a big reality check.  It had been 4 days since he hugged me goodbye to go with his Dad to ride his gocart.  He was so filled with excitement and energy.  A few hours later – he was taken from us by a teenage driver who made a bad decision…to drive around the barricades on that closed road…and show off the performance of his 1987 Camero…  Gone..in the blink of an eye…my youngest child…so filled with life and love…so much in love with his gocart….red hair blowing in the wind…arm hanging out…doing his “Detroit Lean”…on a brisk September Colorado morning…3:48pm…hit by a 16 y/o driver…legally declared (I can’t say the word)________ at 5:19pm.  I got to his side about an hour after he was declared gone.  He was only 9 years old.    
Seeing him in that casket was too much.  He was dressed in the new school clothes he and I picked out together.  He never wore them to school.  The others are still packed up.  I cannot part with his things.  
I close my eyes and recall the fun he and I had shopping the day before.  He loved to shop.  We had so much fun together that day.  He wanted to stop at the Jamba Juice place and get a “suicide”..one of those drinks with all the flavors mixed together.  After our shopping trip we had lunch at Taco Bell.  He ordered one of those combo meals that came with  3 or 4 tacos, nachos, and a large drink.  We laughed and had so much fun.  
He had a friend sleepover on Saturday night.  They had a blast.  The next morning I fixed a nice breakfast for him and his friend.  We had oatmeal, toast, and juice.  He loved oatmeal. Then his friend’s Dad came to pick up his friend…around 7:30am.  Then Jake’s Dad picked Jake up around 10am.  Jake said he would have dinner with his Dad and be home at 7pm.  
Jake never came home.  He never had dinner.  He left us at 5:19pm on September 24, 2000.  We miss him.  We are crying tonite.  Our hearts are 4ever broken without Jake. 
Tomorrow is his bday. Please remember, Jake.  Do something nice for someone tomorrow in his memory.
I will not be at work tomorrow.  My girls will not be at school tomorrow.  We will be lost…another bday without the bday boy……There are presents here for him.  An OD reader from Montana went shopping with her boys.  They wanted to remember Jake on his special day.  I will open the presents sometime tomorrow.  I will share with you what they are.  I will write the OD reader (Shirley) a personal thank-you letter for her and her boys.  I will thank her so much for remembering my little boy…
It is almost 10pm on Monday night in Colorado right now.  It is almost 4pm on Tuesday afternoon in the Marshall Islands.  Jake’s Dad is at work.  I wonder if he knows what day it is?  He gave Jake’s bday incorrectly to the hospital.  He told them May 13.
I think Jake’s Dad is at work as I write this.
A mother NEVER forgets a birthday.  11 years ago tomorrow, I gave birth to a beautiful 7 lb 11 oz baby boy.  He had beautiful red hair.  He was born at the United States Air Force Academy Hospital – May 14, 1991 -he was one week late…..and 9  years later…he left too soon.  A mother NEVER forgets her children.
Good night to all my readers.  I am very sad tonite.

Suzanne’s Diary for Nicholas is a great book.  It is easy to read and is mixture of romance, mystery, and drama.  You can get it from the libary.  It is a new book, but the library carries new books.
If you are reading this entry, Briklen, you will find this book interesting..very interesting.  I thought of you during the climax of the story.
The author is James Patterson.

I received a package from an OD reader in Montana.  She lives in a rural area – 220 miles or so from the nearest mall.  She went shopping with her 3 boys for Jake’s birthday.  I am very touched that they she went so far out of her way to do something special for Jake and me.
I received her package a week b4 Jake’s birthday so I saved it for his special day.  It was a good feeling seeing presents wrapped in my room.  When the kids asked who the presents were for, I replied, “They are for Jake’s birthday.  They are from a friend in Montana.”  It was a good feeling to see presents for Jake…knowing he is not forgotten.  Remember the entry the on the angels that came in the mail?  
So on Tuesday morning, I carefully unwrapped each gift.  The first gift was a Hummel figurine of a little boy holding flowers.  My friend from Montana told me the boy was Jake sending me flowers from Heaven.  How precious the little statue is to me.  I set him on my “Jake table” in my room next to other special items.  I will write about this table sometime.  You really have to come over and see it.  Imagine that…I am inviting all my OD readers into my bedroom!  
The second gift was a  beautiful etched mirror and frame.  The mirror has a scene with a woman, child, hearts and flowers.  The words say, “A mother holds her children’s hand for a little while…their hearts forever.”  This is so true.  Jake’s heart and mine are 4ever attached. This mirror and frame are also residing on “Jake’s Table.”
The third gift was a beautiful garden stone for Jake’s garden.  The stone says, “A garden is where the heart feels at home.”  I placed this stone in Jake’s Garden on his birthday.
Thanks, Briklen, for thinking of Jake and me on his 11th birthday.  Please hug all your boys for me, too.  Tell them they are very special to think of Jake.  I hope to meet you all in Salt Lake City in July.  Please plan on going to the National conference for The Compassionate Friends in Utah.  You will be glad you did.  You will feel you are in the “right place” to deal with your loss, too.

Friday night I was invited to have dinner with a couple co-workers.  I was invited to meet them at Red Lobster.
I didn’t plan on going because I had some errands I needed to run with Renee.  After I finished my errands and dropped Renee off at Gunther Toodys (she was invited to eat out with Joe and Holly, I was already 20+ minutes late for my dinner engagement.  I almost did not go, but at the last minute decided to meet my friends.
There was a line of people waiting for tables when I arrived around 6:15pm.  I told the hostess that I was meeting some friends and she motioned for me to check out the back room.  I went back there and spotted my friends right away.  They were chit chatting and enjoying their time together.  They were so surprised and happy to see me.  The waitress brought me a menu and soon brought me a salad.  I looked at my friends and said, “Where’s your salads?”  They said, “Yea, that’s a good question!  We never got our salads.”  The waitress apologized and then brought them their salads.  It was so funny that they never would have missed their salads if I hadn’t joined them for dinner!  I am still smiling about this almost 24 hours later!
I submitted a story to Chicken Soup.  I pulled one of my entries from my OD about a Random Act of Kindess event – the entry title is “Can I Have Two Quarters, Mom? (June 21, 2001)”
I also submitted Renee’s poem “Why”.  I hope Renee gets published.  She would receive $300!  She was psyched when I told her she would get paid for her entry if it was published!  She has already had this poem published, but she did not receive any money.
Today I volunteered at the library for 3 hours.  I found an interesting book on the display table – Monkey Bridge.  It’s about an Asian person coming to America.  It sounded interesting so I checked it out.
Have any of you read the book “The Bridges of Madison County”?  It is a great book – romance type.  I did not know it has an epilogue – A Thousand Country Roads. Joe and Holly gave me this book for Mothers Day.  I think I am going to sit on the deck and start reading this.
Have a good Saturday!

I received this in an email and thought I would share it with you.  The moral to the story is interesting.
THE RAT TRAP
A rat looked through a crack in the wall to see the farmer and his wife opening a package. What food might it contain? He was aghast to discover that it was a rat trap. Retreating to the farmyard the rat proclaimed the warning; “There is a rat trap in the house, a rat trap in
the house!”
The chicken clucked and scratched, raised her head and said, “Excuse me, Mr. Rat, I can tell this is a grave concern to you, but it is of no consequence to me. I cannot be bothered by it.”
The rat turned to the pig and told him, “There is a rat trap in the house, a rat trap in the house!” “I am so very sorry Mr. Rat,” sympathized the pig, “but there is nothing I can do about it but pray.  Be assured that you are in my prayers.”
The rat turned to the cow. She said, “Like wow, Mr. Rat. A rat trap. I am in grave danger. Duh?”
So the rat returned to the house, head down and dejected, to face the farmer’s rat trap alone.
That very night a sound was heard throughout the house, like the sound of a rat trap catching its prey.  The farmer’s wife rushed to see what was caught. In the darkness, she did not see that it was a venomous snake
whose tail the trap had caught. The snake bit the farmer’s wife.
The farmer rushed her to the hospital. She returned home with a fever. Now everyone knows you treat a fever with fresh chicken soup, so the farmer took his hatchet to the farmyard for the soup’s main ingredient.
His wife’s sickness continued so that friends and neighbors came to sit with her around the clock. To feed them the farmer butchered the pig.
The farmer’s wife did not get well.  She died, and so many people came for her funeral that the farmer had the cow slaughtered to provide meat for all of them to eat.
Moral to the story: The next time you hear that someone is facing a problem and think that it does not concern you, remember that when there is a rat trap in the house, the whole farmyard is at risk.

Something via email I saved to share you:
From: Emer Bayona
MOTHER’S HANDS
by Janie Emaus
As teenagers we live in a different world from our mothers, a world where mothers hang out on the peripheries.  Of course, almost everyone has one; they are unavoidable annoyances.
Today, as I approach that edge, as I am the one with the teenage daughter, I look at my mother through different eyes.  And I sometimes wish I could halt the years and stop her from growing older, stop her from repeating herself.
We sit at my kitchen table as the sun designs a mosaic of light on the tile floor.  My daughter, Anna, sits next to my mother.
“When is Rick going to be here?” my mother asks, referring to my husband.  “I don’t know, Mom,” I answer patiently. “He’ll be here for dinner.”
I sigh and get up from the table.  This is at least the tenth time she has asked that question in as many minutes.
While my mother and daughter play Monopoly, I busy myself making a salad.  “Don’t put in any onions,” Mom says.  “You know how Daddy hates onions.”  “Yes, Mom,” I answer, shoving the scallions back into the fridge.
I scrub off a carrot and chop it into bite-size pieces.  I  thrust the knife into the carrot with more force than is necessary.  A slice falls onto the floor.
“Don’t put any onions in the salad,” she reminds me. “You know how Daddy hates onions.”  This time I can’t answer.  I just keep cutting.  Chopping. Tearing.  If only I could chop away the years.  Shred the age from my mother’s face and hands.  Go back to my high school days when my mother moved from room to room, leaving a trace of whatever fragrance she wore at the time.
My mother had been beautiful.  She still is.  In fact, my mother is still everything she has been, just a bit forgetful.  I try to convince myself that’s all that it is, and if she really concentrated, she would not repeat herself so much.
There isn’t anything wrong with her — not my mother.  I cut off the end of the cucumber and rub it against the stalk to take away the bitterness.  The white juice oozes out the sides.  Wouldn’t it be nice if all unpleasant situations could be so easily remedied?  Cut and rub.  This is a trick I have learned from my mother, along with a trillion other things:  cooking, sewing, dating, laughing, thinking.  I learned how to grow up and when to stay young.  I learned the art of sorting through emotions.  And I learned that when my mother was around, I never had to be afraid.  
So why am I afraid now?  I study my mother’s hands.  Her nails are no longer a bright red, but painted a light pink, almost no color at all.  And as I stare at them, I realize I am no longer looking at those hands but feeling them as they shaped my youth.  Hands
that packed a thousand lunches and wiped a million tears off my cheeks.  Hands that tucked confidence into each day of my life.  
I turn away and throw the cucumber into the bowl.  And then it hits me.  My hands have grown into those of my mother’s.  Hands that have cooked uneaten meals, driven hundreds of car-pool miles, held my own daughter’s frightened fingers on the first day of school and dried tears off her face.
I grow lighthearted.  I can feel my mother kiss me goodnight, check to see if the window is locked, then blow another kiss from the doorway.  Then I am my mother, blowing that same kiss to Anna off that same palm.
Outside everything is still.  Shadows fall among the trees, shaped like pieces of a puzzle.
Someday my daughter will be standing in my place, and I will rest where my mother now sits.
Will I remember then how it felt to be both mother and daughter?  Will I ask the same question one too many times?
I walk over and sit down between my mother and her
granddaughter.  “Where is Rick?” my mother asks, resting her hand on the table next to mine.  The space between us is smaller than when I was a teenager, barely visible at all.   And in that instant I know she remembers.  She may repeat herself a little too much.  But she remembers.
“He’ll be here,” I answer with a smile.  My mother smiles back, one of those grins where the dimple takes over the shape of her face, resembling my daughter.

258,https://www.opendiary.com/m/j8xmom/life-is-a-juggling-act-5368163/,2002-05-19,Life is a Juggling Act,"
After reading “Suzanne’s Diary for Nicholas”, I learned something important.  Suzanne believed that we are juggling too many balls:  Family, Friends, Life, Integrity, and Work.  Of these 5 balls, work is really a rubber ball.  There is always going to be work.  It will always be there tomorrow.  Family, friends, life, and our integrity are glass balls.  If we drop one, we cannot replace it. 
We need to focus on the important glass balls in our life… family, friends, life, and our integrity.  Life is too short to take these precious balls for granted.
Suzanne left a busy hospital, as a doctor, and moved away to a slower pace in life.  She met the love of her life and had a beautiful baby boy.  She loved her family so much.  She had wonderful friends.  She eventually cut back on her work to spend time with Nicholas and her husband.  In the end, it was all worth it.
Good nite OD Land.  Hug everyone in your family tonite.  Tell them you love them.  If you have kids, hug them twice – once for me in memory of Jake.  Tell your friends how much they mean to you.  Enjoy life and put work in its proper place.  Think about your integrity.  Don’t put a price on it – it is all you have.

A frail old man went to live with his son, daughter-in-law, and four-year old grandson. The old man’s hands trembled, his eyesight was blurred, and his step faltered.
The family ate together at the table. But the elderly grandfather’s shaky hands and failing sight made eating difficult. Peas rolled off his spoon onto the floor. When he grasped the glass, milk spilled on the tablecloth.
The son and daughter-in-law became irritated with the mess. We must do something about Grandfather,” said the son. I’ve had enough of his spilled milk, noisy eating, and food on the floor.
So the husband and wife set a small table in the corner. There, Grandfather ate alone while the rest of the family enjoyed dinner. Since Grandfather had broken a dish or two, his food was served in a wooden bowl.
When the family glanced in Grandfather’s direction, sometime he had a tear in his eye as he sat alone. Still, the only words the couple had for him were sharp admonitions when he dropped a fork or spilled food.
The four-year-old watched it all in silence. One evening before supper, the father noticed his son playing with wood scraps on the floor. He asked the child sweetly, “What are you making?” Just as sweetly, the boy 
responded, “Oh, I am making a little bowl for you and Mama to eat your food when I grow up.” The four-year-old smiled and went back to work.
The words so struck the parents that they were speechless. Then tears started to stream down their cheeks. Though no word was spoken, both new what must be done.
That evening the husband took Grandfather’s hand and gently led him back to the family table. For the remainder of his days he ate every meal with the family. And for some reason, neither husband nor wife seemed to care any longer when a fork was dropped, milk spilled, or the tablecloth soiled.

1.  Texas is one BIG state to drive across!
2.  A trucker told us to watch out for Estillene, Texas (not sure that is spelled right) because they are known for giving out tickets.  As we drove thru – the cops had pulled someone over.
3.  The KFC in Vicksburg, MS is NASTY!  Do not eat there.
4.  The Days Inn is Adel, GA was a BAD place to stay.
5.  Jim Bowie’s Restaurant in Bowie, Texas has good food and friendly people.  The waitress thought we were some Partridge Family truckers!  Imagine that!
6.  It is too hot to write anything else.
7.  I did a Random Act of Kindess – gave some Baskin Robbins Savings card to a granny at the motel pool – she had her daughter and 3 grandkids with her.  Her grandkids were playing Marco Polo – Jake and I played that in June, 2000.  We cannot play it anymore…..

I had to tell you this story about my on-line banking.  It is a story that happened about 3 years ago.
I had just got a new computer and needed to download the software for my on-line banking.  So I went to my bank’s website and downloaded the software.  When it was time to check out the modem, I started having problems.  For some reason, the bank was not recognizing my modem.  I was so puzzled because this had never been a problem.
Well, I noticed on the tool bar that there was a “help” button.  Wow!  Never had a “help” button before!  So I clicked on the “help” button.
An information window opened with a Tele Tubby character.  The window said something like this…So you f-c-ked with your computer?  Then there were 2 options to select:  Yes or No.  Of course, after the shock wore off that this computer was cussing at me, I selected the “No” button.  Nothing happened when I selected the “no” button.  So after a few seconds, I selected the “yes” button.  Then another information window opened up with that tele tubby character again and said something like…I knew you f-u-c-ked with your computer!
I was so in shock that I quit trying to get my modem to connect.  I did a screen capture and saved this tele tubby dude and his terrible cursing information windows.  This was Sunday night.
On Monday morning, I called my bank and reported this incident.  They were shocked, too!  I couldn’t say the f-word on the phone, but I described everything.  I told them if they had an email address I would email them the tele tubby character for proof.  They were anxious to see what I was talking about.  After I emailed the file, I received a call from my bank on Tuesday.  They were very apologetic.  Thye researched the incident and said their programmers got bored and tried to amuse themselves and somehow it got out of hand.
I told them it was okay, but it was quite an experience!
I can only imagine what would have happened to this bank if this had happened to someone important in town…like the General at the Air Force Academy!
So, if you go to the ATM machine and try to take out some money and a tele tubby appears on the screen and says, “You are f-cking out of money!”, don’t freak out..call your bank!

266,https://www.opendiary.com/m/j8xmom/where-have-i-been-175-5368171/,2002-06-13,Where Have I Been….,"
Well, I have been home almost 2 weeks and where has all the time gone?  It seems I jumped right back into the work, home, eat, sleep routine….sigh.
One of my daughters is in GA on vacation at my mother’s house.  Her sister is here going to summer school.  
The one in summer school has been on a rollercoaster of emotions with me.  I can’t go into detail right now, but she is really trying my patience.  She is in summer school due to her poor choices in school this past year.  Ditching classes and not doing her homework earned her this fun time in summer school.  She seems to be doing well in the Math class she is taking, but she hates being in school every morning by 7:30.  I take her each morning and then she is responsible for catching the bus home.  Her first time catching the bus was quite an adventure.  She finally made it home by 5pm.  Her class ends at 11:30am.  I call it survival skills!  She nows has NO problem catching the bus.
Her sister is enjoying late nights and sleeping in at her Granny’s place in GA.  She goes fishing, shopping, out to concerts, etc.  She is the A/B student.  With good grades and class attendance she earned a nice vacation.  She will be leaving GA on the 29th to go to FL and NC for the month of July.  Her sister will hook up with her on the 29th – after summer school ends.  Life is tough, but you got to make your own bed and sleep in it!  The summer school daughter is an average student and I do not demand anything higher than a C.  She brought home mostly Fs in March so she had a tough road to climb the last 2 months of school.  She was able to pull a B, Cs and 1 F.  The F earned her summer school.
Anyway, this is what has been going on with me.
Also, the worst wildfire in Colorado history continues to burn here.  It has burned at least 90,000 acres, 21 homes, and had endangered at least 3000 other homes. There have been evacuations in Florissant and Woodland Park.  I have heard it has been about 5% contained, but that is not saying it is under control.  There are almost 1000 firefighters on the scene and more expected to arrive and support those already here.
What caused this wildfire?  A careless person and an illegal campfire.  
We are in such a drought right now that the city has imposed Phase 2 water rationing.  I can only water my yard on Tues, Thurs, and Saturdays.  Restaurants are not supposed to bring water to customers unless it is requested.
It has rained the last 2 days, but not enough to take us out of this drought situation.
We had golf ball sized hail today!  It sounded like tons of bowling balls were dropping on our building at work!  Cars in the parking lot received hail damage.
Guess what?  I am seriously thinking of a career change.  I have an opportunity to teach elementary school and earn my teaching certificate.  I ALWAYS wanted to be a teacher and now I think it is about time to pursue this dream.  I have been accepted into the Teachers-in-Residence Program.  I can actually teach starting this August!  I am currently researching teaching positions.  Once I sign the contract, I am in the program!  I will teach for 2 years and earn my teaching certificate by taking classes on Saturdays and 1 class each summer.  The Air Force may pay for the program, too!
People make fun of me for wanting to leave a higher paying job to become a teacher.  I don’t care.  You only live once and you have to reach for your dreams.  What is money anyway?  You can’t take it with you when you leave this world, right.  
I can teach and be around children everyday and make a difference.  I will be able to touch the future!

Well, this Hayman fire continues to burn.  Yesterday it traveled half a mile in 4 minutes!  My son’s in-laws evacuated there dream home today.  They built a beautiful cabin in the woods and just moved in recently.  Now they have been asked to leave it open and come down from the mountains.  
The cause of this fire has been identified…it is a US Forest Service Ranger!  Why?  Why do things like this happen?
It was so smoky Monday and yesterday.  Today has been okay.
I worked in the yard until almost 9pm tonite.  I was edging along the driveway.  What a chore!  If Jake was home, he would have been outside to keep me company.  His sister just stayed inside watching TV.
Sometimes I get so busy I 4get what happened to Jake.  Then, when my distractions are done, I remember that it happened.  I heard a song on the radio that reminds me of Jake….”unsinkable ships, sink.  Unbreakable walls, break….”  
I miss him….why do these things happen?  He would have been 11 last month.  The boy who hit him will be 18 either this month or next month.  He didn’t get charged.  He took Jake from us and now we have a an emptiness in our lives that will never be filled.
A reader asked me to write about what happened to Jake.  It is so hard.  Please email me your address and I will send the article.  Basically, Jake was riding his gocart in the care of his Dad.  He was riding in a new construction area on a Sunday afternoon.  The road was barricaded to through traffic.  I am sure his Dad must have thought this was a safe place for Jake.  I have to believe he truly did believe Jake was safe.  Suddenly a 1987 Camero came around the barricades at a very high rate of speed.  They hit Jake and Jake never came home that Sunday afternoon.  His life as we knew him ended at 5:19pm on September 24, 2000.  I really believe it ended at the time of impact – – 3:48pm.  Time is so irrelevant when you lose someone.  I don’t like to wear a watch much anymore.  I don’t think I will ever get over these two time periods.  I know I will never get over the fact the teenagers were not charged.  They took Jake from us and there was not a consequence.  Does this make it right?  I don’t think so.  All I can really tell you is that I miss my little boy so very, very much. I think little boys have a special bond with their Moms.  All I can say is…..I guess I don’t have the words to say much tonite……

A lady came up to me b4 the meeting started and asked me about attending the National Conference in Salt Lake.  I told her I was driving and planned to pull out of the Springs on July 4th.  She asked if she could come with me.  I said YES!  Having company to Salt Lake will make the drive pass quickly!  
I am so excited!
She is nice.  She lost her son b4 high school graduation 3 years ago.  This will be her first National Conference and I am SO excited that I will be able to share the experience with her.  My first one was last summer in DC and I went all alone.  I survived okay but that is because I am friendly and talk to everyone!
Nothing else to report.  My son and his wife spent some time visiting with me today.  They had dinner with us tonite, too.  It was nice.  We talked about Jake tonite.  I like to talk about Jake.  We miss him so very much.

I read of a man who stood to speak 
At the funeral of a friend 
He referred to the dates on her tombstone 
From the beginning…to the end. 
He noted that first came her date of birth 
And spoke the following date with tears, 
But he said what mattered most of all 
Was the dash between those years. (1934-1998) 
For that dash represents all the time 
That she spent alive on earth… 
And now only those who loved her 
Know what that little line is worth. 
For it matters not, how much we own; 
The cars…the house…the cash, 
What matters is how we live and love 
And how we spend our dash. 
So think about this long and hard… 
Are there things you’d like to change? 
For you never know how much time is left, 
That can still be rearranged. 
If we could just slow down enough 
To consider what’s true and real, 
And always try to understand 
The way other people feel. 
And be less quick to anger, 
And show appreciation more 
And love the people in our lives 
Like we’ve never loved before. 
If we treat each other with respect, 
And more often wear a smile.. 
Remembering that this special dash 
Might only last a little while. 
So, when your eulogy’s being read 
With your life’s actions to rehash… 
Would you be proud of the things they say 
About how you spent your dash? 
***I received this in an email.  I wanted to share it with you.  Jake was here with me for 9 years, 4 months, and 10 days.  We did a lot in that time.  I miss  him.

else has.  There will be hundreds of people out there with your same degree;
there will be thousands of people doing what you want to do for a living.
But you will be the only person alive who
has sole custody of your life.
Your particular life. Your entire life.  Not just your life at a desk, or
your life on a bus, or in a car, or at the computer.  Not just the
life of your mind,  but the life of your heart. Not just your bank account,
but your soul.
People don’t talk about the soul very much anymore.  It’s so much easier to
write a resume than to craft a spirit. But a resume is a cold comfort on a
winter night, or when you’re sad, or broke, or lonely, or when you’ve gotten
back the test results and they’re not
so good.
Here is my resume:  I am a good mother to three children. I have tried never
to let my profession stand in the way of being a good parent.  I no longer
consider myself the center of the universe.  I show up.  I listen.  I try to
laugh.   I am a good friend to my husband.  I have tried to make marriage
vows mean what they say.
I am a good friend to my friends, and they to me. Without them, there would
be nothing to say to you today, because I would be a  cardboard cutout. But
I call them on the phone, and I meet them for lunch. I would be rotten, or
at best mediocre at my job, if those
other things were not true. You cannot be really first rate at your work if
your work is all you are.
So here’s what I wanted to tell you today:  Get a life.  A real life, not a
manic pursuit of the next promotion, the bigger paycheck, the
larger house.
Do you think you’d care so very much about those things if you blew an
aneurysm one afternoon, or found a lump in your breast?  Get a life in which
you notice the smell of salt water pushing itself on a breeze over Seaside
Heights, a life in which you stop and watch how a red-tailed hawk circles
over the water or the way a baby scowls with concentration when she tries to
pick up a Cheerio with her thumb and first finger. Get a life in which you
are not alone.  Find people you love, and who love you.  And remember that
love is not leisure, it is work. Pick up the phone.  Send an e-mail.  Write
a letter.
Get a life in which you are generous.  And realize that life is the best
thing ever, and that you have no business taking it for granted.  Care so
deeply about its goodness that you want to spread it around.  Take money you
would have spent on beers and give it to
charity.  Work in a soup kitchen.  Be a big brother or sister.
All of you want to do well. But if you do not do good too, then doing well
will never be enough.
It is so easy to waste our lives, our days, our hours, our minutes. It is so
easy to take for granted the color of our kids’ eyes, the way the melody in
a symphony rises and falls and disappears and rises  again.
It is so easy to exist instead of to live.  I learned to live many years
ago.  I learned to love the journey, not the destination.  I learned that it
is not a dress rehearsal, and that today is the only guarantee you get.
I learned to look at all the good in the world and try to give some of it
back because I believed in it, completely and utterly. And I tried to do
that, in part, by telling others what I had learned.  By telling them this:
Consider the lilies of the field.  Look at the fuzz on a baby’s ear.  Read
in the backyard with the sun on your face.  Learn to be happy.  And think of
life as a terminal illness, because if you do, you will live it with joy and
passion as it ought to be lived.

272,https://www.opendiary.com/m/j8xmom/afternoon-with-carter-jakes-half-brother-5368177/,2002-06-28,Afternoon with Carter – Jake’s Half Brother,"
I wrote an entry in the past about the brother that Jake never knew was his brother.  Becky decided she would like to see him so we made arrangements for him to come over last Wednesday.
I picked Carter up from daycare with his mother’s approval, of course.  When he saw Becky, he ran and wrapped his arms around her.  Carter is an only child.  I took them to the house and dropped them off to spend the afternoon together.
I came home around 5:30pm.  I stopped at the store to pick up some pool toys for Carter.  While I was there, a Spiderman stuffed toy caught my attention.  I bought the Spiderman for Carter, too.  He had just went to the movie on Sunday  and saw Spiderman and seemed so excited about it!
When I walked upstairs, he jumped off the couch to greet me.  You should have seen his eyes when I pulled Spiderman out of the bag!  He was so happy to have him!  Then I showed him the goggles, snorkel, fish, and pool rings.  He was so happy to have his own goggles.  He put them on right away….upside down!  He made me laugh.  I helped him put them on the right way and lifted him into the pool.  We have small wading pool in the backyard.  It is 12 feet in diameter and 3 feet deep.  Carter just had a ball with his new pool toys.  I let him play just a few minutes because he was cold and shivering.
I brought him back inside and told him to get dressed.  He stayed for dinner, too.  He is quite the “talker”.  I really enjoyed having a little boy in the house again.  He played squirt gun war with Becky and had a blast.  He is so cute, too.  He has blonde hair and blue eyes.  He will be 5 next month.
His Mom came to pick him up and we had quite an interesting visit.  For those of you that don’t know – Carter is the secret son of Jake’s Dad – nobody knew about him.  He doesn’t even provide child support for this child!  Jake spent alot of time with Carter, but he never knew Carter was his brother.  If he had known, I am sure Jake would not have resented sharing his time with his Dad with Carter, too.
After talking with Carter’s Mom, I felt sad that my ex-husband caused her so much grief.  I am sad that Carter was never allowed to know his brother and sisters either.  Carter’s grandparents on his Dad’s side do not even know about him!
Carter had so much fun he asked if he could spend the night!  I told him we would have him sleep over in August after his sisters return from Florida on vacation.
I am excited that he wants to come and stay with us.  
He will never replace Jake, but we can give him the love that Jake would have given him…had he known this was his little brother.
In Jake’s memory, Carter will always be welcome to spend time with Jake’s sisters….who are also Carter’s sisters.
Jake – Carter WILL NEVER REPLACE YOU!
Carter pointed out Jake’s picture.  I don’t think Carter really understands what happened to Jake, but I think he knows Jake is no longer with us.  When we were talking about Spiderman and how he became a Spiderman, I told Carter I was scared of spiders.  I told him Jake was my Spiderman – he would kill the spiders for me.  Carter looked up at me into my eyes and said, “I can kill the spiders for you now since Jake died.”  How special…..so I told him that would be great!  Carter was about 3 when Jake had his accident.
Should I send Carter a birthday card next month on his birthday?  Or should I leave it up to the girls to send one on their own?  Could I send one to him and just sign my name?  I feel so sad that Carter misses his Daddy and his Daddy doesn’t care.  His Daddy is also Jake’s, Becky’s, and Renee’s daddy.  I feel odd having him over to my house, but I have to overlook the big picture and focus on a little boy who misses his time with his sisters…..I hope this is the right thing to do.  He told Becky at least 4 times that he misses his Daddy.  He actually was able to talk to his Daddy on Wednesday because his Daddy called to talk to Becky.  
Life is so difficult for children.
I miss you, Jake.  We haven’t stopped loving you and will never stop missing you, son.  Carter was actually wearing an old swimmingsuit you outgrew, Jake.  I recognized it.  It brought back memories.  I don’t need to look at an outgrown swimmingsuit to remember you, Jake.  My heartbreak is with me everyday.  The pain will never go away…..

(An email to share and to be shared by you.)
>
The first day of school our professor introduced himself and challenged us to get to know someone we didn’t already know.
>   
I stood up to look around when a gentle hand touched my shoulder.  I turned around to find a wrinkled, little old lady beaming up at me with a smile that lit up her entire being.
>
She said, “Hi handsome.  My name is Rose. I’m eighty – seven years old. Can I give you a hug?”
>   
I laughed and enthusiastically responded, “Of course you may!” and she gave me a giant squeeze.
“Why are you in college at such a young, innocent age?” I asked.  She jokingly replied, “I’m here to meet a rich husband, get married, have a couple of children, and then retire and travel.”
>  
“No seriously,” I asked. I was curious what may have motivated her to be taking on this challenge at her age.
>  
“I always dreamed of having a college education and now I’m getting one!” she told me.
>  
After class we walked to the student union building and shared a chocolate milkshake.  We became instant friends.
>   
Every day for the next three months we would leave class together and talk nonstop.  I was always mesmerized listening to this “time machine” as she shared her wisdom and experience with me.
>  
Over the course of the year, Rose became a campus icon and she easily made friends wherever she went.  She loved to dress up and she reveled in the attention bestowed upon her from the other students.  She was living it up.
>  
At the end of the semester we invited Rose to speak at our football banquet. I’ll never forget what she taught us.
>                     
She was introduced and stepped up to the podium.  As she began to deliver her prepared speech, she dropped her three by five cards on the floor.  Frustrated and a little embarrassed she leaned into the microphone and simply said “I’m sorry I’m so jittery.  I gave up beer for Lent and this whiskey is killing me! I’ll never get my speech back in order so let me just tell you what I know.”
>  
As we laughed she cleared her throat and began: “We do not stop playing because we are old; we grow old because we stop playing. There are only four secrets to staying young, being happy, and achieving success.  
“You have to laugh and find humor every day.”  “You’ve got to have a dream.  When you lose your dreams, you die. We have so many people walking around who are dead and don’t even know it!”
>   
“There is a huge difference between growing older and growing up.  If you are nineteen years old and lie in bed for one full year and don’t do one productive thing, you will turn twenty years old.
>                  
If I am eighty-seven years old and stay in bed for a year and never do anything I will turn eighty-eight.  Anybody can grow older.  That doesn’t take any talent or ability. The idea is to grow up by always finding the opportunity in change.”
>  
“Have no regrets. The elderly usually don’t have regrets for what we did, but rather for things we did not do. The only people who fear death are those with regrets.”
>  
She concluded her speech by courageously singing “The Rose.”  She challenged each of us to study the lyrics and live them out in our daily lives.
>   
At the years end Rose finished the college degree she had begun all those years ago.  One week after graduation
Rose died peacefully in her sleep.
>  
Over two thousand college students attended her funeral in tribute to the wonderful woman who taught by example that it’s never too late to be all you can possibly be.

I had a strange dream Friday night.  I think I was just overtired.  I dreamed that I told Jake’s Dad that I wanted Jake back.  In my dream I remember Jake disappeared when all his Dad’s family was around.  I felt it was time for them to return Jake.  Then I realized that Jake was not with them.  I think I dreamed this because all of Jake’s Dad’s family was here for the funeral and somehow I 4got the funeral scene and thought they just took Jake.  It has been 21 months and I just wanted Jake to come home.
Anyway I went to the movies today.  I saw The Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood.  It is an interesting movie.  You should check it out.  It was produced by all women!
I left money and a Random Act of Kindness card with the ticket guy.  I told him to use the money to buy a little boy’s ticket today and give the card to the little boy with his ticket.  I was hoping someone took their little boy to see Milo and Stitch – the new Disney movie.
I leave Thursday for the National Compassionate Friends’ 2002 Grief Conference in Salt Lake City.

You can buy jewelry that will show everyone that someone special is missing in your heart.  
If you have lost a loved one – Mom, Dad, Grandparent, Brother, Sister, Uncle, Aunt, Pet, etc – you cannot miss this site!  I discovered it today in a grief newsletter.  If you visit – email the lady who made these and tell her Jake’s Mom sent you!
Mine will be yellow gold with Jake’s May birthstone.  I can hardly wait to get it!
Real quick note about the conference – – I attended a workshop, “Understanding Brain Death”.  I came away from that 90 minute workshop with all my unasked questions…answered.  I truly know now what my happened to my little boy.  It didn’t make it better for me, but the knowledge from a nurse helped me understand what happened to Jake on September 24, 2000.  Knowlege is power…but this knowledge made me understand how helpless the situation really was on that afternoon.
I MISS YOU, JAKE.  John Edwards always says to “…validate, communicate, and appreciate your loved ones…..”  I talk to you Jake and you never talk back…why?

For those of you who thought I couldn’t cook, I thought I’d would share this new recipe with you. When I found this recipe I thought it was perfect for people, like me, who just are not sure how to tell when poultry is cooked thoroughly but not dried out.
Give this a try. 
BAKED STUFFED CHICKEN 
6-7 lb. chicken
1 cup melted butter
1 cup stuffing
1 cup uncooked popcorn
salt/pepper to taste
2 tsp Paul Purdome’s Poultry Magic 
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Brush chicken well with melted butter,  salt and pepper cavity. Fill cavity with stuffing and popcorn. Sprinkle the Paul’s over the outside of chicken. Place in baking pan with the neck end toward the back of the oven. Listen for popping sounds. When the chicken’s ass blows the oven door open and the chicken flies across the room, it’s done. 
And, you thought I couldn’t cook.
This was emailed to me and I HAD to share it with you OD Readers!

279,https://www.opendiary.com/m/j8xmom/what-a-wonderful-gift-5368184/,2002-07-11,What a Wonderful Gift,"
I met this very nice young man who graduated from high school this year.  He works at the local Long’s Drug store that I frequent.  His name is Jake.  I wrote about him in January of this year.  It was always so nice to see him and say, “Hey Jake!” and hear a voice talk back.  As you know, my son, Jake, died almost 22 months ago in a tragic gocart/auto accident.  He was only 9 years old, but he could have been 100 and my heart would still be broken.  Anyway, Big Jake (the high school guy)asked me for a picture of Little Jake to carry in his wallet.  I gave him a picture of Little Jake last month.
Big Jake left after high school graduation to visit his Dad in another state so I haven’t seen him since May.  Actually, I mailed Little Jake’s picture to him.
This afternoon…around 6pm there was a knock at the door.  I opened the door and there was Big Jake!  I was so surprised and happy to see him.  In his hand he held something very special.  He handed me a matted picture still in it’s protective plastic covering.  It was a hand sketched picture of Little Jake!  I was so taken by this surprise, I became speechless.  It was so “real-looking” – Little Jake was looking right at me in that picture!  I started crying and tearfully told Big Jake, “It looks just like Jake.  It is beautiful.”  Then I hugged Big Jake.  This picture had all the details of my beautiful son captured by a very gifted artist.  You can see his dimples and the freckles on his nose.  You can look into his sincere eyes that always made me smile.  I just cannot believe this beautiful picture! Big Jake told me his mother is an artist and he asked her to make this special picture for me from the picture I gave him to put in his wallet.  It is just so special.  I am crying as I write to you about this very special and wonderful gift…..  I plan to have it framed this weekend.

Read this email – then read my note at the end:
HE LOOKED OUT FOR THE LITTLE GUYS
“Zacchaeus, come down from the tree. I want to have dinner at your 
house tonight.”  This request gave Zacchaeus a tremendous boost in public 
stature.  He was a man who was so short, he had to climb up in a tree to 
see Jesus.
Jesus recognized people’s insecurities and rushed to reassure 
them.  “Simon,” he said, “they call you a flake but I call you the 
Rock.”  Another time he said, “Mary Magdalene, they say you are worthy of 
death but I say you are worthy of life.”  And yet another time: “Do not 
push the children back.  They should be at the center.  In fact, if you 
want to enter heaven you must become one of them.”  I sometimes wonder if 
Jesus wasn’t given a choice of transportation into Jerusalem.  Elijah got 
white horses, but maybe Jesus thought the donkey could use a little boost 
to its self-esteem.
Jesus was always looking out for and protecting the little 
ones.  King David changed a long-held tradition when he insisted that the 
ones who stayed behind and guarded the baggage get an equal share of the 
spoils of conquest.  David believed that “they also serve, who only stand 
and wait.”
Jesus took the time to see the people in the shadows.  The 
wallflowers.  The Lepers.  The ones nobody wanted to dance with.  He asked 
them to dance.  Jesus dined with the elite, but he lived with the little 
guys…the common folks, the fishermen.
Perhaps Jesus was sensitive to the unlovely and unloved because he 
knew what it was like to be considered an outsider.  He knew what if felt 
to be spit at, mislabeled, and verbally and physically abused.  He knew how 
it felt to be treated like a king one day and a criminal the next.
When he looked at little Zacchaeus in the tree, he said, “Come stand 
on equal ground with me.  I’d consider it an honor to dine at your house 
tonight.”
The rich people may have buried Jesus, but the common folks gave him 
life and joy and companionship.
Jesus looked out for little guys.
Jake’s Mom Memory Note:  
When I read this scripture from the email,  I remembered hearing this in Church with the kids.
Jake was about 4 or 5.  I remember the Pastor talking about this passage in
the Bible and was leading up to Jesus calling out to Zacchaeus and the
pastor said, “And do you know what Jesus said to Zaccaheus?”, and Jake
yelled out, “What?!”  He was so attentive in Church.  I miss Jake,
….(sigh), but I have ALL our MEMORIES intact……..
Do you spend time with the little guys in your organization, or do you 
constantly position your time and energy with the big guys?
How do you use your position to help make your staff feel wonderful, 
more valued and encouraged?
Describe a few of the times you have taken the time to acknowledge the 
people around you…the ones who serve silently and with little recognition.

Subject: The Piano Lesson
> Wishing to encourage her young son’s progress on the piano, a mother took the small boy to a Paderewski concert. After they were seated, the mother spotted a friend in the audience and walked down the aisle to greet her.
>
> Seizing the opportunity to explore the wonders of the concert hall, the little boy rose and eventually explored his way through a door marked “NO ADMITTANCE.” When the house lights dimmed and the concert was about to
begin, the mother returned to her seat and discovered that her son was missing.
>
> Suddenly, the curtains parted and spotlights focused on the impressive Steinway on stage. In horror, the mother saw her little boy sitting at the keyboard, innocently picking out “Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star.”
>
> At that moment, the great piano master made his entrance, quickly moved to the piano, and whispered in the boy’s ear, “Don’t quit. Keep playing.”
>
> Then leaning over, Paderewski reached down with his left hand and began filling in a bass part. Soon his right arm reached around to the other side of the child and he added a running obligatio.
>
> Together, the old master and the young novice transformed a frightening situation into a wonderfully creative experience. The audience was mesmerized.
>
> That’s the way it is with God. What we can accomplish on our own is hardly noteworthy. We try our best, but the results aren’t exactly graceful flowing music. But with the hand of the Master, our life’s work truly can be
beautiful.
>
> Next time you set out to accomplish great feats, listen carefully. You can hear the voice of the Master, whispering in your ear, “Don’t quit” “Keep playing.” Feel His loving arms around you. Know that His strong hands are playing the concerto of your life.
>
> Remember, God doesn’t call the equipped, He equips the called. And He’ll always be there to love and guide you on to great things.

A man’s daughter had asked the local minister to come and pray with her  father. When the minister arrived, he found the man lying in bed with his  head propped up on two pillows.  An empty chair sat beside his bed. The minister assumed that the old fellow had been informed of his visit. “I  guess you were expecting me,” he said.
“No, who are you?” said the father.
The minister told him his name and then remarked, “I see the empty chair;  I  figured you knew I was going to show up.”
“Oh yeah, the chair,” said the bedridden man. “Would you mind closing the door?”
Puzzled, the minister shut the door.
“I have never told anyone this, not even my daughter,” said the man. “But all of my life I have never known how  to pray.  At church I used to hear the pastor talk about prayer, but it went right over my head.  ” I abandoned any attempt at prayer,” the old man continued, “until one day four years ago my best friend said to me, “Johnny, prayer is just a simple matter of having a conversation with Jesus.  Here is what I suggest.” “Sit down in a chair; place an empty chair in front of you, and in faith see Jesus on the chair.  It’s not spooky because he  promised, ‘I’ll be with you always.’  Then just speak to him in the same way you’re doing with me right now.  So, I tried it and I’ve liked it so much that I do it a couple of hours every day. I’m careful though. If my daughter saw me talking to an empty  chair, she’d either have a nervous breakdown or send me off to the funny  farm.”
The minister was deeply moved by the story and encouraged the old man to continue on the journey. Then he prayed with him, anointed him with oil, and returned to the church.
Two nights later the daughter called to tell the minister that her daddy had died that afternoon.
“Did he die in peace?” he asked.
“Yes, when I left the house about two o’clock, he called me over to his bedside, told me he loved me and kissed me on the cheek.  When I got back  from the store an hour later, I found him dead. But there was something strange about his death.  Apparently, just before Daddy died, he leaned over and rested his head on the chair beside the bed. What do you make of that?”
The minister wiped a tear from his eye and said, “I wish we could all go like that.”
I asked God for water, He gave me an ocean.
I asked God for a flower, He gave me a garden.
I asked God for a strenght when Jake left us, He gave me OD.

Well, I went to the County Fair yesterday.  I could not interest anyone from my family to go with me so I invited Carter and his Mom.  I also borrowed the neighbor’s 2 kids – one is 7 and one is 2.  Carter is 5.  Everyone had a great time.  The kids loved the carnival rides and the game booths.  We went thru our money really quick and tried to get more but the portable ATM was down.  I didn’t realize how expense little County Fairs could be…we went through about $125 in 4 hours!
My favorite thing was Valentine’s Performing Pigs!  They are from Seattle, Washington.  They dance and do all kinds of neat tricks.  I think I enjoyed this more than the kids.  I know Jake would have just loved seeing them!  These pigs have been on TV!
5 years ago this month, I took my kids – Jake, Becky, and Renee – to this County Fair.  They loved it so much.  The carnival brought back those  memories like it was yesterday.
Next month – I am going to check out the State Fair in Pueblo!  Jake and the girls went with me there when Jake was about 2..it has been a long time.
I am approaching the 2 year anniversary of Jake’s accident.  I feel the emotions building….September 24.  I think about this day everytime I hear Alan Jackson’s song – Where Were You When the World Stopped Turning that September Day.  I also think of 9/11, too – the whole reason that song was written..

Subject: THE TRIPLE FILTER TEST
From: De Villa, Maria Asela Aguilar
THE TRIPLE FILTER TEST
In ancient Greece, Socrates was reputed to hold knowledge in high esteem.
One day an acquaintance met the great philosopher and said, “Do you know what I just heard about your friend?”
“Hold on a minute,” Socrates replied. “Before telling me anything I’d like you to pass a little test. It’s called the Triple Filter Test.”
“Triple filter?”
“That’s right,” Socrates continued. “Before you talk to me about my friend, it might be a good idea to take a moment and filter what you’re  going to say. That’s why I call it the triple filter test. The first filter is Truth. Have you made absolutely sure that what you are about to tell me is true?”
“No,” the man said, “actually I just heard about it and…”
“All right,” said Socrates. “So you don’t really know if it’s true or not.
Now let’s try the second filter, the filter of goodness. Is what you are about to tell me about my friend something good?”
“No, on the contrary… “
“So,” Socrates continued, “you want to tell me something bad about him, but you’re not certain it’s true. You may still pass the test though, because there’s one filter left: the filter of usefulness. Is what you want to tell me about my friend going to be useful to me?”
“No, not really.”
“Well,” concluded Socrates, “If what you want to tell me is neither true nor good nor even useful, why tell it to me at all?”
This is why Socrates was a great philosopher & held in such high esteem. Use this triple filter each time you hear loose talk about any of your dear friends.

291,https://www.opendiary.com/m/j8xmom/theme-visit-my-little-boy-in-heaven-5368197/,2002-07-29,Theme – Visit My Little Boy in Heaven,"
If I had 24 hours to do anything I would like to do I would love to visit my little boy in Heaven.  He would be 11 years old now.  I would love to sneak up on him and holler across the clouds, “Hey, Jake!  It’s me, Mom.  I am glad I have finally found you, Jake.  I have missed you everyday since you left over 22 months ago.”  (Boy, this is really hard to write with tears pouring out of my eyes like buckets of water…)
I would hug him so tight.  I would run my hands through his beautiful red hair and never let go ..at least for a few minutes.  I know I would be crying and he would wonder why.  I am sure he would be taller than me now, because he was growing up so fast when he was 9 years old.
I would ask him to let me drive his gocart.  I am sure it is safe for him to have his gocart in Heaven because I think there is no danger in Heaven.  I would tell him how much we miss him and that his brother Joe now lives 2 miles from us.  “We don’t have to drive to South Dakota anymore to see Joe and Holly, Jake.”  I would tell him his sisters miss him so much.  I think I would tell him about his 5 year old brother he never knew about.  He knew Carter, but did not know that was his brother.  I would just hold Jake’s hand and catch up on all the things that have happened since he left.
I would wish that I could spend 24 hours with Jake back home, but I would have a very hard time letting him go back.
I think I would ask him to take me to meet God.  I would ask God why Jake had to leave us and I would tell him how much we miss Jake.  I would ask God to forgive me for being selfish and wanting Jake back home …even though I know Jake is Home.
I would spend every waking moment with Jake because 24 hours with your little boy is so short…especially since you know he cannot come home for dinner and stay.  The last 5 minutes, I would hug him and look at him one last time.  I would see how many freckles he has grown since I last saw him.  I would ask him to do his Austin Powers imitation one last time for me.  I would tell him, “Jake, I miss you so much.  I love you so much.  Please don’t 4get us, Jake.”
24 hours…such a short time to spend with someone you miss so very much….
Jake,….would you know me in Heaven?

I volunteered to be the librarian for The Compassionate Friends group in Colorado Springs.  
I love to volunteer at the public library so I thought it might be fun to organize all the grief books on our beautiful hand-made book cart.  The cart was made by a bereaved Dad in memory of his son.
I have a friend at work who is going to build me a database so I can enter all our books so we can see what we have.  Then I think I am going to write a blurb 4 our monthly newsletter about a different book each month.
What do you think?
Also, another surprise from an OD reader arrived in the mail last Friday.  A box from Amazon.com was by my door when I came home.  I thought I was going crazy again…thinking I ordered something and 4got about it!  
I opened the box and there were 2 books:
One Last Time: A Psychic Medium Speaks to Those We Have Loved and Lost (John Edward)
Talking to Heaven:  A Medium’s Message of Life and Death   (James Van Praagh)
My OD friend wrote me a note, too!  Under the John Edward book she wrote, “Dear Patty, I just can’t help but think that you are “supposed” to have this book, so when you have time to sit near Jake’s Garden, I hope you will enjoy reading this!  Love, Donna”
Well, you can bet I have started reading!
Thanks, Donna so much for thinking about Jake and me!  You have to read my Theme entry about what I would do if I could spend 24 hours doing absolutely anything I wanted…..
Jake, I miss you every day, son……I will never stop crying because I will never stop loving you……
Thanks OD for letting me share my little boy with you.  Thanks for being there for us.
Does anyone know what happened to “Glazed” on OD?

293,https://www.opendiary.com/m/j8xmom/that-was-one-expensive-key-5368200/,2002-07-31,That Was One Expensive Key,"
I lost my spare key and didn’t think it would matter until I needed it. On July 14 I misplaced my key while I was volunteering at the library.  So I had to call a Locksmith….$45 later…my key was still missing.  So my son picks me up and brings me home.  He drops me off at the library the next day and after a few minutes, I locate my key underneath some books and magazines.
It is now August 1 and I decided to take some time off this afternoon and take care of some important things…one being getting a duplicate key.
Well, the Locksmith could physically duplicate my key, but it would not work in the ignition.  Why?  Because it is so high tech, I have a computer chip in my key and it has to be programmed!  My van has an anti-theft system on board and not only was it hard for the locksmith to break into the van 2 weeks ago – it cannot be fooled by a key without a chip!  Ugh!
So – off to the dealer I went.  For about $50 – I now have a spare programmed key.  The moral to this story – don’t loose your spare key especially if you have a Vehicle Anti-Theft (VAT) system on your car!  The locksmith that told me I had to get my key programmed told me he had to make a key for a Lexus and the final bill was $600!
Keep your spare key in a safe place!
The last time I had to get a key made was in 1993.  I was washing our car and Jake was playing in the car.  He locked the doors as he was exiting and there I was….locked out of a car in the middle of a wash!  He was about 2 years old and just copied me – he always watched me hit the power locks when I got out of the car.  Boy, I surely miss my little boy.  
Just today, I saw these little personalized things called “Zipper Pulls”.  I guess you link them to your coat or jacket zippers.  I found a “Jake” zipper pull.  I had it in my hand to buy, but for some strange reason, I thought I was too old to have a zipper pull.  I will probably go back and buy it this weekend.  I think maybe Jake was with me today when I noticed it and picked it up.  He probably thought it was silly, too!  It’s okay to be silly, Jake; YOU should know!

294,https://www.opendiary.com/m/j8xmom/monday-2814-5368201/,2002-08-04,Monday,"
Well, my girls came back from visiting relatives in GA, FL, and NC.  They were supposed to be home on 1 Aug, but Vanguard Airlines went bankrupt.  So their plans changed and they arrived on Saturday around noon. 
It is nice to have company around the house.  Becky and I floated in the pool for a couple hours on Sunday morning.  We just kind of vegged out Saturday afternoon and all day Sunday.  
Today I decided to take the day off.  Becky wanted to have a desk in her room so we shopped at a used furniture place and found a nice desk for less than $50!  She has already placed it in the perfect spot in her room.
We are leaving soon to check out the new Mel Gibson movie, Signs.  Both girls think it will be good.  At least the star is nice looking….LOL.
Tonite they want to see the Pro Scouts who are supposedly recruiting locals for Nickelodeon.  They are looking for redheads…at least that is what Renee heard on the radio infomercial and now she has Becky psyched!
We will see…..
I did go back and buy that zipper pull – it is personalized with Jake’s name.  Big Jake checked us out at his register. When he saw the zipper pull, he pulled out his keys and showed us that he had the same one…LOL.
By the way, my girls LOVED the pencil sketching of Jake!  
As Becky and I were floating in the pool, Renee was having a discussion with us.  She made a comment,”….when Jake was still alive.”  It sounded strange, but it was so great to hear Renee say her brother’s name.
Not much else to report.  It is in the 80’s today – quite warm 4 me.  That’s why I like my morning walks; it is in the 50’s in the early morning…too hot to walk after 7am that’s 4 sure!
School starts for the girls on 20 August.  They will be Sophomores this year!  Where does the time go?  Jake would have been starting his last year in grammar school…5th grade.  I wonder if Heaven has a grammar school….(sigh)

Well, this movie was good.  On a scale of 1-10 – I would rate it an 8.  It was funny, scary, and family oriented.  Mel Gibson was great!
P.S.  The trip to see the Pro Scouts was disappointing for my girls.  Oh well …we ended the night at DQ with Blizzards.  I told them they would always be “Stars” to me.

I am going to interview for a 3rd grade teacher position “out in the sticks” – Ellicott, Colorado.  I go in on Saturday for the interview.  I don’t think I can take this one because new teachers have to be in Monday for Orientation – – too short notice for my current employer.  I think it will be fun to make the drive “out in the sticks” on Saturday morning.  Maybe if I make a good enough impression they will consider me for a future position down the road when they don’t have to fill it in a pinch!

297,https://www.opendiary.com/m/j8xmom/the-interview-186-5368204/,2002-08-11,The Interview,"
Well, I drove “out into the sticks” to Ellicott, Colorado for the Saturday morning interview for the 3rd grade teaching position.  Everything went well!  The problem – they needed a teacher to report in on Monday for New Teacher Orientation.  As much as I would love to be a teacher, I just could not do that to my current employer – like split without notice.  I also told him that he would not want an employee that would leave his school without notice either.
I told the principal at this elementary school that when I was notified of this position I knew I could not accept it because of the short notice.  I told him the reason I drove out to interview was to let him meet me and for me to be able to leave a face with my resume.  All in all – everything went well.  He told me to consider his school in the Spring of 2003 when they start recruiting for vacancies next year. I told him I would certainly do that.
I sure hope they find a teacher soon.  The person filling the position is taking a year off due to health issues.  The principal said that whoever filled this position would have a job next year if it worked out for everyone – the teacher and the school staff.  I sure wish they would have called me about 2 weeks ago….
I always wanted to be teacher since I was in the 4th grade.  I told him that……

to college.  Big Jake stopped by tonite.  It was a nice surprise.  We were all having dinner – KFC – when the doorbell rang.  Up the stairs he came to sit at the table with all of us.  I announced to everyone – “This is Big Jake.  Remember my friend at Longs?”  Of course my daughters knew him.  Today Big Jake met Little Jake’s big brother, Joe and his wife, Holly.  It was a nice get together.
Big Jake is leaving tomorrow morning at 2am.  He is going to Alamosa, Colorado to attend Adams State College.  I will miss his kind face and politeness in Longs Drugs.  I will miss saying, “Hey, Jake!”   I will miss hearing his voice.  He says he will write and email me. 
I miss my little boy, Jake, too. He cannot write or email me.  He is not coming home.  It will be 2 years on September 24 next month.  I miss you, Jake.  Every minute, every hour, everyday,….each year…..
I am very sad tonite.  Good night OD land.  Kiss and hugs your kids everyday…your grandkids, your stepkids, all kids…..you will miss them when they leave…especially when you know they are not coming home…..ever……..
Jake Smathers…left us when he was 9 years old…not by choice…he was hit by a 16 year old driver when he was driving his gocart.  He only had his gocart 9 days.  I don’t understand.  People say one day I will understand.  It has been almost 2 years.  I still do not understand.  One thing that I understand now…life is way too short.  Jake’s life was too short.  I passed his 2nd birthday without him.  Words cannot describe the emptiness and sadness in our lives.  The boy who hit Jake turned 18 in June this summer.  I hope he never forgets what happened on September 24, 2000 at 3:45pm…he changed our lives forever…

Normally my oldest son runs the gas grill for me.  Lately, I have been trying to cook on it myself.  I grilled hamburgers on Tuesday night.  Tonite I surprised myself!
My girls love steak so I decided to experiment with steak.  I marinated the steaks in teriyaki honey sauce – K.C. Masterpiece Marinade – found at your local grocery store.  I marinated the meat for about 5 hours.  I threw the meat on the grill and Renee decided to add her touch to the meal.  She chopped up some onion and green bell pepper and topped the meat with it.  She also continued to baste the steaks with marinade sauce as they were grilling.  Becky decided she wanted to make homemade hashbrowns – so she started peeling potatoes and chopping them up in a pan with butter.  Renee threw some onions in there, too!  Then Becky added some grated cheddar cheese to top it off.  I threw some canned spinach in a pot with some vinegar.  Then it all came together for us.  We sat on the deck and ate by candlelight.  The girls had fun cooking so we are going to try and plan to do this every weekend.
Jake’s garden was lit up in the background with solar lights.  So – he was with us in spirit.  He would have loved these steaks.  He was such a good eater.  He always appreciated a good meal.  We miss him so much…

A young mother (about 24) in my grief group shared something special with us on Thursday night.  She lost her first and only child to SIDS when he was 11 weeks old.  His birthday was in July.  He would have been 1.  She made him a cornbread cake and spread peanut butter on top for the icing.  She then sprinkled birdseed on top.  She took the cake to the cemetary and placed it on his grave.  As she told us this through her tears, I was so amazed at this creative idea.  I am thinking about doing the same thing and placing this cake in Jake’s garden on September 24..the day he left us …2 years ago.  I think Jake would have thought this was a creative and “cool” idea, too.
Her son’s name is Austin.  She had him for 11 weeks.  She actually was the one to find him when she came home from work.  I have no words for this special Mom.  I just listen with tears in my eyes.  I hug her.  I think that is about all one can do.  Her son missed all the holidays – Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Years, Valentines Day, St. Patrick’s Day, Mother’s Day, Father’s Day, July 4th, his birthday.  He missed so much.  His Mom misses him so much.  I will hug his Mom for him each month I see her at the meetings.  I will cry with her.  I will understand her pain.  I, too, lost my little boy.  He was 9 years old.  Austin was 11 weeks old.  Age doesn’t matter when you loose a child.  All that matters is …..we miss our children.  I told her Thursday night, “Death ends a life, not a relationship.  You will ALWAYS be Austin’s Mom.”  We talked about families and how many children we have.  I said I have 4.  She looked at me and said, “I have 1.”  I looked back at her and said, “Yes, you have 1.  You always will.”  She is young.  She is almost 20 years younger than me.  She could have more.  She probably will have more.  Austin will always be her first.  Jake will always be my youngest.
Good night.

It was HOT!  I think it was 95 degrees today!  It is about 80 degrees now – but still warm! 
The picnic drained me.  I was busy!  The kids had fun.  2 of the girls won prizes for games – Renee and her friend.  They both won $15 gift certificates to Media Play.  Becky was unhappy because she didn’t win anything.  I tried to win something for her.  I entered the adult sack race – but did not win – I was last…LOL.  I am too old for this but it was fun trying!
Carter had a blast.  He didn’t want to go home so he came home with us.  Renee took him swimming at the local community outdoor pool.  She and her sister are lifeguards there.  He stayed and had dinner with us, too.
I am tired.  Renee is lifeguarding a private pool party tonite until 11pm.  Her sister just got home from a Karoke party.  I just had a short 30 minute visit at my older son’s place…just to catch up with each other.  It is 9:15pm and I dread the 5am wake up….

I was asked a question in my Notes about SIDS.  What causes it?  I am not sure; I am not very knowlegeable in this area.  I think the baby forgets to breath and suffocates.  I know it is a very tragic and heartbreaking experience from those that have experienced this type of loss.  I remember when doctors started encouraging parents to NOT let the baby sleep on his/her stomach.  They encourage parents to have their babies sleep on their backs or propped on their sides.  
I worried about SIDS with Jake.  I don’t think SIDS was a big thing when my older son was born in 1979 or when the twins were born in 1987.  
It was something totally unexpected that took Jake from us.  Imagine that.  I still wake up and go to bed at night wondering if this really happened.  I wake each day and Jake is not here.  It will be 2 years on September 24.  I wonder where all this time has gone?
I miss you, Jake.  We all miss, you.

Today Jake would have started his first day in 5th grade.  I looked at all the kids and wondered what Jake would have worn to school today.  I know his hair would have been perfectly gelled.  He really spent alot of time on his hair.  I have clothes that Jake never wore to school.  We went shopping late.  He would have been in his 3rd week of 3rd grade.
Are there schools in Heaven?  If so, I know he is doing well.  He struggled so hard and we all worked so hard to help him.  I finally held him back in 3rd grade.  He finally did well in school.  Why is it that things happen in life when you never expect it?  Why do 9 year old boys in the prime of their lives – – leave us in tragic accidents.  I will never know.  One thing that I do know – the pain of losing a child never goes away…never….ever

There were Circus Peanuts candy on my desk when I came back from lunch yesterday.  A co-worker usually has some in his office.  Once I told him that my Dad loved to eat Circus Peanuts.  I told him I always think of my Dad when I see those Circus Peanuts.  Monday there were Circus Peanuts on my desk.  Today there are still Circus Peanuts on my desk.  I share them and talk about my Dad.
I don’t need to eat Circus Peanuts to think about my Dad.  I miss my Dad.  He never met Jake.  Dad died in 1988.  Jake was born in 1991.  Jake died in 2000.
Circus Peanuts make me think of my Dad.  Razor Scooters make me think of Jake.  I had planned to get him one on Christmas, 2000.  Jake was not with us on Christmas, 2000.  He left on September 24, 2000.  He was only 9 years old.  I also planned to get him a new bike on his 10th bday on May 14, 2001.  He wasn’t with us on his 10th bday either.  He missed his 11th bday, too.  He will miss all his bdays.  We will never stop missing Jake.  We will never stop loving Jake.  
Jake was my youngest child.  He was 9 years old.  I miss him.
Maybe I will buy a Razor Scooter for a needy little boy for Christmas 2002.  Maybe I will buy a new bike for another needy boy on Jake’s 12 bday.  I will put a Random Act of Kindness card taped to both items.  Jake was a very special boy.

Well, the weekend is almost over and I feel like it never happened.
I went shopping yesterday.  I don’t care for shopping; it is so time consuming.  Anyway, while I was shopping for shoes, I met a 4th grade school teacher.  She was so much fun to talk to.  Another fun thing about being a teacher is their dress code – super casual.  I would love to be able to wear tennis shoes to work! Anyway, I told her of my desire to teach and she gave me positive words and hope.  So my shoe shopping spree was rewarding.
I just got home from Woodland Park.  My oldest son and his wife picked me up around 1230 and we went to vist her Mom in her new log cabin.  It was beautiful – the cabin and the surroundings up there.  Her cabin  looks like something out of Better Homes and Gardens magazine.  
We had a nice visit and lunch.
I wonder if it is appropriate to refer to Joe as my oldest son – he is my only son now….
I think I will always refer to him as my oldest son because Jake will always be my youngest son…4ever 9 years old. 
Well – it is the start of another work week tomorrow…where does the weekend go?

From: Reggie Gatuslao
THE BUSIER YOU ARE
The busier you are, the more important it is to stop and read this story.
One day, an expert in time management was speaking to a group of business students and, to drive home a point, used an illustration those students will never forget.
As he stood in front of the group of high-powered overachievers, he said, “Okay, time for a quiz.” He then pulled out a one-gallon, wide-mouth mason jar and set it on the table in front of him.
Then he produced about a dozen fist-sized rocks and carefully placed them, one by one, into the jar.
When the jar was filled to the top and no more rocks would fit inside, he asked, “Is this jar full?”
Everyone in the class said, “Yes.”
Then he said, “Really?” He reached under the table and pulled out a bucket of gravel. Then he dumped some gravel in and shook the jar, causing pieces of gravel to work themselves down into the space between the big rocks.
Then he asked the group once more. “Is this jar full?”
By this time the class was on to him. “Probably not,” one of them answered.
“Good!” he replied.
He reached under the table and brought out a bucket of sand. He started dumping the sand in the jar and it went into all the spaces left between the rocks and the gravel.
Once more he asked the question. “Is this jar full?”
“No!” the class shouted.
Once again, he said, “Good!”.
Then he grabbed a pitcher of water and began to pour it in until the jar was filled to the brim.
Then the expert in time-management looked at the class and asked, “What is the point of this illustration?”
One eager Beaver raised his hand and said, “The point is, no matter how full your schedule is, if you try really hard you can always fit some more things in it.”
“No”, the speaker replied, “That’s not the point. The truth this illustration teaches us is this: If you don’t put the big rocks in first, you’ll never get them in at all.”
What are the big rocks in your life? Your children. Your spouse. Your loved ones. Your friendships. Your education. Your dreams. A worthy cause. Teaching or mentoring others. Doing things that you love. Time for yourself. Your health. Remember to put these BIG ROCKS in first, or you’ll never get them in at all. 
“If you sweat the little stuff (i.e. gravel, the sand) then you’ll fill your life with little things you will never have the real quality time you need to spend on the big, important stuff (the big rocks).
* Beyond all, remember that the biggest Rock of life is Jesus Christ, the Rock in whom we take refuge. Spend more time with Him and see for yourself how everything in your life perfectly fits in. Do this no matter how busy you are.*
Note:  This was emailed to me and I wanted to share it with you.

What would be the best thing to do to honor Jake?  Should I set up a memorial scholarship fund at my bank?  I would like to do something for his school, too.  Jake’s attorney suggested getting computers for his school.  I would like to do something for both his schools…the one he attended from K-3 and the school he attended for barely 3 weeks b4 his tragic accident.
I heard from Jake’s attorney today and we feel a settlement from the driver’s insurance is very close.  We won our battle to make the insurance company own up to their responsibility.  You cannot buy Jake back, but they can pay whatever limits they are responsible for paying out.  Their first offer was a fraction of their limits.  Jake’s attorney is handling everything.  I am kept up to date on things…that’s all.  More than anything that money can buy…I would love to have my little boy home.  Since I know Jake is never coming home, I want his memory to live on in this place he called his home for 9 years, 4 months, and 10 days.  I know I probably will not leave this area for a long time because my son is buried here and my oldest son lives here, too.  I do know that whereever I choose to go, Jake will always be in my heart and memories.  I will continue to miss him everyday and cry tears when least expected.  I have found out it is so ok to cry and I do cry…as I am tonite.
I think I will investigate the computer idea soon.  I guess I would have to talk to Jake’s schools.  I think it would be nice to have a nice computer lab established in each school.  Maybe a plaque could be placed in each lab…”Jake’s Fun Lab” …or something…”Jake Smathers’ Information Technology Center”…..
Helping out the school will only be a fraction of what we can do in his memory.  Any ideas?
I think some type of Scholarship Fund would be nice.  Every person who is awarded some scholarship money would know the story about a very special little redheaded boy who rode his gocart to Heaven on September 24, 2000.
I think I believe in psychics.  I saw one several months ago – remember I wrote about it.  She said I would have “closure” on “something” in September 2002.  We are approaching this month in less than a week.

Guess what!  The cemetery people where Jake is resting has stepped forward and welcomed our group to do our Memory Walk in Evergreen Cemetery!  Wow!  Imagine that.  Our Chapter Leader of our local chapter of The Compassionate Friends bumped into this guy this week while he was out at the cemetery.
This morning, the Chapter Leader and I went out to drive around the cemetery.  This is a very LARGE cememtery.  In the past, I have only went to visit with Jake.  There are alot of historic areas and people buried out there.  This walk could turn into something educational along the way.  I actually saw General Palmer’s site – he discovered or settled Colorado Springs.  There are several interesting statues, too!
We ended our drive with a stop to visit our sons.
We are tentatively planning this walk for October 26.  We are going to put something in our newsletter and local paper about our walk.  We plan to have shirts made with The Compassionate Friends’ logo on front and the Compassionate Friends motto on back:  We Need Not Walk Alone.
I am excited about bringing this walk to Colorado Springs.  This will be a first for Colorado Springs.  My oldest son and his wife are excited, too.
If you want to make a donation to this walk email me!  Make your checks out to the Pikes Peak Chapter of the Compassionate Friends!
I am so EXCITED!  I love to walk, too!  What a great reason to gather together.

I went with a friend to the movies today.  My friend was diagnosed with breast cancer in June.  She had two surgeries and is now undergoing chemo treatment.  I don’t see her much because she is the fiancee of a co-worker.  So I decided to call her this past week and ask her out to the movies.  We had a nice time.  We saw The Road to Perdition with Tom Hanks starring as the main character.  It was an interesting movie.  It was deep and intense.  A bit too much violence for me; I almost choked on my popcorn with first graphic gunshots.  The movie is really good and shows Tom Hanks playing a role totally 360 degrees from the roles you normally see him play (Forest Gump, etc.).  It has an interesting conclusion.
Anyway, we had a nice time – my friend and I.  Then we looked at wedding bands for her future husband.  It was fun looking a wedding bands.
We finished our afternoon with a late lunch in the Food Court at the Mall.  We had Chinese!
My friend is such a great person.  You would all love her.  She is younger than me and has 2 grandchildren.  I met her grandson; he is 6.  He is such a boy!  He brought back fond memories of when Jake was that age.  He loves the cartoon Gargoyles and he knows ALOT about Gargoyles.  He fascinated me with his excitement about Gargoyles.  Her other grandchild is a baby girl – born last month in July.  She is beautiful.
I thought getting my friend out of the house by picking her up and taking her out would make her cheerful.  She enjoyed going out with me.  She looks great!  You would think she might be weak and depressed – but she looks great.  We laughed alot.  We plan to go out more often – at least once a month.  Susan Sarandon is coming out with a new movie around the holidays.  I am taking my friend out to see this movie.

with my little boy, Jake.  I just had to write in my OD today and share an interesting story with you.
In my Walking With Angels Email support group, I read about James van Praagh hosting a new TV program debuting in September…”Beyond”.  I heard they were looking for people so I called the number in the Email I saw in Walking With Angels.  That was about 2 weeks ago.  I called and got an answering machine.  Just my kinda luck….
Anyway, I started reading John Edward’s book – One Last Time – last night.  It is such an EZ to read book.  I think I was into Chapter 3 b4 I fell asleep.  So today, I was telling a co-worker about this book.  She watches his program – she is a regular fan of his.
Anyway, after lunch, while I was back in my office, I called into my home answering machine to check my messages because I needed to talk to the guys that put in my sprinkler system.  I just talked to them yesterday, but we have been playing phone tag.  I was hoping they called and left me a message.  I only had one message and it was from someone who works on the set with JAMES VAN PRAAGH!  He returned my phone call!  Can you believe this!?  So, I fished in my wallet to find my Calling Card so I could return his call to California.  Guess what?!  He answered (not James, but the guy that works with him) and asked for my work number so he could call back and chat with me at HIS expense!  So we chatted briefly and he emailed me his address to the show on Sunset Blvd..etc.  He wants a handwriting sample to show the producers.  He wants me to write something about Jake and myself and why I want to connect with Jake.  He also wants me to send a picture of myself and one of Jake!  He could not promise me anything for sure, but he thought since my loss was so recent and I am a grieving mother that I might have a chance – – something about motherly loss.  So I am going to think about what to write tonite and I will mail it with pictures tomorrow.  What do you think?  Do you think it might be possible?  I don’t think I have anything to loose, do you?  Is this weird or what…reading John Edward’s book last night, talking about John Edward at lunch, then talking to someone from the James van Praagh show!  
Jake, please come through to me – I don’t have to go to California for you to come through to me.  I miss you, punkin….  Is this phone call from California a sign of more signs to come.  I hope so.  I will try to not get too excited about this.
Last but not least, the guy from the show asked me if I am familiar with Praagh’s book and I said…”Yes!  Talking to Heaven?  I am reading it now!”
Deja Vu, if you are reading this – I think you must be psychic.  Remember?  You sent me these 2 books and you noted in the package that you felt I needed to have the John Edward book.  Look what happened!  Thanks!  Jake and I love you!

Okay – I sent my letter (handwritten) to the Beyond TV show.  I sent a picture with Jake sitting in my lap and Jake’s last school picture.  I wrote the note on a notecard.  The notecard has a little person looking up into the nighttime sky at the stars and it says “How I wonder how you are….” on the front of the notecard.  Now I will wait and see what happens.  I also sent an email back to the guy at the set with 3 pictures attached.  Maybe I will have an email at work from him.  What an exciting way to get motivated to go to work!  LOL.

Jake, I feel you so much, son. I love you and miss you so very much.  I saw alot of kids your age when I went to a High School football game tonite.  You were around us…I felt it.  I was at Gary Barry Stadium and it brought back memories of when we would watch the girls run track there when they were in middle school.  Remember?  You brought your football and threw passes with your Dad.  I remember…I can close my eyes and see it so vividly…like it was yesterday……

Philosophy (orig. subj.)         
THE ONES WHO MADE A DIFFERENCE
You don’t actually have to take the quiz. Just read the email straight through, and you’ll get the point (an awesome one) that it is trying to make! Take this quiz:
1. Name the five wealthiest people in the world.
2. Name the last five Heisman trophy winners.
3. Name the last five winners of the Miss America contest.
4. Name ten people who have won the Nobel or Pulitzer prize.
5. Name the last half dozen Academy Award winners for best actor and actress.
6. Name the last decade’s worth of World Series winners.
How did you do? The point is, none of us remember the headliners of yesterday. These are no second-rate achievers. But the applause dies. Awards tarnish. Achievements are forgotten. Accolades and certificates are buried with their owners. Here’s another quiz. See how you do on this one:
1. List a few teachers who aided your journey through school.
2. Name three friends who have helped you through a difficult time.
3. Name five people who have taught you something worthwhile.
4. Think of a few people who have made you feel appreciated and special.
5. Think of five people you enjoy spending time with.
6. Name half a dozen heroes whose stories have inspired you.
Easier? The lesson: The people who make a difference in your life are not the ones with the most credentials, the most money, or the most awards. They are the ones that care. Pass this on to those people who have made a difference in your life. “Don’t worry about the world coming to an end today. It’s already tomorrow in Australia.” —– Charles Schultz

I-CAN-DO-IT  STREET
I had not really planned on taking a trip this time of year, and yet I  found myself packing rather hurriedly. This trip was going to be unpleasant, and I knew in advance that no real good would come of it. I’m  talking about my annual ”guilt trip.”
I got tickets to fly there on Wish I Had Airlines. It was an extremely short flight. I got my baggage, which I could not check. I chose to carry it myself all the way. It was weighted down with a thousand memories of  what might have been. No one greeted me as I entered the terminal to the Regret City International Airport. I say international because people from all over the world come to this dismal town.
As I checked into the Last Resort Hotel, I noticed that they would be hosting the year’s most important event, the annual Pity Party. I wasn’t going to miss that great social occasion. Many of the town’s leading citizens would be there. First, there would be the Done family — you know, Should Have, Would Have and Could Have. Then came the I Had family. You probably know Oh Wish and his clan. Of course, the Opportunities would be present, both Missed and Lost. The biggest family would be the Yesterdays.  There are far too many of them to count, but each one would have a very sad  story to share. Then Shattered Dreams would surely make an appearance.  And It’s Their Fault would regale us with stories (excuses) about how things had failed in his life, and each story would be loudly applauded by Don’t Blame Me and I Couldn’t Help It.
Well, to make a long story short, I went to this depressing party knowing that there would be no real benefit in doing so. And, as usual, I became very depressed. But as I thought about all of the stories of failures brought back from the past, it occurred to me that the trip and the party could be canceled — by me! I started to truly realize that I did not have to be there. I didn’t have to be depressed. One thing kept going through my 
mind: ”I can’t change yesterday, but I do have the power to make a wonderful today and tomorrow.” I can be happy, joyous, fulfilled,  encouraged, as well as encouraging. Knowing this, I left the City of Regret immediately with no forwarding address. Am I sorry for mistakes I’ve made in the past? Yes, but there is no physical way to undo them.
So, if you’re planning a trip back to the city of Regret, please cancel all your reservations now. Instead, take a trip to a place called Starting Again. I liked it so much that I have now taken up permanent residence there. My neighbors, the I Forgive Myselfs and the New Starts, are so very helpful. By the way, you don’t have to carry around heavy baggage, because the load is lifted from your shoulders upon arrival. When you find this great town, be sure to look me up.  I live on I-Can-Do-It Street.

A close friend had to put her dog to sleep.  He was her life.  She loved him so much and he reciprocated the feelings back to her.  He was her companion for about 10 years.
My friend did not come to work on Thursday.  She sent me a very sad email about her dog.  It is okay to grieve for pets.  They bring wonderful love into people’s lives.  My friend is not married and does not have children.  She has pets.  Nippy was her best friend.  He was a Shitzu – I hope I spelled that correctly.
I passed a sympathy card around to our co-workers.  It was a card to give someone who lost their pet.  Nobody knew what to put in the card.  I did….I wrote, “Nippy lived like a King all his life.  Most people can only say, “If I were King for a day….”, but Nippy was the King of your palace.” Patty
I called this friend when I heard Jake was in an accident and did not survive.  I left her a message, “Hey. I am probably going to be late for work on Monday.”  I left this message on her voicemail at work.  On the way to the hospital, I called her at home and left this message, “Something very sad happened today.  I am on my way to the hospital.  I will call you back.”  After I arrived at the hospital and held my son’s lifeless hand for the last time, I called this friend and told her what happened.  She came to the hospital right away.  She did not have to do that.  She gave me a hug with tears in her eyes.  She understood the depth of my loss and she doesn’t have kids.  I will never forget that Sunday evening, September 24, 2000.
I don’t have a dog, but I cried when I read her email on Thursday morning, September 12.  I understood her loss like she understood mine.  A loss is a loss – there is no other way to put it.  It hurts.  I am still hurting.  I miss Jake so very much.
If I were King for a day…I would give everybody in the world time off from work to grieve their loss.

On Wednesday, my girls and I stopped in at Starbucks on the way to school.  We ordered our usuals.  When the lady gave me the change, I handed some cash back to her and said, “Use this to buy someone’s coffee in memory of those we lost one year ago today.”  The look on her face was a Kodak moment.  She said, “That is SO NICE of you.”
Well, my girls and I stepped aside to wait for our coffees and chatted together.  As we were leaving, a lady in line leaned over to say, “Thanks so much.”  I smiled and nodded my head and continued towards the door.  I guess she was the winner of the free coffee.  
My girls looked at me and said, “What was that all about?”  So I told them.  
I just hope she remembered to do a random act of kindness during the day, too….(sigh).

I went to Church last Sunday with my son and his wife.  My son always talks about how real this Pastor is at Church.
I really got a kick out of him.  He’s from Georgia, too!  Anyway, he was telling this story about this guy he went to lunch with who kept saying over and over again, “Hey, Man. I love Jesus.”  So Pastor Steve finally says to him, “Shut up! Nobody loves Jesus that much!”  
I thought we were all going to die laughing and go to Heaven last Sunday.  So this Sunday, I was back to listen to this cool guy.

We had some new people last night and it was very sad.  I told them all they came to a good place.  I asked them all to come back next month and they said they would!
I prepared materials for 15 people and 13 people attended the meeting!  I gave away a door prize, too.  I picked up a nice journal from Barnes and Noble bookstore.  In my presentation, I talked about how you could journal on-line, in a spiral notebook, or in a fancy store bought journal.  I told them someone would leave tonite with a nice journal.  I think it added a little fun to the meeting.
I also reminded everyone about our walk in October for our children who left too soon.  I actually think we are going to have a large turnout for that event as well.
It was a nice night.  I felt like I actually helped people in this journey of grief that we all must walk.  At least…we do not have to walk it alone.
We are going to have T-shirts for our walk, too.  $10/shirt – great bargain!
Good night.

today.
A guy that was in the military with me in 1984-1985 is now in prison.  He shot and killed his wife about 3 years ago in a rural town – Calhan, Colorado.  (Calhan is a little town I would like to teach elementary school someday…)  Anyway, it was a shock to read about it in the newspaper.  I used to track satellites with this guy!  I went to dinner with this guy!  He lived across from me in the Officer’s Barracks for about a year when were in the Aleutian Islands several years ago.  Wow…
Anyway, a co-worker and I were talking about him today and she suggested we write him a letter.  So we composed a nice friendly letter.  
My friend thought it might be nice for him to receive some unexpected mail.  So we talked about the military in the letter.  We also talked about our current jobs and life. 
I told him about my little boy, Jake, and how sad it has been for me.  (Next Tuesday is Jake’s 2 year anniversary of not coming home after his gocart outing with his Dad.)  I asked about his children, too.
I will let you know if he responds. 
We were not sure where to send it, but we thought we had a good idea of where he might be residing.  
I put a note in the letter, too, that if whoever was reading it and it was not the right person…I hoped they enjoyed reading letters from strangers.
Oh well, I am sure anyone in prison likes to get mail.
I guess this is another Random Act of Kindness….

2 Years ago today I was up at 6am making breakfast for him and his best friend.
Today I got up b4 7am and went on a walk to remember all the good times I had with my son.
2 Years ago today at 10am, Jake’s Dad picked him up to spend the day with him and let him ride his gocart
Today I was the the Church at 10am working on organizing the Book Cart for The Compassionate Friends.
2 Years ago today, Jake was involved in a tragic gocart/auto accident at 3:48pm.
Today I was just waking up from a nap at 3:48pm.  For some reason…I was so drained today.
I am going to the cemetery now to release balloons for Jake…because 2 years ago today was my last hug and I Love You from a special little boy and I will never 4get him.

This is posted 3 days late.
Around 5pm this afternoon, I planned a trip to the cemetery.  I invited my girls, but both did not feel up to a visit to the cemetery.  So as I was getting ready they surprised me when they changed their minds!  
We stopped off at Party America and got dozen balloons in 2 different shades of green.  Green is Jake’s favorite color.  I added a butterfly mylar, too.  We drove to the cemetery and each released 4 balloons.  I tied the butterfly to his memorial stone at the request of my girls.
It was very hard on Becky to be there.  Renee doesn’t show her feelings openly, but I know it was hard for her, too.  I was happy that I had company on this trip.
I am waiting for my favorite country radio station to play a dedication to Jake.  I asked them to play, I Miss My Friend.
Jake was a great friend.  I miss him.  We all miss him.
Dedicate a song to Jake tonight.  Tears in Heaven would be a good one to dedicate to him.  Thanks.  I love you all for listening to memories of Jake and leaving all your notes.

I am having a hard couple weeks.  
Today I was in the grocery store and saw this little boy that reminded me of Jake…just his behavior.  He ran down the aisle and grabbed a Frutopia and yelled to his Oma, “What kind is this!?”
I miss Jake.  It is hard to be without him.  Somedays I am ready to throw in the towel and give up….
Do you think anybody misses Jake like me?
I received 2 cards on September 24 from 2 OD readers.  I also received a card from my daughter’s English teacher.  Thanks to you OD readers for thinking of us.
Why do you suppose I did not hear from my family in Ga?  No card, letter, or phone call.  It hurts so much….and they don’t seem to understand or care.  Maybe they 4got the date, but they have 4gotten Jake’s bday for the past 2 years, too.  I think I will 4get about connecting with those people in GA.  I will send a Christmas card.

What Grieving People Want You To Know
by Virginia A. Simpson , Ph.D.
Grieving people, you may want to print this out and give it to a friend…
Through my work and the privilege of listening to so many stories, I have come to wonder where people get their ideas about how another person is supposed to grieve.
Here’s a test for you:
1.How long does it take to recover after someone you love has died?
2.When should a person begin to “get on with their lives?”
3.Do you think it’s better to mention the deceased’s name to the grieving person or to avoid mentioning the name so that you won’t make that person cry?
4.Do you think it’s a good idea to tell a grieving person how strong they are?
You can figure out the answers to these questions by understanding what grieving people want you to know about them.
1.I am not strong. I’m just numb. When you tell me I am strong, I feel that you don’t see me.
2.I will not recover. This is not a cold or the flu. I’m not sick. I’m grieving and that’s different. I will not always be grieving as intensely, but I will never forget my loved one and rather than recover, I want to incorporate his life and love into the rest of my life. That person is part of me and always will be, and sometimes I will remember him with joy and other times with a tear. Both are okay.
3.I don’t have to accept the death. Yes, I have to understand that it has happened and it is real, but there are just some things in life that are not acceptable.
4.Please don’t avoid me. You can’t catch my grief. My world is painful, and when you are too afraid to call me or visit or say anything, you isolate me at a time when I most need to be cared about. If you don’t know what to say, just come over, give me a hug or touch my arm, and gently say, “I’m sorry.” You can even say, “I just don’t know what to say, but I care, and want you to know that.”
5.Please don’t say, “Call me if you need anything.” I’ll never call you because I have no idea what I need. Trying to figure out what you could do for me takes more energy than I have. So, in advance, let me give you some ideas:
(a)Bring food.
(b)Offer to take my children to a movie or game so that I have some moments to myself.
(c)Send me a card on special holidays, birthdays (mine, his or hers), or the anniversary of the death, and be sure and mention her name. You can’t make me cry. The tears are here and I will love you for giving me the opportunity to shed them because someone cared enough about me to reach out on this difficult day.
(d)Ask me more than once to join you at a movie or lunch or dinner. I may so no at first or even for a while, but please don’t give up on me because somewhere down the line, I may be ready, and if you’ve given up, then I really will be alone.
6.Try to understand that this is like I’m in a foreign country where I don’t speak the language and have no map to tell me what to do. Even if there were a map, I’m not sure right now I could understand what it was saying. I’m lost and in a fog. I’m confused.
7.When you tell me what I should be doing, then I feel even more lost and alone. I feel bad enough that my loved one is dead, so please don’t make it worse by telling me I’m not doing this right.
8.Please don’t call to complain about your husband, your wife, or your children. Right now, I’d be delighted to have my loved one here no matter what they were doing.
9.Please don’t tell me I can have other children or need to start dating again. I’m not ready. And maybe I don’t want to. And besides, what makes you think people are replaceable? They aren’t. Whoever comes after, will always be someone different.
10.I don’t even understand what you mean when you say, “You’ve got to get on with your life.” My life is going on, but it may not look the way you think it should. This will take time and I never will be my old self again. So please, just love me as I am today, and know, that with your love and support, the joy will slowly return to my life. But I will never forget and there will always be times that I cry.

Yesterday morning, the girls almost knocked me in the sink as I was brushing my teeth b4 work.  They heard on the radio that Korn was coming to the World Arena.  Becky wanted this to be her Christmas present – a ticket to the concert.
Well, they have tickets to go seen Korn on November 22 at the World Arena.
Korn.  Isn’t it funny how kids don’t like vegetables, but will see them in concert?  Is Korn a vegetable….LOL?
I hope they have a good time.  If any Korn fans read this, tell me a little bit about Korn.  I have no clue.  I am just a middle-aged Mom with twin 15 year old daughters who dig Korn.

Lisa Beamer on Good Morning America- If you remember, she’s the wife of Todd Beamer who said ‘Let’s Roll!’ and helped take down the 911 plane that was heading for Washington D.C. She said it’s the little things that she misses most about Todd, such as hearing the garage door open as he came home, and her children running to meet him. She’s now the Mom of a beautiful little girl, Mary.
Lisa recalled this story:
I had a very special teacher in high school many years ago whose husband died suddenly of a heart attack. About a week after his death, she shared some of her insight with a classroom of students. As the late afternoon sunlight came streaming in through the classroom windows and the class was nearly over, she moved a few things aside on the edge of her desk and sat down there. With a gentle look of reflection on her face, she paused and said, Class is over, I would like to share with all
of you, a thought that is unrelated to class, but which I feel is very important.
Each of us is put here on earth to learn, share, love, appreciate and give of ourselves. None of us knows when this fantastic experience will end. It can be taken away at any moment. Perhaps this is the powers way of telling us that we must make the most out of every single day.
Her eyes, beginning to water, she went on, So I would like you all to make me a promise. From now on, on your way to school, or on your way home, find something beautiful to notice. It doesn’t have to be something you see, it could be a scent, perhaps of freshly baked bread
wafting out of someone’s house, or it could be the sound of the breeze slightly rustling the leaves in the trees, or the way the morning light catches one autumn leaf as it falls gently to the ground. Please look for these things, and cherish them. For, although it may sound trite to some, these things are the “stuff” of life. The little things we are put here on earth to enjoy. The things we often take for granted. We must make it important to notice them, for at anytime…it can all be taken away.
The class was completely quiet. We all picked up our books and filed out of the room silently. That afternoon, I noticed more things on my way home from school than I had that whole semester.
Every once in a while, I think of that teacher and remember what an impression she made on all of us, and I try to appreciate all of those things that sometimes we all overlook.
Take notice of something special you see on your lunch hour today. Go barefoot. Or walk on the beach at sunset. Stop off on the way home tonight to get a double dip ice cream cone. For as we get older, it is not the things we did that we often regret, but the things we didn’t do.
If you like this, please pass it on to a friend, if not just delete it and go on with your life!
Life is not measured by the number of breaths we take, but by the moments that take our breath away.”
Note:  I received this via email and thought it was worth sharing.  Enjoy your day and DO take NOTE of something special today.

Well, my friend got married on Thursday afternoon.  I was the ring bearer…lol!  Actually, I was responsible for holding the ring case and giving them the rings when the time was right.  We went to the courthouse after work – me, my friend, his future wife, and 2 co-workers.  It was very emotional because we were all so happy for them.  They were high school sweethearts 27 years ago…attended 3 proms together.  This is the 3rd marriage for each and I feel this is the right choice for each of them.  They seem to be true soul mates.  After the ceremony – we all went downtown to have dinner at Phantom Canyon.  It was nice.
The Judge that married them told us an interesting story.  He said he married a couple once and when it was time to exchange rings – each of them stuck out their tongues and placed their rings into their tongues – they had their tongues pierced!  Now, that is interesting!
Well, the Memory Walk is scheduled for 2 weeks from today.  I believe we are calling it Strolling With Our Angels.  I am not sure about the name.  The newspaper wants to interview some bereaved parents for a story b4 the walk.  I think this is a good idea and maybe we will have a large turnout of walkers.
I received a card from the James Van Praagh show on Friday – September 27.  They sent me my pictures back with a note, “Thanks, Patty.  I have scanned in the pictures and submitted your story.”  So I am waiting patiently for the next turn of events.  A friend has been taping the shows for me and I have 3 tapes now!  I just have to find the time to watch the tapes!

You will never guess who stopped by on Sunday afternoon…Big Jake!  He came into town for the long 3 day weekend and decided to drop in for a visit.  It was so nice.  Renee called out to me and said, “Jake’s here!”  I was so surprised!  We had a nice visit for about an hour and 30 minutes.
He seems to be enjoying college life and his independence being out on his own.  He is sure a very responsible young boy for 18.  He said he will be back for Thanksgiving and Christmas and plans to stop in again.  
Today I did an interview with our local newspaper – The Gazette.  They wanted to talk to some parents who have lost children to do a story b4 our walk on October 24.  I was asked a stupid question…”How does it feels 2 years after losing Jake?”  I should have said, “Who’s Jake?” so he would think I moved on, right?  LOL.  Well, I hope the story brings alot of walkers to our Walk.
I had to cut this guy some slack because he said he has 2 children and could not imagine losing either of them.  So, I am sure he had a hard time doing the interview.  Who knows when the story will run…sometime b4 October 26..I hope!
Deja Vu – where have you been?  No emails…..please check in sometime.

..was the sign on the truck in front of me yesterday.
Jake’s favorite muffin was Lemon Poppyseed.  I used to buy them at the bakery at Albertsons.  Jake would wake up early in the morning and feast on one of those muffins before he took off for school.  He loved them as snacks, too.
I wonder if they have lemon poppyseed muffins in Heaven…?

I sure hope this story about the walk draws a large crowd for us on October 26.
I also told the writer that did the interview how much journaling has helped me through this journey.  Thanks to all of you and to 1958Mouser for suggesting it!

Yesterday I met the photographer at Jake’s Memorial Garden on his former school stomping grounds.  I brought the large beautifully sketched picture of him that Big Jake gave to me in the summer.  I just wanted the photographer to see Jake and connect with me and my great loss.  He chose to use Jake’s picture!  He asked me to sit in Jake’s Garden and hold my son’s picture.  Of course, I would do anything for Jake…so into the garden I went and crouched down holding Jake’s picture in my hands.  Of course the garden is becoming dormant with the drought and arrival of Fall – but it meant alot to me that the photographer came out to visit Jake’s school garden.
I asked him to take a picture of Jake’s plaque set in granite in front of his garden, too.  He said he already did because he arrived early enough to check the garden out prior to my arrival.  So – the story will be the paper soon.  I will share the link with you when it happens.
I miss you, Jake and I hope this story will bring people out to walk with us on Ocotober 26, 2002.

338,https://www.opendiary.com/m/j8xmom/great-book-4-5368245/,2002-10-17,Great Book!,"
I am reading a book by Dr. Phillip C. McGraw.  He is also known as Dr. Phil on the Oprah Show.  He has his own show now.
The name of the book is “Self Matters”.  This is such an interesting and ez to read book.  Basically he discusses the two types of people we are:  The Authentic Self and the Fictional Self.  Are you really who you are or are you what external factors have made you?  I have read the almost 2 chapters so far and it is a phenomenal book.  I just took the first “hands-on” test and have discovered that I am living a fictional life and am afraid of the responsibility of change.  Boy! He has me pegged!  My true authentic self would be a schoolteacher – not a defense contractor.  I have known this for some time.
Anyway, he talks about how you can damage your health by not living your authentic self.  
This is an excerpt from his book…..
“I wonder how many obituaries in the newspaper should actually read something like:  Jackson, Robert.  Mr. Robert Jackson died yesterday of complications from doing a lifetime of crap that he didn’t really want to do.  His condition was further complicated because he  also failed to do much, if any, of what he did want to do.  Experts report that he died from cramming someone else’s idea of life into his body, his brain, and his life.  Attempts by Mr. Jackson to fill the voids with work, cars, excessive eating, alcohol, three wives, two thousand rounds of golf, and meeting everyone else’s expectancies but his own, were dismally unsuccessful. Unfortunately, this all took so much out of Mr. Jackson that he was just worn flat out and died about twenty years too soon.  Miserable in his last years, he passed unpeacefully yesterday at his home.  He was surrounded by colleagues from the job he hated, and family members who were all just as miserable as he was…”
You should go to the library today or tomorrow and check out this new book!  I am going to buy my own personal copy so I can highlight points I want to remember!  He says in a year you will be a changed person after reading his book and taking charge of your life today!
He sure empowered me with just the first 45 pages of his book!

I am off to see the Air Force Falcons play Notre Dame.  This is supposed to be a GREAT GAME!  I bought tickets from a co-worker that has season tickets.  He couldn’t go because kick-off is at 8pm and it is too late for him and his Mom to be out.  They live like 45  minutes from the Springs.  So I bought his tickets and I am going with Jake’s big brother, Joe.  I will probably freeze my buns off, but I am sure I will have something to write about tomorrow!
This game will be televised on national television on ESPN.  They are expecting a big crowd of people.  So big that they are bringing in extra seats!  We have great seats!  Of course, Jake has the best seat with the best view….

Well the game was exciting and we had great seats at the 25 yard line.  It was a fun game.  Notre Dame is a good team!  It was 38 degrees last night but the excitement kept me warm!
I had visit from Jake at the game.  On the scoreboard, the Air Force Academy showed a brief clip from a Jim Cary movie – I did not catch the title – something with “Nature” in it.  Jim Carey was Jake’s favorite actor.  Jake could even imitate him!  As I looked at the brief clip, I thought of Jake.  Then I looked into the clear dark skies and smiled.
I miss you, Jake.  YOU should have been sitting with your brother at this game; somehow I felt you were with us.
Today I am going to walk the 3 mile route at the cemetery.  I am going to take my map for the Memory Walk and check it out.
Have a great Sunday afternoon.  I am off to the library today, too.
Yesterday, my son and I spent a hour teaching the twins to drive.  OMG!  At a few moments, I felt I was headed to see Jake!  Any tips for teaching teenagers to drive would be GREATLY appreciated!  Email them to me at minus1son@aol.com

341,https://www.opendiary.com/m/j8xmom/halloween-656-5368248/,2002-10-19,Halloween,"
I am not looking forward to Halloween.  I think it is because Jake loved Halloween so much.  The week b4 his accident he made a comment about buying a pumpkin, but he knew September was too early to buy one.  Right after this conversation, we lost him in a tragic gocart accident.  His accident was on September 24 and his funeral was on September 28.  Then the first holiday without him arrived – Halloween.  It was not good for me.  Then Christmas came without him…as well as New Years, Valentines Day, his birthday in May, Mothers Day, Fathers Day….(sigh).  I cannot believe it is now the start of the 3rd year of events without Jake.  I just don’t do well somedays and today is one of those days.  
It is Fall and the leaves are changing.  Pumpkins are everywhere.  Kids are talking about what they are going to dress up like on Halloween.  I listen to them all and my heart is so empty without Jake.  I told my girls that I think I will go see a movie after work on Halloween.  I told them it was too hard to face another Halloween.  I asked them to gather with friends at another house where a parent is present.  I cannot host a bunch of teenagers and celebrate with them this year.  Do you think I am asking too much….I don’t.

342,https://www.opendiary.com/m/j8xmom/lost-in-evergreen-5368249/,2002-10-21,Lost in Evergreen,"
Sounds like a book or a movie, huh?  Well, actually it is neither; it is a cemetery.
I decided to stop by the cemetery on Sunday afternoon after volunteering at the library.  I thought I would walk the 3 mile route that we have planned for our Memory Walk on Saturday.
Well, everything was going fine for about 15 minutes then I got lost.  Imagine that…lost in cemetery! 
Well, Evergreen is a LARGE cemetery!  I didn’t get too worried because I had my map and I knew where to find my little boy Jake.  So I decided to cruise around by foot and study what was surrounding me.  I found the “pioneer” section where all our founders of Colorado Springs are residing.  I also found an area just for “Priests” – I am surprised that place isn’t overflowig with all the sex scandals we hear about in the paper!  I also found a beautiful statue of the Virgin Mary.  She was standing in a section just for Catholics!
So as I wandered around totally lost – it was quite an adventure.  I stopped to visit Jake.  Seeing his grave is so hard.  I sometimes think he is still away and will be home soon….maybe for Christmas..but his grave brought reality to the forefront and nearly knocked me off my feet.  I miss him…so much….why do 9 year old little boys die?  I still do not understand.  I always think of the teenager that hit him while he was driving his gocart that beautiful Sunday afternoon.  I hope he never 4gets what happened on September 24, 2000; we will never 4get…..
Have a nice Tuesday.  I will be okay; it is just so hard without Jake…not today…everyday.

I watched a sad show last night.  I cannot recall the title of the movie, but it was based on a book, “Shades of Gray.”  I missed portions of the movie, but it seemed to be about the death of a little boy – he had a twin sister, too.  The Mom kept seeing this little boy appear and she could hold him and hug him…like he was really there!  He kept wanting her to go with him.  I wish Jake would appear and I could touch his beautiful thick red hair and hug him again.  I wish I could hear his voice and his laughter.  I wish…I wish….

(excerpt)
CAREER OR FAMILY?
EVERY moment in life, we are faced with a choice. Which should command our preference — the demands of our job or the duties to our family?
IF there is a board meeting today at the same hours that our son graduates from school, where should we go –to the boardroom or to the graduation ceremony?
IF we have to make a very important presentation tomorrow, so as to advance our career, but our wife says she has to see the doctor on a suspicion of cancer, which appointment should we keep?
THESE are the daily battles of conscience we have to wage, trying to keep a balance between our responsibility to earn a living and our opportunity to
live a life. And our choices invariably reveal who we really are.
OUR preferences indicate our true character. Our priorities are the best indicators of our real identity. What profits success? I know that many of you out there would go for career on the pretension that after all, you are doing all these for the family.
MANY of us, would rather become outstanding employees, model personnel instead of being doting fathers or loving husbands.
MANY of you would opt to perform exceedingly well in the office even if you work 12 to 16 hours a day, going home only to change clothes or catch a few
hours of sleep.
BUT what for? At the end of the day, what have you accomplished? What profits a highly successful professional or wealthy businessman if
ultimately, he loses his family, wrecks his marriage or dishonors the name he will leave to his children?
WHAT has a rich man accomplished if he has built a fortune and founded conglomerates of highly profitable companies and yet drives his own wife to vices or infidelity, his children to drugs and delinquency and himself to spiritual decay and total burnout?
WHAT matters most? Look around you. The evidence is overwhelming and irreversible. Families are shattered. Marriages are broken. Lives are reduced to utter emptiness.
EVEN as man advances in wealth and success, he deteriorates on the basic standards of joy, peace and serenity. As we all compete and struggle for power and possessions, we often neglect what really matters most. In our insatiable mania for supremacy over the rest, we often forget the most important things in life.
I WILL respect your choice. But as for me, my priorities are clear. Between career and family, I will always go for family. I can forego that board meeting
and earn the ire of my boss or make a bad impression on my peers. But I shall not inflict a lifetime trauma on my son by sending him alone to graduate  without
his dad. I can forget that business presentation and lose a valued client or waste a career promotion, but I cannot leave my wife alone in her moments of
anxiety.
–Note:  This email has special meaning for me.  I had to make a choice between work and Jake when he was in 2nd grade and my boss was very uncooperative.  I did follow my instincts and chose to go part-time at work to tutur Jake more at home with schoolwork.  Jake became a success in school because I chose family over work.  I will write an entry about this and how my old boss showed up at Jake’s funeral and finally realized how important family really was to me….and now to him.

We had a nice crowd for the walk yesterday afternoon.  The weather was beautiful, too.  The autumn leaves were sprinkled throughout the cememtery with a nice breeze to give them life.
I think the story in the paper brought the crowd.  We had about 50+ people!  We made $300+ in donations and $180 in t-shirt sales.  
I sensed some healing as I walked with the people.  Of course, several people split off from the marked paths to visit with their loved ones buried in the cemetery.  Jake’s best friend’s Mom came out, too.  Her youngest son is now 9 – the age that Jake was when he left us.  He wanted to visit Jake – so we went to spend some time with Jake.  It was a bittersweet moment as “D” looked at Jake’s picture on his memorial.  He became quiet.  I really think kids hurt as much as adults, if not more, when a little friend leaves this world.  “D” reminded me so much of Jake as I observed his curiosity in the cemetery. I miss Jake.
Jake’s best friend was not able to join us.  He had other activities planned.  His Mom said he really wanted to come.  So we plan to go back and stroll through the cemetery real soon with all her kids…and remember the fun times we all experienced with Jake.
We are planning to have this walk next September in another large cemetery.  I think this is a good thing for all of us who have lost not only children but other loved ones. 
Our local chapter of The Compassionate Friends is planning to host our own mini-conference.  It will be a one day conference on a Saturday sometime in the Springtime.  I am excited about this because I really know how much this group has helped me and I think we can help others.  I plan to lead the session on journaling.  So I plan to talk about all of you in OD land again, so if your ears start burning in the Springtime, you can blame it on Jake and me.
Next year, the National Conference will be held in Atlanta, Ga.  I have no clue how I am going to survive a short 2 mile walk in that humidity and heat.  I know it is a win-win situation though – worst case scenario is that I will not survive and will soon see my little boy again.  I guess if that happens – my diary will be deleted because it not have another entry within 30 days.  I hope you will remember us….IF that happens.
Have a great Sunday!  Remember – we are 1 hour behind today – so fix your clocks.  If you live in a state that switches to Daylight Savings Time – you were supposed to set you clocks back one hour last night.

Tonite a co-worker and I went to dinner.  I have found this great fast food Japanese place.  We went and ordered teriyaki chicken plates.  We had a nice time visiting.  
As we were talking and eating, a little boy about 2 years old (the owner’s son) came cruising by our table on the floor with toy dinosaurs in each hand.  So I started a conversation with him.  I asked him about his dinosaurs – so he brought me his collection:  Tyranosaurus Rex, Triceratops, and Brontasaurus.  We had a tabletop dinosaur fight.  It was fun.  He actually joined us at our table!  His Mom came out and laughed and said he could be mine! He definitely made himself at home sitting across from me. If she only knew how much I missed my little boy.
I think I am going to stop by sometime and bring him a book about dinosaurs ….in memory of Jake.

I actually felt skinny!  I will fill you in on how it goes.  They made me weigh in – they didn’t want to use the weight on my driver’s license….lol.
Membership, starter kit, and cost of first meeting was over $45!  A lady told me I was going to have a lot of fun here…lol.  At least I have a friend to go with.
I heard some inspiring stories, too!  Stay tuned to hear more – at least once a week.

Tonight I took my girls and met my oldest son at that Japanese place for dinner.  We had a great time.  His wife could not join us because of other plans so I missed having her.
After dinner we just sat and visited and laughed alot.  I had told my kids about my dinosaur buddy.  I didn’t seem him when we came in.  As we we were talking, the back door opened and a sleepy-eyed toddler came traipsing thru the eating area.  My girls smiled really big and told me to turn around.  He was sooooo sleepy!  He walked past our table and I said, “Hey! Where are your dinosaurs?”  I did not get any response.  He walked by the second time and I asked him again.  He then ran to the back room and re-appeared at my table with 3 dinosaurs – a new one – “baby seratops” is what he called him.  It is a baby triceratops.  My daughter Renee hoisted him into her lap and we proceeded to play our dinosaur game again.  I really enjoy that little guy.  Then his mother came out and was surprised to find her little tyke “being a part of our family”.  I introduced all my kids.  She asked me how many children I have and that question made my heart stop beating.  I looked at all my kids and said, “I have four.”  I told her Jake would have been 11.  I told her my son’s wife missed out because of other plans.  We all visited for a few minutes.  I learned my little dinosaur friend’s name is Andy.  As we left the restaurant, I told Andy I would be back soon to eat and play dinosaurs with him.
Andy sure is fun, but he will never replace Jake.  I hope you know that, Jake…(as tears roll down my cheeks)
…goodnight ODland.

This is a GREAT movie!  Just thinking about it makes me laugh all over again.
The girls enjoyed trick-or-treating with their brother, Carter.  He seemed to have had a nice time.  His Mom wants to see the movie!  She asked if I would see it again and go with her.  I said, “Sure! Plan it and we will go.”
YOU HAVE TO CHECK OUT THIS MOVIE!

It is cold and snowy out tonite.  My girls are visiting with their older brother tonite.  They are watching movies and hanging out with Joe and his wife tonite.  I am all alone.  
I thought I would jot an entry and then I am going to settle into bed (it is only 8:30pm!) and read some more of my Dr. Phil book.
I talked with Jake’s school about doing something in memory of Jake.  I was bummed to find out they did not need computers.  Imagine that!  The principal suggested books for the library.  I am supposed to meet with the principal and Jake’s former teachers to discuss ideas sometime this month.  His teacher asked me and girls to stop by the school one evening and we could chat and catch up on stuff.  I am looking forward to seeing her.

Okay – so I have been a bit remiss in my writing.  I am sorry, but I cannot find anything to write about.
After my first week at Weight Watchers, I lost 0.0 lbs…LOL…BUT the positive note is I DID NOT GAIN weight!  My buddy lost 0.6 lbs so she is ahead of me!  It is fun to go to the meetings and learn new things.  Plus – my dinosaur friend is next door at his Mom’s restaurant.  After our meeting last week, my friend and I went next door to have some hot tea and visit.  My dinosaur friend, Andy, came out to play!
This weekend my daughters and I went shopping.  We shopped at Kohls.  I really never spent much time in that store.  It is located across from where Jake had his accident.  Anyway, it was a great sale this weekend – 40 and 60% off!  Sure makes buying clothes for twin teenagers less painful on the checkbook.
We also stopped by this place called Repeat Performance.  It is an interesting place, full of old clothes from the past!  I was looking for stuff to wear to my company’s 50s XMAS party.  I found a red poodle skirt, poodle button up sweater, red and white saddle oxfords, and a scarf.  To rent this stuff was only $19.99, but the deposit to pick it up on Dec. 6 is $85!  This deposit is to ensure that I bring this stuff back…lol…like I could wear it to Church on Sunday…lol.
My girls are going to the party with me.  They tried on some 50s prom dresses, but decided they would be creative and make their own outfits by pulling stuff together out of their closets…like capri pants, rolled up bluejeans, tennis shoes,…etc.  I think we are going to have fun.  I am going to get my hair done, too…50s ish.
We plan to get a room at the Wyndam Hotel, too.  We will stay the night and check out the next day.  I think we are going to have fun together as a family.  I tried to get my older son and his wife to join us, but they declined.
Renee and I saw a really dumb movie (or at least it was beyond our comprehension)on Saturday night:  The Truth About Charlie.  Go see it and tell me what it is supposed to be about; we just didn’t get it!
Today I spent the morning with my girls.  I volunteered at the library in the afternoon.  Plus I spent some time at the office to catch up on stuff and make up some time I missed last week with orthodontist appts and dr appts with the kids.
Yesterday, I found a golf ball by the van.  I think Jake dropped in.  I picked it up and it now resides in the van.
In case you are wondering why my daughter Becky did not go to the movies….she spent the evening with a girlfriend.  NO! I don’t play favorites…sometimes I think I would like to…lol.

My girls love the zesty steak and chicken rice bowls that Taco Bell sells.  Tonite I decided I would cook them home-made rice bowls!  It was a great success!  They loved them.  I know Jake would have loved this dish, too.
I thought I would share it.
1 can refried beans heated in saucepan..set aside
1 box Mexican rice (rice-a-ronie or whatever)- follow directions on box…set aside
1 lb stir fry steak strips…cook and season with salt and pepper in skillet…cook long enough to kill any ecoli lurking within
1 chopped tomato..set aside
1 chopped green onion (scallion)…set aside
Sour cream
Pace Picante Sauce (medium or hot)
When you have cooked all your stuff and set it aside…get a casserole dish and line the bottom with the refried beans….add the rice on top….spoon a few dollups of sour cream on the rice…sprinkle the tomatoes and onions on top…add the steak strips last (be sure they are cut into bite-size pieces)..season with picante sauce.
You know how you can tell this recipe is a a keeper?  There are no leftovers!  This is cheaper than going out to Taco Bell and makes the kitchen smell great!

Well, my teenagers enjoyed the KORN concert.  I think it was 3 bands – KORN, Trust Company, and Disturbed.  Interesting names, huh?
Tomorrow they are leaving to visit their Dad for Thanksgiving in Georgia.  The last 2 weeks here have been rough.  One is skipping school and struggling to get her grades at Cs or better.  The other is in Honors classes.
I went to the school yesterday to get my PIN and PASSWORD to access my students’ information.  Wow – what a treasure full of information.  The Attendance page shot me through the ceiling!  They come and go to school as they please.  Well, I set some hard core ground rules to be in place when they come back from Thanksgiving.  Since I have access to the attendance records, I told them if they are tardy or absent without an excuse – their privileges are cancelled every weekend.  This includes Starbucks in the morning once a week.  I told them they could smell the fresh aroma of my White  Chocolate Mocha and that should be enough to keep them in class on time.
Also, I got into a tif with one of the pseudo-counselors at school.  I called her Thursday to get my kids grades faxed to me and she was major RUDE and suggested I come into the school for PIN and PASSWORD for access to this info.  I went into her office at 7:15 am and told her who I was and how RUDE she is.  Of course I said it nicely,..”from one professional to another professional, I think you would have more concerned parents here if they did not have rude people like you to work with.”  That was that conversation.  She looked like a Queen Bee in her throne!  I am sorry, but I cannot tolerate unprofessional people in the school system.  I want my kids to do well in school so they don’t have to have a mindless job like that lady!  I think she is just a Mom with no extended education; she sure made me tense.  Now, I will not have to deal with her ANYMORE!  She reminds me of a person who…when God was giving out brains, she thought he said rain and she ran for shelter!

I spent Thanksgiving with my oldest son and his wife.  My girls left for Georgia on Sunday to meet up with their Dad who they have not seen since July.  It has been quiet and peaceful at home.  Life with those teenagers has been quite stressful.  I will have to write an entry about what I discovered when I was given PIN numbers and passwords to access their school grades and other stuff…like attendance.  You can only imagine!
Thanksgiving was nice.  My son’s wife created a delicious feast.  She is such a wonderful cook.  She has enjoyed cooking since they started dating when she was 17.  She cooks from scratch!  
I brought a side dish – my son’s favorite green beans.  We took a leisurely walk after eating – returned for dessert and coffee and some nice conversation then watched E.T. – the 2002 version on his 61 inch big screen.
It was a nice afternoon and evening with son and wife.
I am supposed to hook up with an OD friend tomorrow night for Starbucks and bowling – 1958mouser/Bird of Paradise.

Friday I enjoyed checking out the shops in Old Colorado City.  I found 2 festive handpainted hurricane lamps to bring home.  I have so many PartyLight candles that I knew these lamps would be used right away.  I found a place for them in my family room and enjoyed them as I built a nice fire in the wood burning fireplace.  I love the smell of a nice wood fire in the house.
I also found some stocking stuffers for the girls.  I can’t say much because they made read this OD…you know what I mean…let’s just say they had a great sale on charcoal….lol.
I also hooked up with 1958Mouser/Bird of Paradise for a couple games at the bowling alley.  We had fun.  I will let her tell you about her high game.  Then we mosied on over to Starbucks for some coffee and lemon cake – no cake for me!  I have just earned my bookmark for losing my first 5 lbs at Weight Watchers.  I actually walked over to the meeting this morning (Saturday).  It is about a 35 minute walk – 1 way.  I stayed for the meeting and walked home!  I think I earned at least 2 “activity” points for my walking.  I WAS COLD on the way over there at 7:45am, but it warmed up as I walked home after 9:30am.
I went window shopping with my son and his wife this afternoon.  We went to the mall, Walmart, AND to pick out my Christmas tree!  Joe picked out a beauty.  He brought it into the house and it looks just wonderful in the corner of the family room.  I cannot decide whether to decorate it tonite or to wait until my girls come home tomorrow.  
This is my 3rd Christmas without my little boy.  I sure miss him and often wonder if anybody else feels the “hole” in our family.  Nobody really talks about him.  I bring up his name often.  
I wonder if it is normal to still keep thinking that Jake will be home for Christmas this year because he missed the last 2.  All I know is that I miss him and he will always be a big part of my life and heart.
Now, I have made my eyes cry…but it is okay….I cry because I miss Jake and I will never stop missing him.  So…I guess I will keep crying ……

Well – it has been awhile since I wrote.  On Friday – Dec. 6 – our company had its annual XMAS party.  It was a 50s theme.  I was quite the decked out attendee.  I rented my outfit from a place called Repeat Performance.  This place is the place to find vintage clothing.  I had a nice red poodle skirt with a white poodle on it, a cream button up sweater with a white poodle on it, and matching red and white saddle oxfords!  I had my hair done in the “big hair” look – complete with silver glitter to give it that Christmas appeal!  I was told I had the “best hair”!  
I booked a couple rooms for myself and my daughters.  I thought it would be nice to stay and with a great corporate rate of $45/room at the Wyndam – I could not pass up this deal!  One of my daughters came with a friend.  One daughter stayed behind because she was grounded for skipping school and telling a few “untruths”…if you get my drift.
There was a live band and a real Native American Indian.  The Indian led us in the Friendship Dance.  I bought his CD.  It is very relaxing flute music.
My latest adventure started Saturday – Dec. 7.  I decided to paint my bedroom…..cranberry!  I started it on Sunday and I have just finished the second and final coat of paint tonite.  Painting a dark color over white is a chore.  I decided to make my room my “special place” by personalizing it and redecorating a little.  I am getting rid of my large dresser and hutch and will replace it with something smaller…like a 5 drawer dresser in the corner.  This frees of 5 feet of wall space!  This wall space will be become my picture wall of my children.  I plan to put a rocker in the corner and have a quiet place to read.  Maybe I can finish my Dr. Phil book when this room is put back together.
I think my next project will be to paint the computer/spare bedroom.  I think Emerald Green will be a soothing color.  Jake’s favorite color is green.  I will always think of him as I sit in the Emerald room.  You know a green room is not required to think of Jake.  I think of him everyday and still wonder if it is true that he will be missing another Christmas with us…(sigh).  I will hang some of his art work in the Emerald room.  I have his handprints in plaster; the hospital made them and sent them to me via a friend a day or so after his accident.  Maybe I can somehow attach a hanger on the back and hang these special prints by the computer.  The prints are both of his right hand.  I guess one was for his Dad, but his Dad has been so aloof and into his new life far away…that I will keep them both.  Afterall, Jake lived with me his entire 9 years, 4 months, and 10 days.  I miss him.  I don’t think I have ever hurt this much in my life.  I used to think geometry was the hardest thing in my life until I lost my little boy.  In geometry you have to explain angles with proofs and some steps are “given”.  Losing a child was never a “given” in my life until September 24, 2000.  It was so “out of sequence” to lose Jake and it seems so out of sequence to keep on living without him.  Life.  I don’t understand it sometimes.  Life.  What is it all about anyway?

I finished painting my room.  Wow – what a chore!  I just shampooed the carpet and will move my bed back in there tomorrow night.  It will be nice to have my bed back.  Sleeping on a full-size futon is okay, but I am too old for that.  I need my own space back.
Today I got an email from Japan.  They are looking for a preschool teacher.  It would be the adventure of a life time, but I am too restricted right now for any adventure.  If the girls were 18 and on their own – college or living on their own – I think I would jump on this opportunity.  I have at least 2.5 years left with my girls at home.
Not much else going on here.  My house is a mess with everything strewn about because my bedroom was taken apart.  I will be glad when it is put together again.
Friday night I am attending a holiday party.  It is with my library friends.  The boss over the department where I volunteer is having her people and volunteers over Friday night for a social gathering.  I am looking forward to it.  
Tomorrow I am a year older and experience another birthday without my little boy.  I miss him so much.
My girls could not wait to surprise me tomorrow so they made me open their presents last night.  Becky gave me some nice lotions from Victoria Secret – – like I am interested in impressing some man…lol.  Renee gave me a Zen Garden.  It is really cool.  I had a nice time with my girls last night.
Renee is having a hard time with Christmas this year.  She says it is not fun anymore without Jake.  Imagine that…I felt that way since Christmas 2000.  Renee loved to fill the stockings with Santa surprises.  She especially loved surprising her little brother.  I don’t know what to do.  Maybe I will give each of the girls $ to fill each others stockings with surprises.  Maybe I should stuff a special surprise in their stockings from Jake.  What to do, what to do…sigh.  Maybe I should tell them to do a Random Act of Kindness in memory of Jake and purchase something for one or two of Jake’s friends.  Maybe they should just buy a couple gifts and surprise an little boy in the toy department….decisions, decisions, decisions.
I am speaking at a local Church this Sunday on Organ and Tissue Donation.  This should be interesting.  I wonder what I should wear……I am speaking during the service for about 10 minutes.  That will probably be the longest 10 minutes of my life!

“MY LIFE IS MEANT TO BE LIVED”
Life is to be lived. No excuses. No reservations. No holding back.
An enchanting story about violinist Fritz Kreisler tells how he once
came across a beautiful instrument he wanted to acquire. When he
finally raised the money for the violin, he returned to buy it and
learned that it had already been sold to a collector.
He went to the new owner’s home in order to try to persuade him to
sell the violin. But the collector said it was one of his prized
possessions and he could not let it go. The disappointed Kreisler
turned to leave, but then asked a favor. “May I play the instrument
once more before it is consigned to silence?”
Permission was granted and the great musician began to play. The
violin sang out a quality of music so beautiful that the collector
himself could only listen in wonderment. “I have no right to keep that
to myself,” he said after the musician finished. “The violin is yours,
Mr. Kreisler. Take it into the world, and let people hear it.”
William Arthur Ward said, “If you believe in prayer, pray; if you
believe in serving, serve; if you believe in giving, give.” For you
and I are exquisite violins — our music is meant to be heard.
I want to live my life that way — to take it into the world and live
it fully. I’d rather burn out than rust out. I’d rather be used up
than die not having done whatever I could…wherever I would.
I’m not talking about wearing ourselves out on over-activity.
Happiness is never found in excessive busyness. But it is found in
investing our lives in others. Saying YES when asked for a hand.
Volunteering some time for a worthwhile organization. Spending an hour
with a lonely relative.
In the end, I know that my happiness will not have been
about by my ability or my inability. It will have been about my
availability. My life is meant to be lived.

Our company has a door decorating contest every Christmas.  My office mate came up with the idea of “P & M’s After Hours Cafe”.  (Patty and Melissa)  So we cut a piece of butcher block  paper to cover our door.  I drew and colored in “bricks” on the bottom half.  I hung 5 small stocking (Joe, Holly, Becky, Renee, and Jake.  Jake’s stocking has an angel pin on it.  Melissa made a Christmas tree by taking green paper from the supply room and angled it to sort of look like a tree.  We took clip art from PowerPoint and printed out ornaments on our color copier at work.  We had a co-worker take our picture with his digital camera and we cut and pasted our heads into some elf clip art – -You had to see this!
I took my kitchen cafe curtains and hung the lower half on some hooks at the top of the door.  We hung a real wreath in the office and lit some holiday scented candles.  To top it off – I put a butter braid in the oven and brought it to work to serve for breakfast to all our co-workers who stopped in!  Second place brought us a prize of $20!  First place winner used wrapping paper to cover her door.  She hung a “Happy Holidays” sign on it and taped decorative ribbon the sides.  I think we were the most creative, but it was all in fun.  We enjoyed bringing the holiday spirit to our hallway.  We were the only ones to decorate in our hallway – out of 6 offices!  Bah Humbug!
Tonight I visit the kids in the group home!
Happy Holidays!
P.S.  My girls are grounded for 2 weeks.  We have almost finished week one.  Sunday will complete week 1.  Why?  Because they came home from the movies at 2am on Sunday morning!  They were told earlier not to be out past 6:30pm.  Why so early?  Because I picked them up and their friends from a concert Friday night and took all the kids home and I didn’t get home til almost 1am!  I didn’t want to be the shuttle bus all weekend!  Plus – they did not have permission to go to the movies Saturday night!  Anyway – it has been quite the week at Jake’s house!  Grrrrr…..

From: Christian Article, (Submitted By DAVELUKSCH@aol.com)
The White Envelope
It’s just a small, white envelope stuck among the branches of our Christmas tree. No name, no identification, no inscription. It has peeked through the branches of our tree for the past 10 years or so.
It all began because my husband Mike hated Christmas- oh, not the true meaning of Christmas, but the commercial aspects of it– overspending … the frantic running around at the last minute to get a tie for Uncle Harry and the dusting powder for Grandma–the gifts given in desperation because you couldn’t think of anything else. 
Knowing he felt this way, I decided one year to bypass the usual shirts, sweaters, ties and so forth. I reached for something special just for Mike. The inspiration came in an unusual way.
Our son Kevin, who was 12 that year, was wrestling at the junior level at the school he attended; and shortly before Christmas, there was a non-league match against a team sponsored by an inner-city church, mostly black. These youngsters, dressed in sneakers so ragged that shoestrings seemed to be the only thing holding them together, presented a sharp contrast to our boys in their spiffy blue and gold uniforms and sparkling new wrestling shoes. As the match began, I was alarmed to see that the other team was wrestling without headgear, a kind of light helmet designed to protect a wrestler’s ears. It was a luxury the ragtag team obviously could not afford.
Well, we ended up walloping them. We took every weight class. And as each of their boys got up from the mat, he swaggered around in his tatters with false bravado, a kind of street pride that couldn’t acknowledge defeat. Mike, seated beside me, shook his head sadly, I wish just one of them could have won,” he said. “They have a lot of potential, but losing like this could take the heart right out of them.”
Mike loved kids — all kids — and he knew them, having coached little league football, baseball and lacrosse. That’s when the idea for his present came. That afternoon, I went to a local sporting goods store and bought an assortment of wrestling headgear and shoes and sent them anonymously to the inner-city church. 
On Christmas Eve, I placed the envelope on the tree, the note inside telling Mike what I had done and that this was his gift from me. His smile was the brightest thing about Christmas that year and in succeeding years. 
For each Christmas, I followed the tradition — one year sending a group of mentally handicapped youngsters to a hockey game, another year a check to a pair of elderly brothers whose home had burned to the ground the week before Christmas, and on and on.
The envelope became the highlight of our Christmas. It was always the last thing opened on Christmas morning and our children, ignoring their new toys, would stand with wide-eyed anticipation as their dad lifted the envelope from the tree to reveal its contents. As the children grew, the toys gave way to more practical presents, but the envelope never lost its allure. 
The story doesn’t end there.
You see, we lost Mike last year due to dreaded cancer. When Christmas rolled around, I was still so wrapped in grief that I barely got the tree up. But Christmas Eve found me placing an envelope on the tree, and in the morning, it was joined by three more. Each of our children, unbeknownst to the others, had placed an envelope on the tree for their dad. 
The tradition has grown and someday will expand even further with our grandchildren standing around the tree with wide-eyed anticipation watching as their fathers take down the envelope.
Mike’s spirit, like the Christmas spirit will always be with us. May we all remember Jesus–who is the reason for the season, who gave us the greatest example of giving–and strive to follow his example this year.

#3 without Jake.  I made it through another Christmas.
It was a nice Christmas morning – me and the girls.  I got up early and lit all my candles and started up a nice fire in the wood burning fireplace.
I had to smile when I saw Santa came and filled my stocking and left me an assortment of surprises under the tree.  Even the reindeer left packages.  I must admit, my girls are cute when it comes to Christmas surprises.
We opened our gifts and had a nice quiet morning.  I cooked a dish for a potluck dinner.  My son and his wife came around 11:30ish and we all headed up to his in-laws for a family gathering in Woodland Park, Colorado.  It was nice and reclusive.  We had a nice feast.  There is a new baby on that side of the family and I held him til he fell asleep in my arms…for at least a couple hours.  My kids took pictures of me and the new 3 week old.  I thought it would be fun to send a picture of me and the baby to my family in GA and sign it…”a grandma at last!”…that would get the phone ringing!  I haven’t heard from anyone in GA.  It’s Christmas and they are still awkward about talking to me because of Jake…I guess.
Anyway, I surprised Renee with a gift she had finally given up on getting…a music box that plays Greensleeves.  She was really psyched.  It is a beautiful cherry wooden box with a winter scene.  I surprised Becky with her favorite sweatshirt pullover – aka a “hoodie” – an “ONeil” hoodie.  They were surprised.  For my oldest son (only son now..(sigh)) I chose a DVD – “Mr. Deeds” and for his wife 2 turtle neck sweaters (Pastel pink and blue).  Of course they had a few other small items – nothing to go into debt for the next 10 years though…lol.
I made a dish for the potluck for the family gathering and brought a butter braid for holiday cheer for later.
My visit to the kids in the group home on Saturday was a big surprise and huge success.  They talked about Jake and I let them know he was no longer with me and I could see the compassion in their eyes.  
Kids are more intuitive than adults will ever know.  I have yet to have a kid say something “inappropriate” since Jake’s accident.  I have had alot of adult remarks that were inappropriate.  I think the worse remark an adult told me was, “Thank goodness you have other kids.”  My response?  “Jake was a 100 percent loss to me – not 25 percent.”
Merry Christmas late!  I hope you had a nice Christmas and I hope you continue to enjoy the holidays.  I must get dressed and go to work.  My girls are still asleep.  I plan to work a half day and spend time with my grounded girls…lol.
By the way – check out this chick flick – Maid in Manhatten.  My daughter took me out to the movies last night for one of my Christmas presents.  The movie was nice.
Renee and I started this movie present at least 3 or 4 years ago.  It is fun and cheap.  We use our military ID and get in for $3.75 and not the standard – $7 or $8.  I always get a kiddie snack – small drink, small popcorn, and candy (NERDS).  I give the candy to Becky.
By the way – last Saturday at Weight Watchers I gained .4 lbs.  I was disappointed but I got over it quickly since it IS less than half a pound and it IS the HOLIDAYS!
"
368,https://www.opendiary.com/m/j8xmom/saturday-2950-5368278/,2002-12-27,Saturday,"
Well I went to Weight Watchers this morning..around 8ish.  I was not too motivated since I gained .4 lbs last week.  I lost 1.8 lbs this week!  Hooray!  My total weight loss is now 9 lbs!  I have discovered a nice ice-cream treat, too.  Smart Ones makes these great ice-cream sandwiches and they are only 2 pts each!  They are not cheap, but I like them.  Thank goodness the girls have their own junk food, or I could not afford to have this treat in the freezer for more than a day….LOL.  Smart Ones also makes some decent frozen dinners that I buy for my work lunches.  I pick up a few and store them in the fridge at work.
I volunteered at the library today.  Boy!  It was a madhouse there today.  They were so glad to see me!  I love that unconditional love.  I spent 3 hours there today.  My boss there gave me a nice small XMAS present.  She gave me a nice photo album, a chocolate bar that says, “Thanks for Volunteering,” and a cute pad of stickies that says, “I am changing the world one sticky at a time.”  I sure hope to have one of those cool looking golf shirts that says PPLD (Pikes Peak Library District)someday.  Anyway, I seem to be rewarded and appreciated at the library more than I ever got in my paid job.  I am 0 for 4 now – 4 years without a bonus.  I heard the rest of my team (at least 3 of the 5)got bonu$e$ this year.  I was bummed, but I got over it.  Life is too short to sweat the trivial things.  Volunteering at the library makes up for things like that in my life. Plus, I got a nice XMAS card from all my friends at the library.  It was a very thoughtful gesture.  Don’t you think? 
I am hoping to extend my volunteer work at the library to help tutor in the Literacy Center.  I would be helping adults prepare for the GED and possibly become a Reading Buddy/Homework helper for younger kids.  I hope I hear back from the Literacy coordinator soon.  I think this volunteer work will quench my thirst to become a teacher.
So my Saturday went by fast today.  Weight Watchers meeting in the morning.  A few hours cleaning house and visiting with my girls.  A quick trip to Starbucks with the girls b4 I went to the library.  3 hours at the library.  A quick top at Subway for some quick dinner.  Now…I am pooping out.
I gave my girls their bday presents early.  Renee wanted a book so I picked up “Portrait of a Killer” for her today.  I gave it to her early so she could enjoy reading it while she is on XMAS break.  Their bday is next Sunday, but school resumes next Wednesday.  Becky got a Hurley tee.  I plan to take them out to dinner with their boyfriends on their real bday.  I have to meet these guys somehow.  I will invite my older son and his wife, too.
January 5 the girls will be 16.  They asked for a car.  I couldn’t stop laughing….lol.
Have a nice evening.

I was out walking in the snow today.  I was quite colorful.  I smiled as I walked wondering what Jake would have thought if he saw me out (sigh).
I had on charcoal gray sweats with a second pair of stretch pants underneath for added warmth.  I had a long sleeved gray t-shirt under my turquoise Lands End jacket.  On my head I was wearing this black cream and lime colored snowboarder’s hat with dread locks sticking out!  My girls had actually braided some of the dread locks!  So, here I was, fashionably dressed – walking on New Years Day morning – reflecting in the snow.  As I was walking, I noticed a car slowing down and the window was half way down.  So I studied this car wondering if I looked like a thug and perhaps someone was going to do a drive by shooting…lol.  As the car approached, I looked at the driver with my snow covered face and my dread locks blowing in the wind.  It was an elderly woman stopping to offer me a ride!  She said, “Do you need a ride or are you walking for exercise?”  I smiled and told her I was walking for exercise.  She smiled and said ok.  So I said, “Thanks for the kind offer!”  I smiled and continued my 30 minute + walk and grabbed a paper from a newstand by Dennys and headed home.  It was refreshing to know that there are still kind strangers out there..somewhere.  
Happy New Year everybody!  I will write more soon.  I think I will throw some wood into the fireplace and create a cozy family experience with my girls this morning.  I have soup slow-cooking on the stove and cheese bread in the oven.  I rented a chick flick that I think they may like – Serendipity.  I have not seen it either.  Hope it is good.  Off to gather wood outside……

I received this in an email and thought it was worth sharing.
LIFE ADVICE FROM GEORGE CARLIN
One day this advice on how to stay young, attributed to George Carlin floated into my inbox without any attribution:
1. Throw out nonessential numbers. This includes age, weight and height. Let the doctor worry about them. That is why you pay him/her.
2. Keep only cheerful friends. The grouches pull you down.
3. Keep learning. Learn more about the computer, crafts, gardening, whatever. Never let the brain idle. “An idle mind is the devil’s workshop.” And the devil’s name is Alzheimer’s.
4. Enjoy the simple things.
5. Laugh often, long and loud. Laugh until you gasp for breath.
6. The tears happen. Endure, grieve, and move on. The only person who is with us our entire life, is ourselves. Be ALIVE while you are alive.
7. Surround yourself with what you love, whether it’s family, pets, keepsakes, music, plants, hobbies, whatever. Your home is your refuge.
8. Cherish your health: If it is good, preserve it. If it is unstable, improve it. If it is beyond what you can improve, get help.
9. Don’t take guilt trips. Take a trip to the mall, to the next county, to a foreign country, but NOT to where the guilt is.
10. Tell the people you love that you love them, at every opportunity

Look!  I just found out about a program called Teacher Next Door.  Under this program, as a teacher, you are eligible to purchase a home for 50% of the listed price!  Another perk to teach!  I wanted to share it with you at OD because you may be a teacher wanting to purchase a home.  I can’t share it with anyone I know because the majority of my co-workers think teaching is a “low paid” job.  Check out this link:  http://www.hud.gov/offices/hsg/sfh/reo/tnd/tnd.cfm

January 5, 2003 – the twins officially turned 16!  I took them out with their friends to Zios – an Italian place with great food. They chose this place.  They seemed to have fun.  My son and his wife joined us and also a friend from my office.
They will be back in school on Wednesday.  They have been out for XMAS break.  I am kinda pooped out with all the teenagers over just about everyday.  Sometimes I wish they would hang out at their place.  But – I guess it is okay to know my girls are home with their friends.
I took the plunge into the big screen TV world.  I now have replaced my Panasonic 27 inch TV with a 57 inch HDTV wide screen Sony.  It is nice.  I don’t think the girls have given it a rest since it arrived last week!  I enjoy watching a good movie with the fireplace crackling nearby.  I also picked up a DVD player – so now we are up to date with the gadgets out there.   I am sure this will be the last TV I purchase for the rest of my life…lol.
Hope everyone is having a good start in this New Year.  Today everyone should be back to the normal routine at work since the holidays are officially over.
Tomorrow night I start my new volunteer adventure with the library.  I will start tutoring adults.  I am psyched!  Of course the next 4 Tuesday nights are dedicated to training.  I will be assigned a student after the training classes are completed.

I just started the Alternate Work Schedule (AWS) at work.  I will now work 9 hours (Mon-Thurs) and 8 hours on Friday in exchange for every other Friday “off”.  Today is my Friday off and it is nice.  The teenagers are wearing my patience these days – the twins are 16 now as of January 5th.  I think turning 16 has created an added dosage of raging hormones, disrespect, loud music…etc.  Anyway, they are at school now and I have the house to myself.  I can do anything I want today.  I am meeting a friend for lunch and then maybe I will do some shopping.
Jake had just started showing an interest in golf the summer of 2000 – b4 he left us in that tragic gocart accident.  He was only 9 and enjoyed being outside so much.  People say your loved ones see you everyday and send signs to let you know they are ok.  I think this is true.  Sunday morning – around 6ish, I was out for my morning walk.  I decided to walk in the street that morning since there is nobody out at that early hour.  So I deviated from my normal walk on the sidewalk and was walking in street.  As I was looking down, I noticed something white.  At first I thought it was a bird egg.  I crouched down and using the little light from the street pole, I picked it up.  It was a GOLF ball!  I looked at it and smiled and then looked up into the early morning sky and smiled.  Jake was with me last Sunday morning.  I kept the ball and put it in my jacket.  Now it is in my room.  This is the second golf ball I have found within the last 6 months.  I am keeping them.  I want to bring them to him when I see him again…..
At Jake’s funeral, my son Joe put a 5 iron (from Jake’s clubs) into the casket with Jake.  I put a golf ball in each of Jake’s hands.  I remember this like yesterday.  It has been 2 years, and almost 4 months since his accident.  He was only 9 years old; he was too young to leave us.  We miss him….(tears falling from my eyes).
I went to my Compassionate Friends meeting last night.  I was very quiet.  I couldn’t talk much about Jake.  I just said a couple sentences and looked at the person to my left side and said, “It’s your turn.”  It was an emotional night for me.
Have a nice weekend.

Well, it is a beautiful day in Colorado.  It is in the high 40’s and breezy.  I am off today because it is a holiday.  So I climbed out of bed, grabbed a quick bowl of oatmeal, hit the shower, got dressed and slid out the door to enjoy the day.
I enjoy these morning walks. I reflect on a lot of stuff.  I think about Jake and how he and I would walk – of course he would ride his bike or skateboard ahead of me.  Today as I was walking, I noticed someone had taken some charcoal and written, “I hate my family,” on the sidewalk about a half mile into my walk.  As I walked, I thought about this finding and wondered who had written it.  The penmanship was nice so I think it was an older child – maybe middle school or high school.  Then I thought about the recent walks I have taken with my daughter who seems so angry at the world.  
Becky is 16 and angry at her Dad for leaving the country.  She is angry at me for grounding her for skipping school and lying about it.  She is angry at her twin sister for “twin stuff”.  She is just angry. She is also having a lot of “drama” in her life with school, friends, and boyfriends.  Man!  It tires me to think of everything that she is going through.
Anyway, I once had a long conversation with her about hating her sister so much.  She never wants her sister to hang out with her and her friends.  This upsets her sister to the point of tears.  I know the girls need to have their OWN set of friends, but twins are “tight”.  I told Becky that Renee was sad because she would not include her in her social life.  She got angry and told me that Renee needed to find her own friends.  I listened and finally shared something with Becky.  I told her that her friends will always come and go in her life and that family would ALWAYS be there for her.  I thought about this discussion when I saw the writing on the side walk.  Maybe tonight I will take another walk, and write on the sidewalk, “…but remember this..family will ALWAYS be there for you” when I come to that sidewalk writing on my walk.

I wanted to take my girls out to see About Schmidt yesterday, but they did not want to see that movie.  They wanted to see something else.  Basically, all 3 of us wanted to see a different movie.  Then they called up their friends to meet them at the movies.  Well – that shot to pieces my idea of having a girls afternoon together.  I was disappointed, but I got over it.  I dropped them off at the movies.
I went to the movies by myself today!  I volunteered at the library, treated myself to lunch at Appleby’s, then went to see About Schmidt.  I really didn’t expect a crowd, but it was a full house!  The lady next to me said this movie was nominated for 2 Golden Globe Awards last night – so that explained the crowd!  Excellent movie!  You must go see it.  Jack Nickelson is awesome!
When I arrived early to get a seat – the room had a handful of people – maybe 10 at the most.  I picked a center seat in a row to myself – next thing I know – this place was packed!  It was fun.  I like to go to the movies.  I wish I had someone to go with me.

Today I met with Jake’s school again.  We are  moving forward with a couple projects to do in memory of my special little boy.  The money will be spent upgrading the preschool playground to make it safer for 3 and 4 year olds.  Also, about 8 digital cameras and a laser printer will be purchased so the teachers can take more pictures of the children in various activities.  As a Mom, I know always cherished pictures of my children and always will
I am really excited about the playground idea.  Jake loved to be outside – rain or shine!  This is a “permanent” tribute to Jake.  Cameras and printers will eventually wear out, but playground equipment can withstand wear and tear and last for several years and maybe decades.
Well, I was not able to finish this entry yesterday because OD was doing weird things!  Anyway, I have to come up with some type of tribute to Jake to go on the sign for the playground.  Thank goodness I have at least til October to write it.  Any ideas?  I want it to be original and special.  I think I may ask my daughter for ideas, too since she is a published author of a poem she wrote for Jake.

Thanks for noting my diary.  I feel your sadness in the loss of your step daughter.  If you ever want to share and cry with someone that understands – email me!
I am riding the roller coaster of grief everyday since Jake’s accident.  I think somedays, it just takes my breath away.  Listen to Josh Groban’s song “To Where You Are” and I think it will mean alot to you as it does for me…”…we’re just a breath away to where you are…” means so much.
I cannot believe you read my entire OD!  You can see how I am riding thru life with alot of ups and downs – ALOT of DOWNS.  I miss Jake so much.  You should read 1958Mouser – she lost her little boy when he was 12.  I met Mouser and if it wasn’t for her I would never have discovered this Open Diary.  This writing has helped me so much.  I think we may be hosting a 1 day workshop with our local chapter of the Compassionate Friends.  If so, I have already volunteered to lead a 90 minute discussion on journaling through grief.  
Please email me and share your story.  I will NEVER get tired of listening to those who hurt like me.
Have a peaceful weekend and take it at your own pace.
I went for a walk tonite for about an hour and remember when Jake would ride his bike ahead of me.  I was actually trying to find his bike tracks in the street light beams.  Am I crazy?  I don’t know, but I know I will never be the same since September 24, 2000.  
I was looking for some flannel sheets recently and unpacked a container of blankets, linens, and….Jake’s clothes.  I have all his clothes and the new school clothes that we bought on a shopping trip together – just the 2 of us – on September 23.  I closed my eyes and remembered how much fun we had shopping together.  I am crying again….but it’s okay because I loved him so much…..

Legally, no.  I was told that the driver had a good record until this accident.  It seems to me that this will “mark” his driving record for the rest of his life…right?
I think having to live with the fact that you took the life of a 9 year old boy is somewhat of a “sentence”.  I cannot imagine what it is like to be a 16 year old driver that took the life of a sweet little boy who was only 9 years old.  I can only tell you that as Jake’s Mom we have been “hurt” for the rest of our lives.  My oldest son lost his only brother.  My twin daughters lost their little brother.  I lost my youngest son.  I have 4 children, but losing Jake was not a 25% loss.  Losing Jake was a 100% loss.
Jake was only 9 years old when he was taken from us in that tragic gocart/auto accident.  He loved his gocart.  He had his gocart for 9 days.  He will never go to Middle School like his friends.  He will never go to High School like this friends.  He will never have the opportunity to drive a car.  He will never go to college like his friends.  He will never date and fall in love like his friends.  He will never get married and have a family like his friends.  
As Jake’s Mom, I will never be the same.  His brother and sisters will never be the same.  We miss Jake.  Like the “blink of an eye” he was gone.  He was only 9 years old when he left us.

This is awesome!  I was out on my evening walk and heard the sound of feet coming towards me.  It was already dusk and it was dark outside.  I turned my head to my right and saw a little girl running across the street to join me.  I said, “Hello.  Are you out for a walk?”  She said, “Yea.  I am walking with my friend.”  So I turn around to look for her friend and there is nobody there.  Then, she said, “I walked her home.”  I said, “Well, that was nice of you to do that.”  She smiled and continued to walk beside me.  Imagine this – I am a TOTAL stranger to this little girl.  So I ask her what school she goes to and she responds, “Keller.”  This was Jake’s school from K-3, OD readers.  So I ask her what grade she is in and she says, “4th.”  Then we talk about the different 4th grade teachers.  Then she turns and says, “Gotta go.”  She runs to her house.  
Wow – what a great sign!  I enjoyed our short walk – all 3 or so minutes.
Jake would be in 5th grade as we speak…(sigh).
Thanks for the surprise visitor, Jake!  I guess I looked safe to hang out with, huh?  I miss you, son…more than you will ever know.

I went out to breakfast today at Village Inn.  The girls had sleepover friends and the hormones were too much for me this morning.  
Can you believe I still remember the exact booth Jake and shared for breakfast one morning when he was about 5 or 6?  Yea, his babysitter took a day off and called me at 6 in the morning.  Before – I would have panicked and sought alternate childcare, but sometime b4 this incident, I decided my kids were more important than work.  So I took the day off with Jake.  The girls were in school and I think Jake had afternoon Kindergarten.  So we took a stroll (of course he rode his bike) and we ended up eating breakfast again – at Village Inn.  I will never forget how much Jake loved link sausages.
Of course, I did not sit at this booth today. I probably never will sit at that booth, but I will always look in that direction and close my eyes and remember our special breakfast that morning about 5 years ago…..he loved his sausages so much.  It is so hard to have sausages without Jake.  I had one this morning for breakfast – but it was a sausage pattie – not a link.  Things will never be the same.
I encourage all parents to spend as much time as possible with your kids.  Work will always be there.  A job can be replaced.  Time with your kids is priceless and can never be replaced.  Have breakfast with your kids this week – somewhere special – in memory of a red-headed 9 year old that loved to eat.

I made a generous donation to your school this week.  One of the projects will be to upgrade the pre-school playground and make it safer for little people – 3 and 4 year olds.  I remember how much you LOVED to be outside.  Your favorite time in school was gym and recess.  I will observe the process as it unfolds this summer and is completed on your one of your favorite days…Halloween.  I know when I see the kids yelling and having fun outside on the playground I will think of you with tears in my eyes.  I know you will enjoy looking down and seeing their happiness.
Tonite at my Tutoring Adults class we talked about journals.  I briefly mentioned this journal and why it exists – to write about you.  As the class ended tonite, one of the ladies in my class came up to me to tell me she was sorry to hear of my loss.  She asked could I tell her what happened, Jake.  I told her, Jake.  She asked about the boy driving the car.  I told her, Jake.  I told her how you have an attorney handling matters and I feel very confident things will be dealt with properly.  Whatever happens, Jake – I want you to know we will never 4get you.  Nothing will ever be the same without you, son.  The donation to the school will let others know how special you were and you always will be special, Jake.  This playground is truly a tribute to you, Jake because you loved life and lived it like a boy with endless tomorrows.  
I love you, Jake.  I miss you.  My heart aches for you.  I guess I will always have chronic heartache.  My heart is like a puzzle with a lost piece – – never to beat again like it used to…..  
Love, 
Mom

Well..he was my youngest.  I love all my kids equally and can get really tense with them equally, too.  
If I had lost my older son or one of my daughters, I am sure this OD would be written as well as it is written for Jake.

The space shuttle experienced another tragedy and several lives were lost.  This happened in January of 1986, too.  I remember it so well in 1986.  I was assigned to Lowry AFB in Denver, Colorado.  I was teaching at the space school.
Today I was sitting in my volunteer tutor class when a student next to me mentioned the space shuttle exploded.  I am sure my face was a Kodak moment.
I am sure it will be all over Sunday’s paper.  
I don’t know what to say.  The families of those shuttle crew members have lost so much.  Their lives changed 4ever today – February 1, 2003.  Let’s keep them in our prayers.

Well, I finally had a CTJ meeting with my twin 16 year old daughters.  By the way, CTJ is short for Come To Jesus.  I was finally tired of the fighting wars every night after work and just in general.  So I decided that we would have a meeting on Thursday night.  Well, Becky made me tense on Thursday night so we postphoned it til Friday night.  All I wanted to accomplish was setting some rules in the household that we could ALL live with.  My rules going into the meeting were not to fight or raise our voices.  Well, we survived our meeting.  Some of things I wanted to talk about were:
1.  Friends over on weeknights
2.  Going to visit their friends on weeknights
3.  Sleepovers
4.  Curfew
5.  Grades and attendance
6.  Respect for one another
7.  Laundry and household cleanliness
Well – here is what we agreed upon:
1.  Friends can visit one night a week but they must leave by 7pm.  No loud music and they must entertain them in the downstairs in their rooms (except for the guy friends!) or the Family Room.
2.  They can visit their friends on the weeknight but must be home by 9:30pm.  (Of course, I suggested 7pm but they argued that their friends’ parents LOVE to have them over…yea right….)
3.  Sleepovers are allowed every other weekend but they must entertain their friends at our place because I did not think it is right to take a gaggle of their friends to someone else’s house.
4.  Curfew on weeknights (school nights) is 9:30pm and on weekends it is 11pm.  This is subject to be re-evaluated if it doesn’t work out.
5.  Grades are now their problems.  I don’t care anymore if they skip school or flunk their classes.  I am tired or the headaches of discussing this issue with them so they are on their own and will deal with the consequences.  If they fail, they are responsible for rectifying the situation.  If they quit school (in Colorado you can quit school when you are 16), they can move out and deal with the “real world” or get jobs and go to night school and pay room and board.
6.  Respect for one another will be checked by thinking before speaking.
7.  Laundry days were assigned to everyone so I don’t have to nag about clothes in the washer or dryer when I need to do a load.
8.  Household cleanliness -> everyone is responsible for cleaning up after themselves.  Bottom line, it is a privilege for them to live in my home so they must respect the home.
9.  The first weekend of each month will include a family sit down dinner – to include them and their older brother and his wife.  No friends will be present for this meal.  This is a family night.
How did this weekend go?  It was crazy!  Friday night, Becky went to a movie and was supposed to be back by 11pm.  I called her and she said they went to a later movie and would not be  home til after midnight.  Then she called me at 12:30am to ask if she could sleepover at a friend’s house.  I agreed to let her sleepover.  Her sister went snowboarding.
Saturday – alot of teenagers were at my place and then Becky was invited to go snowboarding Sunday morning.  So I had to go to the ATM machine at 9:30pm to fund her snowboard trip.  Then her friends did not show up to pick her up.  I went to bed and was sound asleep and then Becky wakes me up at midnight to tell me her friends arrived and are ready to pick her up to sleepover with the snowboarding family…
Sunday, I finally catch up on some much needed sleep and sleep in til 9am.  Then my older son and his wife show up just as I am getting out of bed to invite me to breakfast.  Picture this…me with eyes that can barely open with my hair sticking straight up like a troll doll!  So, I put myself together and have a nice breakfast with the older kids…and my weekend is now coming to closure and a new work week begins…

I was cleaning out the fridge this weekend.  I saw a jar of canned home-made butter pickles on the shelf in the door of the fridge.

I don’t eat pickles; Jake loved pickles.  So, whether or not this jar of pickles has an expiration date, I will keep them in the fridge.  Jake gave me these pickles.  These are Jake’s pickles.  They will remain in the fridge for now…and 4ever…I look at this jar of pickles and I remember a beautiful red-headed, freckle faced 9 year old boy giving them to me.  I miss you, Jake…and I still don’t eat pickles.

Well, I took my girls and headed to the historic town of Leadville, Colorado this past weekend.  We left on Friday morning and returned Sunday afternoon around 4pm.  I just felt it was time to get away from our routine.
I took the girls out to Olde World Bagels and Deli for a Friday morning breakfast.  I wanted to try out the coffee there.  I saw they had Cafe White Mocha.  I wanted to compare it to Starbucks’ White Chocolate Mocha – NO COMPARISON!  Plus they put way too much cream cheese on the bagels.  Good thing I missed my Saturday morning Weight Watchers meeting – I  may have been in for a big disappointment.  Anyway, it was during this breakfast that I told the girls we were going to a historic mining town and were staying in a Bed and Breakfast.  They were excited.  I never told them where we were going all week.  I  had only told them to bring warm clothes and a swimsuit.
So we arrive in Leadville around 1:30 pm.  It is only about a 2 hour drive, but we lolly gagged after our breakfast and didn’t get on the road til almost 11am.  So we check into the Apple Blossom Inn and depart quickly to walk around town and check out the main drag.  Lots of coffee shops, but no White Chocolate Mocha!  We found a nice place for a late lunch; the La Cantina.  It was delicious.  I shot a game of pool with the girls, too.
After our lunch and stroll, we returned to our rooms.  Becky and I sat in the hot tub as snowflakes danced on our heads.  We had fun.  We talked about “boys”.  I almost felt like I was 16 again…almost.  Renee hung out in the Inn playing her guitar.  
Saturday was a surprise trip to Ski Cooper for the girls to snowboard.  They were so psyched.  After a nice breakfast at the Inn, we drive over to the slopes..15 minutes away.  The girls snowboarded and I skiied.  It was an emotional experience for me since I had taken Jake and the girls here almost 3 years ago to learn to ski.  I remembered how much fun we all had..the four of us.  I remembered how Jake would ski over to meet me at the lift drop off point and knock me down. I remembered how I tried to stay out of his way as he came sailing down the slopes.  I remembered so much and wished so much that he was with us.  I remembered how much he wanted to snowboard that day and I said, “No.  Learn to ski first, Jake.  You can snowboard next time.”  There was will never be a “next time” for Jake.  So the girls snowboarded and I skiied on Saturday.
We returned for another night at the Inn.  Becky and I sat in the hot tub again to talk about “boys.”  Renee played her guitar and read magazines in the room.
Sunday we ate breakfast and returned to the slopes.  The girls were pooped out by noon.  Thank goodness!  I was getting a bit pooped out myself.  I did meet some kids and enjoyed visiting with them.  I met 3 elementary kids and 2 were the same age as Jake would have been.  Both were in 5th grade this year..(sigh).
We arrived back home around 4pm this afternoon.  It was a weekend to remember.  I really enjoyed it.  I think I am sold on Bed and Breakfasts!  It is the most relaxing way to travel.  I may forgo the National Grief Conference in July and return to Leadville for some rest, relaxation, and reflection on life.  I enjoyed having my breakfast cooked for those couple days.  I like being away and surrounded by strangers.  I liked not having a phone or TV.  I loved the absence of loud teenage music.  I loved having my girls for a weekend away.  
The Apple Blossom Inn was once the home of the Leadville banker – Absalom V. Hunter – back in the day.  It is beautiful.  We stayed in the Dougan Suite – 2 rooms and private bath.  One room has a queen size feather bed and the adjoining room has a twin size day bed.  It was very comfortable and homey.  There were crystal chandeliers and beautiful engraved tiles around the fireplace. His office is called the “Library” and has a queensize bed and private bath.  His wife, Estelle, has a room named for her – another queensize bed and private bath.  There is also a large area – 2 bedrooms with a kitchenette – sleeps up to 9 people!  This area is called the Hunter’s Suite.  This Inn had alot of overnight guests when we were there! I really enjoyed my stay.  The girls enjoyed the fresh brownies in the afternoon, too.  I think it would be fun to run a Bed and Breakfast.  I would serve grits with breakfast!
So – this was our Valentine’s Day weekend; we spent it away from everyone.  Hope you all had a nice Valentine’s Day weekend, too.

Today I took the day off.  These teenage girls are really working me over.  I left a message at work that I would not be in.  My co-workers called and left messages on my home phone and emailed me.
I talked to one of those co-workers tonite.  I asked her why everyone was so worried.  She said, “The tone of your voice was like the message that you left when you called about Jake.”  That was almost 2 years and 5 months ago!  She remembered.
Wow!  I never knew my voice had “tones” for incidents.
I remember when I made that call to work.  It was a Sunday afternoon – after 6pm.  I called my co-worker and said, “Hey.  I will probably be in late tomorrow.  Something very sad has happened.”
Late?  Sad?  It was more than a day later and this event was life-changing and devastating.  Sad?  What was I thinking!  I left that message on September 24, 2000.  I returned to work sometime around that holiday in October – not Halloween – but the one during the second or 3rd week.  Columbus Day?
I don’t know, but sometimes I wonder how we deal with the things that we deal with everyday.  My daughters have been defiant since we returned from our nice weekend snowboarding and skiing.  It is 8:45pm and one has not been home since I dropped her off at school this morning.  I imagine she will show up at 9:30pm – the curfew we agreed upon.  If not?  Maybe another mental health day tomorrow.  Maybe I will have to take time off from work.  Maybe I will quit working.  Maybe…..maybe I will just fall asleep and wake up and Jake will be home and we can take tomorrow off together and share all the things we have missed…..maybe I will quit kidding myself….maybe…

Ok – so I am NOW a volunteer tutor with the library.  I need to get one of those t-shirts. “Stop me before I volunteer!”
My learner is trying to get her GED so I am going to help her meet that goal.  We have met twice so far.  Yesterday was an interesting meeting.  I found some review material for her to do in reading, writing, and math.  I went over each packet with her.  The math area is certainly going to be an adventure.  I was explaning fractions and could tell she was not with me.  So I told her to skip the homework on fractions because I was going to dedicate a lesson or 2 in that area.
I never knew how difficult it would be to teach someone that you cannot add 1/4 and 3/8.  I was trying to explain that you cannot add apples and oranges.  Then trying to add 6 and 3/4 plus 9 and 3/16 became another adventure.  I think this is going to be fun.
She said I have alot of patience.  My response?  “I have to be patient because I have kids!”  With teenagers you have to have patience and medication…lol.
My learner would like to see a picture of Jake.  So next week, I will introduce my little boy to her.  She lost her mother not very long ago so we have “connected” in more ways than academics.
Well, I have to head to the library to volunteer in the circulation department.
I am slowly dealing with these teenagers.  I just keep myself busy and away from the tension.
I am at 10lbs+ weight loss with WW.  I think this makes me feel successful in one area of my life.
I was at the store last night and some girls were selling Girl Scout cookies.  I told them I have bought 8 boxes and have 4 left.  I also told them they are not on my Weight Watcher’s plan…lol, but I do support the Girl Scouts!
I had an interesting opportunity present itself last week.  I got a call from a non-profit childcare center for the position of “Head Teacher”.  It sounded like an adventure.  My hours would be 6am-2pm and I would open the center every morning to greet the parents and children.  I had to decline because this position was not a certified position.  My goal is to get a certified position and get my teacher license.

1936 Olympics (orig. title)
LEARNING FROM CRAYONS
It is 1936. American Jesse Owens seems sure to win the long jump 
competition in the Olympic games. The previous year he had jumped 26 feet, 
8 1/4 inches — a record that will stand for 25 years.
As he walks to the long-jump pit, however, Owens sees a tall, blue 
eyed, blond German taking practice jumps in the 26-foot range. Owens feels 
nervous. He is acutely aware of the Nazis’ desire to prove “Aryan 
superiority.” As a black son of a share cropper, he knows what it is like 
to feel inferior.
On his first jump, Owens inadvertently leaps from several inches 
beyond the takeoff board. Rattled, he fouls on his second attempt, too. One 
more foul and he will be eliminated. At this point, the tall German 
introduces himself as Luz Long.
“You should be able to qualify with your eyes closed!” he says to Owens.
For the next few moments, the African American and the white model of 
Nazi manhood chat together. Then Long makes a suggestion. Since the 
qualifying distance is only 23 feet, 5 1/2 inches, why not make a mark 
several inches before the takeoff board and jump from there, just to play 
it safe?
Owens does and qualifies easily. In the finals, Owens sets an Olympic 
record and earns the second of four gold medals. But who is the first 
person to congratulate him? Luz Long — in full view of Adolph Hitler.
Owens never again sees Long, who is later killed in World War II.
“You could melt down all the medals and cups I have,” Owens later 
writes, “and they wouldn’t be a platting on the 24-carat friendship I felt 
for Luz Long.”
Perhaps unknowingly, Luz Long taught the world a valuable lesson. 
Someone else put it like this:
“We can learn a lot from crayons. Some are sharp ..some are 
pretty…some are dull…some have weird
names…and all are different colors. But they all have to learn to live in 
the same box.”
So do we.

394,https://www.opendiary.com/m/j8xmom/jesus-never-wasted-time-answering-critics-5368304/,2003-03-16,Jesus Never Wasted Time Answering Critics,"
“Go from the presence of a foolish man, when thou perceivest not in him the 
lips of knowledge” (Proverbs 14:7).
Critics are spectators, not players.
Critical people are usually disheartened people who have failed to 
reach a desired goal. Someone has said. “Criticism is the death gargle of a 
non-achiever.”
There has never been a monument built  to a critic.
Critical people are disappointed people. Disillusioned people. 
Unfocused people. They are hurting inside. They build their life trying to 
destroy others.
Move away from them
Don’t get me wrong. Debate is a marvelous arena. Conflict unlocks my 
energy.
But, there is a place to present facts. There is a time for exchange 
of information. Constructive suggestions are always pursued by champions.
There is also a time for silence.
When Jesus was being ridiculed and prepared for His crucifixion, he 
was silent. “But Jesus held His peace” (Matthew 26:63). Jesus did not feel 
obligated to answer critics. He never wasted time on people who were 
obviously trying to trap Him. He responded to hunger. He responded to 
thirst. He responded to seekers.
You owe nothing to a critic. “Speak not in the ears of a fool: for he 
will despise the wisdom of thy words (Proverbs 23:9).
Criticism is deadly.
Correction is life.
Criticism is pointing out your flaws.
Correction is pointing out your potential.
Many years ago, I sat down at my kitchen table to reply to a critical 
letter from a lady. I toiled over my reply. I erased words and wrote new 
sentences. It took me over one hour of exhausting work to carefully carve 
out a decent response to her letter. I still wasn’t satisfied with my 
answer to her. Suddenly, I began to laugh as a thought dawned. It hit me 
that I had never spent an entire hour writing a letter to my own mother, 
the dearest person in the world to me. I had never spent one hour writing 
to the woman who had carried me within her womb for nine months, provided 
comfort and food during my life, motivated me toward God, and to learn to 
play the piano. I had not spent that much time on the most important person 
in my life. I was a fool to spend much time on a critic.
Jesus ignored the critics.
PRAYER: Lord, I know the time I spend answering critics is time wasted. I 
ask that You give me the strength
and maturity to rise above those who are critical and invest time in those 
whom I love and care for. In Jesus’ name, amen.

Well, the weather folks are calling this snow storm the Blizzard of 2003.  I don’t think it is that bad, but I decided to stay home today.  I didn’t want to drive in it.  There are snow drifts up to my knees as I walk out my front door.  My neighbor was out shoveling his drive and sidewalk this morning at 6:30am.  I don’t understand why people do that when it is still snowing…it is like trying to wipe a baby’s face during a mud fight…and your goal is….
I am going to fix me a cup of coffee and relax this morning.  The kids have had school closed yesterday and today so they are vegging in bed.
I have been really angry, tired, and whipped lately.  I think I am falling into the pit of depression.  I am considering going back to the doctor for anti-depressants.  It has been 2 years and almost 6 months since Jake’s tragic accident; I am NOT over it and never will be over it.  Grief…the highway of ups and downs.
I have had a hunch that one of my daughters has been sneaking out at night.  I caught up to her on Saturday morning at 1:30am.  I completed a runaway report on her at the police station at 1:45am.  I was beat tired and a bit unhappy with her behavior.  It is amazing how she reappeared after I went to file the report.  Twins at work!  I am tired.  I need a vacation from motherhood.
I am leaving next week to visit my Mom in Georgia.  Unfortunately I must take the girls.

When I logged on my email at work today, I saw an email from the principal of Jake’s school.  He wrote me on Saturday.  He said the first daffodil has bloomed in Jake’s garden.  As I drove by the school this afternoon, I looked over at the garden and there it was…a single yellow daffodil.  I felt like Jake knows it is Spring in the Rockies.  I remember shortly b4 his accident..he looked out the window to see light snow falling.  He told me it was the first day of winter or Fall.  I cannot remember exactly, but it was the week that I lost him…the 3rd week in September.  I remember asking him how he knew what day it was and he told me he learned it in school.  I miss Jake and each day reminds me of how much life has changed since his tragic accident.
I found a note that his sister wrote about Jake.  She misses Jake.  She can remember his face but has forgotten how his voice and laugh sounded.  It was sad to read this.  I don’t think of these things.  I guess a Mom will always see his face, hear his voice, and hear his laughter…even if it is a memory.  He will never be 4gotten.
Jake, I miss you son and I still can’t believe you are not coming home…..We are going to Georgia tomorrow without you.  This is my 3rd trip back without you.  It is so hard and always will be .  I am taking your Granny for a road trip to Savannah.  It doesn’t seem right to take a trip without you, but I know you permanently reside in my heart..which is forever broken.  Love, Mom

Well, we are back from Georgia.  It is nice to be in the cool climate.  It was cold back there but it was a different cold – – damp cold.  I froze!  
I have alot to write about, but I am beat right now.  I am going to crawl into bed and sleep in tomorrow.
I brought back something.  I brought back Jake’s backpack and some of his clothes he left behind the summer of 2000.
More to follow later….

I had a nice time with my Mom and girls in Savannah last Thursday and Friday.  I watched the video, “Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil” with my Mom at the Bed and Breakfast.  The girls were out on a “Ghost Walk”.  It was so cool to be in town that a movie was filmed in!  Everything in the movie was surrounding us in Savannah.  I really enjoyed Savannah. I especially liked River Street.  There were all kinds of shops and places to eat and things to see.  I took my Mom and the girls on a Riverboat ride on the Savannah River.  It was nice and relaxing.  I have lots of pictures.  I made my Mom a picture book b4 I returned to Colorado.
Renee really wanted to go into Bonaventure Cemetery – the cemetery featured in the book.  We made it to the cemetery, but it closed at 5pm and we missed getting in!  I did take her picture outside the gate.  We didn’t get a chance to see the Mercer House – the house in the movie – but we saw alot and had fun.  The girls wanted to see the ocean so I drove over to Tybee Island.  It was nice, but too cool for a dip.
We stayed at the Olde Georgian Inn.  It was a nice historic place to be – but pricey!  Oh well, I don’t get to spend time with my Mom much so splurging is authorized…lol.

WHY ME?
I asked God why I wasn’t rich.
And He showed me a man with the wealth of a thousand kings, who was lonely, 
and had no one to share it with.
I asked God why I wasn’t beautiful.
And He showed me a woman more beautiful than any other, who was ugly 
because of her vanity.
I asked God why he’d allowed me to become old.
And He showed me a boy of 16, who lay dead at the scene of a car accident.
I asked God why I didn’t have a bigger house.
And He showed me a family of six, who’d just been evicted from their tiny 
shack, and were forced to live on the street.
I asked God why I had to work.
And He showed me a man who couldn’t find a decent job, because he’d never 
learned to read.
I asked God why I wasn’t more popular.
And He showed me a socialite with a thousand friends, who all left the 
moment the money and parties were no longer there.
I asked God why I wasn’t smarter.
And He showed me a natural born genius, who was serving life in prison for 
making ill use of his knowledge.
I asked God why He put up with a thankless sinner like me.
And He showed me His Bible, and His Son who took my place at the judgment. 
And I knew then how much He loved me.
What’s eating you today?
Are your problems weighing heavy on your heart?
Know, then, that you are loved.
And have a WONDERFUL day!
Then brighten someone else’s day, in any way you care to.
Remember, a candle loses nothing by lighting another candle.
Just reach out and touch someone’s life and brighten up their day.

While I was visiting with family last week, I felt the need to escape to the local library and read my book in quiet surroundings.  So I went to the library.  I was not there long b4 a little girl discovered me reading the local paper at a table by myself.  She proceeded to pull out the chair next to me and laid a book on the table and asked me to read it to her.  So I proceeded to read this book as she turned each page.  I had to ad lib a bit because she turned the pages too quickly.  When we were finished, she jumped from her chair and returned shortly with another book.  So we did it again.
Her name was Beth.  She was 4 years old.  She introduced me to her mother, too.  Her Mom did not suggest that Beth let me read the paper – she just left her with me!  Beth is cute.  She has blonde hair and darling blue eyes and is 4 years old.  
I decided to leave when she left b4 I was conducting Monday afternoon story hour.
I think this was Jake’s way of letting me know that he was with me in Georgia…sigh…..

WHAT WAS IN JEREMY’S EGG?
Jeremy was born with a twisted body, a slow mind and a chronic, 
terminal illness that had been slowly killing him all his young life. Still 
his parents had tried to give him as normal a life as possible and had sent him
to St. Theresa’s Elementary School.
At the age of 12, Jeremy was only in second grade, seemingly unable to 
learn. His teacher, Doris Miller, often became exasperated with him. He 
would squirm in his seat, drool and make grunting noises. At other times, 
he spoke clearly and distinctly, as if a spot of light had penetrated the 
darkness of his brain. Most of the time, however, Jeremy irritated his teacher.
One day, she called his parents and asked them to come to St. 
Theresa’s for a consultation. As the Forresters sat quietly in the empty 
classroom, Doris said to them, “Jeremy really belongs in a special school. 
It isn’t fair to him to be with younger children who don’t have learning 
problems. Why, there is a five-year gap between his age and that of the 
other students!”
Mrs. Forrester cried softly into a tissue while her husband spoke. 
“Miss Miller,” he said, “there is no school of that kind nearby. It would 
be a terrible shock for Jeremy if we had to take him out of this school. We 
know
he really likes it here.”
Doris sat for a long time after they left, staring at the snow outside 
the window. Its coldness seemed to seep into her soul. She wanted to 
sympathize with the Forresters. After all, their only child had a terminal 
illness. But it wasn’t fair to keep him in her class. She had 18 other 
youngsters to teach and Jeremy was a distraction. Furthermore, he would 
never learn to read or write. Why waste any more time trying?
As she pondered the situation, guilt washed over her. “Oh God,” she 
said aloud, “here I am complaining when my problems are nothing compared 
with that poor family! Please help me to be more patient with Jeremy.”
From that day on, she tried to ignore Jeremy’s noises and his blank 
stares. Then one day he limped to her desk, dragging his bad leg behind 
him. “I love you, Miss Miller,” he exclaimed loudly enough for the whole 
class to hear. The other children snickered, and Doris’s face turned red. 
She stammered, “Wh-Why, that’s very nice, Jeremy. Now please take your seat.”
Spring came, and the children talked excitedly about the coming of 
Easter. Doris told them of the story of Jesus, and then to emphasize the 
idea of new life springing forth, she gave each of the children a large 
plastic egg. “Now,” she said to them, “I want you to take this home and 
bring it back tomorrow with something inside that shows new life. Do you 
understand?”
“Yes, Miss Miller!” the children responded enthusiastically – all 
except for Jeremy. He just listened intently, his eyes never left her face. 
He did not even make his usual noises. Had he understood what she had said 
about Jesus’ death and resurrection? Did he understand the assignment? 
Perhaps she should call his parents and explain the project to them.
That evening, Doris’s kitchen sink stopped up. She called the landlord 
and waited an hour for him to come by and unclog it. After that, she still 
had to shop for groceries, iron a blouse and prepare a vocabulary test for 
the next day. She completely forgot about phoning Jeremy’s parents.
The next morning, 19 children came to school, laughing and talking as 
they placed their eggs in the large wicker basket on Miss Miller’s desk. 
After they completed their Math lesson, it was time to open the eggs. In the
first egg, Doris found a flower. “Oh yes, a flower is certainly a sign of 
new life,” she said. “When plants peek through the ground we know that 
spring is here.” A small girl in the first row waved her arms. “That’s my 
egg, Miss Miller,” she called out.
The next egg contained a plastic butterfly, which looked very real. 
Doris held it up, “We all know that a caterpillar changes and grows into a 
beautiful butterfly. Yes that is new life, too.” Little Judy smiled proudly
and said, “Miss Miller, that one is mine.”
Next, Doris found a rock with moss on it. She explained that the moss, 
too, showed life. Billy spoke up from the back of the classroom. “My Daddy 
helped me!” he beamed.
Then Doris opened the fourth egg. She gasped. The egg was empty! Surely 
it must be Jeremy’s she thought, and of course, he did not understand her 
instructions. If only she had not forgotten to phone his parents. Because 
she did not want to embarrass him, she quietly set the egg aside and 
reached for another. Suddenly Jeremy spoke up.
“Miss Miller, aren’t you going to talk about my egg?” Flustered, Doris 
replied, “but Jeremy – your egg is empty!” He looked into her eyes and said 
softly, “Yes, but Jesus’ tomb was empty too!”
Time stopped. When she could speak again, Doris asked him, “Do you 
know why the tomb was empty?” “Oh yes!” Jeremy exclaimed. “Jesus was killed 
and put in there. Then His Father raised Him up!”
The recess bell rang. While the children excitedly ran out to the 
school yard, Doris cried. The cold inside her melted completely away.
Three months later Jeremy died. Those who paid their respects at the 
mortuary were surprised to see 19 eggs on top of his casket, all of them empty.

My friend at work has a Jaguar – car.  She took me for a spin yesterday.  It was fun!
Today was my day off, but it was hectic.  My daughter is up to no good at school – ditching classes so I had an appointment with the Dean of Students this morning.  He does his job so well and can handle teens!  So she has to go to Saturday school tomorrow.  She spent all day in “in-house” detention.  They showed me the room.  It looked like a place for solitary confinement, but it was not solitary – she had company!
So anymore unexcused absences will result in “in-house detention” and Saturday schools.  If she pushes her luck past 2 unexused absences – she will be suspended for 2 days.  I plan to go to school with her if she gets suspended.  I am sure that will embarrass her.  I hope her friends don’t smoke “bud” around me.  I am definitely a non-smoker.  I can’t even drink a “Bud” – I am not a beer person either.  Anyway – so much for a relaxing morning.

Well, as a mother of 16 year old twin daughters, I am tired of nagging them about the phone.  I have told them repeatedly that I do not want any calls coming or going into the house after 9pm.  I know it doesn’t take a rocket scientist to know that they are on the phone after I go to bed.  I can tell by hearing their voices coming up through the vents in my room and by the fact they are so beat tired every morning b4 school.
I decided to go online to my phone company and see what services or products I could purchase to assist me with this non-stop phone situation.  Wow!  I found a plethora of information on their website…www.qwest.com!
As of tonite, I am an offical subscriber to “Call Curfew”.  Effective tonite there will be no incoming to or outgoing calls from my house.  Yepper.  When their friends try to call them after 10 pm they will hear..”…the number you have called cannot be connected at this time.  Please try again later.”  I was so psyched when I discovered this little phone feature I could hardly contain myself.  I would love to be a fly on the collar of my girls or their friends when they try to call my number after 10pm tonite.  I am actually going to back it down to 9pm so my girls might be in bed at a reasonable time.  Of course, I have the ability to change the times on this phone feature.  I can also load up to 20 numbers that can be received during the curfew (i.e. family members, my cell phone, my friends, etc..
Yes, it will be heavenly tonite at my house.
I think tomorrow night I will try to write an entry about a support group for parents of teens.  It started out as an email to a local community paper trying to spark some interest in this type of support group.  They emailed me back and asked if I would do a story on this!  Imagine that!  I told them we should run a “brief” in the paper first to see if there is any interest.  If there is interest, then I will agree to do a story for the paper.  The brief will be in the paper tomorrow.  The paper is called “The Slice”.  You can bet at my first meeting of Parents of Teens that I will share my discovery of Call Curfew!  Maybe we can share experiences and medication (anti-depressants, etc.), too!
I need to be reminded to write about the cat with no tail in Georgia, too.
I have a story about mud eels, too.
Also, Chicken Soup for the Soul is looking for stories for their latest book.  I will tell you about that, too.
Well, it is 10:20pm and it is quiet at my house.  The phone hasn’t rung and I don’t hear the girls talking on the phone.  Thanks, Qwest, for a novel phone feature!
Good night everyone.  I have a busy day tomorrow.  We are hosting a conference at work tomorrow and this group of people will be stressful…lots of drama.  Maybe I should pick up a box of dramamine to deal with the drama…and sleep thru it all…lol.
Guess what!  Our local group of The Compassionate Friends is hosting a mini-conference – half day on May 3rd.  I am going to present on Journaling!  I am excited that we are hosting this type of event!  First we did the Memory Walk in October, 2002.  Now the mini conference will occur in May 2003.  We are really reaching out!  
I still think I might go to the National Conference in Atlanta, Ga in Jul.  Next year the National is being held in Long Beach, CA.  
Ok – now it is 10:27pm and I need to hit the sack for the usual 05:30am wake up.
Take care my friends in OD land…..Jake’s mom is about to be taken captive by the Sandman….

When I went to Georgia to visit my Mom, I noticed a cat hanging out on the back steps.  It as a Siamese cat, but my 4 year old neice called it a “Chinese” cat.  The cat had an injured tail.  I asked Mom what was wrong with the cat and she said she was nursing the tail.  My Mom was a Certified Nursing Assistant for over 25 years.  She felt her nursing skills could apply to animals.  
I studied the Chinese cat’s tail from a distance.  It looked like it was infected.  A neighbor of my Mom’s thought the cat had curled up on a car engine to keep warm and got her tail caught up in it.  I confided in my brother that we should take the cat to the vet.  
I had asked my Mom why she did not take the cat to the vet.  She honestly felt that she could heal that cat’s tail with daily peroxide treatments.  She also told me she was afraid if she spent too much money on the cat someone would come and claim the cat.  I told Mom I think an honest person would reimburse her for taking such good care of the cat, but Mom would not take the cat to the vet.
After talking to my brother, I gave him a check and told him to take the cat to the vet the day b4 I returned to Colorado.  This was our covert mission – sneak the cat away from Mom’s house and tell her it left.  So we did.  An hour b4 I left to drive to the airport, the vet called and said the tail would have to be removed.  
Mom missed the cat for the 3 days it was at the vet’s. When the cat returned home, nobody updated Mom on the surgery.  Mom noticed the cat and wondered about the tail.  My brother said it must have fallen off.  Then he chuckled and told Mom that he and I rescued the cat and her checked out and caught up to date on her shots.  He told her the vet removed the tail.  My Mom was so happy to see her Chinese cat that she said, “If someone comes looking for this Chinese cat, I will ask them if their cat has a tail.  I will tell them my Chinese cat has no tail!”  I guess Mom really wanted keep this cat.
I have talked to Mom at least twice since I left Georgia and she really loves this cat.  So this is the tale of the Chinese Cat’s Tail…..
I am so glad I finally found time to share this story with you.  
Next – I will write about the Mud Eels in the aquarium at Mom’s house.

Well, I cut the grass yesterday.  I had a hard time crankin’ the mower.  My neighbor hollered at me over the fence and said he had some starting fluid type spray to help me out.  He brought over this spray can of “Thrust”.  Apparently you spray this on gas and diesel engines to help them get started.  This is a miracle spray!  Thrust does for lawnmowers what supposedly Viagra does for other motors!  I highly recommend this stuff.  I plan to go buy some soon.  I just haven’t decided how I can get up the courage to go up to a salesperson and ask for some “Thrust”.  I am sure it will be a Kodak moment!

Dear Contributor,
We are working on a new project entitled Chicken Soup’s Recipes For Creating The Life You Want.  Since the largest market for Chicken Soup books is primarily women,
we feel the need to create a book specifically for this audience.

looking for are “teaching tales” that inspire the reader to draw their own conclusions and insights from the story itself.  We are looking for real-life anecdotes that are instructive-a personal wake-up call that is enlightening.  No preaching or philosophizing, no fables, just good old fashion storytelling that is based on true experiences.  (Because this book is for the general public we ask that you not send stories that are religious in nature.)
Some of the topics we will include are: 
Getting to Know Yourself, Your Needs and YourDreams Getting Your Priorities Straight

This is an example of the type stories Chicken Soup is looking for.  Please read and think about writing a story for their new book!
A Lesson In Surrender
At the end of my daughter’s senior year in high school, we decided to take a trip to the island in British Columbia where she was born.  Neither of us had been back since she, her father and I had left some 16 years earlier.
Shortly after we arrived, we visited an old friend who’s a jeweler.  When she noticed me admiring one of her chrysanthemum rocks, she offered to make me a piece
of jewelry if I found the right stone while on the island.
From that moment on I was on a quest.  Every time I went for a walk I would scour the beach.  I must have picked up several hundred stones.  After days of
intensive hunting I began to notice that I had become obsessed with finding “the perfect rock.”  Without
having realized it, I had gotten to the point where I was no longer enjoying myself.  In fact, I was making myself miserable.  Here I was in this idyllic setting
and I felt as stressed out as I was in Los Angeles.  I had become so driven to find a keepsake of our trip that I was missing the actual experience.  I called off my search and for the first time since arriving I began to feel like I was on vacation.
A few days later I ran into an old friend who invited me to go on a picnic.  We rode our bikes to a deserted beach.  As we lay on our stomachs at the water’s
edge, I suddenly noticed something tickling my palm.  I looked down and there was a jet black stone with a
perfectly formed circle etched on it’s oval surface.  The stone was exactly the right size for my ring finger.  I was speechless.  I had let go, given up and having expended no effort, I had found the very thing I had been looking for.
I began to think about how fear had driven much of my life.  My self-assured veneer had camouflaged how truly frightened I had been–frightened that if I
didn’t push, nothing would happen.  Perhaps, after this experience, I could begin to loosen my grip and allow
myself to be carried more by life.  Perhaps it was time to get my ego out of the way and allow something deeper to motivate me.  Perhaps it was time to listen to a
voice that has always existed, but one to which I had only intermittently listened.  Perhaps it was time
to allow the wisdom of my authentic self to be more present in my life–to heed the truth that I knew to be correct, but had too often ignored.
Since that experience I began to practice trusting whenever, wherever, however I found an opportunity.  Each time we choose to trust, and it’s not always easy,
our faith grows incrementally stronger.  On those occasions when I feel fear rising in the pit of my
stomach, I glance down at my ring as a concrete reminder of what’s possible for each of us when we open ourselves and surrender.

It was a fairly typical morning in the Brandon household: scrambling 
to eat breakfast and get lunches together, trying to decide what to wear, 
gathering books and notebooks, making beds and putting dirty clothes in the 
laundry hamper, and standing in line and to use the rest room.
Listen to some of the comments that were made and exchanges that took 
place. See how the Brandon family compares to your own.
“You’re such a pig! Why do you always eat all the waffles?”
“Mom, I told you I wanted turkey, not ham. How come you don’t listen 
to me?”
“I have nothing to wear! Look at this; I look like a homeless person.”
“I am sick and tired of you leaving your room looking like a tornado 
just passed through it. If you are going to live like a hog, maybe we 
should start treating you like one.”
“Get out of the bathroom! You’ve been in there for at least an hour! 
And it wouldn’t matter if you stood there looking in the mirror for ten 
hours, you’d still have that goofy haircut!”
If someone had secretly taped your family’s interaction yesterday 
(or this morning) what comments would he or she have heard? Would you 
describe the conversation in your home as mostly positive or mostly 
negative? What is encouragement and how might the conversations above have 
been different if each member of the family had made it a goal to encourage 
others? How can you encourage someone in your family today or tomorrow?
As you near the end of a long race, your legs ache, your throat 
burns, and your whole body cries out for you to stop.  This is when family 
and friends are most valuable. Their encouragement  helps you push through 
the pain to the finish line. In the same way, Christians are to encourage 
one another. [Read Romans 12:9-18.] A word of encouragement  offered at the 
right moment can be the difference between finishing well and collapsing 
along the way. Look around you — in your family and among your friends. Be 
sensitive to others’ need for encouragement, and offer supportive words or 
actions.
Our world beats us down all the time. Make your home a place where 
people are built up and encouraged. Try this exercise: have your family sit 
in a circle. Then have everyone share one thing they really admire or 
appreciate about the person inside the ring. Stress character qualities 
over appearance, clothing, etc. Done correctly, this affirmation game makes 
everyone feel wonderful!

May 14th was Jake’s 12th bday.  I took the day off.  I remember when we ate at Taco Bell together…Sept. 23.  The day b4 his tragic accident almost 3 years ago.  He said he wanted to try a Gordita Crunch.  He chose something else instead.  Since I lost Jake, seeing those Gordita Crunch commercials on TV used to make me sad.  So on his bday, I went to our local Taco Bell and had a Gordita in his memory.  It was tasty, but not my kind of food…too greasy for new Weight Watchers food plan.  As I sat in that Taco Bell, I thought of Jake.  I looked towards the booth we sat in that last time we ate there.  I remembered how much fun the 2 of us had that day.  Then I left to go to the cemetery.  I visited Jake and wondered why he had to leave us when he was so young…only 9 years old.  If Jake had been 30 or 40, I still would wonder why…..he left us.  It just seems so out of sequence.
I was in Target shopping for something 4 Jake, to put in my garden in the backyard as a tribute to him on his bday.  Last year I bought a couple trolls to sit in his garden.  While I was browsing, I heard a little boy talking to himself.  He was about 9 or 10.  He was in the toy aisle checking out some transformer toys.  I watched him from a distance, remembering how Jake loved to lose himself surrounded by the toys in the toy aisle.  Jake loved to check out the toys and then he would return to my side when he was done,usually with a toy in hand and those big brown eyes looking up at me and those deep dimples accenting his smile as he said, “Please, Mom?  I really like this.  Can I have it?”
As I studied this little boy in the toy aisle,I noticed he chose a particular toy and went marching down the main aisle hollering, “Gramma!  Can you buy this for me and I will pay you back?”  As he left to talk to his Gramma, I went to the toy aisle to see what he was looking at.  As soon as I got there, he returned to put the treasured toy back on the shelf.  I looked at him and said, “So Gramma said “No”, huh?”  He nodded his head and kept looking at the toys.  I asked him if I helped him pay for the toy would his Gramma let him have it?  He shrugged his shoulders.  So I asked him which toy was his favorite.  He pointed it out and I picked it up.  I told him, “Today is my little boy’s bday.  He would have been 12 today, but he was killed in a gocart accident when he was 9.”  I then gave him some money, the toy, and a Random Act of Kindness card.  He thankd me and started down the aisle to talk to his Gramma again and turned back to look at me.  He said, “I am sorry about what happened to your son.”  Then we went our separate ways.
So, May 14th has come and gone without Jake.  He would have been 12 years old.

As a little girl, my mother would bring me in the stall, teach me to wad up toilet paper and wipe the seat. 
Then, she’d carefully lay strips of toilet paper to cover the seat. 
Finally, she’s instruct, “Never, never sit on a public toilet seat.” And she’d demonstrate ” The Stance,” which consisted of balancing over the toilet in a sitting position without actually letting any of your flesh make contact  with the toilet seat. But by this time, I’d have wet down my leg. 
And we’d go home. 
That was a long time ago. I’ve had lots of experience with public toilets since then, but I’m still not particularly fond of public toilets, especially those with powerful, red-eye sensors. 
Those toilets know when you want them to flush. They are psychic toilets. 
But I always confuse their psychic ability by following my mother’s advice and assuming The Stance. 
The Stance is excruciatingly difficult to maintain when one’s bladder is especially full. 
When you have to”go” in a public bathroom, you find a line of women that makes you think there’s a half-price sale on Mel Gibson’s underwear in there. 
So, you wait and smile politely at all the other ladies, also crossing their legs and smiling politely. 
And you finally get closer. You check for feet under the stall doors. 
Every one is occupied. 
Finally a stall door opens and you dash, nearly knocking down the woman leaving the stall. You get in to find the door won’t latch. It doesn’t matter. You hang your handbag on the door  hook, yank down your pants and assume ” The Stance.” Relief. More relief. Then your thighs begin to shake. 
You would love to sit down but you certainly hadn’t taken the time to wipe the seat or lay toilet paper on it, so you hold The Stance as your thighs experience a quake that would register an eight on the Richter scale. 
To take your mind off it, you reach for the toilet paper. Might as well be ready when you are done. The toilet paper dispenser is empty. Your thighs shake more. 
You remember the tiny tissue that you blew your nose on-that’s  in your purse. It would have to do. You crumble it in the puffiest way possible. 
It is still smaller than your thumbnail. 
Someone pushes open your stall door because the latch doesn’t work and your pocketbook whams you in the head. 
“Occupied!” you scream as you reach out for the door, dropping your tissue in a puddle and falling backward, directly onto the toilet seat. You get up quickly, but it’s too late. 
Your bare bottom has made contact with all the germs and life forms on the bare seat because YOU never laid down toilet paper, not that there was any, even if you had enough time to. 
And your mother would be utterly ashamed of you if she knew, because her bare bottom never touched a public toilet seat because, frankly, “You don’t know what kind of diseases you could get. “And by this time, the automatic sensor on the back of the toilet is so confused that it flushes, sending up a stream of water akin to a fountain and then it suddenly sucks everything down with such force that you grab onto the toilet paper dispenser for fear of being dragged to China. 
At that point, you give up…You’re soaked by the splashing water. 
You’re exhausted. You try to wipe with a Chick-let wrapper you found in your pocket, then slink out inconspicuously to the sinks. 
You can’t figure out how to operate the sinks with the automatic sensors, so you wipe your hands with spit and a dry paper towel and walk past a line of women, still waiting, cross-legged and unable to smile politely at this point. One kind soul at the very end of the line points out that you are trailing a piece of toilet paper on your shoe as long as the Mississippi River! You yank the paper from your shoe, plunk it in the woman’s hand and say warmly, “Here. You might need this.” 
At this time, you see your spouse, who has entered, used and exited his bathroom and read a copy of War and Peace while waiting for you. 
“What took you so long?” he asks, annoyed. This is when you kick him sharply in the shin and go home. 
This is dedicated to all women everywhere who have ever had to deal with a public toilet. And it finally explains to all you men what takes us so long.

Dear Patty,
I couldn’t recall if I had responded to your letter before. With so many e-mails that I have to reply to, I’m sorry that at times I can’t keep track of them anymore. However, if I still have not done my part, then 
may I ask you to forgive me.
Patty, I’m deeply touched by what had happened to your son, Jake, and I send you and your family my warmest sympathy. I can almost feel your emotion. You have lost your dear son, and life seems to be empty, a void that nothing can fill. Your daily affairs have grown meaningless. And every few minutes, tears keep welling in your eyes, sadness like a heavy 
cloud hangs over everything.
So, perhaps you ask why our Father in heaven has taken your son away, why it had to be Jake. There is no answer which can give you comfort. Only God who is all-knowing has the answer. And countless times He doesn’t explain why. But in God’s time I’m certain you’ll now why. Only the passage of time and the certainty that whatever happens our Father loves you with an everlasting love shall reveal to you His divine reason. The Holy Spirit, too, I pray will soothe your pain. Our faith tells us that before a glorious resurrection there must first be a surrender back to God of the life He has given. Before Spring’s burgeoning of new growth there is the falling of Autumn leaves and their burial in Winter’s cold.
Please accept the fact that we can never change what has happened but with God’s guidance, I pray, you can control how this affects you. With His strength growing within you, you shall choose this moment of grief to become a much more loving and caring daughter of God. Time will pass, and your hurt will heal and you will have grown because of your pain. God is good, and so believe me all is for your lasting good. God knows best and so He has the best things in store for each one of us. Just trust Him with all your heart.  Maybe these words may seem meaningless to you now. I am only going to ask you one thing, and that is to think of the wonderful years you experienced as his mother. Dwell on this thought and all the joys your dear son brought. That smile on his face, his gentle ways, whose recollection fills you with a great sense of loss will soon be a gentle source of comfort to you. I am hoping that through remembrance you will gain courage and peace to realize that the purpose of living is to die, and that death opens the door to the glory of living. I can promise you that Jake is waiting for you all in heaven someday.
So, please have faith that your child is not lost, we know where he is. Heaven has been made richer by his coming. When Jesus lived upon the earth so many years ago, He called the children close to Him. With the 
same, gentle way, He holds your dear Jake close within His arms today. So think of him lighthearted and happy and free, playing in God’s promised land where there is joy eternally. He is closer to you now, Patty, than 
ever before, and his love for you, his dad, his brother and sisters will remain for always.
I will always remember you and your family in my prayers.
God bless you abundantly,
Joe

Well, I am taking my son, his wife, and one of my daughters to California next weekend.  It will be a quick trip. My Aunt is having a surprise Bday party from her kids.  She has 9 kids – my cousins.  She is retiring to the Philippines.  
I thought this would be a fun trip for me and the kids to meet my Filipino side of the family.  I am sure we will stand out as sore thumbs since we are Filipino-Americans!  I am excited.  The theme is Hawaiian and Renee and I went out yesterday to buy some Hawaiian stuff for everyone to wear.  
We leave Friday night and return Sunday night.  This will be the first time I have seen my cousins since 1978!  Some cousins I cannot remember seeing at all!

Jake’s school is beginning work on the playground project.  The initial seed money (insurance funds) that I provided has blossomed into a fully funded $70K project!  Build Day is scheduled for 7 August.
Tears were brought to my eyes as I read the email from Jake’s principal naming the playground in Jake’s memory.  This is such a wonderful tribute to my son.  He loved to play outside and now others will enjoy his favorite past-time…
Now I need a nice quote to go on the sign.  Any ideas?

Dear Patty,.
My heart goes out to you and your family.  I can not imagine the emptiness you must feel.  I’m sure you love your kids as much as I love mine.  As a Christian, I believe that we will be reunited w/ our loved ones who are believers and with children who are tragicvally lost like your Jake, in paradise someday. In heaven, there will be no more tears, no more sorrow, no more tragedy.  Make Jake proud of you everyday, for the rest of your life.  I’m sure he already is.
God Bless,
Buddy 🙂

Well, I went to Buena Vista, Colorado this weekend.  I have found a nice place to stay up there to get away from the city – Woodland Brook Cabins.  It is such a nice place to relax.  The cabins are completely furnished and smell so fresh when you walk it….reminds me of that Gain commercial on TV…linen fresh.
I took my older son and his wife with me. My girls are in FL visiting with their Dad’s family.  They are supposed to see their Dad, too.
Anyway, we fished at Cottonwood Pass Lake.  It was so quiet and peaceful.  The lake was so still and it looked like glass – reflecting the surrounding mountains!  I accidentally caught a small trout.  I felt the tug on my line, but I did not think it took the bait.  When I reeled in my line, there was a small trout on my hook – pan frying size.  We decided to let it go.  After all the excitement, a little boy came over to me and said, “Ma’m, what are you using for bait?”  I said, “Worms”.  He then walked away.  I offered to share our worms with him, but he didn’t come back.  Well, I decided I had to go talk to his parents and give the little guy a worm.  He raced over to me and took a long thick worm out of the container.  I told him he could have the entire container since we brought 2 with us.  He was so happy!  He took the container and thanked!   He reminded me of Jake…out having a good time.  A few minutes later, his Dad came over and wanted to pay me for the worms, I said no.  We had plenty to share.  Another Random Act of Kindness in memory of Jake….(sigh).
We later moved across the lake and had a great time just waiting for some action.  We could hear voices all around the lake discussing types of bait.  My son actually had to break off some of his line since it was getting knotted up in his open-face reel.  When he was done fixing his reel, he stooped to pick up the discarded line and guess what!?  There was another small trout on the end of it!  This was just too funny for us.  We felt like we were on Candid Camera.  So we set the fish free.  It was a small rainbow trout.  I think Jake was with us and laughing his head off.  I can see his teeth and dimples as I write this.
Around 8pm, we headed back into town and stopped at Punky’s for some ice-cream.  Punky’s is a mom and pop ice-cream place.  It sure was refreshing to have some cold ice-cream after a hot evening on the lake.
We returned to our cabin to call it a night. 
We left this morning around 8am and grabbed some breakfast at the Evergreen Cafe in Buena Vista.  This is such a great place to eat!
We arrived home in the Springs b4 noon.  I took a nice nap and then worked on my sprinkler system.  One of the t-joints cracked and I had a geyser in my front yard – not to mention the small hole.  So, I fixed that.  My son stopped by to help me repair a sprinkler head and adjust another station.  While he was making adjustments, the allen wrench screwed the small screw right out of the sprinkler head and we had more water than we needed!  So…here we go again…it’s always something…I suppose I will be at ABC Plumbing during my lunch hour tomorrow.
Oh – by the way, my cable has been out for over a week now, too!  It is always something!  The cable people are supposed to be here sometime between 3 and 5 tomorrow afternoon…like I have all day to wait around for them.  I wish they could just work on it without me being home.
Anyway, I am hitting the sack now…it is 10:15 and 5:30 will be here b4 I know it.
Hope your 4th of July was fun and safe.

Ok – this was my 3rd time back to the cabins.  I went with a couple friends.  I cannot even begin to describe the peacefulness I find in this little Colorado town.
We brought food up with us so we really had a nice time cooking at our cabins.  Being the southerner I am – Saturday morning found me in the kitchen cooking up bacon and grits.  My friend stepped in to cook some omelets and we all sat down to eat together….grits, bacon, omelets, english muffins, coffee, oj…the life of leisure and friends.
Evenings found us sitting outside refilling our wine glasses and enjoying good conversation among friends.
We strolled up to Punky’s on Saturday night for a burger.  We sat outside to eat and watch the night life..teenagers cruising up the main drag…doing a U-turn and passing by again, and again, and again….
While we were out there, a couple guys decided to shoot the breeze with us.  We discussed hot springs and massages.  The conversation led to nude hot springs.  I really couldn’t comment in this area and let everyone know that it wasn’t my idea of fun.  So this guy looks at me and says…”…so you have a problem walking around in your bday suit?”..as he was finishing his ice-cream cone.  I just finished chewing some burger and swallowing.  I casually wiped the crumbs from my mouth and said…”…well..it just depends on what my mission is for the night..”.  I thought both my friends were going to fall off the picnic bench when I said this to him…. a total stranger…making conversation with us strangers…imagine that!  Another fun time in Buena Vista.

I just received my first letter from a soldier in the desert.  She is 19 and is a mechanic.  She was glad to hear from me!  She wrote  a very nice letter back to me.  She told me all about her family and her military job.  I am in the process of putting together a care package for her.

Sunday morning I took my trash out and was stunned at what I found.  A big gray cat was hanging from my fence with a lease around it’s neck.  Someone put a leash on this big beautiful gray tabby cat and the cat accidentally hung him/herself.  It was such an upsetting sight for me.  I think I almost had cardiac arrest!  I think the cat tried to jump my 6 foot privacy fence and the long leash got hung on the fence and the poor cat was doomed.
I called the police to report it and they came to check out the scene to make sure it was not criminally connected.  Alot of cats are being killed in Denver …just an hour away.  This incident was determined to be an accidental death.
It is so sad.  Please do not put a leash on your cat.

Lightning can and does strike twice in the same place, but I didn’t know death does the same thing.  It is almost 3 years since I lost my 9 year son in a tragic gocart/auto accident.  I lost my niece last Wednesday.  She is from the ex’s side of the family.  She, too, is from a divorced family.  She just turned 20 in June.  She was just starting a new adventure in life.  She just joined the Air Force in Jan.  She just completed tech school in TX to become a certified B1 Bomber Armament Specialist.  She just returned to FL to visit with her family for 2 weeks.  My daughters just spent time with her this summer.  She was enroute to her first duty assignment in South Dakota.  She didn’t make it.  She was killed in a car accident in Percival, Iowa.
I wondered about her mother and her feelings.  I called her Mom.  She lives in FL.  I told her she and her family are in our thoughts.  I wish I could be there and I probably could…the funeral is Tuesday.  I just don’t think I can handle this funeral…much less the politicalness of the divorce.  My ex will be there with his brother (my niece’s Dad).  If I went, I would be with my niece’s Mom -the ex-wife of my ex’s husband.  
I don’t understand life.  It has been an emotional week.  My girls are acting out and now there is another death in the family.  People say, “God only puts on your plate what he thinks you can handle.”  If anyone out there prays lot, could you tell Him “Jake’s Mom is full…..”?
Decisions…decisions….

I decided to sponser a “permanent” on-line guestbook.  This will allow friends and family to remember her always and leave memories on her birthday, anniversary of her death, etc.  I never heard of an on-line guest book.  I wish I could have done this for Jake.  If I did, I probably would never have started this on-line diary.   Oh well, writing to you has helped me along this journey that no parent should ever have to take….loss of a child….
I sent a card to the person that was in the car with my niece.  He is in intensive care in a Nebraska hospital.  I have been pre-occupied with his well-being, too, since the accident.  I didn’t know what to write, but I wrote something nice.  I let them know who I was.  I wrote this card to the boy and his family.  I shared about Jake.  I think my best line was, “I know you don’t know who I am and I don’t know who you are…but all that matters is that we care about your son and you – his family.”  I hope I hear back from them.  I put a return address label on the envelope and my email address inside the card.  This is the least I can do for this young boy.  He is 20 also.
If you have a prayer chain out there, include this boy in a Nebraska hospital.  His name is Charles.  I think God knows who he is.  
Heavenly Father, I ask you to please take care of this  young man, Charles.  He is in bad shape.  Please give him the chance to recover and travel to his first Air Force Duty assignment in South Dakota.  He was on his way to a new life and career as a Aircraft Armament Specialist for the B1 Bomber.  Please help his family deal with this tragic situation and give them strength to be by his side. Please allow them to put this tragic situation in Your “In Box” and know that You will do the best you can for Charles.  Thanks for listening.  Also, please take care of my niece – she arrived to your Heavenly estate on 13 August.  Let Jake know his cousin is Home.  I think he might like to take her for a spin in his gocart.  Let Jake drive because I don’t think she is too crazy about being back behind the wheel.  Also, send a sign to the driver of the grain truck that collided with my niece that everything is OK.  I know he must be a wreck, too.  I know this is alot to put on your plate, but I don’t think it is every too much for you, God.  Sometime we need to talk about all the stuff on my plate, too.  Amen.  
Thanks.  God Bless You All.
Good night.

My boss at the library where I volunteer lost her husband in a car accident Monday night….why is this happening….?  He was so young….55.  He was in an accident late Monday night and never regained conciousness.  My library friends called me at work yesterday.  The memorial service was today.  I went back to the Living With Loss store to put together a basket for my boss at the library.  
I just don’t undertand life…a co-worker says life is like a “terminal illness”…I guess she meant we never know when it is over….(sigh)

I walk every afternoon with a couple co-workers in my building.  We usually are out for about 20-25 minutes.  On my walk Tuesday, I spotted a bright orange golf wiffle ball.  I studied it as I walked past it.  My two friends were lost in discussion.  I thought about Jake as I passed it.  After I walked about 25 feet past it, I told my friends to, “…wait for me.  I have to get something.”  Then I ran back to pick it up.  I showed it to them and said, “Look!  A sign from Jake!”  They looked at me like I was crazy, but it didn’t matter to me.  I brought it back to my office and sat in the my Zen garden on my desk.  On Wednesday, I found another one in about the same spot!  Now I have 2 bright orange golf wiffle balls in my desktop Zen garden….Plus the two I have found in the past – on my dresser at home.  The ones at  home are real golf balls.  Jake loved to smack plastic wiffle balls with his golf clubs.  I didn’t want to take a chance of giving him real ones to smack into a neighbor’s window.  He golfed with his older brother about 2 weeks b4 his accident.  His brother will mention that outing sometimes…I know it hurts him to have lost his little bro.  
It is September – Fall – the season Jake left us.  It is hard.  The weather is cooler.  Soon the leaves will change to a bright orange color, the color of Jake’s red hair.  September 24, 2003 will be the 3rd anniversary of Jake’s accident.  How we have managed this long without Jake is quite puzzling at times….
Well – I have lost 19lbs with Weight Watchers – even though I splurged last night at Coldstone Creamery.  Oh my goodness!  That ice-cream is sooooo rich and good!  I had the coffee ice-cream with Heath Bars and Carmels mixed in.  They call it the “Coffee Lover’s”.  So yummy!  Despite my indulgence, I was able to lose another 1.4 lbs this week to make it a grand total of 19lbs!
September 27 will be our 2nd annual Strolling With Angels Walk in the cemetary.  I think it is going to be really chilly.  We had a large turnout last year.  My Compassionate Friends group has made me the speaker to all the media.  I really didn’t want this honor, but so far I have managed to do well.  They gave my phone number to the TV station for covering the Walk.  This is definitely an icentive to keep losing weight…as Jake’s Mom…I want to look decent….LOL.

Saturday I spent at least 5+ hours with my daughter, Renee.  We went to the mall.  I really had a nice time.  I splurged on a new Fall wardrobe for myself to celebrate my new weightloss.  It sure feels nice getting into sizes smaller than normal. 
While I was out, Renee found a nice leather jacket that she really seemed to like so I told her to try one on and we would buy that, too.  She was so thrilled to have a new “grown up” looking jacket.  She put it on and wore it for the rest of our shopping trip.
We had a nice lunch together at Panera Bread.  It was cold yesterday..so soup and sandwiches just sounded enticing!
I also bought some new dressy shoes for work…with heels.  I think I will look tall now!  Renee found some cute boots she really liked.  She wanted to try them on for fun and I could see how much she liked them….so I bought those, too!  She was a really happy, appreciative teenager yesterday.
When I think of how much fun I had yesterday…I smile and wish I had more time with my girls.  Her sister didn’t want to hang out with us…so this shopping trip was less expensive than it could have been…lol.

I take Love and Logic classes on Monday nights.  I have just completed the 3rd Monday.  I find it very interesting and have met some interesting people.  Last Monday night, I met a “man”.  He is in my class.  He asked if I had a minute to talk after the class.  I said I have a couple minutes….an hour later – we were still talking.  Hmmm…interesting…adult conversation – outside of work – a “man” to talk to who is also a single parent.  We will see what we talk about next Monday.

Okay.  I am back.  There is a lot of stuff going on over here.  Becky and I are both in counseling trying to understand each other’s world.  So far…we are moving one day at a time.
I just learned one of her girlfriends is pregnant.  Her friend is 16 years old and about 5 months into this pregnancy.  Her friend has not told her parents anything.  The plan is that she is going to write her parents a long letter and spend the weekend with friends.  Guess where she will be?  If you guessed my place, you are right – at least for tomorrow night.  Who knows what adventure will take place tomorrow night.  Pray for all of us!
The man I told you about….well…I decided to meet him for Starbucks tonite at 7pm for some coffee and conversation.  He would prefer I go to his home for a home-cooked meal and discussion afterwards, but I feel Starbucks is a better idea for now.  I have way too much on my plate for any extra drama…trust me on this!  He seems to have alot to get off his chest with his week, too, so I thought it would be nice to have someone to share life stories with…not lifetimes!
Becky’s sister was in a driver education program all day last Saturday and Sunday.  It is called Master Drive.  It is pricey, but since we lost Jake I don’t want to take any chances!  She will continue for the next 3 Sundays with all day classroom instruction.  She did the skills course last weekend.  After classroom instruction, she will have 12 hours on the road with an instructor and another student.  6 hours of this will be “behind the wheel” time for her – the remaining 6 hours will be “observation” from the backseat.
I am just wiped out with everything right now.  I wish I could write more, but I am quite exhausted.  Mondays I attend a parenting class – Love and Logic.  It is interesting, but it makes my day really long.  I work from 7:30pm to 5:30pm and my class starts at 5:45pm til 7:45pm.  Tuesdays I bowl with my work league – 6:30pm to 9:30pm.  Wednesdays Renee is hooking up with a “Free Thinker” group – believers in Darwinism..from 7-9pm.  Thursdays Renee has guitar lessons from 6:30pm – 7pm.  Fridays — I never know what the weekend adventure will bring me!  Saturday Renee has to take the PSAT exam at 7:45am and Sunday she has to be back at Master Drive at 7:45am til 5pm. 
If and when the kids  join their Dad in March, I plan to catch up on some much needed rest!  The kids were supposed to spend XMAS with their Dad in the Marshall Islands, but as of last night – that plan has been scratched.  So they will either be with me or in NC with his family.
Have to get a little rest now b4 I go to Starbucks….will write again really soon.  If you get a chance to pick up the latest copy of Bereavement Magazine (http://www.bereavementmag.com), you can read about my Random Act of Kindess on Jake’s bday. You read it first in FOD! They are publishing a story on these cards in the Nov/Dec issue.
Any ideas on how I can help this 16 year old pregnant girl?  I think she should see a doctor ASAP since she has never been to see the Dr. and needs pre-natal vitamins.  I told my girls to direct her to the Community Health Center.  Stay tuned for more drama in Jake’s household…of those he left behind…..

Well my daughter’s pregnant friend wrote her parents a letter last night.  She left it where they could find it.  Basically, she told them she was pregnant, she was going to give it up for adoption, she didn’t need any $ from them, and that if she was kicked out of the house she did have a place to stay.  The parents returned from their night out to the movies, read the letter, and picked up their daughter and brought her home to stay – – the mother in tears, herself.  My daughter told me that the pregnant one’s Mom is taking all of next week off to schedule appointments and take care of whatever needs to be done…very supportive.  So I will learn more later, I guess.
By the way,  I spent the morning with my “friend” at Starbucks.  It was an enjoyable morning.  I might make this a habit!
Went to visit Jake this morning, too – just me – by myself.  I did take my “friend” to Jake’s school this morning to share Jake’s garden and playground with him.  I think he was a bit taken by everything.  So I took him back to Starbucks – gave him a big hug – and went to visit Jake.
I am a bit exhausted from all the emotions with this teen pregnancy floating thru out my household.  My girls are completed overwhelmed by everything!
Also, spoke with Jake’s Dad yesterday.  The girls were too busy to be on the phone.  I will share this conversation next time.

I checked into a motel Friday morning to get some rest!  I am losing it with these teenagers!  I slept solid from 10am to 1:30pm.  My counselor saw how tired I was at my Friday counseling appointment.  I was almost 2 tired to talk…..she offered me hug and I was almost 2 tired to hug her back…..
I have to do this more often – get away to recharge. I came home this morning to a messy house.  I have been cleaning since I got home.  I am wiped out people.  Can I retire from parenthood at the age of 44?

Ok – so I met this nice man in my Love and Logic class on 29 Sept.  It is now 1 Nov and I have been enjoying my Starbucks time with him.  So far we have closed down Starbucks a few evenings now.  I really think he is special because he makes me laugh.  I haven’t enjoyed male company in a very long time.  He has already met my girls and both my girls like him.  He has yet to meet my son and his wife, but that is coming up in the near future.
One night, at Starbucks, I shared with Bill about my little boy Jake.  He looked into my teary eyes and listened so compassionately.  I had to look away many times.  He reached across the table and took both my hands into his and squeezed them.   In his own words he told me how my voice changed when I spoke of Jake and he was so sorry that I had to experience this loss.  All I could do was look at him briefly and then look away.  I think this is a very special person.  He thinks it’s God’s blessing that we both met in a parenting class.  He is divorced and shares parenting time with his 10 year old daughter – every other weekend and every Wednesday night for dinner.
I am afraid of men because of my past experiences and I have shared this with Bill.  He seems to understand.  For now, we are relishing our time spent together at Starbucks…we usually end our evening with a quick hug — nothing more.
I am trying to understand the how and why of this friendship with Bill.  All I can say now is that he makes me happy and adds some joy in my troubled life with my daughters these days.
I have saved something interesting to tell you at the end of this entry.  Bill also has a son who lives in another state with his mother.  He would like to invite his son out to Colorado for Christmas break.  His son is 15 and  his name is …..Jake…..He asked me if I would like to meet his son.
I said .. yes …

5.  He banters back and forth like we have known each other since high school.
6.  He is now hooked on Starbucks.  He never went to Starbucks until I invited him there for coffee and conversation.  Now we close it down often during the week.  Sleep deprivation is getting to both of us.
7.  He has a daughter that is 10 and a son that is 15.  Their names are Katie and Jake.
8.  He is trying so hard to reach out and help me with my daughters.  He wants to take them out to his place and have dinner on Wednesday night with them and his daughter.
9.  Katie wants to meet my girls.
10.  Bill has brought a sense of peace into my otherwise turbulent life.

Ok – this week has not been too peaceful.  I asked Becky to leave since she could not follow the house rules.  A friend of hers picked her up Sunday night.  She has been going to school as she feels like it.  I have not heard from her all week except for one voice message.  This tough love is wearing me out.
Tonite I am going to a “Blended Families” conference.  Bill thought it might be interesting so I agreed to go.  I made sure with him that we were not presenting blood tests and marriage licenses at the entry.  He assured me that it was not the case.  With the drama all week in my home – I feel like I have been living in a “blender”!  I don’t even have the energy or desire to go tonite, but I will try….I have a couple hours to reconsider.

I am glad I went.  I learned some interesting things – especially a new term “Godly bonds” – these are all biological relationships – like the bonds I have with my 4 children and the bonds they have with me and their biological dads – in this case – my older son has a different Dad than the twins and Jake.  I wonder how my older son can bond with someone he has never met.  Maybe I should ask about that in today’s session.  Another bond would be the bond between Bill and I (later down the road) and his bonds with his ex (mother of his daughter) and the the mother of is his son, Jake.  Lots of bonding in relationships.
I learned that each day there are 9,500 divorces filed.  Of this number – 65% are from second/subsequent marriages.  35% from first marriages.  Scary!  Maybe that is why I haven’t dated since I divorced 9 years ago!  I don’t know what term describes Bill’s and my conversations at Starbucks – it is not dating – I guess it is called “Having coffee and good conversation”.  Anyway – after the conference we went to TGI Fridays for a late meal.  I cannot believe I ate supper last night at 9pm!  We talked until 11pm and each went home and crashed.  
Part 2 of Blending Families resumes at 9am this morning.  I have to skip Weight Watchers because I have some things to take care of at home before Part 2.
I will bring home some info to share with you when this conference ends today.
Have a good Saturday.

Bill invited Renee and me to 4 wheel in the  mountains yesterday afternoon. We had a picnic and shared about life.  He cooked a nice dinner at his place afterwards.  He asked Renee about Becky and Renee pointed her finger at me across the table – me being the issue of contention.  I just quietly ate my dinner – didn’t want any confrontation over a nice home-cooked meal.  Since we have enough confrontation at home.

Well, lunch with Becky on Wednesday was tough.  It was emotional to say the least.  I invited her back home only if she wanted to come home and abide by the house rules.  She hugged me and said she would be home Wednesday night.  She called me about 7 hours later and said she would be home Thursday night instead.  So, I cancelled attending my grief group Thursday night so that I could be home when Becky came home.  We had dinner and conversation together.  Thursday night went well.  Friday she had her wisdom tooth pulled and stayed home all day. Friday night she felt well enough to hang with friends.  I invited Bill over and we all had pizza.  Bill quizzed Becky and her friends about high school and future plans.  Becky told me later that her friends did not like Bill and all his questions.  I explained to her that it was Bill’s way of learning about teens and their world.  Becky went out with her friends and came home at 1230am.  I was not happy about her coming in late, but I did not say anything.  Saturday she spent the night with a girlfriend.  Sunday she went bowling with me and some friends.  There were still kids over at my place when I went to bed.  I couldn’t sleep after 4am so I got up to get on the computer.  I noted my girls cleaned house after their friends departed; it was nice to wake up to a clean house.   I will praise them for that when they get up this  morning in about 1.5 hours.
Wednesday I am leaving for Buena Vista to spend time in a cabin for the holidays.  Renee is going with me.  Becky was invited by her older brother to spend Thanksgiving with him and his wife.  I think it will be good bonding time for brother and sister.  As for me – Renee wants to snowboard so I will take her up to the mountains and probably ski while she boards.  It will be nice to go back to the quiet town of Buena Vista.  I like it there.  I have to plan my meals and shop b4 we leave on Wednesday.  I never cooked in a gas oven b4.  I guess I will cook some little cornish game hens for Thanksgiving.  It will be a different Thanksgiving this year.  
I am thankful that my girls are both home again.  I am thankful that Bill has come into my life and made me laugh…alot.  I am thankful that I decided to take a “timeout” Wednesday; it was worth it.
I bowled with Bill and his little girl yesterday.  There were 7 of us all together.  His little girl is so sweet.  I can make her laugh.  She is 10 years old.  I guess I miss having a little kid around.  Jake never was 10.  I lost him when he was 9; I miss him.  I miss him very, very much.   When I talk about Jake, Bill’s little girls seems to see my hurt.  I can tell it in her eyes.  For a 10 year old, she has excellent eye contact with adults.  She is great.  She is fun.  She is not Jake, but I enjoy her company.  If Jake is looking down on me from Heaven, I think he understands that I miss him and that Katie is good for all of us.  Jake – you will always be missed – 4ever.

THE UNDELIVERED LETTER
Some years ago there lived in an English city a man whom I shall call Fred Armstrong.  He worked in the local post office, where he was called ‘dead-letter man’ because he handled missives whose addresses were faulty or hard to read. He lived in an old house with his little wife and even smaller daughter and tiny son. 
After supper he liked to sit in his easy chair and tell his children of his latest exploits in delivering lost letters. He considered himself quite a detective.  There was no cloud on his modest horizon. No cloud — until one sunny morning when his little boy suddenly fell ill.  Within 48 hours the child was dead. 
In his sorrow, Fred Armstrong’s soul seemed to die.  The mother and their little daughter, Marian, struggled to control their grief, determined to make the best of it.  Not so with the father. His life was now a dead letter with no direction. In the morning, Fred rose from his bed and went to work like a sleep walker.  He never spoke unless spoken to and he ate his lunch alone. He sat like a statue at the supper table and went to bed early.  Yet, his wife knew that he lay most of the night with his eyes open, staring at the ceiling.  As the months passed, his apathy seemed to deepen. His wife told him that such despair was unfair to their lost son and unfair to the living.  But nothing that she said seemed to reach him.
It was coming close upon Christmas. One bleak afternoon at work Fred sat on his high stool and moved a new pile of letters under the electric lamp.  On the top of the stack was an envelope that was clearly undeliverable.  In crude block letters were penciled the words: SANTA CLAUS NORTH POLE — Fred started to throw it away, when some impulse made him pause. He opened the letter and read: 
Dear Santa Claus, 
 We are very sad in our house this year, and I don’t want you to bring me anything.  My little brother went to heaven last spring.  All I want you to do when you come to our house is to take Brother’s toys to him.  I’ll leave them in the corner by the kitchen stove; his hobby horse and train and everything.  I know he’ll be lost up in heaven without them, most of all his horse.  He always liked riding it so much.  So you must take them to him, please.  And, you need not mind leaving me anything.  But, if you could give Daddy something that would make him like he used to be, and make him tell me stories, I do wish you would.  I heard him say to Mommy once that only Eternity could cure him.  Could you bring him some of that and I will be your good little girl.

That night Fred walked home at a faster gait.  In the winter darkness he stood in the dooryard garden for just a moment.  Then, he opened the kitchen door. He hugged his wife and asked his little daughter if she was ready to hear a story. ______________________________Like refreshing rain in summer,Like the gentle breeze in Spring,Your Word, Lord, make me realize- “It is well, it is well, my dear child.”______________________________

I went to Buena Vista for Thanksgiving and had a nice time.  I took Renee wih me and Becky stayed home because she wanted some “down” time.  Who knows what went on at my place while I was away for 3 days – but if I worried about it I would not have had any peace while I was away in Cabin #16 – Wild Rose. 
Things at home have been quite the roller coaster ride.  I am now taking Family Medical Leave to deal with everything at home.  I am so fatigued.  Family Medical Leave is leave without pay, but I feel it is necessary at times to recharge my batteries in life.
The latest adventure that Becky took me on was last Sunday – 7 Dec.  She took my van out while I was not home!  She has an expired learner’s permit and is not legal at all to drive!  I reported the van as stolen and the suspect as my daughter.  The cops advised me that it would be a “felony” if they came out to write up the report.  Fortunately for Becky, she returned home safely and I called the cops to tell them the van was back and to disregard coming out to write up the report.  How stupid was I!  I should have had them come get her anyway!  I think I am losing it….
As for Bill…I am stressed so much at home that trying to accommodate him is more stress…..so more on that later….but….after 10 weeks…we have progressed to holding hands.  How sweet.
Friday – December 12th – was my bday.  I took myself out to see the new Jack Nicholson movie – Something’s Gotta Give – and it was a riot!  I needed a good laugh!  I would see it again in a heartbeat!
Happy Holidays if I don’t check in by XMAS.  My girls leave on 20 Dec to spend time with their Dad’s folks in NC.  I am counting the days til departure!
I am thinking of going to GA for XMAS unannounced dressed like a XMAS package!  What do you think?  I need to get away from here.

I cannot access your diary to read your entry.  It says it can only be accessed if it’s a favorite.  Can you release access for me to read your entry?

Well, I left CO on XMAS Day.  I was able to slip into GA and surprise my Mom on XMAS afternoon.  I have really enjoyed being “home” and appreciated.  It seems there is nothing in CO to write home about anymore.  The twins are in NC with their Dad and his family.  My son and his wife are in CO.  Nobody knows where I am and that is fine;  no stress here at all.  I will be home tomorrow night – New Year’s Day.
I took my Mom out to see “Cold Mountain” and then out to dinner.  She loved the movie and the quiet dinner we shared together.  Nicole Kidman can sure speak “southern” well in that movie!
I took my younger brother and his 4 year old daughter out to see The Cat in the Hat.  It was funny.  We also shopped and had lunch out together.
I took my older brother out bowling.  We had fun together.  He quit bowling after his second game so I bowled the 3rd game without any competition.  We had a great time.
My younger brother is planning a fish fry tonite for dinner so it should be delicious.  He can surely cook some good fish!  He is going thru a divorce after being with his wife for 12 years.  It is a tough time, but he and his wife have a good relationship and this is important for the 3 kids involved in the middle.
My younger brother just started his dream job as an automotive techinician at a local dealership.  He loves his job so much.  He was schooled in automotive mechanics, but never really worked it as a job – just a hobby.  I stopped by to visit him yesterday at the shop and he sure was a happy camper!  He is definitely in his element!
Well – my time in GA in now coming to an end and I am going to miss my Mom and brothers.  I love the small town life here and the southern hospitality.  I can already tell I am talking “like a local” again!  I am sure my co-workers will razz me when I return to work in corporate America talking like a hillbilly!
I wanted to tell you that the new Jack Nicholson movie – Something’s Gotta Give – is hysterical!  I saw it about 3 weeks ago and loved it!  Another good movie is Mona Lisa Smile.  I have started taking myself out to the movies in CO to destress away from home.  I like to go to the movies.
Also – Bill and I are a thing of the past, I guess.  We got into a small misunderstanding on 17 Dec and he became very angry with me.  He hasn’t spoken to me since 16 Dec at the bowling lanes.  The last I heard from him was a voicemail he left me at the office on 17 Dec.  He sent me 3 emails filled with anger so I decided it was best that we leave each other alone.  I sent him and his daughter XMAS presents and he never acknowledged them.  I came home early on XMAS Eve just in time to see him pull up to my house and leave something in my mailbox.  He didn’t even stick around to say hello or goodbye.  He left me a XMAS card and a gift certificate for XMAS.  I called him at his house to say “Thanks” and he wasn’t home so I left a voice mail.  I tried calling him again b4 I went to bed on XMAS Eve and he didn’t answer.  I don’t know what else to do.  He sure was fun when we hung out at Starbucks together.  I guess all good things have to come to an end.  I miss his presence.  Any suggestions?  I am so glad he doesn’t know about my FOD!
Have a Happy New Year!

I am back in Colorado!  I enjoyed my trip home in GA!  No stress!  I miss my Mom and brothers already – actually b4 I left!  No word from the twins or my son and his wife.  It is quiet on the Western Front; I am going to bed.
Aunty Em – I don’t know what to think about Bill.  I do miss having Starbucks and deep discussions with him.  I miss how he could make me laugh.  I guess I will press on with my life.  I think tomorrow I will volunteer at the library.  I haven’t done that since I met Bill; it is time for new beginnings.  Yes, you can edit him out of the picture if you wish; who knows what the future holds for all of us in 2004.  I miss daily prayers with Bill, too.

17 years ago, I gave birth to 2 beautiful baby girls – one weighed 5lbs 4oz and the other weighed 5lbs 6oz.  Today is their 17th bday – or will be at 8pm tonite (officially – they arrived at 8pm by emergency c-section – 17 years ago).  They are in Georgia visiting with their Dad’s sister and family.  They will arrive home tonite at 8:30pm.  It will be a tense night.  As you know, we have had alot of turmoil in the home for quite awhile.
I wrote them a 3 page letter to explain why I felt the way I felt towards them.  My counselor suggested I do this.  I mailed it to them in NC to arrive AFTER Christmas.  Maybe I will share “the letter” in another entry.  I have decided to let them leave Colorado and live in FL with their Dad.  He is returning from the Marshall Islands to raise them this last year.  The girls don’t want to go, but yet they don’t want to follow the house rules with me.  They have “life friends” here – supposedly.  They tell their Dad they don’t want me to be left behind alone, but trust me – that is justa “front” to play on their Dad’s emotions.  I have mixed emotions about letting them go, but they are no longer “children” and are now young adults.  They must leave and hopefully turn their lives around for the better.
It was a trying year last year.  I cancelled Christmas in my home.  Can you believe that?  I didn’t put up a tree or ANY decorations except for displaying the Christmas cards I received.  Nikki – if you are reading this – thanks for the lovely card you sent from Australia!  Also – thanks to my OD friend in FL for her card and sharing those wonderful pics of your 9 year old son.  He is sure a cutie!
Yep – no Christmas shopping for me last year.  I did buy the girls something small and something for my older son his wife – for their home.  It was nice to have no additional stress with shopping and spending $ when that is NOT what Christmas is about! 
Showing up in GA to be with my Mom, brothers, and nieces was the best Christmas gift of all.  I was appreciated back there and felt “needed” and “loved”.
My older son stopped by to visit with me on Saturday.  We finally reconnected and shared some nice conversation.  He surprised his sisters by taking his wife and flying back to NC unannounced!  He was able to visit with family that he has not seen since 1997 on his step-Dad’s side.  All in all, I think everyone had a special Christmas this year and it was not “material” – it was from the heart with family.
Yes – a Christmas for the “true meaning” of holidays.  I will never 4get this Christmas.
Bill never communicated with me again.  I don’t understand, but I think it will become clear soon to me.  I sent him one last email to apologize for our misunderstanding and told him I did not know how to make it “right” but I was willing to try.  I guess that is all I can do 4 now.  I just thought it was not right to end on a “bad note”, but I guess that is how it will end.  Gee, I feel like I finally opened a door into my heart after 9+ years and my fingers were slammed on the way out!  I will be okay.  I am making plans to stay busy this year – especially since I will be living alone when the girls leave in March.  
I hope you all have great plans for the new year.  It is a new beginning so we have a chance to start over with a clean slate.

Three years ago today, I started writing in FOD.  It has been a very therapeutic release for me.  Thanks for listening and keeping Jake’s memory alive with the Random Act of Kindness Cards.  
Three years ago today, I had no clue where I would be in life.  I still miss my son and wonder what he would be like today.  He would be 12 years old.  Maybe he might have a girlfriend.  He would be in Middle School – 6th grade.  His sisters are now 17 and his brother is 24.  Our lives continue without Jake, but our lives are 4ever changed.  
September 24, 2000 – a day I will never 4get; the day Jake rode his gocart for the last time.

I bowled on Tuesday night and it was not a good start.  I started out with a 125 for my first game and a 95 for my second game!  One of the guys on the opposing team said, “You didn’t even bowl your temperature…ha, ha, ha.”  I had to think a minute; what did he mean?  Yeah – I didn’t break 100 – but bowl my temperature?  Oh!  I didn’t bowl at least 98.6, right!?  Well – I had a tremendous come back in my last game – 186!   Yay!
People keep asking me about Bill – so I tell them we had a misunderstanding and he got mad and hasn’t talked to me since December 16.  Yes, I will get over him when people quit asking about him, I guess.
Hmmm….I wonder if he ever figured out how to get to my OD.  I hope not – if so – Hey Bill – are you over it yet?

Yesterday I woke up after a very strange dream.  I dreamed that Jake was lost.  In my dream, he was very young – about 4 or 5.  I dreamed that he was playing with friends and just disappeared.  I could not understand why nobody else seemed to not notice or “care” that Jake was not home.  I was very upset in this dream and was trying so hard to find him and bring it to everybody’s attention.  Then I woke up and I was trying to remember where Jake was.  It took me a few minutes, but then I remembered that Jake was gone.  He left us behind on September 24, 2000.  He was involved in a tragic gocart accident that Sunday afternoon.  He was only 9 years old.  He could have been 29 years old and I would still miss him.  It just doesn’t seem right to live without your children. 
Strange dream.  I dreamed he disappeared yesterday – but it has been 3 years and almost 4 months ago.
I don’t understand that dream. 
I miss Jake.  We all miss Jake.

That is what my counselor tells me when I tell her I have to “play the mind game” with the twins to survive.  Becky said she was probably going to get kicked out of school for her attendance problems.  I said (calmly), “What is your plan if this happens?”  She replied, “I will go to another school and catch the bus, I guess.”  I calmly replied, “Sounds like a good plan, Becky.” So my ‘love and logic’ classes are being applied daily and my counselor calls it “the voice of reality”. Wow – what a concept.
Renee was so angry at me last week she said, “You sound like a 17 year old – not a 42 year old.”  I had to bite my tongue!  I almost thanked her for subtracting 3 years from actual age.  I think stress must add to my youthfulness…LOL.  I shared this with my counselor, too, and she cracked up laughing.  I believe my sense of humor is very therapeutic and cheaper than therapy!

Well yesterday – 29 Jan 04 at 9:43am, my girls’ schoolmate – age 17 – had a beautiful baby girl – 6lbs 3oz.  I excused my girls from school because I thought supporting their friend in labor was a “real world” lesson they could not learn in a high school classroom.  
It was an emotional experience for everyone – the new Mom, her parents, the new Mom’s school friends.  The baby was named Paige Lynn and is being placed for adoption.  The adoptive parents were at the hospital, too.
My daugther thought it was just amazing that “ball of life” was created from months of being pregnant.  She said the baby had her Mom’s lips…..(sigh).  Someone told the Mom that and she just cried.  Keep her in your prayers, because this is going to impact her for the rest of her life.

I bought a 1988 Nissan truck for a great price in Oct 2003.  It had 168,000+ miles and I got it below book! Alot below book – $500 is all I paid.  Well, I had it checked out at my trustworthy mechanic and put some more $ into it replacing things that needed replacing and I was still BELOW book value!  I was so psyched.  I bought it from a guy in my grief group.  It belonged to his son whom he had lost 5 or so years ago.  His son died in a house fire when he was 23.  So his Dad kept his truck.  When he decided to sell it – I bought it.  It is green; Jake’s favorite color.  It is so cute – old, automatic, some body damage…it has lots of character!
Well, one day about 3 weeks after I purchased it, I was coming home from a Compassionate Friends Steering Group meeting and got creamed in an intersection!  Yep – big time bummer.  A young boy (20 years old) hit me as I was about to clear the intersection.  He got out of his car with an unhappy look and said, “WHAT do you think YOU were DOING?”  I was looking at my poor old truck with a busted radiator spewing fluid all over the intersection, then I looked at him and said, “I was going thru a green light.  What were YOU doing?”  He said, “My light was GREEN.”  So anyway, my truck was totalled and his Ford Probe looked like an accordion in the front.  Since the cop could not establish who was wrong and there were no witnesses – his insurance did not pay for my car and my insurance did not pay for his.  Since my car was so old and I only carried liability on it – it was out of my pocket.  So with what I paid to get it fixed —- well just say — I have about the book value invested in this little old truck.  It runs again, but I am scared it is a moving target so I don’t drive it too much.
Jake was probaby looking down on me and keeping me safe.  The young boy who previously owned this truck was probably looking down on me and saying, “Man!  She wrecked my truck!”  Anyway, the moral to this story is – sometimes a good deal will cost you later.

I went and saw Mystic River Saturday.  This is a great movie – long but an attention-getter from the beginning til the end!
Where else can you go for some peace and quiet?  Even if I choose a movie that is not that good – it is a great place to crash for a nap for $5.  Best $5 I have ever spent for peace!  Of course, I will pay the $7.50 evening rate just to get away from the teenage scene and drama at my house.  As a matter of fact, there is a new movie coming out – Teenage Drama Queen.  If I didn’t know better, I would think my twins wrote this!  LOL.

Ok – well – I do!  They used to call them Thongs or Flip Flops!  Now “Thongs” are worn like panties….anyway.  I decided to make a surprise Valentine bag for each of the girls.  Well – I do know they wear “thongs” instead of “panties” – something about trying to avoid a “pantyline”…  So anyway – I go shopping and have no clue where to find this new “lingerie” – so I wander over to the “lingerie” aisle.  Can you imagine how embarassed I am – 46 years old – looking for “thongs”!  I so wanted to shout out – “These are not for me!  They are 4 my teenagers!”  So anyway, I pick out 4 each for both girls – 8 different ones!  Can you imagine how much work that was!  I thought the embarassment was over until I had to check out!  I just told the young checker that I had no idea what size or style to buy.  I said it was a gift for my girls.  I also shared with her how I first found out that they were wearing thongs.  I pulled them out of the washer and yelled out, “Something in the washer got shredded!”  It was a Kodak moment!

Renee and I checked out a movie Sunday – 22 Feb.  Yes!  I DID invite her sister, but she turned me down as usual.  Anyway, the movie was interesting – The Girl with the Pearl Earring.  We went to the downtown theatre in the Springs – The Kimball Twin Peaks Cinema.  This is the coolest place to see a movie.  There are no crowds and loitering like you find at the mall theatres.  You can actually enjoy beer and/or wine while watching the movie!  I don’t really care for either, but I did order a Steve Mcqueen sandwich with a coffee – tall white chocolate non-fat mocha.  Their coffee is actually better than Starbucks – in my opinion.  It is cheaper, too!  I might just hang out there once and awhile and sip a coffee and watch people some weekend evening – plus check out another movie!  It was a fun time with Renee.  I wished Becky joined us that night.
Ok – the latest at home?  Let’s just say – drama continues.  I have 24 more days til they leave with their Dad to FL – Oops!  Did I say that like I was countin’ or somethin’!  I saw a paralegal today to get the custody status in order.  After writing that check – you know how many Starbucks I could have purchased with that check?  You don’t even want to know……
My ex will be in the state sometime next month.  I haven’t seen him in almost 3 years – he left the country 18 months after Jake’s tragic accident.  I must say, I am very glad that he is coming back to raise our girls their last year of high school.  I have thanked him and warned him about them all in the same breath.
I am thinking of becoming an instructor for Love and Logic.  I would like to offer a class “Parenting Teens With Love and Logic” this summer.  There is NOT a class available here and I think I might have a packed classroom!  How does this sound for my first lesson:  I walk into the classroom in a suit of armor and lift the face shield and say “Welcome to the Parenting Teens With Love and Logic class.  Be brave.  Be very brave.”  Then I leave the classroom and change into my casual clothes (i.e. sweats or bluejeans) and begin the first lesson.  
There is a class offered in Golden, Colorado in May this year on becoming an instructor in Love and Logic.  What do you think?  It is a 3 day class – Thur – Sat.  It costs $395, but it might be worth it.

When my daughter decided to runaway and tell everyone I kicked her out of the house – she also told me she recorded me saying “..get the f–k out of my house!”  Ouch!  Not only is that untrue, but can you imagine what the parents of her friends thought about me?  Well, always remember this ‘what other people think of me/you is not my/your business’.  Anyway – in order to close out a runaway report, I had to bring my runaway to the police department to be fingerprinted and photographed.  Boy – this was beginning to be alot of work for me!  So – she shows up 4 days later.  I decide there is already too much drama so I will wait until the next day to close out the runaway report.  Well, she becomes uncooperative.  So I reach back into my brain for some ‘love and logic’ application.  So I tell her, “You have a choices here about closing out this runaway report.  First choice – you and I can go to the police station together and close it out OR second choice – I call call for a police officer to pick you up and he/she will take you to the police station and I will meet you there.  Also, be sure and bring your recorded statement of me kicking you out of the house.  I don’t recall telling you what you said I told you.  I would like to hear the statement myself.  I wonder what I sounded like saying the f-word.  Also, maybe the police will place ME outside this home.”  Well – to make a long, dramatic scene short – we ended up going together to close out this report – 3 nights LATER!  You have to have patience with this love and logic thing or it will never work.  The key is – always remember who the problem belongs to.  In this case – I didn’t run away.  I filed a report because I did not know where she went despite her story to the police – she claimed I knew where she was the whole time.  Sigh….23 more days of this soap opera at my house.  What will I ever do with myself when they are gone?  Hmm….maybe I will write a book – Taking Off the Suit of Armor Was a Breath of Fresh Air – Literally!  Maybe if my class takes off – I will fly my daughters out here to make guest appearances for my class!
Actually, I plan to go to the movies alot and post all my reviews in my OD!  Who knows – this may lead to a second career…LOL.

Jake’s best friend came to visit me tonite.  He is now a 7th grader and very tall.  Jake would have been a 6th grader since I held him back in 3rd grade.  Jake’s friend’s name is Johnny.  He came over with his Mom, brother, and little sister.  His sister is 3 and his brother is 10.  We had pizza and fun conversation.  Johnny talked about Jake and it was great to hear the stories.  He mentioned Jake’s skateboard so I took him into Becky’s room (Jake’s former bedroom) and pointed out Jake’s skateboard.  He seemed uncomfortable going in the room, but it is so different now.  He spent the night with Jake the night b4 Jake’s tragic accident.  He remembers all the details of that last night of fun they had together.  He and I had a great time together.  I plan to spend more time with him when my girls leave for FL.  I plan to take Johnny out to a movie and catch up with everything that I have missed out on since Jake left us 3 years, 6 months, and 12 days ago……

Well – I wrote about my green truck, right?  Remember…1988 Nissan pickup….green…bought way below book price, etc.  Remember I wrecked it 3 weeks later in an intersection collision?  Remember they “totalled” it but I had it fixed?  Anyway, my great deal was not great anymore – I ended up spending probably what it was worth in the beginning (Blue Book value) to fix it…well…
I only drive it in good weather.  Since it is a truck, it probably would not do well in snow.  So I try to take advantage of the good weather and enjoy my little truck.  So – today was a nice day and I decided to drive it to work.  
By the end of the work day – I was driving home and this Colorado weather changed – as usual.  It started precipitating and then it started sleetin’.  So – I thought ok – I will be fine.  I was driving along and decided to turn on my windshield wipers and then the weirdest <- is that a word? -> well – the most weird thing happened…my driver’s side wiper jumped off the winshield and was hanging on the side mirror of my truck!  Yep!  I felt like I was on Candid Camera or something.  So – I rolled down my window and tried to throw it back on the windshield with no luck.  I pulled over to a gas station and got out and fixed it.  As I was driving back onto the street on my way home – the wiper got stuck and would not do anything.  So here I am…driving along…on a sleetin’ Colorado rush hour evening with just the passenger side wiper workin’.  Hmmm…so I pull over again and try to fix it with no luck.  So I finally made it home with one wiper working.  So…I guess I will be workin’ on this truck this weekend….the joys of driving a “piece of crap” … at least it is paid for, right?  Many times over….LOL.
Another day in the life of Jake’s Mom….

Now this is something to share!  So – yesterday, I am busy working on my computer and decide to check my email.  There is an email from the Single Parent’s Group I once attended with Bill.  Basically, they are announcing that “movie night” will be held at his house this Saturday.  Hmmmmmm…it continues to say…bring something comfortable to sit on, your favorite munchies, and kids are welcome.  He is providing the pizza.  So….
I forward him that email announcing that I am tentatively RSVPing for 2 people – myself and a male guest.  I tentatively plan to bring eggrolls for everyone!
So – I imagine he is wondering what he is going to do when I show up with my “guest”.  While he is wondering – – I plan to be with friends at a “real movie” and NOT at his house – ever!
So – I guess Bill is “trolling” for women in the single-parent’s group now.  That’s nice to know – I wish him luck!  I have moved on to more adventures these days – bowling, movies and eating out with my lady friends.  I am actually enjoying myself.
9 more days until my girls move to FL with their Dad – oops – did that sound like I was counting?
By the way, this year’s Compassionate Friends National is being held at the end of July in Hollywood, CA!  The theme is “Hollywood – where our children are the stars”.  Nice, huh?  If Queen La Freaka is reading this – how far away do you live from Hollywood? I am curious.  I don’t plan go to CA this year.  I will take Jake with me somewhere else to spend time with him in my heart.

0700L would mean 7am local time.  The twins left with their Dad to begin a new life in Florida.  Becky was the drama queen til the end so her Dad got first hand knowledge.  In a nutshell, he arrived last Thursday and Becky was Missing In Action.  Go figure….  So we find her on Friday morning – we have the big scene – the cussing scene with the overused word F_ CK coming from her mouth.  She is hanging with a friend whose Mom reported her as a runaway.  So the Mom comes to my place after lunch looking for her runaway daughter.  I invite her in to take her daughter.  Daughter refuses to leave with Mother.  Mother calls the police….and you can guess the rest of the excitement at my house.
Today was my first full workday since I can remember since January.  It was nice.  I will be traveling to CA in May for business.  Queen La Freaka, where is Seal Beach and how far away are you from there?  If not too far, we can hook up maybe for dinner? 
I will also be traveling to FL on business, but lets keep that a secret.  I don’t want the twins to find out and stowaway on my plane back to CO.  Oops!  Did I say that outloud?!
My new life will be busy.  Becky left her room “trashed” so that will be another adventure into the “unknown” world of teenage life.  I plan to paint and re-decorate that room – maybe make it a sitting room or do it up in Strawberry Shortcake – Becky’s favorite character these days.  I will definitely be busy.
It is quiet here.  The phone is not ringing.  The “band boys” are not crashed in my family room.  There are actually leftovers from Saturday night.  It is quiet.  I like it.  The door bell is not ringing.  I like my new life.
I did thank my ex for coming to my rescue.
Until next time….I am going now to enjoy the solitude stretched out on my couch.
Yes, I like this alot!
By the way – Renee and I went out last Friday – 11 March.  We saw the new Johnny Depp movie – The Secret Window.  It was great, but it scared me.  Renee thinks JD is so hot!  He is very attractive.  I think Renee and I have similar tastes in men.  It was a nice night with Renee.  Becky pushed me away everytime I made an attempt to plan something with her.  I tried and I lost out trying to make our parting moments civil.
I wonder if their Dad visited Jake at the cemetery.  I heard he took his other son out to a movie, dinner, and shared an ice-cream.  That was nice.  His other son needed to be with him because he misses his Daddy.  He hasn’t seen his Daddy for 2 years.  He is 6 years old now.  He needs his Daddy to show him he cares.  His Dad did.  It was nice.
I miss Jake.  I always will.  Good night, Jake. I love you and miss you very, very much.
I miss the twins, but this was the best decision for everyone involved – to let them move to FL to get a new start.  They will always be my kids and I will always be their Mom.  I will probably hear from Renee, but I am sure Becky will not contact me.  Why?  Because she is 17 and she “knows everything she needs to know about life”.  I will miss her.  
Life has been quite the ride for me and my family.  When will the bus stop and let me off?  I am tired of the ride.

I have survived the drama-less home life.  I am starting week 3 today without the girls.  It has been quiet – very quiet, but I like it that way.  I miss Renee’s guitar playing that would serenade me to sleep.  I don’t miss the constant arguing with Becky everyday and night.  It is nice to go to bed knowing that that the girls are home with their Dad in FL – at least I hope Becky is there and not slipping out at night.
I have communicated regularly with Renee.  She calls me and emails me.  I have not heard from Becky – just the rude remarks she makes in the background when her sister is talking to me on the phone.  I guess Becky has written me off, but that is okay, too.  Her counselor emailed me from her new high school last week.  The counselor says she told Becky and her Dad that in order for Becky to graduate next Spring – she must attend summer school this June and go to day AND night school her Senior year to catch up all the credits she is behind.  I guess Becky will now realize how far behind she really is in school.  She made my life miserable from January til the day she left in March last month.  She skipped school regularly and despite how much she tried to hurt me – she hurt herself in the long run.  
Renee is not doing well with the transition to her new high school.  She feels so unwanted by all the kids there.  However, she says Becky has friends flocking around her.  I know both my girls are so different – like night and day.  I just encourage Renee to hang in there and do her best.  I hope it gets better for Renee.
Life at home is quiet and stress-free these days.  I switched teams at work and am learning a new task and it will involve some travel.  I may leave Wednesday for LA for a couple days to meet some people out there that I will be interfacing with.  I will probably spend an additional 2 weeks in CA in May doing some testing, too.  I enjoy my new work environment and it keeps me very busy.  It is nice to be at work full-time again.  All my teammates are professional team-players, too – so that makes work even more enjoyable.
I experienced my first massage.  Ugh!  I went in with no problems and I have been aching since I got outta there.  I guess these “deep-massages” are too intense for me.  It was “different” that’s for sure.  I think I can do without a massage in my routine.  I would rather have a pedicure once a month instead of a massage.  I would rather walk 3 miles everyday than have a massage.  I think I would rather do anything than have another massage.
By the way, remember Bill?  He gave me a gift certificate for a massage as a XMAS present.  Here it is – 3+ months later and I finally redeem this certificate.  I thought about sending him an email to tell him that I went in for my massage, but then I thought – 4get it.  I have received another email from the Single Parents Family Ministry and it seems Bill is hosting ANOTHER movie night at his home – this time WITHOUT kids!  Is it obvious or is it just me that seems to think he is trolling these types of support groups trying to find women?  Oh – well – I wish him well.
I have to run.  This time change really screws up my internal clock!  I am not tired, but I know it will be a bear trying to be at work by 7am tomorrow.
It snowed this weekend in Colorado.  Thank goodness!  We need all the moisture we can get!

I met a friend for dinner tonite.  It was nice.  I finally tried one of those Bailey’s Shakes at Red Robin, too!  OMG!  It was totally worth every bit of the $5.99 price tag!  Yum!
Today I was quite surprised at work.  I was greeted by 3 managers congratulating me for being with the company for 5 years.  Wow – where does the time go when it passes us by.  I am getting a company paid 5-year luncheon and can invite up to 5 people – but more are welcome to attend but must pay their own tabs.  I am excited.  I will have a hard time choosing the initial 5, but I have an idea of who they will be.
Wednesday I leave for a business trip to CA and will return on Thursday night.  Friday is my day off.  Wow – what a busy and short week!
I continue to receive emails daily from Renee.  She is so unhappy in FL.  How can she be accepted by all those new people surrounding her at her new school?  Today she was knocked down in the cafeteria.  She spilled all her food on the floor and had no more money to buy another lunch tray.  It breaks my heart to hear these stories.  I wrote her back and suggested that she pack her lunch and go somewhere quiet to eat – away from all the mean kids.  Also – today – I put a couple packages in the mail to her to brighten up her day.  I also mailed her sister and her an Easter card with a Starbucks card inside.
Tomorrow is bowling.  I am going to be very tired this week.  My plane leaves for CA early on Wednesday morning – so I have to be at the airport by 5am – ugh!  Hopefully, I can catch some winks on the flight out before I head to my meetings.
It is raining tonite.  Thank goodness!  We need the moisture.  Maybe Jake is helping God pour out the rain tonite.  Thanks, Jake.  We need as much as you can pour for us.
Jake – watch over your sister, Renee.  She needs someone to help her withstand the troubles she is experiencing at her new school.  She never “fit in” like you did at school, Jake.  Watch over her, son.

Question:  How was my Tuesday?  Hectic!  Getting ready for a business trip – especially a short one was time consuming.  I was bringing a document out for review so I had to make sure it was ready and all the important people on my end reviewed it b4 it went out to the customer.  I did choose to bow out of bowling Tuesday night, too.  I just had too much do in too little time.
I woke up at 3am on Wednesday morning since my I had to be at the airport by 5am.  My trip out was nice, but I was exhausted by 9pm Wednesday night.  Thursday was nice, too.  I enjoyed meeting the people that I only in the past interfaced with via telecon.
We stayed at the Marriott in Manhatten Beach.  It was a very nice place.  After sleeping in a king-sized bed – I am sold on a bigger bed!  A king-size bed would take up a lot of room in my bedroom – so I guess I need a bigger bedroom, too.  Hmm……
We spent some time in the Manhattan Beach area, too.  I like the atmosphere of hanging with all the “locals” and “beach bums”.  CA sure is beautiful but the homes there are out of my price range.  I sure would like to go back there for a short vacation sometime with my kids.
Question:  Why don’t I let Renee live with me?  I cannot choose one over the other – it would not be fair.  Also, Renee broke the rules, too. She was not nearly as blatant about it as her sister, but she did break the rules and must endure the same consequence.
Sometimes I wonder if I smothered my girls too much by being involved with their lives.  Renee recently called me and informed me that their Dad left on Friday and will return on Monday.  Apparently he went to visit his girlfriend in Michigan.  Hmmmm….I never felt right leaving town when I had my girls; I always included them as a family.  I guess Becky is going to love her “new found freedom”.  I still have not heard from her but thru her sister. Becky wants me to send her some things she left behind.  You can imagine my response!
Anyway – I hope you all have a wonderful Easter.  I am going to shower and head over to Starbucks to read my Sunday paper, drink my favorite coffee, and reflect on life.
Maybe I will have something more to write about after my morning out.

I just watched Oprah.  Her topic was about “the worse day of your life”.  4 women were on the show.  2 of these women had ex-husbands that murdered their children.  
One of these ladies was out on her morning walk when her ex came to her home in the early hours of the morning.  He went into each of the kids’ rooms – all 4 kids were asleep.  He shot them all in the head while they were sleeping.  Then he turned the gun on himself.  Can you imagine coming home after a morning walk and finding this in your home?  I cannot even fathom the horror of experiencing this!  The kids ranged in ages from 5-teens.
Another lady received a call from her ex.  He called to say he murdered their 3 sons – ages 8, 10, and 12.  He then turned the gun on himself.  This lady has since remarried and has 2 more children – a son and a daughter.
Another lady left her car running while she went to grab something quick to eat or drink and a convict stole her car.  She tried to grab her 6 year old son from out of the backseat and saw him dragged to his death – tangled in his seatbelt.
Another lady left her 4 boys in her van while she ran into her apt for 2 minutes.  One of the kids started a fire and you can guess the rest.  They all survived, but the youngest one is scarred very badly.  He is 3 now and this happened a couple years ago.  All her boys have endured numerous surgeries.  
This was a very sad show today.

About a month ago, I was pulled over by a cop.  I was on my way home from work around 6pm.  I pulled over and this mean cop approaches my driver’s window and asks for my license, registration, and proof of insurance.
I give him my license and proof of insurance.  He says, “Your insurance is expired.”  Yea – well it wasn’t – I just could not find my current insurance card.  I think he made me nervous.  So  – I start rifling thru my glove compartment trying to find my registration and most current insurance card.  In my state of nervousness, I note that my registration is going to expire the next day – April 30.  Actually, it was current for at least another 30 days, but I was too nervous to remember that I had just mailed in the renewal form the same week!  So I tell the cop, “Please give me a few minutes to look for my stuff.  I am sure I have it all and it is current.”  So he asks me, “What is the story behind your plates?”  I have personalized plates that read J8XMOM (Jake’s Mom) – in memory of my son, right?  So I tell him, “I have personalized plates – Jake’s Mom (J8XMOM).”  So he continues to pry and says, “So what is the story behind your plates?”  Well, he pushed me too far – I look him straight in the eyes and say, “I have personalized plates – Jake’s Mom – in memory of my little boy who was killed almost 4 years ago in a go-cart accident.  He was hit by a 16 year old driver who drove through the barricades on a road closed to traffic.”  I said this all without breaking my voice.  He just looks at me and then I ask, once again for more time to look for my required paperwork.  He says I can continue looking while he runs my license through his system.  I continue to look for my stuff and decide that I am too nervous to look anymore.  He comes back to my window and says, “So did you find the information?”  I look at him and sigh and say, “No, Sir.  I cannot find my info so go ahead and write me up and I will bring my info to court.  I am sure I am current on all my information, but I just cannot find it.”  Well – then he give me my license back and tells me that he checked out my license and everything is current.  He gives me a verbal warning and lets me off!
I think Jake was looking out for me that night – I think there was a true connection with my son and that cop asking about my personalized plates, don’t you?
I actually think the cop let me off because he asked me once too many times about the “story behind my plates” and did not know how to apologize for his questions OR how to comfort a bereaved Mom.
I believe in Angels…because I personally know one….Jake.  I miss you, Jake.

As I was up getting ready for work on Friday morning..the radio was playing oldies and a Sarah McLaughlin song came on with the lyrics….”Will you remember me?….”…I was brushing my teeth as these lyrics came softly from the clock radio speaker…tears rolled down my cheeks.  Yes, Jake – I will remember you always….everyday..not just your bday.

On Jake’s Bday – I remembered him again with a Random Act of Kindness.  I left a a nice card in my motel room for the Housekeeping staff to share with them about my special little boy and his special 13th bday.  I put $ in the card and told them to do something special because they deserved it since they do such a nice job at the Embassy Suites.
So….Mouser…if you are reading this….have YOU used any of these Random Act of Kindness cards yet?  It was YOU that turned me on to them and I have certainly been using them ever since I read your entry about them.  I have other OD readers that ask for them, too – so they have traveled out of the state of Colorado into other mailboxes….thanks so much for sharing this idea with me.

Remember I wrote about Jake’s Bday and my Random Act of Kindness to the Housekeeping Staff at the Embassy Suites where I am staying while on business?
Well, I just stepped out of my room to put my laundry in the dryer.  I was gone less than 10 minutes.  I return to my room and there is a bag sitting by my laptop computer with a card with my name on it.  It is from the Housekeeping Staff!  The Housekeeping Staff signed the card with a note “Thank you for thinking of Housekeeping Dept.  You and your son are in our prayers.”  They left me a surprise in the bag.  It is a ceramic plaque that says, “Everyone needs a little place to call home”  
I am touched.  I will hang this plaque somewhere in my house when I return to Colorado.
The Housekeeping Staff did not have to do this!  They sure are sneaky – they must have been watching my room waiting for the opportune time to surprise me.  Well, I like surprises.  This was a surprise.
In memory of Jake, please remember the Housekeeping Staff when you have to stay away from home.  Embassy Suites sure has made my 2 weeks working in CA – very nice.  I am looking forward to being back in my own home next week.  I will miss the housekeeping service that I have had for 2 weeks.  It makes the long 11+ hour days…easier…alot easier to deal with….free housekeeping, free breakfast, free happy hours every night….
I am ready to go home.  I leave to attend a cousin’s wedding in Sacramento tomorrow.  I will be in Colorado Sunday night.  I am taking Monday off to recover and reacquaint myself with my cat.  Plus, I probably have tons of mail waiting for me at the post office.  Renee comes into Colorado on Wednesday.  She will be staying with her brother for 2 weeks.  I know she is going to “work on me” to take her back to Colorado for good….sigh…if it isn’t one problem, it is something else, right?  Life…an adventure of a lifetime.

Well, it has been a long, busy 2 weeks.  I am about tired of the LA airport.  I think I spend more time there than I have in my life!  I flew into there and connected with a flight to Santa Maria on 8 May.  I flew back into there on 22 May to connect with a flight to Sacramento.  THEN – I flew back into there to connect with a flight back to CO on 23 May.  So…I am exhausted right?
Well, I decide to make a quick trip to the Ladies Room to freshen up for my final flight home.  Well…as I rounded the corner looking for a stall – there is an airline pilot – MALE pilot – in the LADIES’ room!  I am so out of sorts trying to sort out this situation that I notice his lips are moving and he is talking to me.  He says something about making a big mistake and going in the wrong door and I mumble something like – wow – I am glad this is YOUR mistake – I was starting to think I walked into the wrong door.  So we both laugh as he exits and I contine to search for a stall…WITHOUT any males in there!  Talk about WAKE UP CALL – if I was exhausted when I went into that room – I was definitely more ALERT coming out of there.  Of all things…he was the pilot for my next flight out, too!

At the Evergreen Cemetary there is a huge circular garden – diameter is almost 23 feet!  It is called the Garden of Memories.  It was created in 1995 from donations.  Well, it really hasn’t been planted in about 3 years.  Our grief group adopted the garden.  The cemetary split the cost of flowers with us.  We planted red, white, and blue (probably more a purple color) petunias on Saturday.  We kinda eye-balled it and split it into 3 different sections – one for each color.  Then we kind of climbed in there and brought it to life.  I wish we could have brought our loved ones back to life…(sigh).  Anyway – it took us about 2.5 hours to complete our project.  It looks very nice.  I went back out there to show a friend on Sunday.  She said it turned out very nice.  We also have donated 2 benches overlooking the Garden so people can come out and remember their loved ones or just to escape from the hustle and bustle of life, work, chores, etc.  I think I will be going out there to read, drink my *Bucks, remember Jake and all the fun he brought to our family in his 9 years, and also to remember all our fallen troops in Iraq.  Have a nice Memorial Day.

…why do the birds go on singing, what makes the world go round?  Well, today I went to a BBQ with my son, his wife, and my daughter.  Yes, one of the twins is back in town.  I decided to go for a walk b4 we ate.  My daughter and I had an emotional discussion.  She wants to come back to CO, but I am not ready yet.  I have truly enjoyed the 9 week break from teenagers and things that come with teenagers.  She thinks I hate her.  She says her Dad agrees with her that she should move back to CO with me because she seems to do better with me.   Well, I am not buying into this notion of theirs.  She also says her twin sister does better in FL with her Dad and she wants to remain in FL.  Everyone seems to vote that the unhappy child should come back to CO.  Well, I am not ready and if I could pick a song to underscore my feelings…I would pick some lyrics from Elton John….”…don’t let the sun go down on me….”.  I think my entire life has been in and eclipse at several points along the way and I am finally seeing some sunshine….
Kids did not come with instructions and there is NOT a written/unwritten rule that you have to be your kid’s best friend.  Parents have to be in control and I am not relinquishing this control.  If her Dad cannot deal with twins then I suggest he start trying.  He has had them for 9 weeks and all he has to do is deal with them for less than a year.  I raised these kids for 17 years and he was involved for 8 of those years.  Even when I was married, I felt like a single parent.  Sorry…I just had to vent.  
I am packing up and leaving for LA tomorrow for business.  I am ironing my clothes and then I am headed out to *bucks with a good friend.  
The other twin will be here on the 4th of July.  She was the most defiant one.  Again, she will be staying with her brother and his wife.  I plan to leave town for a little sabattical of peace and harmony.  I cannot even imagine what it would be like if I crossed paths with this one!

Well, my brothers in GA love to go fishin’.  On one of their recent trips my brother Mark noticed something interesting hangin’ from a tree.  He pointed out his discovery to my brother Bob.  So upon closer investigation, they noted an owl was wound up in fishin’ line and was hangin’ from his wing.  Mark cut the line and freed Mr. Hooter – they named him Hooter.  Well, the owl was so relieved to be free he just hung around afterwards and watched my brothers fish.  When it was time to leave, Mark decided to take the owl home because he was worried something bad would happen to him again.  So he wrapped him up in his shirt and put him in a box and took  him home.  Later – he wrapped  him up in a towel so he could study the injured wing.  He ended up takin’ all the fishin’ line off his wing.  That owl was quite the bird.  When my brothers were fishin’, he stood absolutely still in one position on the riverbank watching them.  When my brother took him home, he let him walk around his house.  He said he was about 18 inches tall.  Then the owl disappeared and Mark found him in his closet asleep on some linens.  Mark said he could talk to the owl and sneak up and pet the back of Mr. Hooter’s head and Mr. Hooter would close his eyes and lean his head towards my brother – I guess like a cat would do if you pet a cat.  It is illegal to harbor an owl so my brother turned him over to a retired college professor who specializes in these types of animals.  I am sure he was taken to a vet and is now happy somewhere.  
I just thought this was the neatest thing to come upon at the river.  You never know what you will find hangin’ out at the river.
Mark said the owl was beautiful and had such “human” eyes.

>This is interesting…
> 
>Just in case you might think of Iraq as “only” an oil-rich nation, ruled by an evil dictator for 30 years, whether it has been supporting terrorists or may not be very important, here are a few important facts regarding the important history and roles that this nation has played down through history.
> 
>IRAQ — VERY INTERESTING — DID YOU KNOW?
> 
>1. The garden of Eden was in Iraq. (It sure doesn’t look much like Paradise on earth today thanks to Saddam)
> 
>2. Mesopotamia which is now Iraq was the cradle of civilization!
> 
>3. Noah built the ark in Iraq.
> 
>4. The Tower of Babel was in Iraq.
> 
>5. Abraham was from Ur, which is in Southern Iraq!
> 
>6. Isaac’s wife Rebekah is from Nahor which is in Iraq.
> 
>7. Jacob met Rachel in Iraq.
> 
>8. Jonah preached in Nineveh – which is in Iraq.
> 
>9. Assyria which is in Iraq conquered the ten tribes of Israel.
> 
>10. Amos cried out in Iraq!
> 
>11. Babylon which is in Iraq destroyed Jerusalem.
> 
>12. Daniel was in the lion’s den in Iraq!
> 
>13. The 3 Hebrew children were in the fire in Iraq (That’s good news to know that JESUS has been in Iraq too as the 4th person in the fiery furnace!)
> 
>14. Belshazzar, the King of Babylon saw the “writing on the wall” in Iraq.
> 
>15. Nebuchadnezzar, King of Babylon, carried the Jews captive into Iraq.
> 
>16. Ezekiel preached in Iraq.
> 
>17. The wise men were from Iraq. (where are the “wise” men today?)
> 
>18. Peter preached in Iraq.
> 
>19. The “Empire of Man” described in Revelation is called Babylon which was a city in Iraq!
> 
>And you have probably seen this one. Israel is the nation most often mentioned in the Bible. But do you know which nation is second? It is Iraq! However, that is not the name that is used in the Bible. The names used in the Bible are Babylon, Land of Shinar, and Mesopotamia. The word Mesopotamia means between the two rivers, more exactly between the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers. The name Iraq, means country with deep roots. Indeed Iraq is a country with deep roots and is a very significant country in the Bible. Here’s why.
> 
>* Eden was in Iraq–Genesis 2:10-14 * Adam &Eve were created in Iraq–Genesis 2:7-8 * Satan made his first recorded appearance in Iraq–Genesis 3:1-6 * Nimrod established Babylon &Tower of Babel was built in Iraq– Genesis 10:8-97; 11:1-4 * The confusion of the languages took place in Iraq–Genesis 11:5-11 * Abraham came from a city in Iraq–Genesis 11:31; Acts 7:2-4 * Isaac’s bride came from Iraq–Genesis 24:3-4; 10 * Jacob spent 20 years in Iraq–Genesis 27:42-45; 31:38 * The first world Empire was in Iraq–Daniel 1:1-2;2:36-38 * The greatest revival in history was in a city in Iraq–Jonah 3 * The events of the book of Esther took place in Iraq–Esther * The book of Nahum was a prophecy against a city in Iraq–Nahum * The book or Revelation has prophecies against Babylon, which was the old name for the nation of Iraq–Revelation 17 &18
> 
>No other nation, except Israel, has more history and prophecy associated it than Iraq.
> 
>And also…
> 
>This is something to think about! Since America is typically represented by an eagle. Saddam should have read up on his Muslim passages… The following verse is from the Quran, (the Islamic Bible)
> 
>Quran (9:11) — For it is written that a son of Arabia would awaken a fearsome Eagle. The wrath of the Eagle would be felt throughout the lands of Allah and lo, while some of the people trembled in despair still more rejoiced; for the wrath of the Eagle cleansed the lands of Allah; and there was peace

I stumbled across an interesting book at amazon.com  The author is Joan Anderson.  She wrote 3 books in a series.  Her first book, A Year by the Sea:  Thoughts of an Unfinished Woman – is about her escape to a beach cottage to find herself.  Apparently after over 20+ years of marriage and raising 2 grown sons, she felt she “needed to find herself”.  It was a very interesting book.
I will finish her second one tonite – An Unfinished Marriage.  This book is about her husband retiring and joining her in the cottage.  
I already have her 3rd book standing by to be read – A Walk on the Beach.
I really have been enjoying her books when I find the time to read – like on airplanes when I am traveling for business, drinking *Bucks on my lunch hour and reading, etc.

Those books by Joan Anderson are interesting and filled with quotes.  I bookmarked this quote because it is so deep:
Your children are not your children.  They come through you but not of you.  Though they are with you, they belong not to you.  You may give them your love, but not your thoughts, for they have their own thoughts.  (Kahlil Gibran)
Hmmm…now I know why my daughter always said, “I am my own person…..”

I just had my house painted by College Pro.  A group of college kids did the painting.  College Pro trained them how to run a business, paint, and book appointments.  They did a wonderful job.  
Today I was outside cleaning out my garage and the neighbor from across the street came over.  He thought I was moving….house is painted, stuff in the driveway…..  Isn’t it amazing how people jump to conclusions?
Well, my neighbor is from India.  He and I have a communication problem, but somehow we manage to get by.  I use that universal language…thumbs up and a big smile when I see him and his wife.  His and daughter speak English much better than their parents and I chat with them when I see them.
As I was unpacking items in the garage, I opened a couple boxes with Jake’s things.  It was heartwrenching.  Some dust has settled in his clothes.  I need to re-wash them, but I just don’t think I can handle that now.  I have been thinking of him alot lately and have been very sad.  I think since the twins are now out of my hair – I am actually grieving Jake’s loss.  I didn’t have time to grieve until now?
Anyway – we are getting alot of rain and we NEED IT!  It has rained off and on since Monday or Tuesday.  It is actually chilly outside – in the 50s!
Yesterday, my team at work went to an off-site at Red Robin.  It was relaxing and enjoyable.  I had a Baileys shake!  You  must try one of these.  If you are reading this, Mouser – we need to meet at Red Robin next month when you come out and have a Baileys shake.  It is yummy!
Update on the twins:  Renee and I had a falling out during her visit here recently.  She wanted to come back to CO for her Sr. year and I declined.  The last time I spoke with her was on 3 June.  I was in LA and I called her to let her know I would be back in town that night.  I wanted to do something with her, but she made it very clear that she was waiting on phone call from one of her friends – so I let her go.  She never called me.  It has been over 2 weeks since that last phone call – life goes on…  Her sister will be out next month for 2 weeks – staying with her brother – like Renee did.  I KNOW I won’t hear from her.  Drama – something I don’t need.  
So…today is Friday and I still have the weekend to finish cleaning out the garage.  I am having a new garage door installed on Monday and I MUST have the garage cleaned out by then – nothing like a little pressure this weekend…LOL.  So I will load up my little Nissan truck and make a large donation to Goodwill, too. (Nothing of Jake’s will be donated).

RYN – yes to all.  She is not ‘fitting in’ at her new school.  She says people make fun of her and generally are not nice to her.  She says her Dad doesn’t want her and doesn’t understand her.
I have listened via emails, phone conversations, letters, and a face-to-face when she was out staying with her brother a couple weeks ago.  I tried to explain to her that she needs to “try” harder in her new situation.  I don’t think 2 months was fair to judge a new situation.
My older son experienced what I have been experiencing when she visited with him.  He witnessed how she was never home and how she “bought” her friends.  She wined and dined her friends and went thru $250 in almost 5 days!  She had to borrow $ from her brother to pay a friend to take her to the airport.  She missed her plane and her Dad had to pay $100 to re-book her on another flight.
I tried to explain to her that friends should not be “bought”.  I told her that her friends should have wined and dined her since SHE was the one outta of the circle for 2 months. She and I are so different.
I will say I was proud to hear that she wrote her brother a card and did send him $ to pay her debt.
I guess most people call it “Tough Love”, but I was fair about them staying in CO.  All I had was 3 basic rules:  Be home by curfew, no unexcused tardies or absences (a more diplomatic way of saying “no skipping!”), and decent grades.  The consequence was -> they would live with their Dad if they could not follow my rules.  They chose to leave CO when they broke the rules.  I honestly think they did not think I would let them go or that their Dad would not show up to get them…but they were wrong.
I can only imagine how tough it must be for her to make new friends and live in another state with her Dad.  She has more liberty with her Dad because he does not supervise them as closely as I did.  He leaves them alone and goes out of state to visit his girlfriend in Michigan.  He leaves them home alone.  I know of 2 times that this has happened.  I just hope he doesn’t regret giving them this much freedom and that nothing happens to them.
I still have not heard from her sister since she left on 21 Mar.  I finally “cleaned up” the mess she left her room in.  I have repainted the room and put up a nice border.  It looks very nice.  I might sleep in there tonite.  As far as I am concerned – this one will not step foot in my home again unless there is good indication that she has grown up and can respect my home.
On a positive note – both are working about 26 hours a week and walking to and from work.  They never did that in CO.  They just complained and treated me like an ATM machine.
As for me – I have my home back.  It is peaceful.  I can focus on work.  I can come and go as I please and everything is under control again.  I have no more headaches with a houseful of teens everyday after work and after I go to sleep.  I like my “empty nest”.
Do I miss them?  Yes.  
I have written to them and you and I both know – mail works both ways.  I have called them and left messages.  The phone works both ways, too.
Tonite I cooked dinner for the 3rd time since they left.  I invited my son and his wife over.  A good bachelor friend of mine stopped by to see my new paint job on the house.  I invited him to stay for dinner, too.  We all had a nice family dinner.  I like things like that.  The twins didn’t.  However, they sit down every night for dinner with their Dad – so he must be doing something right.
Sometimes you don’t realize how good you have it until you don’t have it anymore.  I think I gave more than 100% in effort trying to raise these girls.  I am sorry it didn’t work out.  I am sorry their Dad and I divorced when they were 8.  I am very sorry that their little brother died when they were 13.  I cannot remarry their Dad and I cannot bring Jake home.  I guess we don’t live in a perfect world.

I was not with Jake when he had his accident.  But from everyone that talked to me, I believe it was instant.  I believe he was knocked out and never regained consciousness.  He was with my ex when he was riding his go-cart.  This was the second time he was hit by a car when my ex was supposed be supervising him.  He was hit in June of 2000.  I warned his Dad then to keep an eye on Jake.  September 24, 2000 – he was hit again.  Those days are like a blur.  I do remember holding Jake’s hand and crying when I got to the hospital.  He was on life support.  He looked like he was sleeping.  I miss him.  I hope he knows that we loved him every minute we had him with us – 9 years, 4 months, and 10 days.  I believe in angels.  I have one watching over us.

I went to Weight Watchers on Saturday.  I went to a later meeting.  I usually go to the 0730 meeting or the 0900 meeting.  This time I checked out the 1230 meeting.
There were not many people there.  I could not believe our leader told us she once weighed in without her underwear!  She says she put it on in the bathroom afterwards.  She said she has heavy underwear.  Hmmmm…..I think that is sharing a bit too much information.
I once shared that I did not lose any weight one week but my underwear felt loose!  Everyone laughed.  I like to hear people laugh.  I was NOT kidding!  I was telling the truth.
Weight Watchers works!  It is also entertaining.

September is a not a good month for me.  The leaves change and the air is cool.  I like this about September….but Jake left us in September…almost 4 years ago….so September is also the month that changed our lives 4ever….
I had a nice trip to GA despite the heat and humidity.  I was not able to see my kids due to the hurricane down there.  I was not able to take my out on any extended road trips due to the weather, but I am going back for Thanksgiving and taking her to Plains, GA.  Plains is where former President Jimmy Carter lives.  His presidency actually put Plains on the map!
I need some advice.  I pay a substantial amount of child support for my girls, but they are not benefiting from it at all.  It seems they are required to use their own money for groceries and clothes and necessities.  They have told me this numerous times.  I am considering sending them money next month – directly and subtracting it from the child support payment.  I will send the balance to my ex.  Should I or should I not?  With the money, I am requesting the girls to send me all receipts so that I know they are using it for clothes, school items, prescriptions, doctor visits (he has not taken them to the doctor either and Renee is sick), etc.
All I know about their Dad is that he spends quite a bit of time traveling (via plane) to Michigan to see his girlfriend.  I feel my child support money is either funding his trips or just paying his rent.  Should he not be supervising his children more and providing them the necessities?  If I am venting, I am sorry.  It just irks me to no end!  He was in Michigan when Hurricane Charlie hit Orlando.  He managed to be around for Hurricane Frances, but left on Labor Day to return to Michigan.  Now I can only hope that Hurricane Jeanne bypasses Florida!

It was 4 years ago that my youngest son had his tragic gocart/auto accident.  He was the youngest of my 4 kids.  He was 9 years old.  I will never 4get that day.
My 3 children called to tell me that they were thinking of me today.  It was nice to hear from them.  It was very special to know that today they remembered their brother.  The girls called from Florida and my son called after work.
We all miss Jake.  It seems with our broken family (divorce, loss of Jake, the girls moving to FL, etc.) we still try to keep it all together…in the small things that we do.
Today, my Random Act of Kindness was leaving extra money at the check out at Pikes Perk to buy someone else’s coffee in memory of a very special child whose laugh we miss.  We miss his mischief.  We miss his pranks.  We just miss that ray of sunshine…..We miss you, Jake!
Another Hurricane is going to hit FL this weekend.  My girls are home alone.  Their Dad left to go to N. Georgia.  He will be back on Monday.  He will leave them again on Thursday to go back to Michigan.  Maybe this is how he deals with Jake’s absence.  
Good night OD Land and thanks for listening for the past 3+ years.

My neighbor came over to sell me some cookie dough for her school – Fremont Elementary – Jake’s school for 3 weeks…sigh.  She was in Kindergarten when Jake had his accident – now she is a grade ahead of Jake, when he died.  Jake was in 3rd grade when he had his accident.  She is now in 4th grade and the same age as Jake was…9 years old.  She is tall and growing up.  
I bought some cookie dough.  Pecan-coconut.
It is October now.  The leaves are changing colors and it is getting brisk outside.
My ex is getting remarried on May 5th – in Michigan.  This will be good for him.  
Have a great Friday night.  Tomorrow I am taking a friend to Weight Watcher’s in the morning and then off to *Bucks!  Yum!

Subject: Rules for living in the southIf you are going to live in or visit the South, you need to know the rules.
In an effort to help outsiders understand the rules of the Southerner’s mind, the following list will be handed to each person as they  enter a Southern State.
(These actually should be the rules in all states.)
1. That farm boy you see at the gas station did more work before breakfast than you do all week at the gym.
2. It’s called a “gravel road.” No matter how slow you drive, you’re going to get dust on your Lincoln Navigator.  Drive it or get it out of the way!
3. The red dirt — it’s called clay. Red clay. If you like the color, don’t wash your car for a couple weeks — it’ll be permanent.
4. We all started hunting and fishing when we were seven years old. Yeah, we saw that Bambi movie, too. We got over it.
5. Go ahead and bring your $600 Orvis fly rod.  Don’t cry to us if a flathead breaks it off at the handle.  Wehave a name for those little 13-inch trout you fish for: “bait”.
6. Pull your pants up! You look like an idiot.
7. If that cell phone rings while a bunch of mallards are making their final approach, we will shoot it.  You might want to ensure it’s not up to your ear at the time.
8. No, there’s no “Vegetarian Special” on the menu.  Order steak. Order it rare.  Or, you can order the Chef’s Salad and pick off the two pounds of hamand turkey.
9. Tea — yeah, we have tea. It comes in a glass over ice and it’s sweet.  You want it hot? Set it in the sun.  You want it unsweetened? Add alot of water.
10. You bring Coke into my house, it better be brown, wet, and served over ice!
11. You have a sixty-thousand-dollar car.   We’rereal  impressed. We have a quarter of a million-dollar combine that we only use two weeks a year.
12. Let’s get this straight. We have one stoplight in town. We stop when it’s red.  We may even stop when it’s yellow.
13. We eat dinner together with our families.  We pray  before we eat — yeah, even breakfast.  We go to church on Wednesdays and Sundays, and we go to high school football games on Friday nights. We still address our seniors with “yes, sir” and “yes, ma’am,” and we sometimes still take Sunday drives around town to see friends and neighbors.
14. We don’t do “hurry up” well.
15. Greens — yeah, we have greens, but you don’t putt on them!  You boil them with salty fatback, bacon or a smoked hog jowl.
16. Yeah, we eat catfish, bass, bream and carp.  You really want sushi and caviar?  It’s available down at the bait shop.
17. They are pigs. That’s what they smell like. Get over it. Don’t like it? Interstate 65 goes two ways, Interstate 10 goes the other two. Pick one.
18. Grits are corn. You put butter, salt, and maybe even some pepper  on them.  If you want to put milk and sugar on them, then you want cream of wheat — go to Kansas.  That would be I-40 West.
19. The “Opener” refers to the first day of deer season or dove season.  Both are holidays. You can get pancakes, cane syrup, and sausage before daylight at the church on either day.
20. So every person in every pickup truck waves? Yeah, it’s called being friendly.  Understand the concept?
21. Yeah, we have golf courses.   Don’t hit in the water hazards.  It spooks the fish and bothers the gators –and, if you hit it in the rough,  we have these things called diamondbacks, and they’re not baseball players.
22. That Highway Patrol Officer that just pulled you over for driving like an idiot –his name is “Sir,” no matter how young he is.
23. We have lots of pine trees. They have sap. It drips from them. You park your darn Navigator under them, and they’ll leave a souvenir on your hood.
24. You burn an American flag in our state, you get beat up. No questions.
The liberal contingent of our state legislature –all four of them enacted a measure to stop this.  There is now a $2.50 fine for beating up the flag burner.
American by Birth,……….. Southern by the Grace of God!

This weekend was great.  I did not run myself ragged as usual.  I invited my friend from India to attend a Weight Watchers meeting with me.  She was surprised to see all the shapes of people there.  Then we went to Starbucks.
Today I vegged out and stayed home.  I was watching old TV shows…like Flip Wilson.  That show is as funny today as when it was in the 80s!
I cooked a great dinner tonite.  I bought a book called “Saving Dinner”.  The lady that sends out the menu-mailer that I have written about b4 wrote this book.  She is a nutritionist.  Tonite I fixed “Apple Chicken” with rice and fresh green beans.  I made a chocolate cake for dessert.  My son and his wife came over and we had a nice visit.  They are going to GA for Thanksgiving and are going to spend some time in Savannah.  They was pretty excited.  They will be staying at Hilton Head Island, too!  Wow!
Everyone raved about the dinner, too.  My next adventure in the kitchen will be crock-pot stuffed peppers – – so it can cook while I am at work.
Did I tell you that one of the girls will be back in town on the 9th of October?  She will be here for a week visiting her best friend.  I don’t think it is the best use of her time since she will be missing an entire week of school, but her other parent seems to think it is ok.  She has missed so much school already with the hurricanes – at least 10 days!  I have to “let it go” …. as my counselor has advised…so I am letting it go.  If they don’t graduate in May – at least I save on a plane ticket since I won’t be going back there for their graduation if there is not one to attend…lol.
Have a great week.

I think my favorite season of the year is Fall.  I like the way the leaves change – especially the Maple and Aspen trees in Colorado.  I like the cool air in the mornings on the way to work.  I like the holiday scents and decorations thru out the Fall – October/Halloween, November/Thanksgiving, and December/XMAS.  I like the snow falling outside as I sit by my fireplace.  I like to see the excitement of children waiting to dress up for Halloween.  I like to see the excitement of children when they await Christmas Day to open their presents.
When my 9 year old little boy died in a tragic gocart/auto accident on September 24, 2000, the Holidays were not special anymore.  I think when you have little children children, they add the magic to the seasons, too.  Of course, I have other children and I tried my best to carry on.  I think I made it thru 2 Halloweens since Jake’s death -> then I decided to go to the movies on Halloween…(sigh).
This will be my 4th Halloween, Thanksgiving, and XMAS without Jake.  Where does the time go?  It is funny how life continues on after your own has been tragically changed.
Jake loved the Fall, too.  He loved the Holidays.  He loved the snow.  He loved us and we loved him.  We miss him….

I stopped in Walgreens yesterday, on my way home from work.  I studied all the Halloween decorations.  I thought about how captivated Jake would have been looking at all the things available these days.  
I left Walgreens without buying anything.  Halloween is hard.  Maybe this year I will try to endure it and face the trick or treaters….or maybe I will escape to the movies again.  
I just don’t do well on the holidays.

I saw Friday Night Lights recently.  It has been compared to “Remember the Titans”.  This is not true.  This movie is in no class to compete with Remember the Titans.  It is an okay movie.
Shall We Dance is an excellent movie.  Very clean.  Susan Sarandon and Richard Gere are married in this movie.  Jennifer Lopez is the dance instructor.  Very nice movie.  I took my friend from India to see this movie last weekend.  It was her “first” movie experience in America.  Score!  We had a great time.  Afterwards, I introduced her to Coldstone Creamery ice-cream – the ultimate in ice-cream.   She enjoyed it, too!
I have been busy and not writing lately.  Renee came and went this month.  I was able to see her at *Bucks for coffee and she came over for dinner the night b4 she returned to FL.  We had a nice time.  I am disappointed in her skipping school routine in FL.  We all know that she will look back and wish she made better choices with her life.
Today was my Friday off.  I went to check out Halloween costumes for our Halloween potluck at work next week.  I am in the patriotic mood these days…so I am going to be Betsy Ross!  I will try to post a pic for you all to see.  It is a good thing that I am wearing a hat with the costume because I don’t think Betsy Ross has spikey hair in 3 colors like me!  I may even vote on 2 Nov in my Betsy Ross costume…LOL.
It is Fall in Colorado.  The air is brisk and the leaves are colorful.  
Have a wonder Friday night.

My newest adventure is school.  I am signing up to learn about PC Repair.  Maybe I can have my own business:  Patty’s Penny Pinching PC Repair (P3 PC Repair)!  I will let you know how it goes.  I am excited. 
I recently had my computer upgraded to Windows XP and the memory bumped up to 512!  I am ready to take on the world now!  Actually, this was a requirement for my course.

Yep – I am sure Jake loves my new “doo”.  I wanted to be “trendy” and different for October.  I have blonde, burgundy, and dark brown hair.  A high school kid actually told me recently, “Nice hair,” with a  thumbs up.  A person in my grief group thought it looked nice, too.  It is so ez to take care of, too.  I wash it, blow dry it, gel it, and touch it off with glittery hair spray!  A co-worker actually told me that I look so much like Jake with my spikey hair.  Jake had thick red hair and loved to gel it and spike it…(sigh)…he used to drive me crazy spending all that time in the bathroom, but I would let him live in there doing his hair if I could just have him back…..(sigh)..
Enjoy your Sunday.

OK – it is here – Halloween!  I am going out with a friend to an early dinner and then out to the movies.  We are going to go dressed in our costumes.  She is a Victorian Lady and I am Betsy Ross.  We wore our costumes last week to work, too!  The guys actually took me downtown to cast my “early” vote as Betsy Ross!  Our graphics department made me a picture ID, too,  for my character – Betsy Ross.  I actually was on the 6 o’clock news unbeknowst to me!  I saw the camera when I went in to vote and I had thought I had dodged it, but apparently they got a good shot according to my co-workers.  Anyway – below are a couple links to my costume.
I voted in memory of Jake.  The last time I voted and the only time that I can remember voting (yea – shame on me!) was with Jake.  He had an assignment to vote for “Kids Voting” so I took him and I voted, too.  You know, I had to be a good role model…lol.  So – here’s to you, Jake – I voted in costume in YOUR memory.  I actually did a “write-in” for President…”George Washington”…just kidding!  I miss you sOOOOOOO much, son.

I am back from my evening out as Betsy Ross.  My friend was dressed as a Victorian Lady.  We had an early dinner at Phantom Canyon downtown.  Then we strolled down the sidewalk to the Kimball Theatre.  We saw “I (heart) Huckabees”.  Now this movie should have been rated “VW” for Very Wierd!  It was interesting and strange.  We actually saw people get up and leave!  Afterwards, we had some Josh and John’s ice-cream – located next to the theatre.  So we are done with our evening.  It is raining outside and cold.  Goodnight to everyone and I hope your Halloween was fun, 2.

Well, Bush is our leader for another 4 years.  I heard on the news that Hillary Clinton may run for President in 2008.  Go Hillary!  Our first woman Presidential nominee in awhile?  Didn’t we have one years ago?  I thought we did.  I cannot remember her name or maybe she was runnin’ for somethin’ else.
Halloween has come and gone.  Next is Thanksgiving.  In a blink of an eye the New Year will be here!  Where does all this time go?
I am going to GA on business and will be there just in time for Thanksgiving with my Mom and brothers.  I am looking forward to it.  I might get to see my daughters this time…or maybe not.  They will be in Lumpkin, GA turkey hunting with their Dad.  Actually, he will be turkey hunting and they will be wishing they were at home with running water, I imagine.
I watched “White Chicks” on DVD.  Now, that is a LOL movie – for real!  You should check into it!
Last weekend, I invited my neighbor children over for popcorn, a movie, and pizza.  They are 9, 4, and 3 years old.  The youngest is a boy. We had fun.  I am taking the oldest one to the movies on Saturday.  I am looking forward to it.  She always hung out with Jake – even though he was 4 years older than her.  It is hard to believe she is 9 years old…the same age as Jake when he had his accident…(sigh).  
She always seemed to “understand” Jake’s absence – even at the young age of 5.  After the funeral, she would come to visit me every afternoon even just to sit and watch everyone else talk – since I had quite a few visitors those first couple weeks.  I would always offer her milk and cookies.  She asked to visit Jake in the cemetery, too.  I think it was her first visit to a cemetery.  She asked lots of questions.  It was an interesting trip on that day.
So anyway, we are going to an early matinee, Surviving Christmas.  Then out to lunch and possibly Coldstone Creamery for dessert!  My weekend highlight!
Friday is my day off – so tomorrow is like my “Friday” this week.  YAY!

Today was my Friday off – so I slept in til 7am!  I know that sounds early to you guys, but I have been waking up every morning at 4:30am since we set our clocks back!  My body was thinking it was 5:30am….go figure.
So I decided to go on a walk this morning to get a newspaper.  I walked up to Denny’s and decided to stay for breakfast.  Imagine that!  Ms. Weight Watchers going out to breakfast!  LOL.  I would like to tell you that Denny’s has a Fit and Fare menu – so I ordered the veggie omelet.  They also have a Low Carb menu, too!  Boy – they are into satisfying all those potential eater out there!  Well, my omelet was 8grams of fat, but I only ate half of it.  On the low carb menu – it is low in carbs but high in fat grams.  One item was 45 grams of fat!  Just reading the menu made me feel fat!  LOL.
After breakfast, I took a long walk – about 30+ minutes.  When I got home, I headed up to the newspaper office.  There is a new holiday movie coming out next weekend with Tom Hanks – “Polar Express”.  There is going to be sneak preview tomorrow morning at 9am!  The newspaper office was giving out free passes.  So I picked up a pass and I am taking the 9 year old next door with me!  I am so excited.  We will go to the 9am show and then out to Red Robin or somewhere for lunch.  I promised her Mom I will have her home by 12:30pm.  I hope she enjoys it as much as I enjoy planning to take her.

Well, I took my neighbor’s 9 year old to see Polar Express this morning.  We had a pass for the Sneak Preview at 9am.  It was worth it!  I felt like I was actually on the train with all the sound effects!  
It was a packed theatre, too!  Tom Hanks is awesome as the Conducter of the Polar Express.  It is definitely a “magical” XMAS movie.  There were actually 4 Santa Clauses in the audience, too!
Afterwards, we went to the Asian Buffet for lunch – her choice.  
This is one of the best days I have had in a long time.  
Seeing all the kids in this movie made me miss my little boy so I shed a few tears during the movie missing Jake so much…
Tomorrow…off to Denver in the afternoon to go the Denver Civic Center to see the smash hit musical – Menopause.  I can hardly wait!  I have this is a totally awesome production!  Aunty Em – you should go see this, too!

I am going to see Menopause today with a friend.  I am soooo excited.  I have heard rave reveiws about this musical.  I will fill you in later.  The show starts at 5:30pm!  I just got a call from older son to come over for dinner tonite with him and his wife, but I had to decline – due to the show…bummer.  I do enjoy time with them.

XMAS…not!  
I’ll be home for Thanksgiving…yep!  Next week I leave for Georgia on business.  Then I drive home to Mom’s for Thanksgiving.  My ex is bringing the twins to my Mom’s house on 19 Nov.  I will drive them back to Orlando on the 21st and stay down there for a few days.  They have school on M-W.  I will bring them back to GA on Wednesday evening to meet their Dad and he will take them up to his turkey camp for Thanksgiving with all his family in the woods.  Yep.  They have a real Daniel Boone experience up in them thar woods of Lumpkin, Georgia.  They actually hunt down and kill a real turkey and smoke it!
I plan to take the twins out to see Polar Express and catch up with their lives over the past 7 months.  We plan to have some mother-daughter time if we can stand it past the first 15 minutes…LOL.
Work is going well.  It is cold in Colorado.  It is in the 20s!  
I am planning to invite my neighbor’s kids over between now and XMAS.  We are going to make gingerbread houses, eat pizza, pop popcorn, and watch Mrs. Doubtfire.  I am starting to like the holidays again…a little bit at a time.  Not having the twins here with their teenage drama helps!
Have a nice evening.
Guess what I read about this week?  What animal has twins every year in the Spring?  And it is not a human!

It has been snowing off and on all day.  It is nice and chilly.  I am about to stroll out on my afternoon walk.
I took my cat to the vet to be boarded for the next 2 weeks due to business travel and Thanksgiving vacation.  I don’t leave til Monday, but I thought it would be easier to check this off my list of “things 2 do b4 I leave”.  I was sad when I left her.  She has become my source of unconditional love these days.
I have put in my “stop the mail” postcards at the post office.
I have wrote a “stop the milk” note to the milkman.
I have to remember to go on-line and donate my newspaper to the schools while I am gone.
I have written some cards for the troops.  I am involved in a great program called “Friends of Our Troops”.  http://www.troopfanmail.net
This is such a neat program.  One XMAS, I sent out 100 XMAS cards to this program.  The program distributes them worldwide to the troops – including US bases.  I acquired a few penpals.  Most of them have returned from Iraq now.  One got married in Holland in October.  I have not heard from her for awhile – they must be having a long, extended honeymoon…LOL.
Have a good rest of the day and evening.
I am out to bundle up and stroll a couple miles in the snowy weather.

Yesterday, when I took my cat to be boarded at the vet’s, I saw a young woman come in with a box.  She rescued a pigeon and brought it to the vet’s for refuge.  One of the tech’s opened the box and the beautiful pigeon has already passed away.  It was very moving for me to see this.  I guess I am just too sensitive.  I was sad and almost teary eyed.  What a wonderful woman for trying to save a bird!  I asked the tech what happened.  She said Safeway probably poisoned the birds.  Apparently, Safeway gets more than its share of pigeons on their building.  Vets are wonderful people, too.  I am glad my cat is in a loving home for the next 2 weeks until I return from Georgia.  
I see the temps in GA are in the 50’s – so I have to find some summer clothes to relax in back there.  Guess I will pull out my capris and tees.

527,https://www.opendiary.com/m/j8xmom/the-visitor-8-5368438/,2004-11-27,The Visitor,"
It was nice to be home 4 Thanksgiving in Georgia.  I was on a business trip to Warner Robins – Monday – Thursday (15-18 Nov).  Warner Robins is about a 2 hour drive north of where my family lives.  
I was home Thursday nite.  Renee came to my Mom’s about 2pm on Saturday – 20 Nov.  Her Dad dropped her off b4 he headed to his hunting camp in Lumpkin, GA.  I was happy to see Renee.  I have been worried about her for some time.  She has dropped into the pits of depression and despair.  We enjoyed our time together.
We left my Mom’s on Sunday afternoon; I had to take Renee back to Orlando for school and work.  When we walked in the door to her Dad’s house, her sister had dinner ready for us.  Wow!  What a concept!  Becky is now cooking.  She fixed a very nice meal.   I was very complimentary towards her, too.
Before I even sat down to eat dinner, the twins were fighting – something I certainly have not missed in the past 8 months.  I was the “visitor” so I did not engage any discipline.  I just suggested we all enjoy our dinner that Becky prepared for us.
Becky has really changed in her new environment.  She gets up early and wakes her Dad and sister up every morning.  She was NEVER up for school when she lived with me.  She takes going to school and work very seriously.
I met Becky’s boyfriend and his family.  They are wonderful, down 2 earth people.  Becky has basically found an “intact” family who just adore her!  I love his mother.  She is my new best friend!  I spent alot of time visiting with her on Sunday and Monday night.  We spent some time together on Tuesday, too.  Then I brought the girls up to GA Tuesday night – back to my Mom’s house.  Their Dad picked them up early Wednesday morning to take them to his hunting camp in Lumpkin for Thanksgiving.
We had a nice Thanksgiving at Mom’s house.  My son’s wife did all the cooking.  It was nice having my son, his wife, and my girls (although brief) at Mom’s house for the holidays.
Renee and Becky returned to my Mom’s house on Friday b4 lunch time.  They brought their Dad’s girlfriend’s daughter “R” (their future step-sister?), too.  She is 16.  We had a nice time.  We all went bowling.  There were 9 of us!  We rented 3 lanes at the bowling alley and split into 3 groups.  We were able to bowl about 2 games each.  When we finished – my girls and their friend, “R”,  returned to the woods in Lumpkin, GA and we returned to my Mom’s. 
I was busy the entire time I was home at Mom’s.  I loved being home.  The drives to and from Orlando are about 3.5 hours each way. The weather was nice and cool – damp at night.  The damp weather chilled me to my bones!  We have dry cold air in Colorado – totally different than the South!
I was able to see both my brothers and their kids (3 nieces and a nephew – ages 17, 13, 6, and 5).  My 13 year old niece celebrated her “13th” bday on Friday – so that was fun, too.
The neighbor (she’s 19) came over to play cards with us a couple nights, too.  I just learned how to play Spades and I love it!  I like playing with 4 people – in teams.  We tried to play it with 3 people, but it was not as much fun as with 4 people.
We had some late nights, too.  I remember going to bed after 1am one night!  Oh – the joy of vacation and not having to work the next morning.  I could get used to this life really ez!
It was sad that it all had to come to an end.  I left Atlanta (3.5 hour drive from Mom’s house) on Saturday night at 7:20pm and arrived to a cold and snowy Colorado!  It is so cold outside now – about 19 degrees!  I have been cold all day!  My son put 4 60lb tubes of sand in my little truck so I don’t slide around the neighborhood like a hockey puck this week!
I have to tell you what Becky said about her life in Orlando.  She basically said ….”….Mom you were always up my ass when I lived with you.  Dad is never up my ass and I am doing fine….”.  All I could do was look her in her eyes to acknowledge her statement.  I had to hold my tongue; it was worth it.  Because…..remember?  I was in Orlando for 2 days and 2 nights….and I was just the VISITOR.  I could leave it all behind me.  I am now home in Colorado and I am okay.  No extra baggage here.  I will say that their Dad does not provide for them like I did.  There was hardly any food for them.  I bought groceries for them b4 I left.  I was just the “visitor” but I am still a Mom and worry about them.
Have a wonderful week!

I sent an email to a person connected with the Operation Santa Claus program in New York City.  I requested 50 letters be sent to my work address.  This is the reply I got back:
“50? Really? Wow! That’s awesome. We’ll be thrilled to pick up that manyfor you.  May I make a suggestion, though? I’m not sure if you’re distributing them to 50 different people or taking collections to answer them from one big fund, but if the latter… would you consider taking a packet from a classroom or two instead? We took a packet from a 1st grade classroom -26 kids total – 2 years ago, and these kids needed the most basic of things.  Their letters to Santa asked for “a pencil” or “a book.” It was such a great feeling to be able to give them school supplies, books, and toys, and to send a big parcel of classroom supplies to the teacher. We also included juice and cookies so they could have a party while they opened their gifts.
Just something to think about if you’re coordinating a larger effort.Either way, I’m so happy you’re able to take on so much!
If you want 50 individual letters, please let me know if they should all befor one-child families.  Sometimes a mom will write for all her kids, or anolder sibling will include younger ones.
Thanks! “

Yesterday, I took my neighbor to see “Christmas With the Kranks”.  It was a great movie and we enjoyed it.  My neighbor “M” is 9 years old.  She will be 10 on 28 January.  Wow…she will be older than Jake and she is actually in the 4th grade this year.  Jake never made it to 4th grade.  
Anyway, I really do enjoy spending time with “M”.  She is the big sister to her 4 year old sister and 3 year old brother.  I think she enjoys times spent away from home and having extra attention.  I like to help her Mom out and spend time with the kids.  
Dora the Explorer is coming to the Pikes Peak Center and I am thinking of taking “M’s” little sister to see that in February.  “A” loves Dora!  It will give me some one-on-one time with “A”, too.
Cher is coming to the World Arena in March.  “M” LOVES Cher.  She knows all about her.  She read a book about her.  I am thinking of surprising “M” with tickets to see Cher for her Bday/XMAS present.  I probably should ask her Mom, first.
I need to find a nice kid’s movie to take “M’s” little brother, “T”, out to see.  Hmmmm…what do 3 year olds like to do?  Maybe see a Monster Truck show?
Last night after “M” and I went to the movies, we went downtown to see the “Festival of Lights”.  We had a nice time – chilly – but fun!  It was probably in the low 30s.  I was sitting on the street with “M”.  I am telling you – the padding on my butt may be thick but it sure did not insulate me from the cold pavement!  We stopped for sub sandwiches and hot chocolate, too.  It was fun.  Lots of kids there had me missing Jake so much more during this holiday season.  He would have loved the lights and excitement.
Today is Sunday and my weekend is coming to an end…bummer.  Another day…another dollar…anther day closer to retirement -> if that is ever going to happen!

…your lights and ornaments look lovely….yep..I put lights and ornaments on the tree yesterday afternoon.  I had to take some time off at work since a plumber was coming over to check a couple things out for me in the bathrooms.  So…while he worked, I decorated.  I noticed he looked at my tree, too!  Hmmm…either it is ugly or ok…who cares.  I placed an angel on the top.  I found an old handmade ornament from Jake’s childcare.  It was made from a lace doily folded into a triangle with Jake’s cut out picture as the head on the angel.  So my tree has 2 angels on top…(sigh).  Maybe I should take the store bought angel off the top and put Jake there.  Hmmm….we will think about that.
I also bought 3 wreath like looking things.  They are made of evergreen boughs – real stuff.  They are decorated with pine-cones.  I will hang one on my door.  I will hang one on my office door – since we are decorating our doors for XMAS.  The 3rd and largest one will be special.  I will add some painted wooden ornaments to it and take it out to Jake’s place in the cemetery.  I think I might bring the small battery operated XMAS tree out there, too.  The XMAS tree will have to go out there XMAS eve since the batteries will probably last only a few hours.  I will have to think about this a little more.  I guess it really doesn’t matter since Jake is not really out there.  He is with me..always…wherever I go….(sigh).
When I think about Heaven and God, I wonder about alot of things.  Is there REALLY a place called Heaven? I think there must be.  I have to believe there is because I HAVE to KNOW I will see Jake again…..If I don’t believe…what else is there to look forward to after our time spent here?  Also, will Jake and I look the same or does it matter?  I saw “The 5 People You Meet in Heaven” on Sunday night on ABC.  The guy, Eddie, who died looked better in Heaven.  He was not old anymore.  I wonder….I know I will know Jake by his beautiful thick red hair.  I HAVE to believe….we will see all our loved ones again…I just have to….
Wow – where is this entry going?  
Have a nice evening.  I will try to check in with you guys tomorrow.
This Sunday – December 12 – is the candlelight for all our children who have left us too soon.  Please light a a candle in memory of Jake and all the other children who have gone too soon.  It is my bday, too.  I will spend my evening at the candlelight with The Compassionate Friends.  It will be a very sad bday – like the last 4 – but it will be ok.  I am “…just a breath away….” from where these children are.  We all are.  God Bless You All.
P.S.  18 more shopping days…..

Tonite is our company XMAS party.  I was out shopping to see if anything “struck me” to wear to the party.  No luck.  I reckon I will pull something together tonite from the closet.  It should be fun hanging with my co-workers for dinner, music, and holiday spirit.
I am working on our office door for our “Decorate Your Door” contest at work.  It is nice to see everyone get into the holiday spirit.
Not much else to report.
Have a good Friday.

I haven’t had time 2 write since my last entry.  Holidays are busy!  The XMAS party went well.  I left after 9pm.  
Well, I have completed all my XMAS shopping for family.  I got my oldest brother a gift certificate for Ebay since that is where he spends all his free time shopping.  He should have rec’d that via email on 7 Dec.
I still need to get my youngest brother’s package in the mail.  I got him a small portfolio with pen to use for his training classes.  He is always taking training courses in Orlando.  He is a mechanic striving to get his ASC certification…whatever that is.
I have already mailed a box for my nieces and nephews.  That went out FEDEX on Thursday.  That had 4 gifts in it.
I just mailed my Mom’s package today – George Foreman cooking griddle.  She always admired my griddle so I got her a nice one.  Of course, with no kids at home – I don’t use my own griddle anymore.
I sent giftcards to the girls.  Actually, USAA calls them “teen cards”.  You, as a parent, preload them and they supposedly learn about budgeting…yea…right.  There are no fees for this card so when they run out of money – they are out of cash with no overdraft fees like a debit card.  These went out in the mail today.  I put them in a card with a note to call me so I can activate them….I wanted to make sure THEY got them b4 I activated them.
My son and his wife are getting Walmart giftcards.  They love Walmart.  I can’t deal with the crowds there.  So it was quite an adventure today to pick up those giftcards and deal with the mobs of people.  
So…all I have left to buy are some Starbucks giftcards for my coffee friends at work.  That should be ez.
Tonite I am going to a XMAS gathering with my friends from the library.  I have not volunteered there in over a year so I am excited to see everyone.  My boss from the library is hosting it at her home.
Then I am invited to another get together in Woodland Park tomorrow afternoon.  One of the former managers where I work is hosting it at her home.  She left our company for a better opportunity in September.  I haven’t decided whether to go to this one yet.  The last time I saw her was in the Atlanta airport in November!  We were on the same plane for a business trip!  I would like to see her though.  She is fun.
Last night, I had the neighbor kids over.  We made sugar cookies from some cookie dough that looked like playdough!  Boy – that was an adventure.  We had fun.  Afterwards, we ordered out pizza and played XMAS bingo while we were eating.  Go to http://www.crayola.com to find out more!  I actually had some cool prizes, too!  Everyone was a winner.  No losers at XMAS time!  Then we popped some popcorn and watched Mrs. Doubt Fire.  We had quite the festive evening, complete with XMAS music and laughter.  I also had some gifts for them under the XMAS tree.  So we had XMAS early.  We also filled a Santa Cookie jar with their delicious creations and brought it to their parents for a XMAS present from us!  Our evening ended about 10:30pm.
Oh, I almost forgot to tell you something neat!  I got a XMAS card from Becky in the mail today with a STARBUCKS card in it!  Awesome.  So..you know where I will be tomorrow morning – strolling up to *Bucks for some coffee and to read the paper.  Yay!
And…..I got good news this week at work – a bonus and a pay raise!  What a wonderful XMAS season this year!
Also – I mailed out XMAS cards this year, too!

What is the best gift you ever got for somebody else?  A music box.  
Renee always wanted a music box that would play “Green Sleeves”.  She had wanted this for 2 or 3 years.  Well, XMAS – 2002 – my mission was to search for this present.  I found a place downtown in Old Colorado City that sold music boxes.  You could select your own tune.  I found her a music box made of cherry wood with a  nice XMASy design.  When you opened it, it would play “Green Sleeves”.  I was so excited to put it under the tree on XMAS Eve night.  When she opened it XMAS Day…it was a Kodak moment.  She was 15.  She treasured that music box.  Sometimes I would open it when I was in her room just to hear it play the music.  I noticed she kept things that belonged to her brother in there.  It was a bittersweet moment when I would open the box, hear the music, and see things that belonged to Jake.  Yes, the best gift I ever got for somebody else was a music box.

As a joke, my brother used to hang a pair of panty hose over his fireplace before Christmas.  He said all he wanted was for Santa to fill them.  What they say about Santa checking the list twice must be true because every Christmas morning, although Jay’s kids’ stockings were overflowed, his poor pantyhose hung sadly empty.One year I decided to make his dream come true.  I put on sunglasses and went in search of an inflatable love doll.  They don’t sell those things at Wal-Mart.  I had to go to an adult bookstore downtown.  If you’ve never  been in an X-rated store, don’t go.  You’ll only confuse yourself.  I was there an hour saying things like, “What does this do?  You’re kidding me!  Who would buy that?”  Finally, I made it to the inflatable doll section.   I wanted to buy a standard, uncomplicated doll that could also substitute as a passenger in my truck so I could use the car pool lane during rush hour.  Finding what I wanted was difficult.  Love Dolls come in many different models.  The top of the line, according to the side of the box, could do things I’d only seen in a book on animal husbandry.   I settled for Lovable Louise.  She was at the bottom of the price scale.  To call Louise a doll took a huge leap of imagination.On Christmas Eve and with the help of an old bicycle pump, Louise came to life. My sister-in-law was in on the plan and let me in during the wee morning hours.  Long after Santa had come and gone, I filled the dangling pantyhose with Louise’s pliant legs and bottom.  I also ate some cookies and drank what remained of a glass of milk on a nearby tray.  I went home, and  giggled for a couple of hours. The next morning my brother called to say that Santa had been to his house and left a present that had made him VERY happy but had left the dog confused. She would bark, start to walk away, then come back and bark  some more. <SPAN style=""FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial Unicode MS'; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-l
anguage: AR-SA”>We all agreed that Louise should remain in her panty hose so the rest of the family could admire her when they came over for the traditional Christmas dinner.                                                                                 My grandmother noticed Louise the moment she walked in the door.  “What  the hell is that?” she asked.   My brother quickly explained, “It’s a doll.”  “Who would play with something like that?” Granny snapped.  I had several candidates in mind, but kept my mouth shut.  “Where are her clothes?” Granny continued.“Boy, that turkey sure smells nice Gran” Jay said, to steer her into the dining room.  But Granny was relentless.  “Why doesn’t she have any teeth?”  Again, I could have answered, but why would I?  It was Christmas and no one wanted to ride in the back of the ambulance saying, “Hang on Granny, hang on!”My grandfather, a delightful old man with poor eyesight, sidled up to me and said, “Hey, who’s the naked gal by the fireplace?”   I told him she was Jay’s friend.  A few minutes later I noticed Grandpa by the mantel, talking to Louise.  Not just talking, but actually flirting.  It was then that we realized this might be Grandpa’s last Christmas at home.The dinner went well. We made the usual small talk about who had died,  who was dying, and who should be killed, when suddenly Louise made a noise like my father in the bathroom in the morning. Then she lurched from the pantyhose, flew around the room twice, and fell in a heap in front of the sofa.The cat screamed. I passed cranberry sauce through my nose, and Grandpa ran across the room, fell to his knees, and began administering mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.  My brother fell back over his chair and wet his pants.  Granny <SPAN style=""FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial Unicode MS'; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA”>threw down her napkin, stomped out of the room, and sat in the car.It wasindeed a Christmas to treasure and remember.                                                                           Later in my  brother’s garage, we conducted a thorough examination to decide the cause of Louise’s collapse.  We discovered that Louise had suffered from a hot ember to the back of her right thigh. Fortunately, thanks to a wonder drug called duct tape, we restored her to perfect health
This was an email story I just had to share with you all.  Happy Holidays!

It is the day after XMAS and I did not hear from any of my family in GA.  I will write more later.  It is now time to hit Starbucks.  
Can you believe I walked up there yesterday for a cup of my favorite coffee and it was CLOSED?!  Hmmm….the one by the interstate was opened on XMAS Day a couple years ago……must be the manager of each store that decides….
I asked for Starbucks cards for XMAS from my brother.  He always sends me interesting things that I never use – good white elephant stuff.  I probably should put them in a box for future White Elepant parties…  This year he sent me 2 brown Starbucks coffee cups.  Why?  I like going up there for the ambience and my favorite White Chocolate Mocha Non-Fat with Whipped Cream – Grande!  I guess I will wash them and put them in my cupboard with the other coffee cups that I have collected over the years.  My favorite coffee cup came from my friend – 1958Mouser.  She brought it up from NM.  It is southwestern.  I get asked alot about that cup when I use it at work.
I will write more later.  I did get a Starbucks card from Becky.  She knows her Moma well!
Starbucks…here I come.  I have to read about all the after XMAS sales in the paper while I am sipping my coffee.  I hope there is not a crowd of people up there.  Merry Day After XMAS to all of you in OD Land!

If I could make a New Year’s resolution for a friend, it would be:  Please don’t commit to things that you really are not going to follow thru with.
I will write more on this after I go to Starbucks for my “usual”.  I just had to have a “placeholder” for my thoughts on the “theme for the week”.
I have a friend that will make a commitment and not follow thru.  More than once has she said she would do something and has let me down.  I don’t invite her out with me anymore because I cannot deal with the letdown when she cancels last minute.  The last time she invited me out for something, I declined.  It was an invite to a movie.  A few days later, I asked her how the movie went and she said she didn’t go.  I am glad I did not commit to that movie or it would have been another let down.
Life has enough letdowns – so I have decided to avoid these with this person by not comitting to anything with her anymore.

Well, this week sure has dragged on.  Tomorrow is my Friday off.  I am going to Denver for the weekend.  I just want to get away for awhile and wind down.  My daughter, Renee, was supposed to fly in on New Year’s Day, but her plan changed.  She got hurt in the “mosh pit” at a concert on Wednesday night.  Apparently, she was “crowd surfacing” and crashed.  She hit her head and was taken to the hospital via ambulance.  She called me today and says she is sore but okay.  I had made these plans in Denver to spend some time with her, too.  So – now she won’t be coming.  I decided not to let a good thing go to waste – so I am off to Denver to ring in the New Year!  I will leave tomorrow morning.  If anything interesting comes up – I will be sure to write about it.

Well, so far it has been very peaceful in Denver.  The Embassy Suites does an excellent job of making this place feel at home.
I went to visit my Indian friend.  She used to live across the street from me.  She moved away in October.  They bought a home in Denver.  I had a wonderful visit there on Friday afternoon.
I am reading an excellent book – “Tuesdays with Morrie”.  It is relaxing to sit in my room and “escape” once in awhile with a good book.
I just finished watching an excellent movie – Finding Neverland.  Wow – it was very emotional.  It is like a visit with Jake.
Now – in almost an hour – it is complimentary Happy Hour – and I will grab me a drink and go back to my room.
This has been a very restful stay so far.  I had planned to share this adventure with Renee, but she decided to NOT fly into Denver today.  So…I decided I couldn’t let a great plan like this weekend in Denver go to waste!  I plan to have another “escape” soon.
Renee is supposedly flying into Denver next Saturday.  Of course, I won’t hold my breath and I won’t make plans again.  If she comes – great! If not – empty nesting has certainly suited my needs in my middle age.  She has discovered boys and her first kiss – so you know what that means – she will probably remain in FL.  It is so stupid for her to let one guy change her life, but that is life – live and learn.

Also, a good friend called me today.  She was Jake’s babysitter for a couple years – from the age of 2.5 to about 5.  She had a dream about Jake and felt it was his way of telling her to connect with me.  As she told me about this dream, over the phone, my eyes welled up in tears.  Apparently, she dreamed he was in her pool as a young toddler.  He apparently turned over in his float.  She dived into the pool to get him.  She was giving him CPR and suddenly he was older – like 7 or 8 years old.  He recovered from the CPR and asked for me.  She said I was there and Jake was holding my hand with one of his hands and her hand with his other hand – this was the “connection” for her to communicate to me.  Wow!  I have to “believe” this because yesterday I just saw – Finding Neverland – and it dealt with loss and was like a “visit” from Jake, too.  Neverland is a place you go but you must “believe”.  I believe…….

I have to share a quote with you from the book I am reading – Tuesdays with Morrie.  Basically, it is a story about a college professor who is aging with ALS – Lou Gehring’s disease.  He is talking about his departure from life with a dear former college student.  The professor’s name is Morrie.  He and his former student meet every Tuesday for a Lesson on Life.  Here is the quote that made me think of Jake last night:  “…love is how you stay alive, even after you are gone.”
I love you Jake – always and 4ever.  I will see you again.  I believe.  I talk about you always and you will always be a part of me and your siblings’ lives.  We will live in your honor and make you proud of us all.  I left a Random Act of Kindness card in my motel room b4 I left Denver.  I left a note for the Housekeeping Staff and a tip so they can have a Happy New Year, too.  You are 4ever in my broken heart, Jake.

I had dinner with a good friend last night.  She was Jake’s childcare provider from the ages of 2.5 to about 5.  We caught up on alot of stuff.  She is terminal.  Sometimes I can’t believe it.  After reading, Tuesdays with Morrie, I guess I can relate in an awkward way.  We are all terminal; life is terminal…(sigh).  She has been terminal since 1996 and it has been 9 years now.  She has a 13 year old son that was best buds with Jake.  He has been diagnosed as “clinically depressed”.  He has very detailed dreams about Jake.  He says Jake is older.  He says he plays with Jake in his dreams and Jake is very happy and in a better place.  Wow…I wish I could have nice dreams about Jake, but he doesn’t visit me in that way….probably because he knows I will have to wake up and face another day without him.  I will take Jake’s bud to the movies on Sunday.  We will go see something that will make us laugh.  I am sure we will talk about Jake b4 and after the movie.  It will be ok.  I am sure we will cry, too.  That will be ok.  Tears are good.  Tears are words that we cannot express.

I am thinking about joining “Curves” with a friend.  We both do Weight Watchers and walk, but now we are going where we have NOT gone before – resistance workouts at Curves!  Hmmm…we have not committed yet.  It is $29.95/month plus a $150 registration fee.  They have a deal going on this month.  If we join b4 the month ends – we get half off the registration fee!  I think it will be fun, but I am not sure I can work it into my schedule.  I work long hours.  I go to Weight Watchers every week.  I am taking a course in PC Repair.  Renee is coming home tomorrow.  Wow!  I sure stay busy to be a loner, huh?!
So…tomorrow morning I go to Weight Watchers – early.  Then I go to Starbucks for my coffee and to read the paper.  Then I leave the Springs to drive to the Denver airport around 10ish.   Hmmm….I will pick up Renee and take her to lunch and catch up on each other.  Then…..Saturday is about over.
Sunday I am going to the movies with Jake’s old babysitter and her son – Jake’s buddy.  He is 13  now.  We are going to see Finding Neverland.  I hope Renee tags along with us since she LOVES Johnny Depp sooooo much!
Monday I will take Renee back to her old high school and re-enroll her.  
Hmmm…it should be a very busy and interesting weekend.
Oops!  I 4got to tell you something important!  I bought 2 tickets to the Cher concert for next month.  I will be taking my neighbor’s daughter.  It is a surprise for her 10th bday on 28 Jan.  She loves Cher soooo much!  I hope her Mom keeps the secret!  The Village People are opening for Cher….Y….M…..C…..A.  I am not a concert fan, but I know Meagan just adores Cher!

Well, today has been a good day.  I went to Weight Watchers this morning.  I sure was dreading it.  I have not been in 3 weeks!  I know I splurged a little bit over the holidays.  I was so thrilled to see that I gained a little over a pound!  Whew!  I was worried I might have gained more!  I think Weight Watchers is a wonderful program.  It definitely changed how I eat!
After Weight Watchers, I drove up to Denver to pick up Renee.  She was so haggard looking.  She was out til 3:30am this morning with her friend!  She caught a 9am flight to Denver.  She was so happy to be home.  I have enjoyed visiting with her and seeing how much she has changed.  It has been almost 10 months since she left.  She has her braces off and has a beautiful smile.  She is now out with her friends.  
Tomorrow I will be meeting a girlfriend at Starbucks for coffee in the morning.  Tomorrow afternoon I will be going to a movie with a friend and 2 teenagers.  Renee says she may tag along, too.  That will be nice.  After the movie, we plan to have dinner out as a group, too.

Sunday was nice.  I went to a movie with a good friend.  She actually had her own family-based childcare center years ago.  Jake was in her care for about 2.5 years – from the time he was about 2.5 years old til he was about 5.  Her son and Jake were best buds.  Her son was with us.  She also brought along another child that knew Jake.  She is 12 now.  Boy!  I have not seen her since she was about 4 – what a time warp!  She is now a typical teenager.  We all had fun.  Renee actually tagged along with us.  After the movie, we all went to my place to hang out for awhile.  Then we all went to McDonalds – all teens love fast food!  We had fun.  We shared memories about Jake and laughed, shed a few tears, and had some moments of silence.  It was good for all of us.
Jake’s buddy asked me if I would like to go see ‘Fat Albert’ with him next weekend.  I was psyched.  He said, “Pat, Jake would have liked this movie!”  I smiled and agreed.  So next Saturday – Renee and I are picking up Jake’s 2 buddies and going out to see the new Fat Albert movie.  Maybe afterwards, we will come back to my place to veg or go out for some Coldstone Creamery ice-cream.  I can’t remember if we had Coldstone Creamery here b4 Jake’s accident.  Sometimes, my mind just gets so fuzzy…(sigh).  I do remember us going to Baskin Robbins, the Dairy Queen, and McDonalds for ice-cream with Jake.  Jake would have loved Coldstone Creamery…..(sigh).
Today, Renee re-enrolled back into her old high school.  She only needs 1 credit to graduate, but she is taking 5 “lame” classes…teen talk…lol.  She is happy.  We had dinner together tonite and now she is off to hang with her friends.  It is nice having her home.
Tomorrow she has a doctor’s appointment.  She has been having some headaches.  Her shoulder and wrist are causing her some pain.  This all resulted from her fall while “crowd surfing” at a rock concert in FL b4 New Year’s.  She was transported to a hospital via ambulance, but they never really “checked” her out (i.e. CT scan, x-rays, etc.).  Her Dad never knew about the “ordeal” til the next morning.  He was not home when it happened.  I think Renee will be okay; I just want to make sure she is ok – especially after falling on her noggin!
Tomorrow is another day.
Did I tell you that Renee wants to move back to FL after she graduates?  She wants to get a place with her sister and go to bartending school!  Hmmm….Becky is going to culinary school after she graduates.  Maybe they can open their own “Bar and Grill”….LOL.  Hey – at least they have a plan!

I wanted to take Renee out to eat tonite, but she wanted to go out to eat with her friend.  Ok.
So I went to Red Lobster by myself.  It was great!  They have this “LiteHouse” menu.  I had the jumbo shrimp cocktail, baked potato, salad, and hot tea.  It was just right for my ravished stomach!  I think I will have to go there again with some friends.
Tomorrow is Thursday – but it is my Friday!  Yay!

I am guessing “back in the day” college professors could say anything!  You have to remember – this was in the early 80s!  The answer I gave him…..hmmmm…….probably something along the lines of ……”…maybe that’s why I have been late for your class a few times…oversleeping…”….let him use his imagination to believe me or not!  Geez!

Hmmm..this long weekend spoiled me.  I had a hard time getting cranked up today at work.  Anyway…Tuesday has ended.  I am headed out to the music store.  I am buying a digital piano so I can entertain myself when I am bored.  The music store is having an open house.  I am going to sign up for intro lessons for the Clavinova (Yamaha digital piano).  They are going to demo it tonite. 
I have not decided where I want to put this piano yet – so I told them I would pick it up in 2 to 3 weeks.  The lessons start sometime in February.  I played the piano as a teen years ago; it is like riding a bicycle – once you know how to play – you don’t ever 4get.
So…I am excited.  I am thinking of taking more piano lessons, too.  I would like to brush up and learn more.
My daughter got a job.  She started Monday at the Dairy Queen.

Well, the open house at the music store was alot of fun.  I met a nice woman that works there.  She took some time to show me some of the features of the Clavinova – the higher priced ones!  So – I had a nice time.  It was fun playing and experiencing all the “high tech” features.
The Clavinova I am purchasing is the “most basic” one.  I wanted something more like a regular piano – nothing spectacular.  I think it will meet my needs just fine.
Today was a long day.  I didn’t take an outside lunch.  I stayed in the office all day except for my afternoon walk – about 20 minutes. 
Renee is at work.  I don’t see much of her these days.  She is still in bed when I leave for work.  She is either at work or at a friend’s house when I come home every night.  Tomorrow she leaves to spend the next several days babysitting 3 kids – ages 13, 10, and 7.  Their parents are going out of town for a week.  She has to have them at the bus stop every morning at 7am then she has to drive an hour back to town to get to her classes by 8:30am.  She finishes school at 2pm and then has to drive back to the “sticks” to meet the kids at the bus stop by 4:30pm.  Yep – she will be doing this for a week!  She is responsible for all their needs for a week!  I am sure this will be an “eye-opening” experience for her.  She will have them all weekend at their place, too.    Just thinking of her schedule tires me!  She leaves tomorrow night and I won’t see her again until next weekend sometime.  
Well – tomorrow is another day….

Today I attended an all day real estate investor’s seminar sponsored by Ron LeGrand.  It was very informative and it seemed very credible.  I learned alot today.  My brain is tired.
To learn more and receive more detailed training, you must attend 2 “Boot Camps” – at the price of $3495/ea for 4 days training for each seminar.  They offerred a perk today – sign up for both and receive a $2000 discount plus some freebies.  The best freebie was being able to work with one of the millionaires when you close your first deal!  Very powerful seminar!  Lots of people were racing to sign up with their checkbooks and credit cards!  I did not sign up.  I came for information gathering only.
Look up Ron LeGrand on the internet and read about him.  He is a very successful man – thru real estate.  He used to be a mechanic.  He has a system where you don’t use any of your money.  You don’t take risks either.  His systems seems very doable!
Have a great weekend.  I am going for my walk.

After I saw the movie – The Aviator, my interest in learning more about Howard Hughes was sparked.  So I bought a couple books about him.  I am reading “Howard Hughes:  The Secret Life” by Charles Higham.  It is interesting.  It was this  book that the movie was based on.  Did you know that at one time – Johnny Depp was considered to play Hughes in that movie?  Wow!  Anyway – Howard Hughes was born on XMAS Eve…many years ago.

564,https://www.opendiary.com/m/j8xmom/howard-hughes-the-secret-life-2-5368475/,2005-01-21,Howard Hughes:  The Secret Life,"
This book is interesting.  He really was not born on XMAS Eve, according to the book.  He was born on September 24, 1905.  His Dad married a Texan heiress.  SHE had the money.  Her parents allowed the marriage because he (Howard’s Dad) had a brother that was well known for writing bestsellers and his Dad (Howard’s Dad’s Dad) was a well known judge in Iowa!
Anyway, I will always remember Howard Hughes’ bdate – September 24 – it is the same day that my life changed with Jake’s accident but several years later….
Anyway, Howard Hughes’ Dad could not manage his money and was penniless alot.  His Mom was a hypochondriac!  Inventing and patenting a “drill bit” is what brought money and fame to Howard’s Dad – Robert “Bo” Hughes.  Of course, he lost it as soon as he made it more than once!

Today is Sunday.  Wow, I feel old!  I crashed on the Futon downstairs and it was not as comfortable as my bed!  So – after I grab a bite to eat – I am out to walk this morning.  It feels nice out there – in the 30s.  Remember – Colorado has a “dry” cold – not “damp” like in the South.  If it was 30 degrees in the South – I would have to bundle up!
Hmmm…the daughter that returned home has me wondering about her true motives.  Supposedly – she came home to get focused on finishing school.  It has been only 2 weeks and the school is calling and leaving messages about “absences” and “low grades”.
She felt “so alone” living with her Dad because he was never around.  She wanted to go on walks with me.  Ask me how many times she has walked with me – yep – ZERO.  Her smoking has given her “smoker’s cough” and she has no stamina – she can hardly walk upstairs without being winded.
Sigh…..oh well, time will tell.
Have a great Sunday!
I am going to the movies today.  I want to go see Coach Carter.  I will let you know how it went.  It is about a basketball coach.  I invited my older son to go with me to see it yesterday.  He is a big basketball fan.  He played in Middle School and was great!  Well, he declined.  Said he had other stuff to do.  Well, at least I asked.  I couldn’t get motivated to go yesterday after he declined.  I am going for sure this morning – maybe mid-morning.

Last Friday I got a Starbucks in the late afternoon.  I was taking a late lunch after 1pm.  I picked up a newspaper and decided I needed coffee, too.  It was a brisk afternoon.  Well, when the lady gave me back my change, I was a bit surprised.  I gave her a $10 bill and she gave me back change for $100 bill!  Yep – she gave me $96+ in change.  I told her she rung me up wrong.  She seemed so calm for making such a big mistake.  I thought I would at least get a coupon for a free Starbucks…but it didn’t happen.  Bummer.  Well, honesty is the BEST policy.  Anyway, it was almost like winning at Bingo!  It was exciting, but it was brief.  It is life.
Sunday morning, as I started out for my early morning walk, I noticed something strange.  There were large footprints in the snow.  They led to both doors of my pickup.   Hmmm….someone got into my truck and left the glove box open.  So, I locked up the truck and took my morning walk.  By the time I came home, all the neighbors were outside talking.  Apparently, someone broke into cars all up and down the street and stole stuff.  Wow – I guess some people are really bold and bored to do something like that.  Oh well, I didn’t have anything of value in my truck.  So, I didn’t have much to worry about.  But you are absolutely correct if you are asking me if I lock up my truck these days….yepper!
Tomorrow is the first day of February.  Wow – where did January go?!  Wednesday night I am taking my neighbor’s daughter to the Cher concert.  That should be fun!  The Village People are opening for Cher……….Y…..M…..C…..A!

Well, it has been awhile since I have written.  I just wanted to say that I did something I HAVE never done b4 in my life.  I hula-hooped!  Yep.  They have these very large and weird looking hula hoops at Curves.  I watched a lady do it and decided after my workout that I would try it, too!  I did it and had a cheering section, too!  I was like…”…look at me and this hula-hoop!  I am doing something for the first time in my life in front of total strangers!”  So that was my excitement for Thursday night.
Friday was kinda of interesting, too.  I met my Confirmed Bachelor (CF) friend for lunch.  We always have fun and laugh together.  We have known each other for almost 9 years!  We had a nice lunch and as we were walking out to the parking lot, he said he had something to give me.  He reached into his SUV and pulled out a dz red roses!  OMG!  I was so surprised!  He gave me a hug and a peck on the cheek.   It has been over 24 hours and I am still wondering about that surprise.  I sure hope it was done out of “friendship” and nothing more.  We have such a wonderful friendship as it is.  I want to remain best friends with him and nothing more.  Any ideas?
Today – Saturday – Renee and I drove up to Lakewoood, CO and checked out the Colorado Mills Outlet Mall.  We had a fun time together.  It is a nice mall and we didn’t see anybody we knew – that is nice, too.  We were totally out of our element and enjoying the newness of a new place.  She bought a ceramic straightener for her hair, perfume, and a cute shirt.  It was fun seeing her shop and seeing what she likes these days.  She got her income tax refund and enjoyed her afternoon shopping.  She never got paid in full from her babysitting job.  They still owe her $250.  They keep promising her they will pay her and now it is almost 2 weeks later and she is STILL waiting.
Tomorrow I have a date with the 4 year old next door.  We are going to the Pikes Peak Center to see Dora the Explorer.  I am sure this will be a fun afternoon!  
Tomorrow night, Renee and I are going to the movies to see “Sideways”.

I am going to Curves tonite.  Yay!  I have not been since working out on Friday.  I was bummed to have gained some weight at Weight Watchers.  A supportive woman told me it was because we are building muscles at Curves; she gained weight, too.   So….am I going to keep working out just to gain weight?  Help me understand this!

Well – it has been a while since I have written.  I really don’t have anything exciting to write about.  I have been staying busy with work, Curves, and volunteering.  I started volunteering 2 weeks ago with the Pikes Peak Family Connections “Nurturing Program”.  If you are not aware, this is a program that offers parenting programs to those in the community that have either been referred to the program or are taking it for educational purposes.
My first  night volunteering was hectic.  We had alot of kids – about 6 infants alone!  I worked with the bigger kids – those that could walk.  I did hold a young 9 month old boy who was fussy.  It was nice.  Once I held him, he seemed content.  I will say, I had a headache all day the next day.  I think it was all the crying that first night when the kids had to be left with us – total strangers.
My second week with the kids was much quieter.  I helped out with a 6 month old who was crying.  She seemed happy to be brought into the room with the bigger kids.  She enjoyed looking at all the little people walking around her.
Well – 14 more weeks of this Nurturing Program.  I volunteer on Wednesday nights.
I work out at Curves after work on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday.  I also work out on Saturday mornings.  It is such a hoot to be there!  I am hoping to earn my first “Curves” t-shirt this month.  I need to work out 16 times and I have completed 10 already!  Yay, me!
There was a noter that mentioned living in Wyoming and there is not a Curves there.  Well – check out their website and get one!  http://www.curvesinternational.com  I think it is very reasonably priced for a franchise.  Also, the royalties and advertising fees don’t seem bad at all.  I have actually entertained the idea of selling my house and moving back East closer to family and opening a Curves by the military base in Valdosta, GA!  This way, I will have a job there waiting on me!  I could take my Mom to work with me to spend time 2gether.  Everytime I think about this my adrenalin pumps thru my system!
Have a nice President’s Day tomorrow.  I have to work…bummer.

We have a new car wash in my neighborhood -> Quick Quack.  Its mascot is a big yellow duck. 
I decided to try this car wash today.  I was a bit terrified when they told me to put my van in neutral and stay in the van as it entered the car wash.  I took off my seatbelt so if anything happened, I could get out.  Then it started.  The van started moving thru the routine – spray – suds – giant brushes attacking me on both sides of the van.  Then the most scary thing happened – a huge blue-looking octopus was coming right at me!  Actually, it is a big ragged looking thing.  It landed on the hood and windshield and starting slapping itself wildly!  OMG!  I was hyperventilating!  I could not deal with this and yet I could not get out to escape!  I thought I was done until the big blow dryers started blow drying my van.  Gee, I thought this was never going to end.  Then it ended.  I was free.  The exit sign was in sight.  
I don’t like those kind of carwashes.  I remember going thru one with Jake when he was about 5 or 6.  I was totally terrified.  He had a blast.  I think he thought it was funny to see me so freaked out.
Well, Jake – I did it again and I am STILL freaked out!
The van looked nice when it was all said and done.  Next time, I will let the attendent sit in the van.

So what is the Nurturing Program?  It is a parenting program.  It is also a child abuse prevention-type program.  Young parents with children attend this program and learn how to be better parents.  My role as a volunteer is to work in the children’s room.  We have kids anywhere from a few months old to 7 years old.  We have parents that are very young in our program – young teens.  I am guessing the youngest mother is about 16 years old.  While the parents are learning how to be better parents, we work with the children.  Some of these children have been abused and neglected.  Many of the children are living in foster care – away from their biological parentsl.  It is tough at times to see the bitterness between the foster parents and the biological parents.  Wednesday nights allow the the biological parents to connect with their children – away from the foster parents.  It has been a rewarding experience so far.  I think I have learned to be quite creative with Play Dough….LOL.  It is also rewarding when one of the smaller children (less than 12 months) cries and suddenly becomes calm when I pick him/her up.  There is a young boy – about 9 months old.  He has the same name as my little boy – Jacob.  Well…you can only imagine how I feel when I am able to pick him up and he is at peace……I miss my Jacob so much.

‘We Need Not Walk Alone’ is the motto of The Compassionate Friends.  
I was wearing my Compassionate Friends T-shirt on Friday.  I was taking back a lawn mower part to Sears’ Appliance Repair Center.  I had ordered the wrong part.  As I was waiting in line with the cashier, I felt a tap on my back and a deep voice say, “What does that mean?”  He was referring to the motto on the back of my t-shirt.  I turned around and was facing an elderly gentleman breathing with the assistance of oxygen.  I told him that The Compassionate Friends is a support group for bereaved parents.  I told him I lost Jake.  I told him about the gocart accident.  He looked at me with that look – you know the “look”.  The “look” that he wished he never asked the question.
After I completed my exchange with the cashier, I turned to leave.  The older gentleman said, “How long has it been since you lost your son?”  I turned to him and said, “It will be 5 years ago on September 24.”
I cried all the way home.  I miss my son so much.  I guess it is the tears that let everyone know that the pain never leaves.  My heart is 4-ever broken.  There will be a void in my life that can never be filled.  It is good to have people ask about Jake.  It hurts.  The pain is ok because the tears are the words that can never be expressed.  Tears need to be released because I can never explain the pain and loss and how it feels.  I just would never wish it on anyone – not even my worst enemy.

I went out to lunch with my daughter yesterday.  She invited me to the mall with her, too.  It was nice.  
I spent some time today with my son and his wife.  We went to Woodland Park and celebrated Mothers Day with his in-laws.  It was fun.  There were lots of kids there, too.  The oldest was 10 – then 5, 3,  2, and 11 months.  It was fun.
Now I am packing to leave for a business trip to Dayton, Ohio.  At least it will be warm there!
My daughter in FL called this morning to wish me a special day, too.   It has been a nice day and the weather has been more Spring-like than it has been in days!
I have decided to take some time off work when my daughter graduates.  I plan to take her to lunch on graduation day.  She graduates on Tuesday night at 7pm – 24 May. 
Tomorrow is my oldest son’s bday.  He will be 26.

He is 14 today but I haven’t celebrated a bday with him in 5 years….(sigh).  Today has been a draining day.
I bowled this morning with Big Brothers Big Sisters – “Bowl for Kids’ Sake”.  It was fun.  Lots of prizes were given out.  I was our Team Captain.  My first ball was a gutter and I won a free burritto at Chipotle!  I gave the prize to my Little Sister.  She won some prizes, too!  We all had fun.  Since it was Jake’s Birthday today – we named out team “Jake’s Angels” – there were 2 adults (me and a girlfriend) and 2 kids (my Little Sister is 12 and my friend’s daughter is 13).
I came back from Ohio on Thursday afternoon and I was glad to leave that heat and humidity!  Ugh!  Being the conservative person I am – I always left the hotel room A/C off.  After returning to a hot room – I learned to leave the A/C on “low” to keep me alive when I returned!
I was able to continue my workouts at Curves in Fairborn, Ohio.  I met some cool ladies!  I am now entered in the Curves “Coast to Coast” contest and could win a tee-shirt! Yay!
I had fun checking out the mall in Fairborn, too.  It was nice.  I bought some stuff for my girls for graduation presents.  I actually almost recruited a couple woman in Ladies Footlocker to join Curves!
Hmmmm….I would really like to look into owning one of these Curves franchises.  Any ideas where I can get financing?  I am veteran, too!  Do you think I could get a small business loan somewhere?

I got a speeding ticket on April 26.  I thought I was just ""going with the flow of traffic"".  I could not tell the officer how fast I was going.  He said his fellow officer clocked me at 52 MPH in a 40 MPH zone.   Hmmmmm….I was just going with the flow of traffic, I thought to myself.  He said, ""Is there any reason you were in a hurry?""  I said, ""No Sir.  I guess I was just not paying attention"".
So – the painful outcome -> $130 fine and 4 points on my license.
I went to court on Monday and accepted the Plea Bargain – 1 point for a defective headlamp but the fine remained the same PLUS a $15 court fee charge.  Wow – $145.  Do you know how many Starbucks that would have bought me?!
So now I putz around with my eye on the spedometer AND the speed limt signs.

This is the title of a book I just read.  It is a novel about a parents and teens.  It is so realistic!  I learned alot.  I would recommend it to all parents with teens or teachers that work with teens.  http://www.parentingteenstoday.com/
I am having a lot of emotions this month.  My son left for Tallahasse yesterday.  He is taking a job transfer with his company.  He has always wanted to live in FL.  His wife will be leaving soon, too.  Their house is on the market and they have had some offers, 
My daughter graduates on Tuesday night and leaves the following day to return to FL to live with her sister.  Her Dad is coming out for her graduation.  They fly back together on Wednesday.  Her sister is still trying to finish her credits in FL.  She got so far behind when she was ""rebelling"" out here with her friends.  She should be done after summer school.  Hopefully.  If not, she is an adult now and is in charge of her life.
It is hard to ""let go…."".

Renee is graduating tonite.  Her Dad is in town.  He and Renee will fly out tomorrow.  She will begin her new life in FL living with her twin sister.  Her sister has 2 more classes to finish in summer school.  She missed out on her graduation ""walk"" on 17 May.
It will be different again.  It is funny how kids come and go in and out of our lives.

Well, it has been damp and chilly in Colorado the past couple days.  Now it is raining.  I just heard from my son in FL.  He just got back from Panama City Beach with his wife.  He loves the warm weather.  When I told him it was in the 40s today and 50s yesterday here in Colorado, he could not believe it!  He is so happy to leave this weird weather behind.
Today I went to Home Depot and bought some flowers to plant.  I also bought a butterfly bush.  It is a lavendar one.  I was just outside digging a hole in Jake’s garden and then the down pour came.  Ugh!  I am sure Jake enjoyed dumping that water on my head from his strategic location up above.  So – my project came to an abrupt ending.  At least I got the hole dug and the bush inside the hole.  I will have to finish up tomorrow night.
I was also able to clear the area around my rose bush in front by the mailbox.  Jake and I always enjoyed planting flowers there in the Spring.  I purchased several different flowers to plant around the rose bush.  They are all annuals, I think:  Petunias, Celosia, Salvia, and Daisys.  The Salvia plants have a funny name.  They name looks like ""Saliva"" so I think I will call it my ""Spit Flowers""….LOL. 
Well, tomorrow is another day.  
Anyway, I will wish you all a good rest of the week.  It is back to the grind for me tomorrow.
Hey, b4 I 4get, I heard a funny one to share:  What is the difference between in-laws and out-laws?

I read about a couple in England who celebrated their 80th wedding anniversary.  I think that is so awesome!  They said they never go to bed angry and always hold hands when they go to bed.  That is so awesome!
I had a strange dream about Jake last night.  His Dad got remarried last month – truth – not a dream.  In my dream, his Dad, his Dad’s new wife, Jake, and I were in this dream.  All I remember is how Jake looked at his Dad and his Dad’s new wife.  I will never forget his face.  It was a face of disapproval.  The new wife was saying something to Jake’s Dad – I cannot recall any detail.  I just felt awkward to be there with THEM!
The best part of this dream is that Jake was older – a teenager and he was sitting with ME!
I sure miss that special little son of mine.

594,https://www.opendiary.com/m/j8xmom/i-wish-488-5368505/,2005-06-04,I Wish…,"
I wish someday I could meet someone special with a great sense of humor.  Someone who appreciates the small things in life.  Someone that would treat my kids like his own.  Someone that would visit the cemetery with me and talk about Jake.  I wish…..I would meet someone that would be a real ""father figure"" to my children.  Someone that would take my oldest son fishing and talk about life.  Someone that would hug my girls and tell them that he would always be there for them.  I wish, I wish, I wish.   Wishes sometimes come true.
I was told to read this book, Father Hunger.  It is a Christian book.  I was told my daughters are searching to fill this void.  I know my son has expressed not having a real Dad in his life.  I was engaged to his Dad, but we never got married.  I married when he was 6 years old and I had Jake and his sisters.  My oldest son always felt left out.
Now – it has been about 11 years since the divorce and almost 5 years since Jake’s death.  My oldest son married his high school sweetheart when he was 18.  The eloped after Basic Training in the Air Force.  I am very fortunate that his father-in-law has taken time with him and made him feel so accepted into the family.  He does car work and house projects with my son.  I think that has been very beneficial for my son.
On the other hand, my daughters really don’t have that role model.  I have really never dated since the divorce.  I have always focused on my kids, work, and school.  I dont’ have any regrets, except I wish somehow I could fill the void my daughters have in their lives.  Their Dad is leaving tomorrow.  His plans are to return to the Marshall Islands and work because he makes great money and it is all tax free.  He leased an apartment for our daughters.  He told them he would pay the rent if they went to college.  I think this will only create other problems for our daughters.  They will never learn responsibility.   They are 18 and living in FL – alone.   Their new step-Mom told them to call her if they need anything.  She lives in Michigan.  Hmmmm….newlyweds living 1000s of miles apart because it is all about $.  Well, you can’t take your $ with you when you leave this world, but memories with your family are priceless.  I just don’t understand.
I wish…I wish I had the right answers….
If any men with children are reading this entry, could you maybe explain why this kind of thing is happening?  Am I living in a world with rose-colored glasses believing family is more important than it really ever will be or was meant to be?

Today I spent time with my Little Sister (thru Big Brothers Big Sisters).  We had fun.  We saw the movie – Hitch.  It was funny.  It was fun to see my Little laugh out loud.  I have known her now since about the end of March.  She has really opened up to me and it makes it easier to spend time together.  After the movie we went out for ice-cream at the DQ.  My daughter worked at the DQ b4 she moved back to FL.  I chatted with one of her friends.
It was a good day today.  I am thinking about taking my Little to the circus.  She has never been to the Circus.  The Circus will here soon.
Well – it is time to hit the hay and start another week.

The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants is a good movie!  I think if you have teen-age girls this would be a good movie for you to see with them.  It is sad in some parts, but lfe is not full of total happiness.   It made me remember the days when my girls were younger – Middle School – Early Highschool times.
I invited a couple girlfriends over for coffee and butterbraid yesterday – mid-morning.  We had such a great time.  One brought fruit and the other brought a sausage and egg casserole.  We just sat around and had fun visiting, eating, and drinking coffee.  We broke up about 2pm.  
All of us could not go to the movies – due to other committments.  The 2 of us that went did enjoy the ""Sisterhood"" movie.
Next movie I would like to see is …. Cinderella Man…with Russell Crowe.
I am flying into Fl at the end of the month to see my other daughter graduate from high school.  Then she will go up to GA to visit my Mom if she can get the time off from work.  We may stop and see my son and his wife, too.  It will be a busy visit.
I am looking forward to some 1 on 1 time with this daughter.  We enjoy talking at Starbucks.

598,https://www.opendiary.com/m/j8xmom/darn-bird-5368509/,2005-06-11,Darn Bird!,"
Today I went to the cemetery to visit Jake.  As I was walking away from my van, I swooped down upon by a chirping blackbird.  At first, I thought he/she was flying low.  After a couple swoops, I felt like I was under attack and there was no fallout shelter in sight!  I got to Jake’s grave and that aggravatin’ bird would not leave me alone!
I heard some giggling across the way, and it was another visitor in the cemetery.  She was on her cell phone talking.  I yelled over to her, ""What’s up with that bird?!""  She started laughing and said it was …""…picking on her, too"".  As we were talking, that darn bird starting flying at me like a Surface-to-Air Missile!  Man!  He never pecked me or pooped on me, but I was darn near ready to poop my pants!
I decided to stand still and observe.  Then another car came into the cemetery and parked by my van.  I was quietly watching to see if that darn bird would freak them out, too…and it DID!   Those ladies got smart and headed back to their car to get an umbrella.  Then one of the ladies walked over to get me so I could take refuge under her umbrella and get back to my van!  Wow!  What an experience.  Next time I go to the cemetery, I am either bringing an umbrella or Jake’s sooper soaker water gun and defend myself!  
Geez!
Anyway, our grief group planted the Memory Garden again at the cemetery yesterday.  Here is a picture I took this morning – b4 the ""Bird Scene""!

Anyway, I earned my first tee-shirt from CURVES.  Yay!
Not much to report right now.  I led our grief group on Thursday night.  It was another hard evening….(sigh).  I am thinking about going to Atlanta in September to a take a course on becoming a Bereavement Facilitator.  I would earn a certificate.  It is pricey though.  I would be in the course on Jake’s 5th anniversary date…hmmm…that may be too much for me…I will have to think about it some more.

The reason I picked the one in Atlanta is because I could see my family while I am there.  The reason I am thinking of considering it is because I think it may benefit me when I lead our local Compassionate Friends goup.  They are also looking for a replacement Chapter Leader for our local group.  I would like to maybe consider the volunteer position, but I would like to learn as much as I can so I can be useful and knowlegeable in some of the other areas (i.e other types of loss than are not related to Jake).

Well, I spent 11 days in FL and GA.  I was able to spend time with Becky.  She did not graduate from high school due to attendance issues.  I was so bummed.  This trip back to FL was to celebrate her graduation.  Oh well…life…  She plans to get her half credit in night school in the Fall.  I told her I didn’t want to discuss her not graduating because it would ruin our time together.  So we had fun sitting in the hot tub at the motel and cooling off in the pool.  One night a few young guys between 25 and 35 hung out with us in the hot tub.  They tried to pick me up!  Now, that was an ego booster for myself AND my daughter…LOL.  I explained to them that this was my time with my daughter and they could not believe I was Becky’s Mom!  Anyway, people my age need an ego booster once in awhile…LOL.
I truly had a wonderful vacation, but it is certainly HOT and HUMID in FL and Ga!  Ugh!  I was able to take Becky away and have some great quality time with her.  I think our best time together was walking on Coco Beach collecting shells!  I spent 6 days with just her.  I took her to GA to visit with my family for a few days.
Her sister did not seem to interested in spending time with me.  I guess she is all ""grown up"" and enjoying her ""her own pad"" with her sister now.
I was able to swing by Tallahassee FL and visit with my son and his wife in their new pad.  It was a great couple days with them.
I enjoyed visiting with my Mom, brothers, and neices and nephew, too.  It was nice.
It is nice to be back home in Colorado.
Well, I have to go pick up some milk for breakfast.
How about that Hurricane about to hit FL in the panhandle area?!  Yikes!  Another good reason to visit FL and LIVE in Colorado!

Hmmm…I have been dragging all day!  I even crashed for 3 hours!  I think going on vacation and returning after midnight on Sunday morning and jumping back into work – has taken its toll on me.  I am exhausted!  So….not much to report.
I had a craving for a Pecan Cluster Blizzard at the DQ and tried something different this week – Banana Cream Pie Blizzard.  Hmmm…it was different – I prefer my standard Pecan Cluster though.  DQ has 3 new summer blizzard flavors:  Banana Cream Pie, French Silk Pie, and Key Lime Pie.  I think I might try the Key Lime next time.
Well, it sure has been stinking hot this summer.  I was at Lowe’s today and they are sure busy on the fan, ac, and swamp cooler aisle.  I met a woman from Chicago and she is about to heat to death this summer!  She has lived here 12 years and said it has NEVER been this hot before.  I am thankful that I have a swamp cooler to make my life more liveable during this heat wave.  I enjoyed visiting with this woman and the sales person in this ""cool"" aisle…LOL.
I am going to a play tomorrow night.  I am going with a friend.  So..I don’t even know what play we are going to see, but it should be a fun night.  She is a fun person.  She has twin boys about 5 years older than mine.  We like to exchange stories!

What is a swamp cooler?  Well, it is also called an evaporative cooler.  It basically runs on water and is very low cost.  Basically, a swamp cooler cools the dry air in your home.  It blows out all the hot air thru your open windows and makes living in this dry climate much more tolerable.  Go to http://www.homedepot.com and do a keyword search for ""evaporative cooler"".  I would love to work at Home Depot or Lowes on weekends and sell these wonderful home appliances!  I love people and I love my swamp cooler.

Hmmm…it was brought up that I should plan one of these dinners about every 3-4 months…I am thinking b4 the holidays (Oct) and after the holidays (Mar).  What do you think.
I was approached about becoming the new Chapter Leader for our group.  I could not commit, but the pressure was on!  I said I would have to think about it.  The ideal person would be someone that only works part-time or not at all.  I don’t know how I could fit another commitment into my already over-commited schedule!  UGH!  I will think about it over the weekend and look at my calendar.

Guess what?!  I went to work out at Curves last night after work and I am a WINNER!  My name was drawn for the Coast to Coast Curves Tee!  YAY!  You can enter the drawing each time you work out and bring a business card from the Curves you visited.  I was entered 8 times!  I had visited Curves in Dayton, OH, Nashville, GA, Orlando, FL, and Tallahassee, FL.  I will be entering again if I find a CURVES in Minnesota next month.  I am so psyched!  I love Curves and you have to earn the merchandise.  They do not let you buy it.  
Today I am hitting *Bucks to read the paper and have some coffee b4 my workout.  I need to catch up on the news since I don’t read the paper during the week.  I am going to have to figure how to read the paper in the mornings again!
It will be 5 weeks on Tuesday since Iast spoke with my ""estranged"" daughter, Renee.  It is hard to believe since I brought her back here to finish high school.  Since she left the day after graduation to go back to FL with her Dad – she has been different.  He got remarried in May and returned to the Marshall Islands in June.  His wife lives in Michigan.  He leased a 2 bedroom apt for the girls with the agreeement that he would pay the rent if they went to college.  Becky now is paying rent since she did not graduate from high school.  
Becky just got a new full-time job working in a day care!  She starts on 15 Aug – in the infant room.  She is so excited!  She has also enrolled in night school to pursue her half credit needed to graduate from high school.  I bought her a gift certificate at her Curves in College Park, FL to congratulate her on her new job.  She picked it up on Thursday.  It was a surprise for her when she walked in.  Now she can either use it to pay her monthly dues for a month or use it for merchandise since they sell items at her Curves.  She always wanted a tee shirt so now she can treat herself.
I also mailed a package to Becky last week.  She has a purple bathroom and is so in love with it.  I bought her towels for the bathroom – 2 lavender bath sheets, 2 hand towels, and 2 wash cloths.  At the bottom of the box, under the towels, I packed 2 new outfits – one for her and one for her sister.  I thought she could use it for her new job or school and Renee might like it, too.  I annotated which outfit belongs to who so there is no fighting – plus they both have different tastes in clothing and different sizes.
Anyway, today at lunch is our balloon launch for our children that left too soon.  I will go and launch a balloon for Jake.
Later this afternoon – around 5ish is our company picnic.  It will be at the Sky Sox stadium.  We are having a buffet!  At 7:05 the game starts! 
Today is a busy day.  I may just skip Curves and veg at *Bucks.

I have not written in a week…so let’s see…
Well, my Little Sister cancelled our outing today.  Her Mom called last night and said she had strep throat.  Yikes!  I don’t want to be around that household!
Yesterday was my Friday off.  I vegged a bit and went out to eat with my Curves buddies last night.  It was fun.
It is really chilly today and I LOVE it!  I have not had my Saturday *Bucks yet and it is 3:15pm in the afternoon.  Chilly weather draws me to *Bucks.  I skipped it today after my Curves workout.  I wasn’t feeling in the mood – if you can believe that!
I sent my girls a surprise package in the mail and they got it on Tuesday this past week.  Becky called me to thank me.  I was bummed to hear that they went out drinking in their new outfits – to the point that Becky puked all night long.  Well…so much for surprises…right?
Here’s a funny for you.  Renee – my estranged daughter – called me a couple times this week.  She wanted to know if I claimed her on my taxes.  No, I don’t.  She thought if I claimed her on my taxes she would pay ""in state"" tuition at the college she plans to attend in FL!  Hmmm…how dumb is that?  Even if I claimed her on my Colorado taxes – she would still have to pay ""out of state"" tuition since she lives in FL!  Maybe she should skip college altogether and work full-time at Publix…LOL.  I think she is trying to get into college really quickly since her Dad is making her sister pay rent since she never finished high school and could NOT go to college.  I guess she thought her Dad would never follow thru with his ""I will pay your rent if you go to college"". 
I have started studying my computer repair course again.  I kind of dropped the ball since my last exam in January.  It is interesting.  I just had to surf the internet to research some stats on a Super Micro SUPER P4SPE motherboard.  I took a test yesterday on-line and did well – 100%.  Now I am into the unit on ""System Boards and Component Identification.  The only thing I don’t like about this course is the ""unprofessionally produced workbooks"".  One of my pet peeves is typos and poorly written course material.  For example – this is an actual sentence out of the course material ""Based on the answers to the questions, other questions the system asks until it arrives at a solution or set of possible solutions.""..yea …like ""What did I just read?""  This is NOT a sentence.  It is an incomplete thought!  Anyway, I sure critiqued them in the past on this material and just recently critiqued them yesterday via email.  I offered to proof their courseware as an independent contractor!  I told them I was a courseware developer for 4+ years in the military and that could expect to get negative feedback on their courseware if they didn’t clean it up before sending it out to confuse the students.
Anyway….nothing else to report…..OH!  I almost fogot!  I am reading the latest and final book by Elizabeth Kubler-Ross:  On Grief and Grieving.  It is an ez to read book.  She wrote the book ""On Death and Dying"" years ago.  That book was more catered to those that were facing death themselves.  This new book is written for those that are left behind.  I am thinking of buying another copy and donating it to our local library in memory of Jake.

With the prices of gas I don’t think too many people will be planning any trips – plane-wise or otherwise. 
I have been watching the news with Hurricane Katrina.  I was so glad to see the Army come in with helicopters and amphibous vehicles.  It makes me feel so proud of the military.  Having been in the military, I know the military trains its people well and they will do a good job in LA and MS.
I think I am going to relax this weekend and hang low.  I picked up a new Danielle Steele paperback, Johnny Angel.  I have started reading it and I think it is going to be a good read.
My daughter started college this week in Orlando.  She seems excited; it is a new experience for her.  She is taking 4 classes and plans to keep working 35 hours a week in a grocery store bakery.  I am proud of her.  Her sister is back in high school trying to get the half credit she needs to graduate.  She is also working 40 hours a week at a child care center.  She loves her job!  I think she plans to start college in January to study Early Childhood Education.  We talk often.
My son and his wife are going to Destin, FL for the Labor Day weekend.  I talk to him every weekend.  I just called him Thursday night to ensure that he checked ahead to make sure there was no hurricane damage where he was heading.  So far, everything is a go.  He left sometime today.
My only comment to the unsigned noter:  Yes, I am glad it was only a ticket.  However, I did not drive thru a barricaded road in excess of over 50+ mph.  I was driving with traffic on a main artery thru town.
I hope you never have to endure the loss of a child.  Only then will you understand my feelings towards the driver of the car that hit my son.   I would never wish such pain on anyone.  It will be 5  years this month that my son was taken from our family.  We hurt now and always.  It 4ever changed our lives.  If your note was meant to cause an emotional reaction, you were successful.  Your scored!  
I hope you have a nice weekend and do something positve for others.  I wish you well.  Do something meaningful this weekend; you should make a donation to the Red Cross for the hurricane victims in LA and MS.

I was in JCPenney shopping yesterday.  I was looking at the Beds in a Bag.  This is so cool – you get the comforter, sheet set, bed skirt, and 2 pillow shams all for one price.  Anyway, I was noticing the difference in price between the 200 and the 250  thread count sets.  Hmmm….so I found a ""Martha Stewart"" llooking kinda customer and asked her what the difference was between the 2 thread counts.  She told me it was the softness.  Wow!  I never knew that.  So..if you have a choice between 200, 250, 300, 320, etc. thread counts – the bigger the number the softer your sleep!  Well I decided on the Queen size set with 200 thread count.  It was such a great sale; I paid $69.99 for the set – regularly priced at @ $129.99 for the set.  Of course, JCPenney probably purchased it wholesale for much cheaper, but I think i got  a great deal.  As far as softness, it doesn’t matter to me.  By the time I hit the sack each night I am too exhausted to notice…LOL.

The local library district is reading Tales of the Arabian Nights starting in October for the All Pikes Peak Reads program.  I thought it might be a cool thing to do with my Little Sister.  I am meeting with her today at 2pm.  I am going to take her out for ice-cream at Coldstone and catch up with  her life.  I have not seen her since July.  Her schedule has been too busy.
Do you think she would like to participate in this library project or it too ""uncool"" for a 12 year old?
I picked up a book to check it out.  I have never read Tales of the Arabian Nights.  It seems like a fun thing to do.  There is going to be a ""kick off"" party for this on October 2 in the park downtown, Acacia Park.  If she is not interested, I think I am going to do it anyway.

I spent about 3 hours with my Little Sister today.  We went to Coldstone Creamery for ice-cream.  It was so great!  I actually skipped lunch so I would not feel so guilty eating that rich ice-cream.  Afterwards we went to Walmart to shop for school supplies.  I am donating a set of 8th grade school supplies to the local Middle School this week.  Jake would have been attending that school in 8th grade this year…(sigh).  It was easy to shop with my Little Sister because she was a great help in finding the stuff!  Then we went to the library to get her a copy of the book, ""Tales of the Arabian Nights"".  We are going to participate in the library program or at least try it.  She also found 3 other books she seemed to find interesting.  I think it was a fun trip to the library for her.  We even got her a new library card; one she could wear on her key chain.
Now it is time to hit the sheets and start another exciting week in the World of Work tomorrow.

…asked my little boy, Jake, 5 years ago.  ""What is today, Jake?"", I answered.  He smiled and replied, ""The first day of Fall, Mom!""  I smiled back and said, ""How did you know that, Jake?""  He smiled and said, ""I learned it at school.""  I smiled back and said, ""You are getting so smart!""
I had just held him back in 3rd grade and put him in a new school.  He had struggled for 3 years and hated school.  He was finally getting to enjoy school and then – 3 weeks later – he was killed in a gocart accident.  He would have been in 8th grade this year.  If you believe in Heaven then their must be Middle Schools there, too.  Right.
Every Fall, on this day, a memory of a life cut too short.  Soon the neighbor’s maple tree leaves will turn orange and more memories of Jake will spill out.  It’s ok.  Memories are 4ever.

..my youngest child was taken from me in a tragic gocart/auto accident.  Today, I was in the cemetery for the ""Strolling With Angels"" memory walk we started a few years ago with our local Chapter of The Compassionate Friends.  It was a beautiful day for a walk.  A friend joined me.  We hung out at Jake’s ""resting place"" for awhile and talked.  Then we headed over to *Bucks for our favorite drink.
Later on this afternoon, I am picking up my ""Little Sister"".  She wants to see a scary movie – The Exorcism of Emily Rose.  It is not my choice for a movie, but she wants to see it – so we are going.  I hope I can sit through it without freaking out in front of her…..LOL.
Tomorrow I am going to see ""March of the Penguins"" with a great friend and then out to dinner.  So, I am keeping busy this weekend.
I rented my Halloween costume for our holiday potluck at work.  I am going to be a ""Court Jester"" from the Medieval time era.  It is such a cool costume!  I will have to link some pics for you to see it!  I love the cool hat and shoes!  I also went a step further, I bought this cool half mask to match my costume.  Just wait til you see it!  Jake would have laughed so hard to see me as a ""jester""!  LOL.  A co-worker rented her costume, too.  She is going to be a Princess from the Medieval time era.  She has a beautiful costume!  Sometime over the Halloween weekend, we will wear our costumes and go to dinner and a movie.  We have to get our money’s worth out of these rentals!!
Last weekend I was in Minneapolis, MN for training for my new volunteer community position:  Chapter Leader of the Pikes Peak Chapter of The Compassionate Friends.  It was a busy weekend!  I met some new friends and had a nice time.  One of my new friends lost her 21 year old son in Iraq.  We bonded like ""best friends"".  We had such a busy schedule, but we did slip away to the ""Mall of America"".  We missed the shuttle from our hotel to the mall so we walked over.  It was about a mile or so walk, but we enjoyed visiting with each other.  I would like to go back with my daughters and see the entire mall.  We only were there for about an hour.  We caught the shuttle back to the hotel in time for our group dinner at 6:30pm.  I bought a souvenir for my Little Sister and a Minnesota sweatshirt for myself.  I love to buy shirts and sweatshirts from other places.  My son just sent me a nice t-shirt from FL – a Hard Rock Cafe Tee from Destin, FL.
We are starting a book discussion at work – over lunchtime – once a week.  We are reading ""Self Matters"" by Dr. Phil.  I have already read it, but it is such a great book!  I am enjoying re-reading it.  It is making me re-evaluate my life and my desire to teach school.  Oh no!  I bet I will be enrolled in a teacher certification program by January!  I guess I should just go to school at night and get certified, take a leave of absence from work to student teach and press on.  Maybe once I have my certificate in hand, I will be more apt to get a teaching job.  I have been accepted into 2 Alternative Teaching Programs – where you teach full-time under contract and go to school at the same time.  I have had ZERO luck in finding a teaching job – so maybe I need to reverse my plans – go to school at night – keep my current job – and earn my certificate that way.  Who knows!  Dr. Phil’s book is so good that I recommend it to all my friends and will be doing it again!
Anyway, life is the same for me as usual:  work, Curves, piano lessons, and whatever jumps on my plate!

Well, I went to the movie and saw ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"".  It was not too scary.  It was based on a true story!  Interesting.
Tomorrow will be a lighter day – I am going to the movies with a friend.  We are going to see ""March of the Penguins"".
An interesting note about tonite, my Little Sister and I decided to visit the Ladies Room after the movies.  When I was washing my hands I was shocked to see her putting money in the vending machines in the Ladies Room!  I was a bit unez.  I thought she was purchasing a condom, but it was actually lip gloss!  Thank goodness!
I never knew you could buy candy, lip gloss, and Advil in the Ladies’ room!
Good night OD Land.

March of the Penguins is a GREAT movie!  I loved it.  Those penguins were so beautiful and how they mate and share the responsibility of the babies is wonderful.  If I was a teacher in the Sciences (elementary, middle school, or high school), I would give my students extra credit for seeing this movie.  It is so educational and the scenery is just awesome!
Do you know how long penguins can hold their breath and how far down into the ocean they can dive?  You will be amazed – go see the movie!
I forgot to tell you that there were 3 red carnations on Jake’s memorial when I went to visit the cemetery yesterday.  They seemed wilted from the weather.  I often wonder who visits Jake and leaves things.  I often wonder if the boy that hit Jake goes to visit him: he would be 21 today.  I know you cannot forget a car accident – much less one that takes a life.   I guess I am thinking too much again….
Have a great week!  I get to attend a conference tomorrow:  Conflict Management for Women.  I hope to learn some interesting things.

…I am going back to school to get my teacher’s certification.  I have been wanting to do this since I left the AF almost 13 years ago.  So – starting in January 2006 – it’s back to school 4 me!  Yep – re-reading Dr. Phil’s book, Self Matters, pushed me over the line to seek out my ""authentic self"".  I certainly don’t have a ""passion"" for what I am doing now and I can’t afford to throw away any more of my time on a job that is not fulfilling me.
On another note, I spent time with my Little Sister yesterday.  We went to the park downtown.  There was a kick off party for the ""Tales of the Arabian Nights"".  It was fun.  We saw some dancers – like the kind you think about when you think back to Sinbad the Sailor days…LOL.  There were several booths for crafts and face painting.  We had a great time. 
Afterwards, we went to the library to check out the Hispanic Heritage Week display.  Afterall, she IS hispanic!  Then she wanted to check out some books.  I was thrilled to see that she was enjoying the library and reading.  When I met her in March she did not care much for reading, but she has impressed me lately!  I hope to keep her interested in school because it is so important!
I check out my first Harry Potter book.  I have heard so much about  those books!
By the way, Tales of the Arabian Night is an interesting book.  My little sister lost interest in it, but I think I am going to stick it out and maybe see some of the theatrical productions that are coming out in our community based on this book!

I have been busy since I last wrote in here.
I spent some time Saturday with my Little Sister.  We carved a pumpkin together.  We had fun.  I think we enjoy the time more when we are at my place.  When we go to the movies or attend activities, we don’t have much time to vist with each other.  
This weekend our company is participating in a community event – painting an apartment for a needy family.  I will do that on Saturday.  It should be fun and rewarding.  I won’t be able to connect with my Little Sister because I will also be working on Sunday.  We are doing on-orbit testing with a recently launched satellite.  I will have a very brief weekend.
I have decided to go to Tallahassee for Thanksgiving.  My son and his wife invited me to their place.  They also invited his sisters, who live in Orlando.  If all works out, we will all be together for Thanksgiving.
I will start my on-line teacher certification in January.  This should be quite an adventure.
I bought a 1997 Camry for Renee.  I am trying to orchestrate getting it to her.  I purchased it thru a high school/college friend in GA who owns his own car/truck business in Valdosta, GA.  The car is now at my brother’s house.  I hope to have it delivered to Renee in a couple weeks.  The car she has been driving is not reliable – 1994 Volvo.  Her Dad gave it to her for graduation.  I sure hope she takes care of this Camry.  I got such a great deal on it!  It is a 4 door LE with a spoiler on the back.  It only has 148,000 miles on it.  My brother is a mechanic.  I had him pick it up and check it out and he said it was a great deal.  The purpose of this car is to provide reliable transportation to college for Renee.  She is enrolled at a community college in FL and is taking 4 classes and working almost 40 hours a week.   To teach some responsibility, she has agreed to pay me $50/ month car payments.  So we will see how this works out for her.
As far as Renee’s sister, I told her I would help her out when she goes to college, too.  Right now she is still trying to finish high school!
So – that is what is new with me.

It is hard to believe that Halloween is just around the corner!  Colorado has already had snow (on Columbus Day) and Christmas decorations are going up in stores (i.e. Walgreens, Longs Drugs, etc.).
Gee – it goes so quickly!
I have been so busy at work.  I just got home from working at Schriever Air Force Base – out east of town.  We are doing on-orbit testing on a newly launched GPS satellite.  
Tomorrow I am going to paint an apartment with some co-workers for a low income family.  Sunday I will be back out at the Base testing.
I am sure next week will fly by, too!  
I will be working on Halloween night, too!
I will be going out to dinner with friends on October 29th – dressed in costume.  I am a Court Jester.  If I get pics, I will post them….LOL.  One friend is a Renaissance Princess and the other is TBD.

I just got back from ""making a difference"" in our community.  Several co-workers participated in this event.  We painted the inside of a large apartment.  I brought a friend.  We painted the downstairs bathroom.  We had fun visiting and laughing and painting together.  The apartment is for low-income people, but it was a NICE apartment!  It was a 2 bedroom 2 bath spacious apartment!  We always enjoy participating in community projects and do it often at work.  
We were given t-shirts and certificates of appreciation.  I guess every October on this weekend it is ""Make A Difference In Your Community"" weekend.
Afterwards, my friend and I went out to Applebees for lunch.  We always enjoy each other’s company.  We are planning an afternoon at the movies followed by dinner one day this upcoming week.  I am looking forward to it.
Did I tell you that I am getting a car for Renee?  Well…she just informed me on Wednesday that her driver’s license has been suspended for nonpayment of a speeding ticket.  Gee…I guess things never get any better with her and her sister.  Her sister lost her job last month and just found another one after 3 weeks!
On the upside, Renee is doing really well in college.
How is Becky doing in high school?  I will never know.  Renee doesn’t share any info on Becky and I don’t ask.  It is better this way.
Well, I guess I am going to relax a bit – since tomorrow – it is back to work at Schriever AFB.  It is kinda interesting reading satellite telemetry again.  I haven’t done this since 1991!  It all comes back to you …like swimming or riding a bike.

Today I was off – a much needed day of rest – comp time.  So I went to a movie with a girl friend.  I chose ""The Fog"".  Oh my goodness!  This was quite the movie – full of suspense and lots of scenes to make you jump.
Next time – I will pick a ""chick flick""!
Tomorrow is another day of rest.  I will be back to work on Sunday.
I finally made myself sit down and start reading the first Harry Potter book:  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone.  It seems to be ok.  There sure are some interesting names in there!
Have a great Thursday evening.
Oh – by the way – did I tell you I did the 6 week weight management program at Curves?  Well, I GAINED 2.5 lbs but lost 6.75 inches!  My metabolism is jacked up by doing the Weight Watcher’s program for 3 years – so I have to start eating 2500 calories a day now to reset my metabolism – appparently it is too low.  I have to weigh each day and when I gain 3 lbs – I have to revert back to eating 1200 calories a day with 20 or less carbs for 3 days.  I will lose the 3lbs and start my 2500 calorie routine again until I can go about 3 or 4 weeks b4 I gain the 3lbs.  Once this happens – I should be able to go back to 1600 calories a day and lose weight and get to my goal weight.  I just need to figure out how to eat 2500 calories a day to reset my metabolism.  I had a hard time fitting in 1600 calories a day!  I started today.  I guess I will have to go to Gunther Toody’s or Sonic and have a caloried-loaded shake for dessert tonite…LOL.

Well, I had a nice Thanksgiving.  I went to GA to visit my Mom and brothers from 19-23 Nov and then drove to Tallahassee on 23 Nov to visit my son.  We had Thanksgiving at his place.  The girls came up from Orlando and my Mom and brothers drove down from Georgia.  We had a n wonderful get together.  We spent a couple evenings in the hot tub, too!  I left their place on 25 Nov and went back to Mom’s place and flew home to Colorado on Saturday night – 26 Nov.
It is hard turning around from that East Coast time!  I still am trying to do it!  Losing a couple hours is tough!
My daughters seem to be doing fine.  The one in high school should be done after she takes her final exam.  She hopes to start college in January.
The one in college looked a bit rough.  I believe she is burning the candle at both ends…LOL.  She looked tired and frumpy but was happy to be with all of us for Thanksgiving.
My Mom enjoyed seeing all my kids.  It has been quite a while since she has seen them all together.  She always enjoys visiting with everyone.
I will try to post some pics soon.
I did see the car I bought for Renee.  It is sure nice.  She seems to like it and it runs great.  It pays to have a mechanic for a brother!  (My brother is a mechanic at a Chrysler dealership in Valdosta, GA)
I hooked up with a young man that I babysat many moons ago.  He is now 35 with a family of his own.  Now that make you feel old!  I visited with him, his family, and his mother.
I bumped into my old high school teacher when I was working out at Curves in my hometown.  She was fun to visit with, too!
Every time I go home to my small hometown it is fun to remember the ""good ole days"".  My town has about 4300 people living there!  I would love to relocate but there are no jobs back there.  So I will remain here and visit when I can.  I think my brother and his son will be coming out to visit me the week after XMAS.  It will be nice to have company out here for a change.
Thanksgiving is gone and Christmas is around the corner.  One holiday is done and one more to go.
I hope everyone had a nice Thanksgiving filled with family, friends, and blessings.

I have sponsored several soldiers in the past.  I have 4 now – 2 in IRAQ and 2 in Afghanistan.  One sent me an ""Evil Eye"" from Afghanistan.  It is a decoration to hang in your home. It is supposed to keep evil away from your home.

Has anyone out there had any experience with taking the GED?  If so, please note my OD with any positive or negative input.  My daughter is taking it on December 10.

I sometimes wonder why Becky is choosing to take the GED on December 10.  It is almost an 8 hour test with 240 questions in five subject areas PLUS an essay.  The subject areas are:  Language Arts/Reading, Language Arts/Writing (Essay), Social Studies, Science, and Math.  She supposedly signed up for it today and will be taking it on Saturday.  It just seems like a lot of information to brush up on in such a few days.
I hope she does well.

Today I am taking my Little Sister out to Calhan to see a ""real’ Nativity Scene.  Real is defined as ""with real animals"" like a camel, donkey, sheep, and goats.  I think I am more excited than she is about this adventure out East.
Last night I went out with some ladies.  The conversation was all about dating and meeting this ""hot"" single doctor – so Middle School.  I think I will pass on future dinners of this type.  However the night was crisp and the Baileys and coffee I had with dinner was just the right treat for me.
Today I have to try to get my Christmas packages out to the soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan.  I sponsor 4 and 2 are enroute home – so just 2 packages to mail.  Each package has microwavable popcore, a ""new release"" DVD, and something to read in their spare time.  Oh – and some home-baked oatmeal raisin cookies.
My ""Christmas cards for soldiers"" project is now getting donations like cookes and Boy Scout popcorn!  If this continues, I will need donations for postage…LOL.
Tomorrow night is the Candlelight ceremony for Jake and all the kids that left too soon.  I am really hoping I can handle it.  It tears me apart each December.
Monday is my bday so I am taking the day off – Yay!
Well – I got to get going on my day – housework, laundry, post office, CURVES!
Have a great weekend.

Well, yesterday afternoon, I went to the movies to see Derailed.  Wow!  This movie starts off  a bit slow and then BAM!  it takes off til the end!
Anyway, as I was standing in line to buy my ticket, a lady in the line next to me was short on cash.  She was short a quarter.  She told the ticket dude that she didn’t have any more $ on her and he seemed to think …oh well…so I reached over and said, ""Here – I will cover it.""  I handed her a $20 bill.  That is all I had on me.  She looked at me and said, ""All I need is a quarter.  Do you have any change?""  I said, ""No.  Take what you need out of this (as I handed her the $20 bill).""  She looked at me and said ""Thank you so much.""  I said, ""Merry Christmas!""  The lady behind her looked at me and said, ""Well, that is probably the cheapest gift you bought this year,"" and was laughing at me!  I was clue less on how to respond to her so I said, ""Well, it IS the thought that counts, right?""
So anyway, this movie, Derailed, starts off with a lady buying a guy a bus ticket and it changes his life!  Boy!  I was a little worried!
Happy Monday!  Today is my bday.  My brothers and Mom sent me nice cards.  They all came today!  Perfect timing!  Mom sent me some $ so I think I will go shopping later or sometime this week.  All I asked for was an apron!  Maybe I will be buy something warm…like a hoodie from Hot Topic or The Buckle.  It is chilly here you know.

Well, yesterday was a great day for me.  I think I have added a new routine to my life – take the day off on my birthday!  It is the best birthday present I can give myself.
I worked out at Curves in the morning and kinda putzed around the house til early afternoon.  I picked up a couple XMAS presents and then met a friend and her daughter for dinner at Red Lobster.  It was a nice evening!  They gave me a very nice bday card with a  STARBUCKS gift card inside!
Yesterdat – 47 years ago – I was born in Fairbanks, Alaska at Ladd Air Force Base.  My dad was an Airman in the military and my Mom is Filipino.   21 years ago, I returned to Alaska as a 1LT in the Air Force.  Ladd Air Force Base is now an Army Base – Fort Wainwright.  I liked Alaska.  Maybe someday I will return to teach school there.  The people are so friendly.  I visited the Anchorage area again in 1992 when my husband (now ex) was assigned to Clear Air Force Station.  I remember visiting a little village – Nenana.  The people were so nice – almost like being in the South!
Today I am back to work and the usual routine.  I encourage everyone out there in OD Land to take their bday off this month and next year.  It is so relaxing and you owe it to yourself!  2 of my 3 kids called to wish me a Happy Birthday.  I missed my son’s call, but he left me a nice voicemail.  My other daughter called to tell me she was definitely taking the GED this Thursday and Friday (split into 2 sessions).  I wished her my best.

It is so cold outside!  It has been snowing since yesterday!
I have already been to the post office 2x today to mail out packages.  I have mailed 3 boxes to the troops in the Middle East.  I was able to collet 91 XMAS cards, AND 2 tins of cookies, AND a large tin of Boy Scout popcorn!  Next time I should also collect postage!  LOL.
The post office has been open for the past 2 Sundays.  There was a guy in front of me with 16 boxes to mail!  Wow!
My daughters called yesterday.  The one in college is considering moving to Michigan to go to an Art school there where her new step Mom goes to school.  She even called her new step Mom – ""Mom"".  Ouch!  Now that hurts.  She seems to feel it is best to get away from her ""irresponsible"" sister.  Hmmm…they call each other that so often it depends on what day of the week it is….
My other daughter called to say she DID NOT take the GED.  She has rescheduled for January 17, 2006.  It seems she and her sister are not getting along.  I wonder how she will do without her sister nearby?  
My son and his wife leave on Thursday to spend XMAS in Kansas City, Kansas with her sister and family.
It is 19 degrees outside.  I went for a walk b4 7am this morning to grab a newspaper and boy was it chilly!  It was 12 degrees!
Tomorrow I will be picking up my Little Sister to take her out to dinner at a program sponsored by Big Brothers Big Sisters.  She is getting a present from the ""Giving Tree"" program.  It should be fun for both of us.  Her Mom asked if I would take the younger sister, too.  She is 4.  I said, ""Sure"".  It will be quite an adventure for the younger sister.

I had to share someone with my special XMAS dinner at Ruby’s Diner.
I went to dinner last night at Ruby’s with a friend I have known for about 10 years.  We worked to together in the past.  We actually were officemates for quite awhile.  He knew Jake and Jake described him best …""Mom, he’s like a big kid in a man’s body…""  He introduced Jake to the excitement of model rocket launches, too.  He is in a rocket club.  So…T and I go back a long ways….  He was one of a few to get my email at 3 0r 4 am on September 25 announcing Jake’s accident.  So…it has been a long friendship with life changing moments.  T lost his ""best"" friend to Cancer about 2 years (I think) after I lost Jake.  It was a hard time for T.  Then about a year after that, he lost his Mom, too.  So we have been through alot together.  He met me after my divorce, also.  He was always a great listener.  I joked with him last night that knowing me has probably scared him away from women..with the divorce experience…LOL.  I call him my ""CB"" friend – for Confirmed Bachelor.
T and I also share the same military backgrounds, too.  We were both space operations officers in the Air Force.  We joke alot and use our military space ""jargon"" often to entertain each other.  For instance, if someone we know is not coming across clearly in their attempts to communicate, I tell them ""In the satellite world we refer to that as LOC – Loss of Comm""…LOL.
So, T and I spend time together like ""best friends"".  We meet for lunch and dinner when we can fit it into our busy lives.  We recently started trying to do movies together.  About 2 years ago, we started trying to meet for Christmas dinner b4 he and I left town to be with our families.  His family lives in AZ and mine lives in FL and GA.  We also do a small gift exchange.  He is so creative and fun!  Well, this year was very creative…..
I got him this little ""flip top"" guy you can sit on your desk.  It is a ""Red Sox"" guy and he holds peanuts, candy, etc.  You flip him open and get your treats.  T is a BIG Red Sox fan and when they won the World Series, T was so HAPPY!  He is just a normal all around typical sports fan.  So, I thought I had picked out a ""special"" gift for him.  He liked it!
He brought me a gift bag and slowly handed me my stocking stuffers first.  It was a movie I had raved about a couple years ago.  It is an older movie, but I had never seen it til recently.  ""Hoosiers"" is the name of the movie.  A co-worker burned a copy to DVD for me, but it kept ""freezing"" while I watching it so I finally had to rent it to finish it.  Now I have my own personal copy!  Yay for me!  I can enjoy it on Christmas!  My other stocking stuffer was a *Bucks card!  I am on a roll now!!  T knows I LOVE *Bucks; he doesn’t drink coffee.  I keep planning to meet him at *Bucks sometime so I can drink coffee and he can drink hot chocolate…lol…but our hectic life has not made time for that yet.  His last gift for me was something only he and I can appreciate the humor in. He gave me some Quaker Old Fashioned Grits.  I LOVE grits and HE has never had any.  He is originally from the NE – Connecticut.  I have always talked about how great a breakfast is with Grits and he could never relate.  He always told me about the line in the ""My Cousin Vinny"" movie – ""What is a grit?""….Lol.  We sure enjoy making each other laugh.  When I opened up the top to the grits container – there was ANOTHER surprise inside!  It was a small box buried in the grits.  I opened it and was absolutely speechless!  It was a beautiful double hearted necklace with diamonds.  My hands were shaking as I slowly removed it from the box.  He smiled at me and said, ""You are special"".  He wanted to give me something back since he felt I do so much for others…..I am still speechless as I write this….Of course, I thanked him over and over.  I am just not good at this!  I was totally caught off guard with this gift.  
So we talked and talked until we were about the only ones left in the restaurant.  Then we decided to leave after about 9pm.  He walked me to my truck and I gave him another hug and he asked for a kiss.  So – I gave T a quick kiss.  I kissed my Confirmed Bachelor Friend!  Nothing serious – just a quick brush against our lips.  What an interesting night.   What a ""special"" Christmas surprise!

Here it is again…Christmas.  I have had a friend stay over since Friday night; so I have had company.  She and I have had alot of fun together.  She is having some marital issues and instead of going to a ""safehouse"", I told her to stay at my house.  We have been having fun.  Saturday we did a little shopping for ourselves and went out for a late lunch at Red Lobster.  We stayed so busy running around that the stores closed b4 we could buy groceries for our Christmas dinner!
We watched a couple DVDs yesterday.  You have to check out ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"".  I think I have to buy that to add to my DVD collection.
Today my friend went out to see King Kong.  I was going to see ""The Whale and the Squid"" at the local downtown theater, but I changed my mind.  I think I am going to watch ""Guess Who"" with Ashton Kutcher.  I will watch the Whale and the Squid tomorrow afternoon.
I heard from one of the kids today – Becky.  She called to thank me for her Christmas present.  I left a voice message on Renee’s cell phone and I still have not heard from her.  They are in NC for the big Christmas with her Dad’s family.  He is home from the Marshall Islands with his new wife.  All seems to be going well.  My son and his wife are in Kansas with her family for Christmas.  I left  a message on his wife’s cell, too.
I called my family and was able to visit with them on the phone, too.
My friend took me out for Christmas dinner – at Dennys.  Well, there are not TOO many choices today for Christmas dinner.  NEXT YEAR I will have my act together and have all my fixings for a Christmas dinner bought B4 December!
Now – it is movie time – then bedtime – then sleep in late time!  Tomorrow is a holiday for me – woo hoo!

My friend moved into her own apt yesterday.  It was kind of sad to be in this empty house once again.  I have gotten so used to living alone – so I will be okay.  She seemed excited about her new apt.  She left some things here so I need to give her a buzz to remind her.  She left some frozen food in the freezer and a couple personal items.  It is only 6:56am now – so I will call her later – around 10ish.  I am sure she is exhausted from all the moving and excitement of her new place yesterday.
Not much on the agenda today.  I will probably go into the office this morning to make up some time.  Since I work 9 hour days I always have to either charge an hour vacation on a holiday (holidays are 8 hours for charging purposes)or make the time up.  I am a week+ in the hole for vacation.  I am planning to save it up and go home for my Mom’s bday in May.  Her bday is May 8.  My older son’s bday is May 9 – and he lives just a couple hours away from Mom.  Then Jake’s bday is May 14 – at least I will be with family on his bday.  It is hard to believe he would be 15 this year…(sigh).  I would really like to stay awhile in May if I can survive the heat wave!

A good friend of mine passed away on Sunday.  He was only 45.  I met him in the Air Force in 1983.  We went to tech school together.  We were just out of college and commissioned officers in the Air Force.  After tech school – we went separate ways to separate new assignments.  We met again in 1985 as instructors at the same tech school.  We both had married, too.  He married a lady who had a 7 year old son.  I had a 6 year old son when I got married.  We had similar marriages.  His wife and I were pregnant at the same time.  She delivered her daughter on Dec. 31, 1986.  I delivered my twin daughters 5 days later in the same hospital.  A year or so later, his wife had another daughter.  My friend was so proud of his daughters.  Four years later, I had another son.  My friend and I split up again in separate assignments.  I left the tech school in 1989.  He left the tech school in 1991 (the year my son was born).  He never met Jake because when he did reconnect with me in the late 90s, Jake was not home because he was visiting with his Dad.  Jake died in 2000 and when I next saw my friend, it was after Jake died – sometime around 2001 or 2002.
My friend had a troubled marriage, but he did his best to provide for his wife and children.  He moved to New Bern, NC in July 2004 to live with his parents.  He taught school there.  He was 2 classes away from becoming a certified teacher in NC.  His wife and kids lived in FL.
My friend used to email me and call me ""just to check in"".  He would send me funny emails and inspirational emails.  I just shared a funny email with him last week.
When I was checking my email on Monday night – I noticed an email from someone I did not know.  The subject:  Randy M. Passed Away on Sunday.  My heart stopped and I was freaked out.  Is this a joke?  Well, it is NOT funny.  I opened the email.  It was from a friend of his who received my emails – forwarded from my friend, Randy.  I called her to talk to her.  She told me he spoke of me often.  She just wanted me know the tragic news so she emailed me.
I have had a difficult  time these past few days.  I wrote something to be read at his funeral.  His funeral will be on Saturday in New Bern, NC.  I will wait a few days – about 10 – then I will write a nice letter to his parents.  I will let them know what a special man their son was to many people.  I will tell them about his wife and I being in the hospital at the same time.  We were across the hall from each other at Fitzsimmons Army Medical Center (now closed) in Denver, CO.  I was in a deep sleep and the twins were fussing and crying.  I did not hear them.  I was zoned out.  Randy came across the hall and peeked into my room.  He saw the babies crying and he recognized me in the bed fast asleep.  He picked up the twins and comforted them until they fell back to sleep.  He told me this story after I got out of the hospital.  He laughed because he is a big strapping black man and was holding twin infants that were white.  The twins were tiny, too!  Both weighed less than 6 lbs.  He made me laugh alot.  I made him laugh, too.  
I don’t quite understand why Randy died, but I do know this:  He was a man of  with ""faith"".  He is now ""home"".

This has been a hard week for me.  My dear friend, Randy, had his funeral today at 10:00am in NC- 8am in Colorado.  I heard it was a packed house and that he touched so many lives.  I will soon post what I had read at Randy’s funeral.  
I miss you, Randy!  You never met my son in this lifetime, but I am so sure he will be waiting for you to give you a ride in his gocart.  Please hug him for me and tell him I miss him so much.  I know you had a troubled marriage and I know you did your best for them.  I hope in my heart that your beautiful daughters will keep your memory alive.  Your wife and all 3 of your children (Randy adopted his wife’s son after they were married) came up to NC.  Two very special friends of yours have been in touch with me all week – via phone and email.  I don’t know them, but it doesn’t matter – we all know you…and that bond will remain with us 4ever.   I will write a letter to  your parents, Randy.  I will share with them what a wonderful man you were and all the fun times we had teaching tech school together at Lowry AFB.  I will try to find our tech school group graduation picture from 1983 and see if they can find you and me in the picture.  I guess I better send them a current picture of me so they can at least have a hint, huh?!  I will also call them.  I will never 4get you, Randy, but I will never understand why you left so soon.

I ran an errand then picked up my Little Sister.  We went to Barnes and Noble so she could spend her giftcard she got for Christmas.  She is so generous.  She bought a picture book for her little sister.  She also bought something for herself.  Then we went next door to Starbucks to visit and drink coffee and hot chocolate.
We sure have come along ways since we first met.  I think I am going to end this relationship after our year ends – March 2006.  I am going to be getting really busy with work and possibly traveling again.  I think it is best and only fair that she get a new Big Sister that is less busy.  I was going to tell her about it today, but we were having such a nice time I decided not to ruin it for us.
She wants to either be a Vet or a Lawyer when she grows up.  I am trying to arrange a visit to my Vet so she can shadow a Vet in the office for an hour or so one Saturday.  She seems excited about that, too!  I am hoping I can arrange her to see some Teen Court at the Courthouse sometime, too.  She has great ambtions and I want her to keep thinking BIG!
Well, on the personal side, I am stressed.  I have to somehow tell my friend that gave me the nice necklace for Christmas that I am not interested in anything but a ""friendship"".  Any ideas?  I am stressed because Valentine’s Day is coming and I don’t want him to spend any money on me!  HELP!

     Teachers get about 16 weeks of vacation each year and I think that is great!  The most vacation I ever had was 30 days and this was when I was in the military!  I only get 2 weeks vacation in my current job.  Actually, teachers having 16 weeks of paid vacation is NOT the reason I want to be a teacher.  I want to be a teacher because I want to fulfill a dream that I have had since I was in fourth grade, I want a challenging job, and I want to have job satisfaction.
     The first reason I want to be a teacher is because I have always wanted to teach since I was in the fourth grade.  My fourth grade teacher, Mrs. Johnson, told our class all the great benefits of being a teacher.  This is when my dream first started.  Later on in life, I worked as a teacher’s aide when I was a Senior in high school.  I worked every afternoon in a 3rd grade classroom and I earned high school credits for this, too!  It was so much fun!  I enjoyed creating bulletin boards and leading the class during their reading times. Third graders were so entertaining, too!  I remember when one of the students came up to me to show me his new braces; he was so proud.  Years have passed since those days, but I never gave up on the dream to teach!  You only live once so you have to pursue your dreams.
     The second reason I want to be a teacher is because I think teaching would be a challenging job.  Children seem to always want to challenge and there is never a dull moment.  I have had a lot of different jobs in my life and none have been very challenging or exciting.  Having had some military experience, I think I would like to teach in an Alternative Middle School because I am very structured and orderly.  I am almost sure that teaching in an alternative school would be a great adventure and full of challenges everyday.  I might have to wear a suit of armor to class each day for my own protection!
     The third reason I want to be a teacher is because I think teaching would give me job satisfaction.  Job satisfaction is so elusive these days that I almost think “job satisfaction” might be an oxymoron?!    I don’t wake up each morning racing out the door to my current job for the job satisfaction; you have to trust me on this.  My current job is so routine and lacks any excitement.  A trained monkey could probably do my job.  The most excitement at my current job is when the server crashes and the email goes down!  Working with children and teaching them to learn would give me great job satisfaction because I would see results everyday!  I would leave the classroom everyday, or maybe at least a couple days a month, with some feeling of accomplishment.
     In summary, teachers do have a lot of vacation but they work hard and deserve those 16 weeks of vacation!  Vacation is nice, but that is not the reason I want to teach.   I want to be a teacher because I have always wanted to teach, teaching would be a challenge, and teaching children would give me some job satisfaction.  I  am looking forward to each day in the classroom knowing I might feel a sense of accomplishment at the end of each day.  Maybe I am wrong about this or maybe I am looking through “rose-colored” glasses, but I will never know until I try it!  Look out world; Patty is going into the classroom!
They liked the essay – so onward!  My first homework assignment was to watch a video clip of 4 Kindergarten teachers discussing their students who did not have preschool experience and zero social skills.  It was interesting.  Then I had to answer 4 questions on my observations.  All this was done on-line.   It too
k me a bit to figure out how to post my homework assignment (http://www.taskstream.com) – but then everything is so new to me!  This whole video thing was so funny to me because my sound doesn’t work on my computer.  Since I cannot read lips – I replaced my speakers and after having NO SOUND for 12+ months – it is so exciting to hear something from my computer!  I love the sound of incoming email – having heard that sound in months!
My next assignment is writing about parent communication.  This requires some research (they give me the links to read articles on this topic) and I have to write another essay to answer some questions.  I think this is going to be a fun adventure.  I also found out that I have to complete 40-60 hours ""in classroom"" observations – so their goes my vacation – not going to GA or FL – but going into a classroom.  Woo-Hoo!  I have communicating via email with one of my classmates;  she lives in Maryland.  I guess I have to write instructions on dowloading music to an MP3 player.  Hmmm…since I don’t have one of these…FIELD TRIP to Best Buy!  Yea!

Today it was very cold and windy.  It was about 7:30am and I was putting gas in the van at the local Conoco.  As I was freezing and waiting for the tank to fill up, I saw a Mom and son walking along the street.  I saw how close the son stood next to his Mom.  He was almost as tall as she was.  It took me back to 5+ years ago…when Jake was almost as tall as me…..I miss him.  I miss having him make me laugh.  I have moments like this often.  Also, today I went into the break room at work to get some bottled water.  I opened up the fridge and ""BAM""!  I had another ""moment"".  I saw the cans of Brisk Ice Tea.  Jake loved to drink Brisk..(sigh).  I guess Jake is letting me know that he is thinking of me…it just takes my breath away….

When I returned ""North Country"", I browsed and found 4 more DVDs for the weekend.  I think I am going to just relax this weekend and watch movies.  I heard a funny story on the radio recently.  The DJ said he took his Mom to see ""Walk the Line"".  She has not been to the movies in long time and he said she loved Johnny Cash.  So they went to the movies and as soon as  Joaquin Phoenix showed up playing Johnny Cash – his Mom yelled out in the theater ""..THATS NOT JOHNNY CASH!""….I laughed so hard!  What would we do on our ride to work without radios in our cars?!  Radios are my entertainment and news – quicker than reading the newspaper!  Have a great Friday!  Today, at lunch, a co-worker and I are going into the lab to play a new card game she taught me yesterday – Phase 10.  It is going to be fun and relaxing.  TGIF!  Thank God It’s Friday!

Why do abused women NOT report the abuse?  My 19 year old daughter was ""smacked"" very hard by her 26 year old boyfriend and she will not press charges!  I am glad he lives in FL and I live in CO – or there might have been some more smackin’ between him and me!  I have made arrangements for her to leave Orlando.  I just hope her twin sister doesn’t have to deal with him since she is still in Orlando.  If I get another phone call and he has hurt her – I will be on the next plane to the Big O!  Maybe I will post a picture or maybe not..it angers me each time I look at the pictures.
I am sorry – just venting.

668,https://www.opendiary.com/m/j8xmom/not-enough-sand-5368579/,2006-03-10,Not Enough Sand,"
My daugher passed the GED and earned a FL state high school diploma!  Her face is still healing and she has been in touch.  I am sorry that she had to be ""smacked"" by a boyfriend but I think it is these ""painful"" life lessons that make ""impacting"" results in our lives.  She is fine – out of Orlando – healing – and making plans to move on with her life.
As for me, I have picked up some ""bug"" at work and feel very under the weather.  I did manage to pick up my Little Sister today.  She is ""shadowing"" a doctor at the vet’s office.  She once expressed interest in becoming a vet so I wanted to give her this opportunity to see it ""hands-on"".  She felt ok being left there alone with the staff.  She is so young – 12 – that I worry about her like she is my own.  Afterall, my  youngest would be 14 today if he was still with me….sigh..I am sure she is in goods hands there.  I will stop by to pick up some bakery treats for the vet staff to say ""thanks"" for letting my Little hang out and learn today.
Next week, my Little and I will visit ""Teen Court"".  She has expressed an interest in being a lawyer, too.  So – I think this will be a good experience, too.  Teen Court is where kids have a ""second chance"" by going b4 a jury of their peers.  Of course there will be mentoring by real attorneys – so it will be interesting.  Since my divorce I don’t care too much for attorneys.  Question:  If you have 100 attorneys at the bottom of an ocean floor coverd up to their necks in sand – what do you have?  Answer:  NOT ENOUGH SAND!  However, I will say that I have ""Pre-Paid"" legal services and I used it for the first time last month and I like it!  It was for minor stuff but the attorney walked me through everything.  Not bad for $16/month.

My next assignment for school is to write a lesson on multiculturalism.  Exciting, huh!?  Well, I was thinking about writing a lesson about the Mexican girls celebrating their 15th bday – – Quinceanera Celebration.  What do you think?  Do you have any other ideas what I could write a lesson on for multicultralism?  I picked the Quinceanera because my ""Little Sister"" is Hispanic.  We talked about this celebration on Saturday after she visited my vet for a ""field trip"".  She did enjoy her visit to the vet.  They gave her the tour of the facility and she was able to be in several appointments ""shadowing"" the doctor.
So far, this on-line school has been interesting.  I have completed 5 assignments and received grades for 4 – all passing!  It usually takes about 4 days to post a grade for assignments.  My last assignment was fun; it dealt with technology.  I had to create a ""signature"" in the Paint program, scan a newspaper banner, and take a digital picture.  Then all projects had to saved as jpegs and uploaded as attachments for grading.  It was fun – different – but fun.  It would probably have been very difficult if I had not had the experience with computers.
I read an interesting story in the paper yesterday.  It was about a group of Moms called ""Punky Moms"".  Their website is http://www.punkymoms.com  Be careful viewing the postcards at this site; they are a bit ""different""!  Since my hair is black and punk red now I thought I would fit in with this website, but it is too young for me….LOL.
Today I am taking my Little Sister to visit Teen Court.  It should be interesting.  I pick her up around 4:30ish and then we head over to the Municipal Court Building and take our seats around 5ish.  I should have something interesting to share after this adventure.  
Have a great day!

Also, must possess the physical stamina of a pack mule and be able to go from zero to 60 mph in three seconds flat in case, this time, the screams from the backyard are not someone just crying wolf. Must be willing to face stimulating technical challenges, such as small   gadget repair, mysteriously sluggish toilets and stuck zippers. Must screen phone calls, maintain calendars and coordinate production of   multiple homework projects. Must have ability to plan and organize social gatherings for clients of all ages and mental outlooks. Must be   willing to be indispensable one minute, an embarrassment the next.

Last night I went to the Fine Arts Center to hear John Lennon’s first wife do a live interview.  Her name is Cynthia Lennon – mother of Juliann Lennon – former first wife of John Lennon.  She was so cool to listen to and observe.  She is so down 2 Earth!  She wrote the book  ""John"" and did a book signing, too.  I got the book and had it signed.  I was reading the first chapter today.  It is ez reading.  Unfortunately, the first chapter is about being notified of John’s death in NY in December, 1980.
She talked about her book and her life with John Lennon.  She is an interesting woman and I could listen to her all night.  I did have to listen closely since she has the English accent – being from England you know.  Amazing night!

Today it is windy outside and about 50 degrees.  It is nice.  I met a friend at Starbucks for coffee this morning.  We never see each other due to our work schedules.  I have about finished up my taxes and will mail them on or b4 April 17.  You know that is the deadline this year – April 17th – since April 15th is on a Saturday.   I have to pay Uncle Sam this year since I don’t have any dependents, but it IS WORTH the absence of the teen drama…LOL.
My grader liked my lesson plan on the Quinceanera!  I thought it was fun reading about this celebration, too!
Thursday I was in the Police Operations Center to get my fingerprints done for a legal name change.  It was kinda interesting there.  A lady came running in and she WAS hysterical.  Apparently she had a restraining order against her husband and he drove by her home or neighborhood.  She was terrified.  I cannot even imagine what it must be like to be in a relationship like that.  I was scared, too!  I was worried he would come in and start shooting or something!  I was trying to locate a safe place to hide in case!  Anyway, he never came and I got my fingerprints done and went back to work..whew! 
I am going to take my Little Sister to see Nanny McPhee today.

Wow – I am just a not writer anymore.  I guess i pop in and out on OD.  What a new look!  I thought I was at the wrong site.
Anyway, I completed by 1 year match with my Little Sister.  I decided to close my match, but if she wants to call and keep in touch, I am ok with that.  We had our last ""official"" outing last Saturday.  We went to the movies to see ""Big Moma’s House"".  The movie was a riot!
I have just been staying busy with work, school, and life.  School is interesting, but it is getting expensive with all the textbooks!  I am sure I will have spent all of the Air Force stipend sooner than later!  $5000 doesn’t go far in college these days.
I am going back East to visit family at the end of this month – WOO HOO! I plan to spend some time with my daughter that went thru the ordeal with her boyfriend – the domestic violence scene.  We plan to see a movie and chill at Starbucks.  I will be there for my Mom’s bday on May 8th (#81) and my son’s bday on May 9 (#27).  
My daughter is on her way into the Air Force.  I think that life lesson with the bad boyfriend was a wake-up call to her to get herself in gear and plan a life for herself.  She leaves for Basic Training in July and will graduate sometime in September.  I will be in San Antonio for her graduation; I wouldn’t miss it for the world!  Her job will be in ""Munitions"" and she can travel all over the states and world in that career field!  Even though she passed her GED she is back in school to get her high school diploma.  She needs that half credit in math.  She says she has a great teacher and he has volunteered to tutor her when she needs it.  She is also starting a new job.  She will be working for Publix.  She will be working in the bakery – yum!  She has had some obstacles to climb around.  She recently found out that she has no car insurance; her Dad dropped her from his policy a long time ago and never told her.  Unfortunately, her driving record is so bad her insurance rates are high.  My son and I have decided to let her get her own policy so she can learn the consequences of tickets and accidents.  So now she walks to school and catches the bus to work.  She is not too crazy about it but nobody ever promised us life would be a bed of roses.  At least she won’t be spending money on gas, car insurance, and car payments, right?
The other daughter is in ""her own world"".  She only calls to complain about the expenses in life.  I listen while she whines.  I don’t send money because that would make her problems exist 4ever.  She is finishing up her 1st year in college in Orlando.  She misses her twin sister, but I think both of them need to grow up and move on with life without the other attached at the hip!  I can’t understand the drug world out there.  Apparently both my girls hooked up wih useless ""coke-head"" dudes.  I wish they would move on and try a Pepsi product…something that is not going to leave a bad ""after taste"" in their lives!  ARGHHH!
I think I am going to head over to Starbucks and read the Sunday paper.  All of you have nice Sunday and the rest the week!

My daughter and I are enjoying our quality time.  She and I have been planning our road trip.  I am coming back to get her the first week in July.  We are driving her car back to Colorado.  She is going to visit with me and her friends b4 she leaves for basic training on 18 July.
My other daughter landed a nice job in a medical office bldg.  She makes $10/hour – much more than she was making at the Publix bakery.  She loves her job.  She works 8:30am to 5:30pm Monday thru Friday.  She has mandatory overtime once a week and that is at time and a half ($15/hour).  She seems to like it. 
I cannot believe how hot and humid it is here – ugh!  It is in the high 80s.  I can’t wait to hit the shower and wash the grim and sweat off!  I walked the dogs 3 times since I got here today at 1130am!  
I am taking my Mom to Plains, GA on Monday.  Plains is the home of our 39th President – Jimmy Carter.  Then on Tuesday I am going to Thomasville, GA to see my son’s new house and take him out for his bday dinner – #27 this year.  I am also going to try and take my Mom to see this Plantation in Thomasville!  It should be interesting to go on tour of this plantation house.
What do you think of the illegal immigrants that went on strike on Monday?  I think they should become US citizens and stay here because they work.  We have too many people in this country that ARE US citizens that DO NOT WORK!  There – I have spoke my peace.  My Mom and I argue endlessly about this topic.  I think people who come here and work should be able to stay once they obtain citizenship.

Well, I guess I better start packing my stuff and head back to Mom’s in Nashville, GA – about a 2 hour drive.  I promised her I would be home for dinner and my son called and said he would be back in Tallahassee tonite at 6:30pm.  Hmmmm…I guess I can’t wait that long since I promised Mom I would be home tonite.  Decisions…decisions….

Tomorrow is the 4th of July – Yay!  It’s a holiday – no work!  I am going to grill a steak and celebrate.  Maybe I will check out a movie, too.  I will have to reward myself to motivate me to do my school work tomorrow.  I have a paper I need to wrap up and turn in – it is about Indians and Mexicans – 2 subcultures in Colorado.  The research has been interesting.  Did you know India has the second largest population in the world?  Did you know Mexicans play football but it is played like we play soccer?  Did you know reading about these cultures fills up your brain really quick?  I need to put it all on paper b4 I 4get!
My daughter Becky will be going to Basic training this month.  She is supposed to come out here for 3 days to visit her friends and then the ships out of Denver on July 18.
Her sister is between jobs.  She is also moving into another place.  Hmmmm…kids lead such a carefree life when they are teenagers.
My son and his wife are in Savannah, GA – enjoying the touristy things there – like riding the River Boat on the Savannah River, doing the Ghost Walk downtown, etc.  It is so refreshing to hear about their adventures.  They should be back in their home tonite and will relax tomorrow on the 4th.  I wonder if they stopped at the famous RiverStreet Sweets shop on the River Walk?!  The stuff in that shop is so delicious – like the pralines!
Have a great 4th of July!  I hope the weather is great for all to grill outside!

..of My Business.  Here is an excerpt.  ""Unhappily, most of us allow others to determine who and what we are.  We decide who we are by the way we are treated and thought of by others.  We become so concerned about being judged that we perform poorly, make mistakes, or perhaps always try to live up to someone else’s expectations.  We become our own worst critics.  Yet, if you believe in your own self-worth and in the availability of opportunities, you are the captian of your own ship and the master of you own destiny.""

The Pillsbury Doughboy died yesterday of a yeast infection and trauma complications from repeated pokes in the belly. He was 71.
Doughboy was buried in a lightly greased coffin. Dozens of celebrities turned out to pay their respects, including Mrs. Butterworth, Hungry Jack, the California Raisins, Betty Crocker, the Hostess Twinkies, and Captain Crunch. The grave site was piled high with flours.
Aunt Jemima delivered the eulogy and lovingly described Doughboy as a man who never knew how much he was kneaded.
Doughboy rose quickly in show business, but his later life was filled with turnovers. He was not considered a very smart cookie, wasting much of his dough on half-baked schemes.
Despite being a little flaky at times he still was a crusty old man and was considered a positive roll model for millions.
Doughboy is survived by his wife Play Dough, two children, John Dough and Jane Dough, plus they had one in the oven.
He is also survived by his elderly father, Pop Tart. The funeral was held at 3:50 for about 20 minutes.

Her sister seems to be lost and missing her so much – must be a twin thing.  She parties alot.  She called me up drunk last weekend…LOL.  
Yesterday I vegged after cleaning house and watched 3 great DVDs:  Benchwarmers, Eight Below, and Cheaper by the Dozen Part II.  All were great movies.  There were some emotional moments to offset the funny ones, too.  Jake would have loved Benchwarmers.  I think I will buy a copy and donate to the local library in his memory.  
Now – off to Starbucks to read the Sunday paper and people watch!

Well, it has been awhile since I have written.  All is well in my neck of the world.  I have definitely been captivated with my new past time – playing volleyball.  I just signed up for another 9 week league.  We are having so much fun!
I got a letter, finally, from my daughter at Basic.  She is fine.  I missed her call yesterday and I was so bummed, but I saved her message so I can replay it when I want to hear her voice.  Today she leaves for Warrior Week.  That should be fun – getting away from the Base and having fun in the woods with her flight.  I think she will like it.
Her sister returns to college on the 28th of this month.
Nothing else to report.
I will try to check in again soon.
Oops, I 4got something.  I made a bereavement basket for a friend who lost her 23 year old son in March.  I waited awhile to put it together.  It turned out nicely.  I brought it to Curves.  I left it there so she will have a surprise the next time she comes to workout.  I just missed her yesterday!  My timing leaves a lot to be desired.  Here’s what I put in it:

Finding Neverland DVD – when I saw this movie at the theater – it was like a visit from Jake.  I hope it comforts her, too. 
Popcorn to go with the move – regular and kettlecorn 
4×6 Family photo frame 
Wallet size photo frame with a March birthstone (her son was born in March) 
A grief book 
A Journal – as you know – journaling has helped me heal on OD 
Chocolate – everyone knows it is the ""all season"" comfort food 
2 cans of mixed nuts – nice snack food to ward off the guilt from eating all the chocolate – low carb food! 
Some pamphlets from The Compassionate Friends 
Party light candle with crystal votive holder 
Stuffed rabbit holding a blue egg 
Nice large basket to hold all these items.  I put colored confetti in the bottom of the basket.  Topped this off with fake white silk rose petals.  Wrapped the basket with clear purple wrapping paper and 2 beautiful white bows.  I wrote her a nice note in a card with heartfelt words that only another person who has lost a child could write.  I think she will be picking it up tomorrow if she works out.  I hope so!

Did I tell you I joined another summer volleyball league?  Well, I did and it is the bomb!  I have such a fun time on Tuesday nights.  Our first game we did well, but our second game was not great.  We had fun so to me that is all that matters.
I was supposed to leave on a business trip on Wednesday, but I am still here.  It will either be tomorrow or next week.  I hope it is after Tuesday so I can play another game of volleyball…LOL.
Not much to report here – all quiet on the Western Front.

I like the small town atmosphere in Lompoc.  Did you know the average house around here is about $400K!?
I leave Tuesday.  I will be in TX on Thursday to see my daugher graduate from Basic Training on Friday, September 1.  I can hardly wait.  We will all have good time.  My son and his wife will be there, too.
I will return to Lompoc on September 9.

I get home Sunday – for a week and then back to CA for more work .  I get more tired thinking about it all as I write this.  I hope I wake up soon and feel refreshed.  I am bringin my own blanket on this trip so I don’t freeze on the plane.  I think I will take the little homemade pillow Jake made at school when he was in 3rd grade…(sigh).  I sure miss him.  I will just sleep during the flight.

…since I have written in here.  My trip to CA will be winding down this week and I will be coming home after 30+ days in CA.  It has been alot of long hours at work.  Living away from home makes you appreciate being home.  I have found a local Curves to workout at in Lompoc, but our hours are so long, I haven’t been able to go as much as I would like.  There is also a Starbucks nearby so I have just experienced a new Fall flavor – Maple Machiatto.  It is sweet and definitely a treat on a cool day when I come home – not too cool in CA.  I have been enjoying the morning temps – in the 50s.
I was able to go to Hollywood last weekend.  Boy!  That was an adventure!  I will have to share pics sometime with you.  I saw some strange things down there.  It was fun.  I talked two of my co-workers into going with me by volunteering to drive.  I didn’t think it was a big deal to drive to LA until I got on to the 6 lanes of traffic – whee!  That was another adventure, but we made it there and back just fine.  When we got there, I thought we should all buy a City Pass – a package deal with several things to do for $49.95.  Well, I had to actually do my own credit card transaction because the young boy behind the register didn’t have much computer help.  He asked for my assistance and I helped him out.  While I was in the back of the store talking to some tourists, the check register young man called out for me to come to the head of the line and help me make another sale!  LOL.  I should have gotten my City Pass for free, huh!  We did the tour of the stars’ homes, Wax Museum, Hollywood Museum, the Hollywood Blvd historic walking tour, etc.  It was well worth the money.  The house that impressed me the most was the home of the 18 year old rapper, Little Bow Wow!  Wow!  He bought a beautiful mansion on a corner lot and it was NOT secluded at all!  The other house that was interesting was the house with the 18 ferraris (either red or yellow) parked in front – the home of the two brothers that own GUESS jeans!  I thought the location of the Kodak Theater was interesting, too.  This is where the Oscars are held.  This is actually located in a Mall!  Yep – the red carpeted stairs the stars walk on are actually mall steps.  The curtains are dropped over the store fronts so you would never guess you were in the mall!  We didn’t get to actually tour the Kodak Theater, but we were able to see it.
Anyway, it was a fun adventure for a day.  We left our rooms at 7am and were back in town by 11pm.  We were definitely tired and slept well.

My daughter graduated from Basic training on September 1 and completed tech school on November 8.  She is currently enroute to her first assignment to Idaho.  She is visiting with the new man in her life.  Thank goodness he is in the Air Force, too and probably has better values than the ones she has met in the past.

Well I picked up Mitch Albom’s latest book, For One More Day.  I saw it at Starbucks, but I didn’t want to pay $21.95 for it.  I bought it at Barnes and Noble since I am a member of their book club – for $13 and some cents.  It is a book about spending one more day with a loved one that has passed.  It is written in an interesting way.  Mitch is such a great story teller!  This story is about a pro baseball player who’s life crashes down on him and he goes back to his home town to his boyhood home and his mother is there!  This is all I am going to tell you.  
If I could spend one more day with Jake…(sigh)….I wouldn’t have the time or take the time to write a book about it!  I would just enjoy every minute of it.
Mitch also wrote Tuesdays With Morrie – a very great read about life and dying – so realistic it is scary!  He also wrote the The Five People You Meet in Heaven, but I could not get into that one as well as I did Tuesdays With Morrie.
Have you heard of The Christmas Box?  The Angel of Hope?  I think I am going to try to make a goal of our Compassionate Friends group to try to bring the Angel of Hope to Colorado Springs.  Read about it at http://www.caseproof.com/rpe/angels.php

A couple great quotes to leave you with taken from this book:
""Sharing tales of those we lost is how we keep from really losing them"".  (This is so real to me because I started my OD to write about my son.)
""When someone is in your heart, they’re never truly gone.  They can come back to you, even at unlikely times.""  (Thanks, Jake for drawing my attention to this book at Starbucks on a busy weekday morning.)

I saw ""Deck the Halls"" yesterday with a friend.  It is a funny, feel-good movie.  It will remind you of Chevy Chase in Christmas Vacation but it will get you in the end.

Well, this will be the 7th Christmas without you.  I miss you.  Everyone misses you.  I came home late last night and found some of your schoolwork.  I went thru it and just could not keep from crying.   You were doing so well in school when your second time around in 3rd grade started.
I found a book that you made for me.  It was titled ""Mom’s Book"" by Jake.  It was fun looking at your drawings but I am so sad that I do not have you here to decipher your ""phonetic""  writing.  On page one your drew a picture of yourself and wrote "" I am mosn"".  I don’t understand what you are trying to tell me, but I did love the picture you drew of me standing with you and your friend.  You wrote- Thise is my mom.  She is nise.
…I miss you everyday and can only imagine you as 9 years old, but you would be 15 now.  Your sister, Becky, is now in the Air Force living in Idaho.  Your sister, Renee, is living in FL going to school and working.  They will be 20 next month, but you probably still remember them as being 13.  Your brother, Joe,  and his wife Holly are living in GA now.  AND you are going to be an Uncle, Jake!  Holly made the announcement yesterday….
The half-brother you never knew was your brother is now in 4th grade!  Where does the time go, Jake?
Your  Dad is remarried but he still lives in the Marshall Islands and visits his wife in Michigan at times.  This added another stepbrother and 2 stepsisters to your family.  You have a big family Jake with a big hole in their hearts without you……..
So much has happened since you left us.  We will have so much to share when we join you….
Christmas is not the same without you ….nothing has been the same without you.  
Tonite is our last volleyball game, Jake.  We need alot of help in winning tonite.  I think we have only won once since we started this league in October.  Send some luck to us tonite.  
Today is my birthday and I will always remember my last bday with you.  I never knew it was the last with you.  When I look at the picture of you sitting on my lap that December in 1999 – I close my eyes and rewind my memories of our family.  Memories are 4ever and you will be with us 4ever.
I remember how we enjoyed breakfast every weekend morning while the girls slept in.
I remember how you always made us laugh.
I remember how you always crawled into bed with me to read your Captain Underpants book.
I remember the day you left us…like it was yesterday.  Renee still has a hard time talking about you.  She talks to Becky about you.  She wrote a poem for you on her myspace.com page so I know she thinks of you everyday, too.  She can’t talk about you because she hurts too much.  Becky dreams about you often.  Why don’t you visit me in my dreams?
I baked cookies today.  Baking is not the same without you, either.  Let’s face it – without you – life can feel so empty everyday.  I see teenage boys and think of ""what might have been"" if you were here today.  I think I need to write a book about what it might be like if I was able to visit you now in your new Home.  Everytime I think about writing it, it breaks my heart because it would not be a visit – because I would not want to leave and come back without you.  I cannot even imagine the happiness in Joe’s, Holly’s, Becky’s, and Renee’s eyes if you and I were to surprise them for Christmas!  It has been 6 years, 2 months, 18 days, and about 5.5 hours since I hugged you that Sunday morning b4 you raced out the door with your Dad to ride your go-cart.  I never knew you were going to ride it to Heaven on September 24, 2000 at 2:45pm.  You had your gocart for 9 days and you were only 9 years old when you took that final ride.  It changed our lives 4ever…..

We lost our last game, but we had fun trying to win….  We went out afterwards to celebrate my birthday and 2 others’ birthdays.  We went to the Texas Roadhouse.  It was fun.
I went out ""clubbing"" with some friends Friday night.  Wow!  It was sure loud there; we went to Rumbay.  I sat and people watched from 10pm to 1215 am then I went home.  I really don’t get into dancing – so I drank water and watched my friends have fun on the dance floor.  I saw some interesting ""things"" going on out there on the dance floor!
Today I mailed the last 3 packages to a Marine Unit in Iraq.  I have sent them a total of 6 packages.  My co-workers contributed, too.  I have not heard whether they have received any of them yet.  This time I put in self-addressed envelopes to they can let me know they rec’d them.  We sent 6 boxes total.  It is nice that the post office opens on Sundays b4 Christmas.
I mailed the kids’ stuff last week and the week b4 – so my shopping is done.  Now – I think I will shop for myself and wrap them and put them under the tree so I can have some excitement on XMAS day, too…LOL!
I heard from my oldest son that his wife’s second pregnancy test came back negative – so – she is NOT pregnant.  They are both a bit bummed.  I am sure 2007 will bless them with children.  I think if we think positive – good things will happen.  They were doing the in-vitro process so they have several more frozen embryos to try again.  Keep your fingers crossed for them.  They implanted 2 in November, but it did not work out.

night.  I had quite the adventure today.  My newlywedded daughter was flying thru Denver today with almost a 2 hour layover.  She asked me to come meet her at the airport.  So – I headed out and boy was it an adventure!  The snow was blowing tand he traffic was unbelievable on Christmas Eve  – – so now I know why Santa uses a sleigh.  It took me  almost 2 hours to get up there!  It was about an hour longer than usual.  So we met and grabbed dinner at Panda Express and visited.  We talked about her husband.  It was great!  We asked a total stranger to take our picture (we supplied the digital camera) so we could remember our time together.  
I left her at the Security gate after spending about an hour and a half together.  When I pulled up at my house – almost 2.5 hours later – she called me from Idaho!  The drive back to the Springs was scary to say the least.
Now I am home, sipping on Baileys on the rocks.  I am safe and tomorrow is Christmas.  I am cooking dinner for myself.  If anyone stops by – at least I will have stuff to serve.  If not – leftover turkey is the greatest for sandwiches!
So Jake, Christmas # 7 without you….(sigh) AND you have a new brother-in-law.  He seems to make your sister very happy.  He is definitely very responsible and I hope to meet him in March.  
You know, Jake, Becky looks so much like you (red hair and freckles) that it is always like you are with us when Becky and I visit.  I miss you son – so very much.  Merry Christmas in Heaven!  Love, Mom

Did I tell you that I am sponsoring unit of soldiers stationed in Iraq?  My co-workers pitched in, too, and I was able to ship off 6 boxes of stuff to them.  I finally heard from them – last week!  They are safe and enjoyed receiving the care packages.  They even sent me an updated wish list!  LOL.  They are a unit of 32 soldiers stationed in a very remote area of Iraq.  I think this is what I like most about Christmas – remembering those that protect us and enable us to have our freedom.  If you are interested, check out the website:  http://www.adoptaplatoon.org   You can be a penpal or sponsor during the holidays.  Trust me – it is worth the time and effort.

I am painting the spare bedroom.  Now that my daugher is married and is expecting to come home with her husband, I had to have a place to put them.  I didn’t think they would like staying in separate rooms on twin beds – thus the new project.  I am painting it with a friend.  I will post pics when I am done.  We are painting it 2 colors – an accent wall is ""asparagus"" colored and the the 3 other walls will be a soothing blue color – ""coastal mist"".  We did the accent wall yesterday and today we will do the 3 other walls.  Actually – it is more like a wall and a half since one wall is mostly closet, one is mostly window, and the other wall has the entry door.  We are definitely having fun.  I like ""color"" in a home.  
My oldest son and his wife are coming to visit at the end of February and my daugher and her new husband are coming at the end of March.  So…the room will be ready in plenty of time!  I may have to sleep in it at least once to try it out…LOL!
My next project will be moving the twin bed from Jake’s room into the the girls room (Becky moved into Jake’s room about a year after his accident) and putting a double/full size bed in Jake’s room.  So..if ever the kids ever all come home again – we will have accommodations for the married ones!  If Renee ends up married – we will slide the 2 twin beds together to make it a larger one….now that is thinking ahead!
Anyway – got to get ready for part II of my paint project!

I spent the entire weekend in Idaho with my daughter.  I really liked that small town – Mountain Home.  The people were SO friendly!  I thought I was back in the South.  Mountain Home has under 12,000 people living there – very small compared to the half a million living in the metropolis of Colorado Springs!  I totally enjoyed my visit.  We went up to Boise to check out the mall and see a movie.  We saw ""Freedom Writers"" – excellent movie for teachers and teacher wannabees like me!
So – that’s it for me.  My son and his wife should be visiting in Feb and my daughter and her new husband should be visiting in March.  Renee is too busy to come visit – oh well – to each his own.
It is 16 degrees here!  BRRRRRRRRR!

It is cold and snowing.  Blustery day!  We were able to leave work early today due to the bad weather.  Yay!  I watched Dr. Phil.  It is was 21 degrees today and now it is much colder.  Off to bed with the electric blanket turned up!  
P.S.  I wonder what it will be like tomorrow at 6am.  Blue jeans day?  I hope.  I have to stay warm on the slippery drive to work.  
Next week I will be in FL!  That should be a nice break from this weather.  (Provided the weather here is decent enough for me to drive up to the Denver airport on Tuesday to fly out…LOL.)

713,https://www.opendiary.com/m/j8xmom/why-2374-5368625/,2007-02-24,Why?,"
Why is life so confusing?
I went to FL and was able to have dinner with my daughter.  We had a nice visit.  She brought her boyfriend.  He is very nice and educated.  I enjoyed his conversation.  They seem happy together.
I wish I understood my daughter more.  She is 20 and is going into the Air Force in June.  Now I will have 2 Airman in the family.  She plans to be a Linguist.  She scored very high on the Air Force exam and on the language exam.
Is this wierd or what?  I was with her but felt so far away…like detached.  Like she has a wall up around her.  She seems unhappy living in FL with her Uncle.  She chose to leave Colorado to move to FL.  She didn’t like the house rules here when she was living here (i.e. you have to go to school, you have to be in at curfew, etc.)  Now she is living a totally unsupervised life and seems so unhappy…sigh.  I guess you can only do what you can do, right?  I got depressed after my visit with her.  I was sad.  Is this corny or what?  I felt like a complete failure in life.
Well, I was back in my own bed on Friday night.  My son and his wife came into town and have been with me since Saturday night.  I am having a nice visit.  It is so nice to cook meals and have someone to eat with me.  We had grits, eggs, bacon, and toast for breakfast this morning.  For dinner we have country ribs cooked in a crockpot, corn on the cobb, and a fresh salad with raisins and apples added in!  Yum!
We watched a great DVD today, too .  Check it out – Facing the Giants!  Great movie!  Tell me what you think.  It is a powerful movie about God and believing in Him – ""With God all things are possible"".
Tomorrow is my last day of having my kids here – then they head up to Woodland Park to visit with her family and they return to GA on Saturday.  I will miss them.  
At the end of March, my newlywedded Airman in the Air Force is coming home with her husband.  I will finally meet my new son-in-law!
Gee – where does the time go?  My son has been married for over almost 9 years.  He will be 28 in May!  The twins are now 20 – one is married and in the Air Force and the other is entering the Air Force in June.
In May, Jake’s 16th bday will be celebrated in Heaven.  We miss him.  We talk about him.  We all grieve his absence in our own ways.  
Can u believe I have been writing in OD for 6+ years?  Time.  Appreciate each day and note the simple things in life.  Smile at strangers.  
Thanks for listening all these years and being my virtual friends.  
Tomorrow I am taking the day off and enjoying the simple pleasures of visiting with my son and his wife for the day.
Oh – the weather was beautiful at Cocoa Beach, FL!  It was in the 70s and people were wearing coats!  Imagine that!  I loved the weather, but Colorado is my home now.

Yea, that is what a co-worker named my daughter’s car.  I bought her a car to get her around to and from work last April.  It is a 1990 Chrysler Sedan and ""totally loaded"" with all the digital stuff.  I got this car for a steal!  Well, she blew up the engine after running it hot.  My brother is a certified mechanic so he offered to rebuild the engine to factory specs and NO LABOR charges.  Well, I let him and my daughter work out the $ since it was her car.  It was rebuilt and delivered to me on a flat bed truck from an auto transport company from GA to CO.  I have been driving it and have fallen in love with it.  I put CO plates on it and she is coming down from ID to pick it up this month.  It drives like a dream.  It is a ""classic"" car and you see them on the car lots or in the newspaper listed for $4995, but I got it from the original owner in GA for  $1100.  I took it in yesterday to my local mechanic because it was ""chirping"" and they replaced a belt and pulley and commented on the nice job done on the engine.  I smiled and said, ""Yes, my little brother is an ASC Certified Mechanic in South GA and he rebuilt it to factory specs for less than a $1000"".  They said it would have cost me $4000 for them to rebuild it.  Trust me – I plan to let my daughter know what a real deal she got having her Uncle rebuild her engine.
So anyway, I plan to drive the pimp mobile to work this morning.  It was an all-leather interior and smells like a new car after 17 years!  It has spoked wheels, too!  It took me several minutes to find the right button to move the seat up.  It has a digital readout that says something like ""All system monitor checks are ok"" – like something you would find in a cockpit of a plane or space shuttle!  It has 103,000 miles and than is very little for a car that old!  The average person drives a car about 12,000 miles a year (12,000 x 17 = 204,000).  It is very low mileage compared to the average car this age!
I did mention to my daughter that if she tires of this car that I will take it back in a heartbeat!  It is such a gem – an old gem!  Should I call it a good ole solid rock?

My living room is now a light shade of yellow ""shortbread"" and with an accent wall a little more yellow ""yorkshire pudding"".  I LOVE it.  My house is coming ""alive"" with  color.  
The downstairs family room is woodsy looking.  I have a rocked in fireplace so to bring out the browns in the rocks, I chose ""quaking grass (green)"" on 2 walls  (wall with the fireplace and the opposite facing wall and ""spiced vinegar (biege type color"" on the other 2 walls.
I will post pics when I have my house put back together.  I have stuff in piles in all the other rooms!
Anyway, I am have a delightful time with it all.
We lost a major gov’t contract at work and 100+ people are affected with an impending layoff (including me).  I guess I will have more time to play in the paint cans…LOL.  I plan to substitue teach and work very hard on getting my teaching certificate out of the way.  I am shooting to student teach in January 2008 unless I land a teaching job b4 then (like in a Charter School).  I would like to teach in an alternative middle school.  I think that would be a challenge.  I need to rent a ""suit of armor"" for my first day in an alternative teaching environment.  Picture this….me in a suit of armor marching into the classroom, lifting up my face shield, saying…""Greetings class!  Let’s get ready to rock and roll!""  I will look like the Tin Man in the Wizard of Oz, but I will be the Tin Teacher…LOL.

I have been taking a Saturday morning workshop for the past several Saturdays.  It is an 8 week Bereavement Educational Workshop.  I lam earning something that I think is interesting.  The terms grief and mourning are really 2 different experiences.
Grief is all the emotions you hold within yourself.  Mourning is the outward expression of these emotions.  I have been mourning a bit lately about Jake.  I think it is because I am so ""pegged out"" on my grief meter as the Chapter Leader of the Pikes Peak Chapter of The Compassionate Friends and attending this workshop.  It is all good.  When you can help someone else, you are healing.  As Helen Keller once said, ""It is easier to walk with someone in the dark  than to walk alone in the light…"" or something along those lines.
Have a great weekend and find something nice to do for someone else..even if it is smiling at someone who has a scowl on his/her face and wish them a great weekend, too.

I had a request to write a more detailed entry about this and I will soon.  Things are a bit hectic at the moment.   We are having a big transition at work; my team is in the process of a big lay off.  We lost a major government contract so it has been quite the roller coaster ride at work.  First we were told our last day was April 7.  A week later we were told our last day was extended to July 7.  A few days later we were told the last day was April 30.  Thursday we received our ""release"" letters and notification of severance and NOW our last day is May 31st.  So – it is what it is.  I am looking forward to my transition from Defense contracting to elementary teaching.  I have my substitute license already in place and I am ready to take the plunge into some more new adventures.  However, I have become the ""Chosen"" one and my skill set is being requested by the the winner of the new contract.  So – another hurdle to overcome in the next few weeks – to stay and help them out for a few extra months or to decline politely and head over to the newest elementary school.  Decisions, decisions, decisions…I am a bit worn out from it all.  I am either taking mornings or afternoons off for the rest of this week.  Yesterday it was the afternoon and today it is the morning.   
On a positive note, the newlyweds are in town.  They arrived yesterday and are honeymooning at the Broadmoor!  Wow, huh?!  Anyway, tomorrow I get to have lunch with them and finally meet my new son-in-law.  I am a bit excited and a bit anxious?  They are so excited to be together.  They got married in December and returned to their respective bases – he is in TX and she is ID.  So I am sure they are very happy to see each other, too.  I will patiently wait on the sidelines until my daughter calls or picks me up for lunch tomorrow.  
It is 41 degrees now and it should reach the 70 mark today.  Yippee Skippee!
Gray Tabby – I WILL write this entry about grief and mourning soon.  I agree – whatever the term the bottom line is – we miss them and we will always miss them.  Our bodies are the container for the grief that consumes us and the tears, writing, etc. is our means of releasing these feelings as we mourn them.  Take care and I hold you in my heart as we remember our sons everyday.

Wow – where does the time go?  It has been a long time since I wrote.  I am staying busy with work and school.  Our team is slowly leaving due to the lay off.  I am one of 5 people left.  On June 1st, I will be one of 3 left.  On August 6th we will all be g-o-n-e.   I am hoping to jump into my new teaching career in August.  I plan to sub in all the local school districts.  This should give me some real-world writing experiences for my school papers!  I am presently studying Testing.  I finished up Classroom Management last week – it was a grueling 14 tasks!  Ugh!  I have 5 tasks in Testing then I take the Objective exam; it covers alot of stuff.  I hope I can remember everything I learned in:  Schools and Society, Human Development and Learning, Diversity, Classroom Management, and Testing.  Wish me luck!
I wish I was not so swamped at work and could squeeze in an assignment or two during the week.  As for now, I gave up Curves 2 nights a week to dedicate to homework.
Did I tell you I am going to be a Gramma?  December 5 is the big day!  My son and his wife are expecting their first after almost 10 years.  Keep your fingers crossed for us.  The ultrasounds look fine and the heartbeat has been good so far.
It is cold an rainy in Colorado Springs.
I heard about another good book – On Life’s Disappointments.  It is written by Harold Kushner.  He wrote ""When Bad Things Happen to Good People"", too.  We are discussing it in our book group.  We meet twice a month – like I HAVE TIME for another project….LOL.

I HAD to share this email.  I cannot stop laughing…..!
So, we had this great 10 year old cat named Jack who just recently died. Jack was a great cat and the kids would carry him around and sit on him and nothing ever bothered him. He used to hang out and nap all day long on this mat in our bathroom. 
Well we have 3 kids and at the time of this story they were 4 years old, 3 years old and 1 year old. The middle one is Eli. Eli really loves chapstick. LOVES it. He kept asking to use my chapstick and then losing it. So finally one day I showed him where in the bathroom I keep my chapstick and how he could use it whenever he wanted to but he needed to put it right back in the drawer when he was done. 
Last year on Mother’s Day, we were having the typical rush around and try to get ready for Church with everyone crying and carrying on. My two boys are fighting over the toy in the cereal box. I am try ing to nurse my little one at the same time I am putting on my make-up. Everything is a mess and everyone has long forgotten that this is a wonderful day to honor me and the amazing job that is motherhood. 
We finally have the older one and and the baby loaded in the car and I am looking for Eli. I have searched everywhere and I finally round the corner to go into the bathroom. And there was Eli. He was applying my chapstick very carefully to Jack’s . .. . rear end. Eli looked right into my eyes and said ""chapped."" Now if you have a cat, you know that he is right–their little butts do look pretty chapped. And, frankly, Jack didn’t seem to mind. 
And the only question to really ask at that point was whether it was the FIRST time Eli had done that to the cat’s behind or the hundredth. 
And THAT is my favorite Mother’s Day moment ever because it reminds us that no matter how hard we try to civilize these glorious little creatures, there will always be that day when you realize they’ve been using your chapstick on the cat’s butt.

It is hard to believe that this is your 16th bday.  It is the seventh one without you.  Where does the time go?  I released 16 balloons for you at the cemetery today.  It was a cloudy day, but the balloons were so colorful.  My Random Act of Kindness for you today was buying Starbucks coffee for the vehicle behind me in the drive-thru.  I miss you, Jake.  We all miss you.
I wonder how tall and robust you would be today.  I wonder how fast you would be driving me over to the DMV to get your driver’s license today.  I wonder so much about what would have been.  I wish I could believe people when they say ""he is in a better place"", ""God needed him"", ""it was his time"".  I think these are meant to ease my heart, but the words don’t bring me any comfort.  I wish you would visit me in my dreams like you do so often for your sister, Becky.  I will be patient and wait.  I love you son and you will always remain a part of our family and will never be forgotten.  Nine years seems like such a short time for you to have been with us.  I could never be an organ donor.  I cannot donate a broken heart.

Today I started reading a new book.  It was written by Harold Kushner – ""Overcoming Life’s Disappointments"".  It is based on the story of Moses and how he lived his life.  I would like to share a quote from the book with you ""…do things for people not because of who they are or what they do in return, but because of who you are"".  I am really getting into this book.  He tells a story about a man visiting his wife in a nursing home.  The wife has Alzheimers and people ask this man why he visits his wife each day since she doesn’t even know who he is.  His answer was short but has a lot of depth in it.  He said, ""Because I know who I am"".
I challenge any of you out there that like to read – check out this book from the library.  It will speak volumes to you.
On another note, today I went to the office to study for school – too many distractions at home.  When I drove up, 3 young boys were skateboarding and asked for water.  I went into our secure building and went into our break room and purchased 3 bottled waters and 3 bags of M&Ms.  They were so happy to see the refreshments.  However – when I left the building – almost 3 hours later – I was surprised to see they had littered our premises with their empty water bottles and empty M&M bags.  I picked everything up and threw it in the trash – which was at the entrance where I gave them their refreshments.  I went home wondering why they did something like that?  Maybe I will ask them if I run into them again on an upcoming weekend visit to the office.  Or maybe…I should have reminded them to use the trash can when they were finished eating?  Who knows…..
Anyway…back to my book….hope you all had a nice Memorial Day weekend.

Today at about 2:30pm I get an email from Western Governor’s University congratulating me for my Passing Score.  OMG!  I am still in a daze, but am glad this is done -now on to more interesting things in the world of teaching!  This exam covered a large area of topics in Human Development, Schools and Society, Diversity and Inclusion, Classroom Managment and Testing.  Thank goodness the first part of the test was on Testing – a unit I am currently working on.  I hear my next semester is going to be wicked!  Wish me luck!

Saying Grace In A  Restaurant
 
Along with the laughter from  the other customers nearby, I heard a woman remark, ""That’s what’s wrong  with this country. Kids today don’t even know how to pray. Asking  God for ice cream!  Why, I  never!""
Hearing this, my son burst into  tears and asked me, ""Did I do it wrong? Is God  mad at me?""  As I  held him and assured him that he had done a terrific job, and God  was certainly not mad at him, an elderly gentleman approached the  table.  He  winked at my son and said, ""I happen to know that God thought that  was a great  prayer.""
""Really?"" my son  asked.
""Cross my heart,"" the man  replied.
Then, in a theatrical whisper,  he added (indicating the woman whose remark had started this whole  thing), ""Too bad she never asks God for ice cream. A little ice  cream is good for the soul  sometimes.""
Naturally, I bought my kids ice  cream at the end of the meal. My son stared at his for a moment, and  then did something I will remember the rest of my life.
He  picked up his sundae and, without a word, walked over and placed it  in front of the woman. With a big smile he told her, ""Here, this is  for you.   Ice cream is good for the soul sometimes; and my soul  is good already.""

Something deep to share with you – an Email story.
At a dinner party, a KIA (Know-It-All) began downgrading teachers.  He reminded the other dinner guests what they say about teachers:  ""Those who can, do. Those who can’t, teach.""  
To stress his point he said to another guest:  ""You’re a teacher, Bonnie. Be honest. What do you make?
Bonnie, who had a reputation for honesty and frankness replied,  ""You want to  know what I make?""  She paused for a second, then began…""Well, I make kids work harder than they ever thought they could.  I make a C+ feel like the Congressional Medal of Honor.  I make kids sit through 40 minutes of class time when their parents can’t make them sit for 5 without an I Pod, Game Cube or movie rental… You want to know what I make?""  She paused again and looked at each and every person at the table. ""I make kids wonder.  I make them question.  I make them criticize.  I make them apologize and mean it. I make them have respect and take responsibility for their actions.  I teach them to write and then I make them write.  I make them read, read, read.  I make them show all their work in math. I make my students from other countries learn everything they need to know in English while preserving their unique cultural identity.  I make my classroom a place where all my students feel safe.  I make my students stand to say the Pledge of Allegiance tothe Flag, because we live in the United States of America. Finally, I make them understand that if they use the gifts they were given, work hard, and follow their hearts, they can succeed in life.""  Bonnie paused one last time and then continued.  ""Then, when people try to judge me by what I make, I can hold my head up high and pay no attention because they are ignorant.  You want to know what I make?   I MAKE A DIFFERENCE.  What do you make?""

I finally finished up my course in Testing.  I am now on a short break before I start my next class – Instructional Planning and Strategies.  I will have 18 assignments to finish by 30 Jul so I can student teach in January, 2008.  I cannot even imagine that this is possible!  Let’s hope I can do it.
Tonite I organized a dinner out for our local Compassionate Friends group.  I reserved a room for 20 of us and only about 11 showed.  I think the waitress was not too happy, but some things I cannot control.  Why do people say they will be there and not show up?  I am sure things came up so I am not going to worry about it.  Since the gratuity was built into each individual check, the waitress made some $.  I guess the important thing is that we all had a nice dinner buffet and good conversation.
Anyway, I am going to try and plant a butterfly bush tomorrow.  Wish me luck.  I certainly don’t have a green thumb…just dirt under my fingernails for all my efforts!  I also bought some Asiatic Lillies to plant.  I think they have such a cool name for a flower!
Here’s a question for you – how many oceans are there in the World?  You cannot surf the net and look it up!  Write the first answer that comes to mind.  I was writing objectives for my assignment recently and chose geography.  Also, how many continents are there in the World?  I found some interesting info about these topics when I was researching them.  Teaching is going to be such an adventure.  I am so excited!

Have you heard of this author?  He wrote ""The Power of Now"" and ""A New Earth:  Awakening to Your Life’s Purpose"".  Deep!  I attended a book talk on A New Earth:  Awakening to Your Life’s Purpose and we basically did not talk about the book.  I think it is deep but very in tune with our lives today.  I heard Paris Hilton is reading ""The Power of Now"" – so maybe that one is not too deep…LOL.  I think I will check it out.

I finally finished my library book, ""On Life’s Disappointments"".  Wow!  This book is definitely worth the read!  I renewed it twice – not because I couldn’t get into reading it – but because with work, school, and other activities – I was pulled away.  I finished it today and immediately reserved about 3 more of his books at the libary (on-line).  Moses sure was an interesting fellow.  I learned so much about Moses and his life and how we can learn from Moses.
I reviewed NPR’s Summer Book Recommendations for 2007 and found some books that interested me.  I looked up at the library and most are available, but I have to wait for them – so I might be reading them in 2008…LOL  Here are some of the ones I would like to read:
Five Skies by Ron Carlson
The Maytrees: A Novel by Annie Dillard
The Story of the Cannibal Woman: A Novel by Maryse Conde
The Sunlight Dialogues by John Gardner
Anyway, if you have read any of these – let me know if they are any good.  Book reviews are like movie reviews – it is all in the eyes of the reader…
Have a great rest of the weekend.

It was really warm yesterday.  A good friend and her husband came over to visit.  I have known her since 1994!  Anyway, she has 5 kids – 2 are grown and are in their 30s.  She has 3 adopted kids,: 13, 7, and 2.  So she came to visit and catch up.  Here 7 and 2 year old are brother and sister.  Their biological mom was not very responsible.  She had 4 kids – the two my friend adopted, one who passed away at the age of 2 months (drug related), and a recent newborn in February.  Anyway, my friend is a great Mom and her husband is so supportive.
We walked over to Jake’s school to visit his garden and the playground built in his memory.  Along the way we browsed at a couple garage sales.  When we arrived at the school, her 2 year old thought he was at Disney!  He loved all the equipment.  It is designed for ages 3-5.
As we sat there and watched him and his 7 year old sister play – another family of 6 came to hang out, too.  This family had 4 kids- all under the age of 5.  They were all so cute and having a blast on the playground.  3 of the 4 were triplets!
We finished off our afternoon with a a trip to the Dairy Queen.  It was so relaxing yesterday.

I discovered the ""Fast Reads"" in the library last week.  You can only check them out for a week and cannot renew them.  So I checked out ""Susannah’s Garden"" by Debbie MaComber.  It is really easy to read.  I really didn’t start reading it until about 4 days after I got it.  So now it is due tomorrow.  I am on Chapter 9 of 42 and I am  not a Speed Reader!  Since it is a good book, I think I will go pick it up at the bookstore and finish it.  I think it has a little bit of everything in it.  As far as I have read, Susannah’s Dad passed away a few months ago – maybe 2 or 3 months ago and she has just placed her Mom in assisted living.  Her Mom really misses her husband; they were married almost 60 years!  Susannah also lost her brother in a car accident when he was 21 and she was 18.  So there is quite abit of loss in this book.  Susannah is married (about our age) and has 2 children – a son and daughter.  The daugher is 20 and has just arrived home for the summer break and is miserable.  The greatest thing about this book is that it is so easy to read – like a good Danielle Steele book!
I just changed out the pads in my swamp cooler.  It is such a chore but had to be done.  I think I have mastered it now.  I guess I could have my own business, Swamp Cooler – Have Straw Will Travel….LOL.  Swamp coolers are the greatest invention for dry climates!  
Anyway, another Monday lies ahead of us.  At least it is a 4 day week with the 4th of July falling on a Wednesday.  Yay!
The Farmers’ Markets got into full swing on Saturday.  I love to visit the Market and chat with the farmers and their families.  I bought some nice tomatoes and fresh pole beans!  I think it would be so much fun to be a farmer’s wife.
Have a great week!

I was eating at Village Inn yesterday with my co-worker.  I could not help but notice the little red-head with freckles sitting behind her.  He was out to lunch with his Gramma or Great Gramma.  He seemed to be having a great time.  This little boy made me think of Jake.  When I checked out at the register – I sent ice-cream sundas to their table in memory of Jake….sigh.
Today I planned to make a dent in my garage cleaning/organization.  I opened a box of Jake’s things – oops – that ended my time in the garage.  It is so hard..still…always…and 4ever……

I 4got to mention in my previous entry something about Jake’s box of toys.  There was this battery-operated car in the box; it was one of his favorites.  I moved the switch to ""on"" and it almost jumped out of my hands.  I didn’t know batteries could last almost 7 years….(sigh)…I am still drained from this event early this morning…..

Today I received mail about my sponsored child in India.  I have sponsored her since she was 5 years old thru the organization Christian Children’s Fund.  She actually celebrated her 16th bday last month…or so I thought.  
I opened the letter and was so surprised.  Her picture looked very different.  Then I noted her birthdate was changed again!  When I first sponsored her, they told me her birthday was 12/25/91.  About 3 or so years ago, they apologized and said they errored; her birthdate was actually in June/1991.  Anyway, as I opened this letter and was studying the picture and important info about her, I noticed the birthday was now April/1996.  I am like ""What""!?  So I decided I better read the cover letter.  
Surprise!  Surprise!  My sponsored child recently married and is no longer in need of a sponsor.  This letter is offering me another child!  Whew!  Now that explains the picture and birthday.  I now have the opportunity to sponsor an 11 year old girl from India.  I guess once you get into this sponsorship program you cannot escape!  LOL.  I think it is a worthwhile program.  For $21/month you can make such a difference in the life of a child 1000s of miles away.  You actually receive written letters from your sponsored child, too.  I have not decided whether I am going to do this yet; I am still a bit alarmed that my original sponsored child is now married at the young age of 16!  I am sure it was an ""arranged"" marriage.  I sure hope she is happy and I wish her my best.
Anyway, good night people in OD Land……for some reason I am really tired and draggin’ today.  I think it is because I napped so long on the 4th!  My body is confused!  Nap?  What is that?!  Well, I sure enjoyed my nap but can’t seem to awaken from it and it was yesterday!  Or maybe it was the carb lunch today.  I went to a luncheon at Mimis today.  My muffin was huge!  I ate a delicious walnut chicken salad and half a muffin and now I am zonked – it all started after lunch today.  I even skipped out on my workout at Curves (shakes head in shame…) – I dozed off on the couch after work today and just finished eating a late dinner.  I am going to try and read a little school work now and crash for the night.  Tomorrow is DEFINITELY a Starbucks morning!  I love you all!

Have you ever played hillbilly golf?  I discovered this at the Farmer’s Market yesterday.  This guy was so creative!  He made this thing out of PVC piping.  It looks sorta like a standing towel rack.  It comes with 2 golf balls with a rope fed thru them.  They look like like the ""old fashioned"" klackers from back in the day about 30 years ago.  Anyway –  picture a rope with a golf ball attached to each end.  You stand about 15 feet from the rack and hold one of the golf balls in your hand (the other will be dangling from the rope) and toss it towards the rack.  If it lands on the top rack – 3 pts….middle rack – 2pts….bottom rack -1 pt.  First person to get exactly 21 pts wins!  How cool is this?  Gray Tabby and Aunty Em, your grandkids would love this!
Go to Ebay and do a search for Hillbilly golf; I think I might have to pick up one of these things next Saturday for myself and/or a XMAS present for my brother! 
These are the balls…

Have a great week!
I started working part-time today.  I am going to like this.  I was able to buy some squirrel food at Home Depot on my way home from work.  I fixed their squirrel feeder and put up a birdfeeder.  I hung the birdfeeder from my kids’ basketball hoop – –  hoping those squirrels can’t shimmy up there!
Now, I think I can focus more on school and TRY to get the 18 assignments done by 31 July.  However, I am a week behind since my courses were not loaded on-line yet!  Off to the books….I don’t have to be in tomorrow until 1130 – yay!  But I do plan to telecon in to a meeting at 8am…so it will be nice being able to do it in my pjs….LOL.. and my cup of joe…
My latest soldier care package is ""Operation Kosovo"".  I am collecting items at work to send to an orphanage in Kosovo.  They have 50 children – ages infant to 13.  A co-worker is bringing in gently used boys clothes.  I am thinking I will donate Jake’s clothing, too.  Jake would have liked this idea.

I DID go the Colorado Dragon Boat Festival.  It was interesting and relaxing.  I saw alot of interesting things.  I will post pics soon.   Since my Mom is from the Philippines, I felt like I was at a big family reunion!  I saw different types of cultures there:  Filipino, Chinese, Vietnamese, Mong, Mongolian, etc.!  Since I am going to be a teacher, I found the school art and writings  very different and interesting.
Today, I am going to the zoo.  My company is having their picnic there.  So off I go again…have a great rest of the weekend.
By the way, I did work on shool work on Friday and Saturday.  I completed 2 assignments yesterday and plan to knock one off another one today, too.  I must admit, I did nap during the videos Friday, but I woke up and replayed them.  The Jewish guy in them is very handsome; I like his accent.  But watching a Jewish guy discuss teaching strategies is not as exciting as watching a good Richard Gere movie…LOL.  I won’t get my 18 assignments in by 31 Jul but I am steadily working them.  This course, Instructional Planning and Strategies, is the toughest course in the program.  Supposedly, it is all downhill after this course.  Next I will be learning about teaching all the content areas….quite an adventure but I AM enjoying the journey!  Everyone needs to pursue their dream and I am in hot pursuit!  I plan to be substitute teaching soon.  My orientation is 1 Aug with the local school district.

Today a lady at Curves thought I had a sister that worked for Verizon.  She thought I really looked like a person that worked at Verizon.  I told her that I had no family here in town.  She seemed flabbergasted.  This is the second time in my life that someone thinks I look ""just like so and so"".  The other time happened in South GA when I was visiting with my Mom.  Somebody asked me about my fish market in Lakeland, GA.  Now – that is really fishy to say the least.  I politely said they must have mistakened me for someone else and they were absolutely sure that they had not.  So I must have been born in a set up triplets and we got separated at birth…LOL.
Ok – tonite my daughter called me.  She is leaving for Basic Training tomorrow.  I was thrilled to hear from her since she has grown up and filled her life with a ""boyfriend"".  I think I am going to have another new son-in-law before Christmas.  No announcement – I just hear it in her voice.  I will be going down to Texas for my 3rd time to attend another graduation from Basic Training – this time at the end of September.  I sure hope it cools down by then!  I should get a medal for all this!  Anyway, after Basic, she is on her way to 18 months of schooling in Monterey, CA to become a Linguist.  She LOVES languages so I think she will enjoy her new career.

My daughter asked me to come up for Thanksgiving so I may be going back to Idaho for another visit.  Gee – I am going to be quite busy – Basic Training graduation next month for Renee, Thanksgiving with my daughter, Christmas with my Mom and my son’s family ….hmmm…maybe I should plan something for me in October!  My day job officially ends at the end of September (even though they have hinted they would like me to stay til the end of October – ugh!) and then I will be in the classroom subbing…yay!
I am pooped out – ready to hit the sheets.  Did you guys see my giraffe picture I posted a few entries back?  I made that my mypace.com picture!  I am sure my kids are getting a kick out of that picture on myspace…LOL.  
Good nite ODers.  Can u believe is my 763rd entry!? Wow – where does the time go?  I have been writing here 6+ years.  You have become my extended family since Jake left us.  Thanks for being there for me!

Ok – so a co-worker talked me into attending a low impact aerobics class.  It was fun!  But it was definitely a workout.  They want me come back next Thursday for the next free class and sign up as a regular in September.  I told them I would have to see if I could even get up tomorrow morning…LOL!  Gee – Curves 3 times a week and Aerobics 1 night a week, and school, and life, etc.  We will see.  I am too beat to think about it now.
I called Mom today.  She seems ok but she told me she missed Sam and it will be a few days before ‘she gets over him’.  I was quick to correct her and tell her she would always miss him because he was such a big part of her life.  She is such a strong lady.  She lost my Dad almost 20 years ago (he was several years older than her).  Then she lost her grandson (my son) almost 7 years ago and now she has lost her pet.  If I have received anything from my Mom – it is her strength.  She is always so strong.  I think I am going to keep checking in with her every day for awhile.  I might just have to catch a plane home to surprise her and maybe go dog shopping?  I will have to think about it.  She is a wonderful person.  Her heart is bigger than her entire body.  She is maybe 4 ft 8 inches and maybe 80 lbs soaking wet?

So I am now a registered Licensed Substitute Teacher in the largest school district in my area.  I went to my first Back to School Conference yesterday.  I networked and passed out my new business card ""Licensed Sub (PK-12)"".  Today I got a call from an elementary teacher needing a sub for 3 days next week!  However, due to my part-time schedule at work – I could do 2 out of 3 days.  I could sub on Wedensday and Friday but not on Thursday.  So I promptly called her back and she was able to get a person for all 3 days.  I think it is better so the kids have some consistency.  I did let her know I would be available M-F starting October….and she did say she would call me again…so my new career is off to a good start!

So – that was my day yesterday + I did turn in an assignment for school so I wasn’t slacking too much…LOL.
I have to get ready to go into the office today..bummer..but I am one day closer to starting my dream job….Happy Thursday!

So..recently I was talking to a 1st grade teacher at Curves.  She was telling me her school expected 1st graders to write paragraphs before 2nd grade.  So we talked about that and she shared with me a funny story.  She is teaching her students (6 year olds!) how to write ""How To"" paragraphs and this is what one student wrote:  Title:  How To Be a Couch Potato.  First, you get a bag of chips.  Then you find a soft couch to sit on.  Next you eat the chips.  Finally you are fat.  
This was such a funny story!  I think I burned more calories laughing than working out that day at Curves!

Well, I was tired of doing schoolwork yesterday so I took off to the movies.  I saw ""The Nannie Dairies"".  I think it is an okay movie.  Some funny lines and kids will like it.  I enjoyed it.  It was kind of sad/emotional at the end.  I am a sap for emotional endings.
I also have been reading a new book by Debbie Macomber.  She is really easy to read.  I picked it up at the library last week.  The title is ""Christmas Letters"".  It is a romance but it has a lot of things going one.  K.O. wrote a Christmas letter for her sister, Zelda, and it was so good she now has a business writing Christmas letters.  Zelda is married to Zach and they have twin daughters (5 year olds) and their names are Zoe and Zara.  Each daughter has pet dog – Zero and Zorro.  Is that enough Zs for ya!?  Anyway, Zelda is reading a book, Free Will, about letting kids have control of their lives.  K.O. despises this book because the twins are out of control.  K.O. meets the author and now they are dating!  K.O. has a friend that claims to be psychic and has seen signs in the kitty litter and her raisin bran (2 raisins floating side by side in her milk) that K.O. and this author were meant to be.  Some book so far, huh?!  It sure is a nice break from school work!  I actually was at Walgreens tonite and saw that Debbie Macomber has a new paperback out.  I almost bought it but first I must finish this library book!
Have you ever seen ""testicles"" hanging off the axles of a big truck?  I saw this in the Walmart parking lot.  I was getting out of my Mom mobile and I was walking thru the parking lot when I saw those things hanging off the axle of a ""manly"" truck.  Wow!  I kept studying them because they looked so real – course I have not seen real ones since – long ago! – but I don’t suppose they change much.  Then a strange thought came into my head.  I thought someone might be filming some reality tv show in the Walmart parking lot so I quickly looked around and scurried off.  I did take one last look over my shoulder to make sure I was not imagining this scene.  Wow.  Walmart has some interesting things in their parking lot!  If I had my camera, I would have snapped a pic and posted it for you – but then maybe it was too obscene for OD.  I had to write about it because it was sure an interesting day in the Walmart parking lot….

I went to the State Fair and saw some beautiful Bengal Tigers from India.  They were an assortment of colors!  Of course I had my caramel apple, too!  I go to the fair just to get one of those apples and enjoy the ""scene"".  This was my excitement on Saturday.  
On Labor Day, I went to Manitou Springs to an arts festival.  You will not believe what I saw there!  A woman was walking around the festival with a ""hairless"" cat hanging off her shoulder – a REAL cat.  It was really ugly, too!  I think it looked like that cat on the Austin Powers movies!  She said it was different than the Austin Powers’ cat but similar.  It was definitely a sight!  I wished I had my digital camera!
Have you heard of detoxifying your body using a foot soak?  I saw this at the Fair, too!  People were paying $30 to detoxify their bodies.  They started out with clear water in the foot soaking tub.  They added salt and then put in the ionizer machine – some machine thing that created negative ions to draw out the toxin in your body – into the water.  By the end of the 30 minutes, the water was nasty brownish and black looking with parasite in it!  It kinda looked like your feet were soaking in a nasty toilet with you know what in it!  I asked a friend about this yesterday.  She is an RN.  She said this is all crap.  Parasites cannot come out of your feet.  The guy at the fair said they come out of the sweat pores in your feet.  My friend said this was all crap.  What do you think?  Her husband’s advice was ""Don’t go to the fair for medical treatments""…lol.  Anyway – google it!  Look for ""ionic detoxification"" and tell me what you think!  Avon sells detoxification patches to put on your feet at night.  I think I am going to call my Avon rep and ask what these patches do for you.  In the meantime, I will continue to detoxify my body by drinking lots of water!

P.S.  Subbing is more work that what I used to do!  I think I am going to like this once I get the routine down.  School districts start calling as early as 4:30am!  Gee – it is like being at summer cadet camp and hearing the bugle to get us up and starting our day!

Last week a student pushed a student (1st grade) and I calmly explained to him he needs to keep his hands to himself and NOT push anyone.  Then a student came up to me and said, ""He doesn’t understand you.  He speaks Spanish!"".  I am like ""No habla espanol – come on somebody help me out with this student!""  3 students came forward, spoke something in Spanish to the young student, then walked away.  I am like thinking – did they say, ""The teacher says not to push and to keep his hands to himself"" or did they say, ""The teacher doesn’t care – push everyone!""  Hmmmm…I definitely will have my work cut out for me each day and it will never be boring!
On another note, I got a call yesterday to sub at Jake’s school.  Yep, I had forgotten that this was a strong possibility in this new career.  So…I accepted the job.  I wonder if any of the teachers that knew my son are still there?  I guess I will take a deep breath and find out on Tuesday.
If anyone has any EMERGENCY CLASSROOM MANAGEMENT TIPS – let me know!

So today I subbed at Jake’s school.  I worked with Special Needs students and it was GREAT!  These kids are more on-task than regular-ed students.  
It was an interesting day.  A child in the classroom, not a SPED student, lost his Step-Dad so the rest of the class was sad.  I took some time to talk to the SPED students who were impacted by this loss.  I could tell they had a lot on their mind – much more deeper than math word problems.  So we talked a little about feelings and what to do when their friend returns to school.  After they worked a while on math, I let them make paper airplanes to give to their bereaved friend.  They decorated them with some of the teacher’s stickers…oops…well, sometimes you need to be flexible, right?  Then we took the airplanes on a test flight in the classroom and both were aerodynamic enough to maintain altitude.  These kids were 9 years old.  I shared with them about Jake and how sad it was for me.  One of my students’ names today was ""Jake""…can you believe this!?  Here I was talking to ""Jake"" about the sadness of someone losing a parent yet I experienced the total opposite loss!  I believe ""my Jake"" was  present with me today.  
Anyway, my plan to ""keep the kids"" under control today worked!  I used poker chips as ""tokens for being good"".  I added smiley stickers to the fronts and the backs of them.  If the students were good, they could exchange their token for a ""reward"" at the end of the class.  The reward was their choice of a new pencil with any of several wild, cool designs.  It worked well!  I had 2 students who ""boo-ed"" the pencil reward and opted to keep their tokens.  I sure hope their parents don’t think the kids learn to gamble in school…lol.  I don’t even know how to play poker!
Anyway, another day in the classroom….tomorrow is another day.  Tomorrow is my dentist 6 month check-up; it should be a pleasant morning.

I was at a distric school orientation on Thursday fand I was sitting by a guy who relocated to CO from WA.  So I ask him, ""What brought you to Colorado – our awesome baseball team?"" and the rest of the people in the meeting started laughing.  This was the goal since I wanted to see if anyone was watching the World Series.  So this other lady in front of me started bashing the Rockies and the lady to my right leaned over and told me she was big Rockies fan and if the other lady did not shut up she might choke her….LOL.  Gee, all I was trying to do was ""break the ice"" in the conference room…lol.  Then I tried to get the attention off of baseball and said, ""You know why Colorado Springs does not have a professional football team?"" and they asked why and I said, ""Because if we had one then Denver would want one""….so you can imagine what the atmosphere was like then!  So – then I apologized and said, ""Hey, I was just kidding…just trying to make conversation""…LOL

Recently, in the Special Ed classroom, a young child was working on the alphabet.  He was supposed to identify the letter and the picture on the flash card…like ""a"" for ""apple"".  He got to the ""i"" and said ""i for that thing!"".  It was a picture of an iguana and he didn’t know what it was or how to say it.  I thought it was the cutest incident!  
I have been busy subbing and I must say that I truly am having a wonderful time.  One day in Special Ed I let my students draw pics.  I asked one student, ""Is that a picture of your house and your family""?  She replied, ""No, this is a Church.  This is Jesus, this is my brother, this is me, and this is God"".  I leaned over to study her picture and said, ""Let me see God.  I have never seen him and I don’t know what he looks like"".  She showed me her picture as the other students were climbing over me to see ""God"", too.  One student said, ""You don’t know what God looks like.  You have never seen him""!  She said, ""yes I have""!.  He said, ""where""? and she said, ""in Church"". They continued to argue and I had to redirect back to our lesson.  It was a fun and interesting day.
The moral to this story is:  Let kids draw pics and don’t comment on them other than to say, ""What a nice picture!"".

So…my washer broke.  The repairman said I needed to get another one.  He recommended his friend at a used appliance store – so off I went to go shopping.  It was on Platte Avenue.  Platte is kinda scary at night but this afternoon it was kinda scary, too.  There was a hooker in broad daylight!  It was a beautiful day for hookin’; the temps were nice and she was dressed for the weather.  Anyway, I saw this drunk guy staggering along the sidewalk.  He stopped, he staggered, and then he fell down – it all looked like it was in slow motion!  Then a couple people came over, checked him out, laughed and walked away.  Then a man came an picked up and got him standing again and they walked away.  
When I left the appliance store, the drunken man was passed out at the store next door – right on the steps.  I looked at him, approached him, and said, ""Sir, are you ok""?  No response.  So I went to my truck and called the police.  I was worried something may/might happen to this man.  The police asked me all these questions that I could not answer (i.e. was he conscious? was he breathing? etc.)  All I could say was, ""I saw him fall.  I saw someone help him up. I see him laying on the steps of a business.""  I said, ""He looks crashed out.""  Well, the medics arrived and they were able to awaken him and ask him questions.  I wonder what goes thru a drunk’s mind when he wakes up at 3pm on the steps of a business with flashing lights around him and medics asking so many questions?
I hope he is ok.  Platte is such a busy street; he could easily have been hit by a car if he staggered into the street and fell.
Anyway, I was able to get a good used Whirlpool washer for $205 – includes delivery and hauling away the old one.  Yay!  I have bought from this store before and my last used washer lasted almost 10 years!

This movie is hysterical!  I saw it downtown at the Kimball Theatre.  Usually, the Kimball is known for showing Independent movies – not big screen regulars.  I read the review about this movie and laughed outloud so I had to go see it.  It is about a 27 year old guy that is very shy.  He doesn’t date or do anything but keep to himself.  He lives in the garage apt behind his brother. 
Well, one day he orders this life-size doll, ""Bianca"".  He says she is Brazilian and very religious so she has to sleep in Lars’ brother’s guest room!  Anyway, he treats her like she is his real girl friend.  You must go see this to believe it.  I don’t think I have ever been treated as good as this doll!  She dies in the end and it is sad.  You ask me, ""how can a doll die?""  Well – I can’t give away the movie – so go see it!  When Lars could not wake her up one morning they called 911 and she was taken by ambulance to the hospital!
Anyway…back to school work.  By the way, subbing and school are going wonderfully well.  Hmmm…is ""wonderfully"" a word?  I think it is; it means full of wonder, right?

I am currently visiting my daughter in Idaho at Mountain Home AFB.  I am using the computer at the library.  It is chilly up here but we are having a great time!  Tommorrow we feast in the chow hall.  No dishes, no clean-up, no headaches!  Yesterday, I went to her squadron potluck and we had a nice time, great food, and wonderful conversation with her co-workers.

Thanks for playing!  Do you want to play again?  No choice – u r playing!  I loved all your answers – especially the one about the ""car"" roadrunner – which is true, too!  People have to be careful with our vast vocabulary.  If you are asked to select a picture of a ""sub"" on a standardized test – there better be an option for a ""sandwich""!  Sub means Subway to most kids today – not submarines!
I took my big exam today and PASSED (does the happy dance)!  No more school work til next year!  Yay!

I miss you, Jake!  It will be XMAS #8 without Jake.  I did decorate the outside of the house again this year and put up my small fiber-optic tree.  I will try to post a picture for you all.  I plan to play some XMAS music later this morning, cook up a cream cheese butter braid in the oven, and perk a pot of coffee.  I am having company later this morning – around 11ish.  I also plan to slow cook some country pork ribs in the crock, too!  I think this is the most ambitious I have been in awhile.  It is very chilly outside (21 degrees) and I am headed out to Curves for early morning workout, too!  It must be a full moon?!

I took an elementary subbing job today for the ESL (English as a Second Language) teacher.  Well, the 5th graders were great!  They read and spoke English very well.  Now the Kindergarten kids ….. that was another story.  I had 5 of them and one of the first questions they asked me was ""Do you speak English?""  I said, ""Yes"".  When I tried to work with them and read a story, they were in their own world.  I am sure what I was hearing from them was as foreign as what they were hearing when I was reading to them…LOL.  Eventually, they were into their own world – all communicating in Spanish.  At one point they brought me books that THEY wanted me to read to them.  Unfortunately, the books were in Spanish.  It was fun to watch them interact with each other and their book.  As for me?  I felt like I was a visitor in another country!  So…I don’t think I will do ESL again.  I don’t think any of us benefit.  Do you?  I guess it doesn’t help to have an accent like mine, either!
Good Night OD Land.  Tomorrow is another day.  Wednesday is my all day subbing for a Kindergarten class!  This should be quite an adventure!

Christmas, 2007
Greetings from Michigan!
Here is the latest from the corn patch. Dale and Tara are growing like weeds – thank goodness they are not in my garden! Dale is now 14 and Tara is 10. I had to get a new job to afford their Christmas Wish Lists! (I will write more on my new job later.) The kids want a Nintendo and WII for Christmas – so if you have an urge to donate money to charity – send it this way! Long gone are the days of GI Joe soldiers and Barbie and Ken dolls. When I sat on Santa’s lap, I asked for a Christmas loan to buy gifts for the kids!
John is still recovering from his accident this summer. After his accident, I wondered how Evil Knieval lasted all these years! On a brighter note, after his time in the hospital, I acquired new skills through observation. Now I work in the hospital. How about that? I learned a new job through osmosis! I took care of John and learned a new career interest!
My new job is “Pharmacy Tech”. I dance through the days with pills and bottles.  I like it, too! I know more about drugs than the drug lords themselves AND I don’t need them!  
John always wanted to be a pilot and realized that dream through his love of flying remote controlled helicopters. It is safer, too! The worst case scenario is a bad landing in the middle of our corn patch! 
We may live in the middle of a corn patch but it has its advantages. I love to play the trumpet and the piano and nobody complains whenever I get the notion to play my instruments. However, it probably scares the crows out of the corn patch but we get a bigger crop! Anyway, I play whether I have an audience or not! Sometimes, the crows think I am playing “Taps” at the end of the day and they stand at attention as I play my trumpet as the corn pickers “pass in review” through the rows.
I hope you are all well and in good health and spirits. If you want a change of scenery, come to Michigan and see us! We would love to have you. If you live in the big city and want to leave the smog behind – try our small town and the aroma of the local paper mills. Leave the big metropolis and enjoy the quiet life.  No loud airplanes fly overhead – just John’s remote-controlled helicopters. No busy traffic sounds – wake to the serenading music of my trumpet or piano. But remember “the corn have ears” and news travels right out of our patch – so the locals will know you are visiting!
 We would love to hear from you!
All our love,

It has been very, very cold here!.  I keep my thermostat at 65 degrees and it is still chilly inside!  My favorite part of the day is hunkering down under the electric blanket at night.  It will be nice to be in FL and GA with temps in the 70s – which they think is COLD!  Try 14 degrees and icy roads in Colorado and you will think the 70s is tropical and swimsuit weather…lol.

So – it was Sunday afternoon and the siren was blaring in my hometown.  I step outside and look at my watch and it is after 4pm in Georgia.  I ask my brother, ""What is that?""  He says, ""That’s a siren.""  (sometimes my brother is so shallow…lol).  I reply, ""I know that.  What’s up?  It is not the noon siren.  Is it a tornado alert?""  He goes inside to turn on the weather channel and yep – we have one headed our way in 6 minutes.  We are all standing outside looking at the dark clouds.  Brilliant aren’t we?  Anyway, nothing happened.  So that is the excitement for South Georgia during my holiday visit.  
Otherwise, I am enjoying the holidays with my family in Nashville, Georgia.  Oh – speaking of Nashville, GA – we were on the front page of the Valdosta paper recently.  It seems the new sheriff in town was going to ""clean up"" the drug infested community and arrested 4 young African American men in ERROR!  Trust me – they don’t use the politically correct term ""African-American"" in the South either!  He apologized and brought one of the families’ a ham!  Does this sound like the script of a movie ""that went bad"" or what!  I wanted to comment on the article but my family did not want me to sign my name – so I let it slide by.  Small towns and the law enforcement here is something to be ""reckoned"" with.
A nice tidbit about small towns – the hairdressers are much cheaper than in a big city!  I got a color retint for $45.  I could not touch that price in Colorado Springs!  I also got a cool spiky haircut for $10!  I know I will be saving my hair appointments for my next visit – no  more doing it b4 I leave!

Anyway, I had a great Teacher Assistant and the day was fun.  One young man had new glasses and was so excited about them.  I sat down next to him to chat with him.  He noted that I had glasses, too.  OK – at least we know he can ""see"" with his new glasses.  The next thing out of his mouth was hysterical.  He said, ""Do you have all your teeth?""  Then he quickly showed me he lost one of his.  I told him I did have all my teeth, but I wanted to say ""Did I 4get to get them off the nightstand and put them in this morning""?….lol
It was a fun day.  One of the kids said he was going to be a principal in 4 years!  I am thinking – wow – I have a Masters and am just a substitute.  I must be in the wrong shool!  LOL.  
Kids are so much fun and keep us young.  It reminds me of the saying, ""You don’t stop playing because you are old.  You are old because you stop playing"".  I am old but I can still chase the kids on the playground to play Tag!  So, I guess that makes me Middle Age?

I had a great day yesterday.  I met a friend for coffee at Starbucks then we decided to look for a used filing cabinet and small student desk and chair.  We started out at a pricey furniture store and then we ended up at Goodwill and the ARC.  We did not get the desk or filing cabinet but we found some great bargains!  I spent less than $28 and got some great deals:
1 OLD NAVY Gray and Black Pullover-for my son-in-law when he comes next month.  He lives in TX and he gets cold in CO – I wonder why…lol.
1 GAP Long sleeved two tone (Dark and light blue) pullover shirt – another something for the TX son-in-law
2 pair of DANSKIN workout pants (very comfy!) – 1 black and 1 navy – each $1.50!  I usually pay about $15 each for my DANSKIN stuff from WALMART – woo hoo!
1 Cherokee Fleece zip up night shirt (I think it is a Target brand)- it covers my whole body (of course I am only about 5 ft 1 inch anyway)!  Nice for the subzero temps we are having in CO!
1 pr NEWPORT NEWS gray leggings to wear with my fleece night shirt
1 pr WILLIWEAR silver leggings – very sporty!  They have cute zippers at the bottoms so I can be quite fashionable at CURVES!
1 VICTORIA SECRET striped teal 2-tone long-sleeved night shirt – another warm thing to wear to bed!
The best deal of the day —> 1 Bright red and teal fleece COLUMBIA jacket – on SALE for $2.50!
I might have to go back today and pick up a couple nice workout pants for my daughter in Idaho.  I saw them yesterday but was not quite sure she would wear them.  I talked to her later and she was tickled to hear about them!  Both are less than $5/each.  One is Disney sweat pants that say ""Wild One"" on the butt cheeks with Tigger on the front and the other is a melon colored pair of NIKE work out pants.  I also saw a nice Aeropostale hoodie that she might like, too.  This was $4.99.  If she doesn’t like the hoodie, I know I can wear it!  OMG-this type of shopping can get addictive!  I also saw two upright pianos for sale!  I played them both.  They are rough looking, but if you have an aspiring piano player in your midst – $149 is not bad.  It would cost more to move it to your house!  
I am washing my purchases and will be giving them new homes in my closet.
I hope you all had a nice long weekend.  It is very cold here!  I think I am going to wear my new bargain fleece jacket today!

I jumped into a new adventure at the school yesterday.  I accepted a position as a Sub for Elementary PE.  This was the most fun I have had in a long time!  I think I would like to be a PE teacher!  I dressed like I did as if I were going to workout at Curves.  I was comfy all day and I loved every minute of it – even being the recess patrol!  I shot some hoop with the kids and sometimes I ""swished!"" and sometimes I didn’t.  The best part was when the kids said – ""It was a good try though!"".  You can tell they have a very cool regular teacher that encourages them when things don’t go the way they should.  I think I am going to sub some more in the PE area!  It fits well into my love for working out and being physically fit.

This is, as my friend said, a ""very thought provoking"" movie.  It is based on a true story.  It is about the publisher/editor of ELLE magazine in France.  He has a stroke at the young age of 43 and wakes up paralyzed ""trapped in a body"" and can only communicate by blinking his left eye.  His mind is alive and well but he cannot express himself.  This movie is based on the book he authored by the same title.  He wrote this book after his stroke.  Note:  The movie is subtitled in English.  They speak French throughout the movie. 
I went straight to the bookstore after the movie to get the book.  I wanted to make sure I didn’t miss anything while trying to keep up with the subtitles!

5 of us met at the Elephant Bar.  First – one lady ordered her appetizer/meal and did not receive it after 45 minutes.  She reminded the waitress.  Next, two ladies had over salty lettuce wraps.  They complained and one got a free dessert.  I ordered something that I thought was a ""special"" and they told me it wasn’t after I boxed it up to take home.  They decided to give me the ""special"" price with manager approval.  Next, one lady ordered dessert and I ordered a ""spiked"" coffee.  We took bets to see who would get their order next.  My coffee came.  A few minutes later, my friend was told her dessert was freshly made and needed to cool for 15 minutes.  She decided to order a ""spiked"" coffee instead.  15+ minutes LATER her coffee arrived.  She might as well have waited for the dessert, right?!  Wow – what a night.
Tomorrow is another day…I sub for 3rd graders – unfortunately it is not PE.  Thursday is 1/2 day for ESL/ELL.  This should be very interesting since I am not bilingual.  Next week is Kindergarten ALL WEEK!  
On a better note, I am getting some job leads in the teaching arena – woo-hoo!  I need the benefits since I am still waiting on my benefit continuation package from the job I left in September!  My benefits ended on 1 Dec (with my severance period).  I have tried to call the people in charge of sending out my continuation package and as usual – I am on hold 4ever!
On a sad note, a co-worker passed away – long story.   We are having a Wake for him Thursday night.  He was so young – a few years older than me.  He just retired in 2005 so he could enjoy life/family while his health was good – then a freak accident took him away.  Basically, he was hit by a ladder when a gust of wind blew the ladder.  He was NOT on the ladder – just in the path.  It happened on Thanksgiving.  He felt ok.  He actually was at a luncheon with me the following week.  He never mentioned his ladder incident or at least I did not overhear any conversation about it.  Then on Christmas day he started having headaches.  He went to the doctor the following Monday and they discovered he had a hematoma/bruise on his brain.  He had surgery the next day and was in the recovery room and had a stroke.  This put him in a coma and he never woke up.  We lost him in the wee hours of Saturday morning…less than 3 days after they removed him from assisted breathing and transferred him from the ICU to a local hospice.  Life is so difficult.  He was a brilliant engineer and just a ""great all around"" good guy.  He was married with 3 grown children that he adored.
Thursday will be a difficult night for all of us.

I had to kill some time yesterday between subbing and attending my co-worker’s wake – so I went to Starbucks to read my book, The Kite Runner.  My Skinny Cinnamon Dolce Grande coffee was $4.08!  Oh No!  This is too much.  I think I am going to have to think twice about stopping in there other than on Sunday mornings to read the paper!  For that price, I could have had a nice meal off the $1 menu at McDonalds!
Gee – I think I am feeling the recession in my coffee habit.  So, I am off to fix my own pot of coffee this morning.  I have a couple job interviews this mornings so I have to get into gear!
Thursday was a terrible day in the 3rd grade classroom.  It was totally out of control.  I was in melt down mode for the rest of the evening.  Yesterday was a great day!  I subbed for ESL and the kids were all well-behaved and on task.  I think they were talking about me in Spanish…lol.  I am just going to have learn to say ""I understand every word you are saying"" b4 I sub in ESL again…lol.  However, they do speak excellent English for it NOT to be there primary language.  I told them they were all smart!

I heard that this movie was so good.  Apparently, it appeared on an episode of Oprah.  Basically, it is about being happy by thinking positive thoughts – not negative.  I did not think the movie was very exciting so I am sure the book is worse.  I just had to watch it to see what all the  hype was about.  I believe if you want something out of life you will work to get it.  I don’t think it drops into your lap.  
I am currently sick – I think a caught a ""bug"" from Kindergarten last week OR it was the ""mystery meat"" I ate in the lunchroom on Thursday.  Anyway, I am quite under the weather.  It was nice yesterday – weatherwise – yet I was very cold so I know my immune system is under attack.  My eyes hurt, too!  I think today will be a better day.  I just had some Ramen noodle soup for breakfast.  I am not crazy about the number of carbs (50+) in that soup but I was hungry!  I even worked out yesterday at Curves since I am in their challenge this month – Basic Training.  It was not a good idea, but it was nice to get out of the house.
Today I think I will try to do some school work and rest up for the week.
I had to write a little bit about The Secret in the beginning of this entry since some people had never heard about it.
P.S.  After doing Kindergarten last week, I have been wondering if I really want to teach!  Send me notes of encouragement!  Tell me it will be easier when I have my OWN class!

I went to Orientation for another school district on Tuesday and Low and Behold – I subbed for them today.  Now that is QUICK!  I subbed Middle School and survived!  I have decided I like Middle School  and may try subbing more there.  6th graders were much easier than Kindergarten and 3rd grade!  My day flew by and I liked it.   Walking Hormones (my pet name for Middle Schoolers who are discovering who they are..lol) are OK.  My sarcastic humor fits in well with Middle Schoolers and their sarcastic outlook on life! 
Hope you all had a nice long weekend.  
OD was something this week!  I was wondering if they were going to renew their domain since it expired last week.  Low and Behold – they did!  I finally was able to get on here!

828,https://www.opendiary.com/m/j8xmom/yuck-379-5368741/,2008-02-22,Yuck!,"
So I went out shopping with a friend today and scored on a pair of Merrills’ shoes – ON SALE – at Dillards.  My friend scored, too!  She picked up some good bargains at a cool consignment store – Between Friends.  Afterwards, we decided to grab dinner at Village Inn.
OMG!  The waiter had his hair hanging in his face and his fingernails looked like he just did an oil change at Jiffy Lube!  My coffee glass had some ""unknown leftovers"" on it….etc.  So I asked for a new coffee.  He obliged.  I just could not get over his dirty appearance so I watched him throughout my visit.  Then he did the ultimate yuck!  He handled his hair like he was smoothing it over b4 the cameras started rolling for a Pantene commercial.  Ugh!  His hair was so dirty, too!  He almost looked like a Troll with his hair hanging in his face past his eyes!  Isn’t there a creature on the Munsters called ""Cousin It""?  I think my waiter was his brother!  I finally had to say something to another worker.  She came over to our table to clear our dishes and I said, ""Hey.  Can I tell you a secret?""  She looked at me and my friend and smiled and said ""I think so.""  I think in her mind she was thinking I was about to ""come out of the closet"" and tell her I was having dinner with my girlfriend.  Wrong!  Anyway, I told her all about our ""dirty"" waiter.  She cracked up as I told her about his hair commercial for Pantene.  I told her she had to promise NOT to say anything.  We even did the Pinky Swear.  She promised she would not say anything until WE left the restaurant.
Anyway, I asked her to cut our dessert – NOT HIM!  She showed me her clean hands and obliged.  Now here is the kicker – she brought our pies and when I took the first forkful from my pie I noticed BEFORE it entered my mouth that the fork had someone else’s leftovers on it!  So my friend and I called her to our table and it was definitely a Kodak moment. She hurried across the restaurant towards the kitchen with the evidence still in her hand – a fork with a bit of coconut creme pie AND the dried on ""mystery substance"" with it.  She returned with another fork and we finished our dinner.  
Wow – what an experience.  Bummer that our receipt DID NOT have the usual ""share your Village Inn experience with us at our website and win a chance at blah, blah, blah…""  Wow – Murphy’s Law, right?  When you have something TO report on a survey you NEVER get asked to complete the survey.  Anyway – I could not come up with a creative title for this entry so I titled it ""Yuck"".
However, dinner was good – just a bit distracting tonite.
Hope you have nice rest of the weekend.

I have been busy subbing and working on school assignments.  I became a sub for a local daycare center recently.  I hoped to worked with school-agers but the first day I was changing a very dirty diaper – yep – I was not prepared for that.  I promptly asked to work with older kids after that day!  On a better note, I discovered this place needs volunteer reading tutors to work with K-5 students – so you know what is on my ""things to do list"" – meet with the volunteer coordinator!  Yep – I would rather listen to kids read than do daycare.  Daycare is not in any of my school taskings…lol…so I am not helping myself out at all.  My hat is off to all the daycare providers because you are all VERY SPECIAL PEOPLE and very UNDERPAID and UNDER APPRECIATED!
Since I last wrote – I moved up a couple notches in the school system.  I decided to do Middle School and High School.  I really like Middle Schoolers.  High schoolers are too stuck on themselves these days.  They were ok – considering it as an ALTERNATIVE HIGH SCHOOL – yikes!
Next month – I get to leave this chilly climate and visit my son in sunny, humid FL.  Yea!  I am tired of the funky weather here.
Back to the grind – Lesson Plan on teaching handwriting.  I have named my lesson Building Letters since it is all about strokes: Vertical lines as in the letter ""I"", Horizontal lines as in the letter ""T"", Circles as in the letter ""O"", and Slanted lines as in the letter ""A"".  Of course – it is manuscript – NOT cursive.  Gee – it is so hard to explain how to teach someone to write when you are too tired….anyway..that is all folks…back to the strokes and I am so under par….lol.

I went to the library today and bought a Chai tea.  I took it into the library.  I set it on a table and it spilled over!  What a mess.  I took off my sweat shirt hoodie and cleaned up.  Then I went and got wet paper towels to clean it up better.  What a waste of a perfectly tasty chai tea.  
Anyway, while I was at the library, the security guard asked a teenager to sit right in her chair.  She was lounging like she was watching tv at home.  Her legs were draped over the arms of the arm chair.  After the guard corrected her and left – she went right back to her position.  I just shook my head and went back to reading.  
P.S.  The library is not as quiet as I remember it as a kid!
Today was in the 60s!  It was like summer here today, but I hear snow is coming tomorrow or Friday.  Man!  I wish this weather would straighten up!
I am busting my butt trying to get 14 assignments done by next Wednesday.  I have 4 left.  Math is not my favorite subject but I have done well in these assignments so far.  I have one more math assignment and 3 science ones.  Wish me luck.  I want to get these all done so I can enjoy being a Gramma for 2 weeks starting next Thursday.  I will be in warm FL!  With my luck, I will return to a Colorado April Blizzard!

I actually decided to NOT sub b4 I leave.  I need time to relax after all this paper writing for Math and Science!  When I return, I will be jumping into Social Studies, Visual Performing Arts (whatever the heck that is!), PE, and Health; 7 homework assignments total for this content area.  
My plane leaves at 6:30am out of Denver – so I am going up the day b4 to spend the night and indulge myself a bit.  
Good Night.
P.S. I decided to get married.
Did I tell you I stimulated the economy a little early – b4 I got my Stimulus check?  Yep – I splurged on a Toshiba laptop and it is nice.  I wanted to take it on my trip, but the security at the airport makes it a hassle.  So I will travel with a purse and book to read.

I felt like a Starbucks yesterday so I went thru the drive thru.  I ordered my favorite drink:  Grande Skinny Vanilla Latte with 1 shot of expresso.  Then I pulled out a $5 bill and some old giftcards.  I asked the cashier to see if any of the cards were any good and BINGO!  I scored with a card with money still on it!  So I got my $5 back and the card with some $ still left on it and most of all – I got my delicious coffee which I savored while doing some homework.  Yum!  Starbucks makes a science lesson so much more enjoyable!
P.S.  The marriage thing was an April Fools joke.  Gray Tabby figured it out.  I guess you guys know me too well in OD Land despite never having met me in person…lol.  Yea, I was married once and it was a life lesson indeed.  It is hard to believe it has been so long ago that I was divorced.  Was I really ever married?  It seems so unreal…but I have evidence —- kids!

Now, as soon as I recover from this jet lag (functioning on GA time in CO!), I will be ok.  Then it is back to subbing and school work and THEN back to GA and FL in June.  I plan to fly there and drive my daughter’s car back to CO – road trip!  She didn’t want the Camry anymore so I am bringing it home to use to battle the gas prices…LOL.  Kids are so ungrateful at times – I bought the car for her to use for college and work and asked for small payments of $50/month.  It has been over 2.5 years and I got two payments in 2005.  LOL.  I just wanted to teach some responsibility.  They don’t get this kinda deal with a bank!  I learned another valuable lesson.

I have a funny story to share with you.  I have been battling a cold since Sunday.  I didn’t really feel up to subbing on Wednesday but took on a half day with 4th graders.  When I arrived at the school, they asked if I could stay for the whole day so I agreed.  Then ….SURPRISE!  They changed my agenda!  They gave me all day with Kindergarten kids!  So – it was a busy, hectic day.  But the cool thing is I learned about Seahorses!  I read ""Mr. Seahorse"" to the class and it was awesome!  I had no idea that the male seahorse keeps the eggs in his pouch until they hatch!  How cool is that?!  I wish I was married to a Seahorse when the twins were in the greenhouse!  Remember that book, ""Everything I Know I Learned in Kindergarten""?  I guess I can somewhat relate to it now!
I am feeling much better now.  I have taken off all week from my enjoyable workouts at Curves due to feeling under the weather.  I am so looking forward to getting back there on Monday!  I really believe eating alot increases metabolism.  I went to the Dr. last week and had lost 6-7 lbs since my last visit in November!  Remember, I was on vacation in April for 2 weeks – eating like most people do on vacation – lots!
It is 51 degrees in Colorado.  I think Spring is peeking out FINALLY!

Did I ever tell you about the nice musical globe I bought at Things Remembered last XMAS?  It is beautiful.  It plays ""Evergreen"".  It has a silver tree that spins while the music plays.  The tree holds a gold heart with these words inscribed:  We never lose the ones we love they live in our hearts. 
As I write…the globe is playing, the tree is spinning, and my heart bleeds to see him again…7+ years and the pain is so acute..I miss you, Jake – always and 4ever.  You are 4ever loved, 4ever missed, and 4ever 9 years old in my memories.  Mom

I’ve come to the frightening conclusion that I am the decisive element in the classroom.
 My personal approach creates the climate.  My daily mood makes the weather.
 As a teacher I possess a tremendous power to make a child’s life miserable or joyous.  I can be a tool of torture or an instrument of inspiration.  I can humiliate or humor, hurt or heal.
  In all situations it is my response that decides whether a crisis will be escalated or de-escalated and a child humanized or dehumanized.
(Hiam Ginott, author of Between Teacher and Child)
 
 P.S. This quote was so powerful I purchased his book from amazon.com (Of course it was used due to my job transition budget ($2.30 + tax + shipping = <$7.00).  I felt I had to read the book of someone who spoke so honestly.)  The red text above indicates my goal as a teacher.

845,https://www.opendiary.com/m/j8xmom/dear-jake-9-5368758/,2008-05-14,"Dear Jake,","
It is late, Jake, but I had to tell you about my grief meeting tonite.  I brought some great pics of you and some clay things you made in art.  I also kept a tiny piece of paper that you wrote your name on long ago.  It means so much to me to see your name ""Jake"" written in your best handwriting.  I baked a marble cake with milk chocolate frosting.  I didn’t let the pan cool enough so when I took it out, it was not a beautiful cake – so I put it back in the pan and frosted it.  It  looked great!  Everyone loved it!  I brought ""real"" milk, too, so we could enjoy the cake.  Sophie brought your favorite snack – homemade flour tortillas.  I lit a candle for you, too.  It was a small group tonite – about 7 of us total.  I shared how I use Random Act of Kindness cards in your memory and passed several cards out.  I challenged everyone to do a Random Act of Kindness in memory of their loved ones.  Happy Birthday to a very special boy who will never be forgotten.  
Some people told me of a psychic tonite.  I am thinking about calling her to ""connect"" with you, Jake.  I think it would be so neat to ""hear"" you come through for even a brief period of time.  I was thinking of maybe doing it at Christmas when your brother and sisters are home.  I have to think about it a little more, because maybe the others would not deal too well with it.  I will see and keep you posted or maybe I will surprise you when we ""connect"".  
Anyway, I sometimes wonder what you would look like today.  I think you would be about 6′, broad-shouldered, with beautiful thick red hair.  I miss you…..we all do…always…and 4ever.  It is so hard to believe you are gone and never coming home.  Sometimes, I think it is still a dream and think I will wake up and you will come upstairs and eat breakfast with me…like we used to.  Sometimes, I close my eyes and and ask ""why?""..and sometimes…..I look at your picture and cry.  When I hear Josh Groban sing ‘Just a Breath Away’ I think of you and know that it is so true – we are all ""…just a breath away from where you are….""  I wish you would visit me in my dreams.  Please?

I took my last exam on Wednesday, May 14th, Jake’s Bday.  It was 171 questions, multiple choice and covered all the content areas:  Handwriting, Reading, Spelling, Language Arts, Science, Math, Social Studies, Art, Health, and PE.  Wow!  It was alot of info!  My brain was on overload. I was stressed afterwards.  My results were posted on Thursday morning and I PASSED!  I do believe in Angels because I think Jake gave me the strength and stamina to stick it out almost 3 hours of testing!  Woo-hoo!  Now, I am free to relax until student teaching in the Fall!  Thanks for all of your support!  
I am so looking forward to a relaxing summer without writing papers!  If all goes well, I will have my teaching certificate in PK-8 by Christmas or shortly thereafter.  Whew!  I am so tired of reading about all the elementary/middle school content areas!  Maybe now I can read a good book for fun.

….something funny to share about hospital stays.  I was in the hospital several years ago for surgery.  You know you NEVER get to sleep …. at ALL!  Anyway, this CNA comes in bright and early one morning to take my blood pressure.  Then she gets this startled look on her face as she is pumping her blood pressure thingy.  She says, ""OMG! You don’t have a blood pressure!""  I say, ""Well, I think you forgot to put all the parts together.  You forgot to put the cuff on my upper arm.""  She says, ""Oh!  I guess it IS early!""  So she puts the cuff on my arm and is pumping me up like a huge balloon!  My arm is killing me and is about to break in two – then all of a sudden – the blood pressure cuff flies off my arm and lands across the room after bouncing off the wall.  We both look at each other and I say, ""Hey.  Let’s just say my blood pressure was fine and you can go check someone else now.""  She agreed,  She left and I tried to go back to sleep…LOL.

This was quite a book!  At first I didn’t think I was going to be able to get into it.  The Chapters are based on different characters speaking.  For instance, Sara is the Mom. Brian is the Dad. Anna is the donor daughter. Kate is the ill child. Jesse is the forgotten son.  Etc.  Anyway, I stuck it out and it was well worth it!  The book is about a family that conceived a daughter whose purpose was to donate vital life sustaining blood, bone marrow, etc. to their ill daughter.  Basically, she was conceived to save the life of the other daughter.  Anyway, the donor daughter, at the age of 13, goes to court to challenge her parents for medical emancipation.  This is all I am going to say.  Go to the library and get it!  A co-worker told me about this book last summer.  Also, another ODer wrote about it so I decided to check it out (literally!  I got it from the library.)  Now that I am not having to read textbooks and take exams in school, I can read for leisure.  Next, I plan to read Little Women.  This is a classic I never read!

…was last week.  It was nice.  We had ‘sub’ sandwiches, punch, and cake. They also gave each of us a cute Sub Survival Kit.  It had 9 items in a small bag:
1.  Rubber Band:  to remind you to be flexible
2.  String – to help you hold it together
3.  Mint candy – because you are worth a mint to our district
4.  Happy face sticker:  to remind you to keep smiling
5.  Starburst candy – to give you that burst of energy to get you thru the day
6.  Pencil Eraser – so every student can start each day with a clean slate
7.  Puzzle piece – to remind you that you are an important piece in the journey of our students
8.   Cottonball – to help soften any rough times
9.  A package of Equal – to remind you to treat each student equally
I sub for 4 school districts and this was the only district that hosted an Appreciation luncheon for the subs.  I am thinking I will make this district my top priority to sub for after I finish my student teaching in the Fall.

855,https://www.opendiary.com/m/j8xmom/new-bike-fever-5368768/,2008-06-01,New Bike Fever,"
So, I have had the fever for a new bike – not that I have an old one (I donated my last bike to Goodwill years ago!).  I looked at bikes at KMART, Walmart, Target, and the Base Exchange at Peterson AFB and the Air Force Academy.  Nothing seemed to jump right at me.  The prices ranged from $49.99 – 169.99.  
Today I went to a bike store – Bicycle Village.  The sales person picked out just the right bike for me.  It is a Trek Navigator.  It is classified as a comfort bike.  I took it for a test ride and LOVED it!  It is just the right fit for me, too – not too small and not too tall.  So – I bought it.  I also bought a cool helmet to match it!  I will bring it home tomorrow.  I didn’t have time to load it into my van this afternoon.  I will take my little truck up there tomorrow morning get the bike.  I am so excited!  Price?  Well – lets say you get what you pay for and I paid for a nice bike!  I will recoup the expense of this bike via the gas savings!  Trust me on this.  When it costs $3.85/gallon to fill an 18 gallon van – versus riding a bike – the difference is PRICELESS!
I hope to ride it to work/student teaching in the Fall.  The two schools that I am looking to possible student teach at are nearby.  One is 2 miles from me and the other is 1 mile from me.  So – I am going to conquer the price of gas and ride my bike to school!  Woo-hoo!  
Hey BOP – I bought my bike BEFORE I read your note – what a coincidence!

These things add up – not to mention the helmet!  But, I am still excited about this new toy.  I joined the Preferred Customer program at http://www.bicyclevillage.com so I should be getting 20% off future accessories.  I wish they had mentioned this to me yesterday when I bought the bike – then I would have bought the helmet and accessories AFTER I joined the program…lol.  It would have saved me about $20!  
It rained today but the sun is now out.  I could probably cruise up to the library to drop off some books!
BOP – did you get a basket for your bike?  I like mine!  It is made of wire and detaches so I can take it into the store/library with me!  My bike is a metallic blue.  What color is yours?  I read that they come in red, too!

So I suggest we ride around the block.  OMG!  This was the longest ride around the block!  Their older sister (age 13) joined us.  We had a blast.  We rode by Jake’s old school (also the school the 2 youngest neighbor kids attend).  We went up and down the hilly neighborhood – typical of Colorado.  I was pooped out by the time our ride ended.  They ate dinner and came to get me and we started our journey to the library at 8pm.  It was quite the uphill climb, too!  At one point the kids and I were walking our bikes up the sidewalk!  We made it to the library and the youngest wanted to check out books about ""eagles"".  He didn’t have a library card so I let  him use mine.  We dropped the books into my basket and were all home before 9pm.  I invited them over for a game of Spinner dominoes and ice-cream.  We sure had fun.  This bike has definitely added to my social life with the neighborhood kids!  And let me tell you this:  Riding this bike is quite the workout!

Since returning from vacation, I have been feeling lazy and dragging all day long.  I think I spoiled myself last week with staying up til almost midnight and sleeping in til almost 8 every morning.  Remember.,,,I am usually in bed by 9pm and up between 5:30 and 6am.  The past 2 days I dozed off – once on the couch and once on the deck.  I guess I should quit feeling guilty about it and enjoy it!  Thank goodness my travels are over for the summer.  I am just waiting to be placed for student teaching.  I better start getting myself into a routine b4 school starts!
I am reading another Debbie Maccomber book, ""Dakota Born"".  It is about a small town in ND that is slowly fading away.  The town needs a new school teacher.  Anyway, 2 young women travel to this town to visit and get away from their routines and one returns to be the teacher.  Now the romance is starting.  A young farmer, in his 30s, is very interested in this young lady.  She is about 30.  Both have never been married.  Anyway, this is the story so far.  I try to read a little bit each day when I can stay awake on the deck…lol.
The last book I read, ""That Summer Place"" was good!  It was about romance in the summer months.  They characters were older – like my age.  It was a fun read – I can’t remember the last time I was in love!  I guess love is like riding a bike – you never 4get…lol.
Anyway, time to grind some beans and perk a pot of coffee.  Can you believe it?!  I am NOT going to Starbucks.  That habit is a bit expensive for an aspiring school teacher.  I am hoping my students will give me $5 Starbucks cards for XMAS…lol.  I am sure I could stretch them out over the year!
Another book that I might read is ""The Last Lecture"".  It is about a computer science professor who gives his ""last lecture"" because he is terminally ill.  It was intended for his 3 young children – a legacy he wanted to leave to them.  This lecture inspired the book.  One of the quotes from his book, ""We cannot change the cards we are dealt, just how we play the hand"".  The author is Randy Pausch.  I hear his lecture was captured and is on youtube.  It might be something to check out.

I am done with week 2.  Yay!  I get to more involved in teaching next week – Daily Language Instruction.  I am so glad!  The days go by quicker when I am actually engaged in teaching.  So I will be doing some math and language arts next week.  I hope to start teaching my required 2 week unit soon.
It was in the low 50s this morning so I took off for a walk this morning at 6:30am.  I was gone for about an hour.  I stopped by a Middle School track and jogged a half mile to supplement my walk.  Then I went home, got some $, and walked up to Starbucks for a coffee and a newspaper.
Now I am off to Curves.
Have a super LONG weekend!

I read a book that received the Newberry Honor Award.  This is an award for great literature for children.  The title is ""Feathers"" by Jacqueline Woodson.  It is about an 11 year old girl and her family and school life.  It teaches an interesting lesson in the end.  It has a surprise ending.  Basically, her classmates cannot figure out why a ""white"" boy they nicknamed ""Jesus Boy"" is attending THEIR school.  They think he should be at the school across the highway.  Great story with a great lesson in the end.  It is only 118 pages.
Why am I reading this book?  I thought as a teacher, I should be familiar with the ""award winning"" books in case the kids ask me.  My next book is ""The Wednesday Wars"" by Gary D. Schmidt.  This is another Newberry Honor book.  This about a boy with issues in Middle School.
Back to cutting the grass…..  I took a breather to get something cool to drink.  Now, I have to cut the front yard.  Then I have to take a shower and get ready to visit my granddaughter.  Yes!  She is in Woodland Park visiting her other grandparents.  Her Grampa on that side is retiring from the AF and there is a retirement picnic in his honor.  So…I have to get a card, a giftcard, and head up to join in the celebration!  I am so excited to see Isabella.  I have not seen her since June.  I hope she remembers me.  She is 9 months old now.  Gotta bring my camera, too!

I saw my granddaughter today and was able to help with her bath and hold her for a bit.  OMG!  She is now sitting by herself, crawling, and pulling herself up in the crib!  She has changed so much since I saw her in June!  She is growing and getting more mobile.  I smell like a fresh bathed baby since I held her so much!  I wish I could see her more often.  She returns to FL on Wednesday.  I am sure her Daddy (my son) misses his girls (wife and baby).
I think I am going to consider going to the State Fair tomorrow.  I love to look around and have a caramel apple!

It was so hot in Pueblo, Colorado.  I cannot even begin to tell you how hot it was walking around the fair for almost 3 hours!  I am thinking it was at least 10 degrees warmer than Colorado Springs!  
I had fun looking at things.  AND….I bought a delicious caramel nutty apple!  It was wonderful eating that apple in the shade and watching people go by with the prizes they won tucked under their arms.  Me?  I didn’t try any fairway games.  One guy told me how easy it was to toss a ball in the vase.  After several balls, he finally got one in.  I just smiled and said it did look to easy for him!  
A good friend went with me.  Afterwards, we returned to the Springs and went out for Indian food.  
Today was a great day!  Overall, it was a great weekend.  I got the grass mowed, held my granddaughter, and went to the fair!  Tomorrow is another day in the classroom.  
Have a great week!  I don’t know if I will have time to write much.

Boy!  Time flies when you are busy!  Next week I get to try to teach a Math lesson on ""Estimation"".  We have a new math program ""Everyday Math"" and the staff is learning it as they teach it.  So, I might as well try it out, too!  The goal is to try and teach the kids how long it will take them to walk from their school to McDonalds for an ice-cream.  (No, we are not actually walking there – I wish we could!)  It is about a mile from our school to McDonalds.  Remember, an estimate is not ""exact"".  So wish me luck.    
I am still pooped out every day after school ends.  I think I am too old for this!  What do you think?
I still manage to hit Curves at least 3 times a week.  This re-energizes me!

885,https://www.opendiary.com/m/j8xmom/i-taught-math-today-5368809/,2008-09-09,I Taught Math Today!,"
Today I taught a lesson on ""Estimation"" to the 5th grade class.  We had a blast!  I was nervous and a bit worried  but it was all for nothing.  It was fun having the kids ""estimate"" values and then seeing how far off their estimate was in the end.  For example, one of my examples was for the kids to estimate the number of listings on 1 page of a phone book.  Their original estimates varied from 500 to 1029.  Then when I showed them how to estimate (there are 4 columns on the page – count the listings in one column and multiply it by 4) the answers were less than 200!  Then I showed them how to estimate the number of words on one page of their library book AFTER they gave me an estimate.  The strategy I taught them was to count the number of words in one line and multiply it by the number of lines on the page.  We had fun.  Then the challenge problem came into play.  This was from their Everyday Mathematics journals.  They had to estimate how many steps and how long it would take them to travel 1 mile.  This was so much fun.  I put them into groups of 5 or 6 people and assigned a Team Captain to each group.  Each group also had a data collector; he/she was responsible for recording info in his/her group.  This involved each group measuring a typical step/stride and then figuring how many steps they would walk in 1 mile.  For example, if the average step was 18 inches, they would have to convert the 5280 feet (distance of one mile) into inches and divide that number by 18 inches OR take the 5280 feet and divide it by 1.5 feet (18 inches).  This would tell them how many steps it would take them to walk a mile.  Then they had to figure how long it would take them to walk the mile based on the number of steps.   I took the groups outside and had them walk for 1 minute and count their steps.  This gave them the number of steps they could walk in a minute.  They used this number and multiplied it by their stride length.  This gave them how much distance (inches) they traveled in one minute.  Then they had to figure out how long it would take them to travel 1 mile based on the amount of distance they covered in one minute.  For example, if you can walk 120 steps in 1 minute and your step length is 18 inches – multiply these numbers and this gives you the distance covered in a minute.  Then take that number (inches/feet) and figure out how many minutes it will take you to walk 1 mile.  It was a long lesson but everyone was busy calculating numbers!

…for thinking of us during that difficult day this week.  I made it through despite having to look at ""September 24, 2008"" written on the board all day.
On a better note, I discovered an attention grabbing chant that works great with 5th graders!  I say ""Hocus Pocus!"" and they chant back ""Everybody Focus!"" as I have all eyes back on me.  Thank goodness for google!  I demonstrated it to them during our science lesson yesterday and they LOVED it!

Your chances of wining the lottery in CO are much better than winning the Powerball.  I was inspired to write this entry after reading an OD about possibly winning the Powerball.  This is what I discovered on the lottery website:
Your chances of winning the Colorado Lottery are 1:5, 245, 786 or 1:5 million
Your chances of winning the Powerball are: 1:146,107,962 or 1:150 milliion
I say increase your chances by buying at least one of each ticket.

I am working on a unit to teach in Social Studies this month.  It is about Native Americans.  I am excited about adding things to it to make it interesting.  I am researching how I can get a local Native American to come to my classroom dressed in his/her native attire.  How cool would that be to have a Native American come teach us a dance!  I have not found one yet, but I keep hoping I will.  I know it will cost me some $, but maybe they will consider it ""education"" and do it for free?  Am I dreaming or what!?

What an awesome experience it was!  I actually did the zipline and mountain boarding.  
Zipline:  I can’t believe I climbed up a tree about 30 to sail off a platform attached to a harness!  It was such a RUSH!  It was so scary climbing up that tree, but the kids were all so encouraging!
Mountainboarding:  This is like skateboarding a a very large skateboard.  I was decked out in all the gear.  I was so nervous getting on the board but the kids were all supportive.  Except one…he pushed me down the hill!  I wiped out but I got up and did it again!  As for the kid, we bonded after that experience.  I think watching me fall scared him!
Google ""Golden Bell Camp"" and check out the zipline and all the other activities!  I would love to go back.  There is no school tomorrow for students, but I have to go in since it is another Teacher Work Day.

When we returned from camping, a student fell and hit her face on the playground equipment.  I rushed up to her and gave her my nice flannel shirt (pink and green colored shirt) to blot up the blood on her face and hands.  Later, I wondered if the blood stains would come out.  My neighbor suggested soaking the shirt in cold water, detergent, and a cup of vinegar.  It was awesome!  Better than Oxydol, in my opinion!  She also said vinegar makes your ""whites"" come out so clean from the washer.  So I cannot wait to wash a load of white laundry.  It takes me about 3 weeks to make it worth a washer load of laundry since I live alone.  
I washed my kitchen floor recently, too.  I used a bucket of warm water and vinegar.  I got down on all 4s and scrubbed the linoleum floor by hand and it was CLEAN when I was done!  Yep, vinegar is definitely a great thing to have in the pantry!
I am done with school this week and it is only 1:15pm.  No school until Monday!  I am so going to enjoy this break and get caught up with my on-line school assignments and housework!

I had a great 50th with my 5th grade class.  I was surprised to find a cake and a gift!  
My last day student teaching was very emotional.  The students surprised me with a basketful of items for my future classroom!  Boy, that really saved me some $.  My favorite gift from them was a beautiful scrapbook.   It consisted of a letter from each student and a their picture – plus some additonal fun class photos and nice quotes.  I really never realized I made an impact.  I will miss them.  Some even put their address and home telephone number in their letters!
Christmas Eve my oldest son called from Woodland Park, CO and invited me up to have Christmas Eve dinner with him and his family and in-laws.  It was wonderful.  My granddaughter is really growing and is very mobile!  She walks holding on to things and can stand up all my herself in the middle of the room, but is too timid to try to walk without something to hold onto.  She can really race across on the room crawling!
My son and his wife surprised me with a gift of recent photos of the baby.  I have all but 1 framed at the moment!  
His in-laws surprised me with a special gift, too – chocolate covered pretzels, XMAS mug, tea, and a cute XMAS bowl that I will put to use this week when all the kids arrive for New Years’ week!
Christmas day, I spent relaxing with some videos – This Christmas and A Raisin in the Sun – both were great!  I would recommend them!  I have not watch my last one yet – Fred Claus.  I will probably do that today since the temps are in the single digits and I can’t play outside…lol.  Oh!  I enjoyed some fine spirts while I watch the videos – Baileys over the rocks and one mixed with Butterscotch Schnapps and Cinnamin!  Yum!  It was a very quiet and relaxing day.  I am so enjoying being done with my on-line teacher certification program and student teaching.  I am going to really enjoy these free days until January 7th!
My son and his wife will arrive to visit me tomorrow and will leave January 1st.  My daughter from TX is on the road to see me as I write this.  She should be here b4 dinner.  My other daughter is flying in on Monday.  And Jake….he is with us all in our hearts today and everyday.  I was preparing his room for guests and it was tough moving his toys around in the closet…(sigh).  I sure miss him…..very much….every day…today…tomorrow….always…

Tomorrow son and his family arrive and I can see my beautiful granddaughter.  
I am so wired tonite and the kids are sleeping soundly.  I think I will pop in Fred Claus and see if it is as funny as people tell me.
5 more days and we start another year!
I fell down my stairs last Wednesday and think I did something to my shoulder.  When I do the pec machine at Curves it is painful.  I guess I am lucky I didn’t break a hip at my age!   I think I also bruised my left hand or sprung my thumb (is that possible).  I think I will take an Aleve and see if that will help my achey body.
Tomorrow, I think I will cook a new recipe – slow cooker pepper steak!  I get ambitious in the kitchen when I have people to feed!  I baked about 4+ dozen chocolate chip cookies today, too!
Well – I am off to the medicine cabinet and ready to go watch Fred Claus (Nick’s brother, I hear).

…I recommend you watch ""Forgetting Sara Marshall"".  This is a funny DVD!  It is about a guy who breaks up with his girlfriend and goes to Hawaii to get over her and guess who is there?  She is there, too!  It is funny what guys do to ""get over"" a girlfriend!  Never in my wildest dreams would I have imagined these things!

So today was my second day as a substitute floater.  I floated through all grade levels.  Kindergarten was interesting.  So, picture this…a student says, ""What is your name?"", I respond, ""My name is Ms. S."", the student says ""You mean Missus S.?"", I respond ""No, Ms. S."", he says ""Why?"", I respond, ""I am not married."", and then a small voice from the back of the room announces in a loud voice, ""Do you want to be my Dad’s girlfriend?!""…the rest is history….I am still laughing about this…remind me to write about my response to this Kindergarten student! 
Have a great 3 day weekend! I plan to rest and relax!
P.S.  Can you imagine me being involved, at MY age, with a man who has a 5 year old!  I cannot even imagine how hectic life would be for me!  This man is probably young enough to be my son!…lol!  
I should write a book about my adventures as a Sub!

I have the opportunity to take a Spanish class in the District at no charge!  I am going to do it!  I have so many Spanish speaking students and I am at a loss for words (literally).  All I can remember from my High School Spanish days is how to say ""Louisa has a cold"" and this is NOT going to help me at all!  I have NOT met a student with the name of Louisa and none have been sick with a cold!  Wish me luck!

It was a lot of fun tonite!  I think I am going to like this class.  We are learning things we can use in the classroom – like ""stand up, class"", ""sit down, class"", ""shout"", etc.  This is more fun than High School Spanish class!
I need a good old-fashioned remedy to get to sleep and ""having sex"" is NOT an option.  Any ideas?  I didn’t sleep much at all last night.  I dozed off during the SuperBowl and couldn’t sleep when I went to bed.  However – the SuperBowl was AWESOME – go Harrison!  What a great 300 yard touchdown run!  The Cardinals had some great players, too – go Fitzgerald!  But most of all – the commercials were great!  The half-time show with Bruce Springsteen was great, too!

917,https://www.opendiary.com/m/j8xmom/the-last-entry-maybe-5368843/,2009-02-21,The Last Entry…maybe,"
I have not really written in here for awhile.  I am wondering if I left would it really matter.  Does anyone really read this or maybe would be unhappy if I left?
I have been so busy subbing that I don’t have time to update.  Are you REALLY interested?  
Anyway, this past week was awesome!  I had a 5th grade sub job for 3 days and one day in 1st grade (the military would pay combat pay for duty in 1st grade…lol).  Anyway the 5th grade teacher has been out for about 3 weeks and the kids have had a handful of different subs.  So I knew I was ""fresh meat"" when I walked into that class on Wednesday.  So – I sympathized with the class for having so many subs.  Then I told them up front who I was and that I was once in the military and DID NOT put up with any crap and warned them NOT to test me!  So – within the first 5 minutes someone challenged me and they had the consequences.  Trust me – kids need to know what is expected of them in the classroom.
Well, I have become attached to this class and volunteered to stay with them for a couple days this week; their regular teacher is due back (hopefully) on Wednesday.  I plan to take my digital camera to school this week, take a class picture, and make a nice card with the kids to welcome their new teacher back.
P.S.  Mind you, I still don’t put up with any crap – so the next 2 days will be like the last 3 days!  
Note:  When I was teaching fractions, some kids were actually taking notes!  So – I think I connected with them as ""learners"", too!
 
***Hmm…I am at 936 entries – should I stick around and try for 1000?!  Also, Bird of Paradise recommended that I journal after I lost my son and I have not regretted it one bit.  So go out there and thank HER if you read MY diary!  I met her and she is a lot of fun.  Ask her about the fox we saw in Colorado when she came out to visit me.

So today I went to Starbucks to read the Sunday paper and have some oatmeal with nuts and brown sugar.  The oatmeal is good at Starbucks by the way….I felt I could splurge since I won some $ playing the PowerBall.  I only got one number but it was the number that matters the most – the POWERBALL number.  Since I bought the PowerBall Power Play – the PowerBall number was worth $15 – this is $13 more than I invested in the ticket – so off I went to my favorite coffee hangout.  
Today, a couple older gentlemen were sitting next to me.  One was so funny!  He kept cracking jokes at his friend and I couldn’t contain my laughter.  I was crying because he was so funny!  Do you know how hard it is to read with blurry eyes?!  Anyway, it was fun drinking coffee out today.
I saw a funny sign on my way home from teaching last week.  Each time I drove past it, I cracked up.   So today I took a picture of it.  I will try to post it later.  
Tomorrow is another day with the 5th graders.  I really enjoy them.  It will be hard to say goodby to them when their teacher returns this week.
I also went grocery shopping today.  Can you believe the price of groceries!?  OMG!  My favorite bread is $4.15!  I remember when bread was less than a $1.  But back in those days we don’t have the healthy selections we have today.
One noter commented that when I started this diary it was for a different reason than what I write about now.  That is so true.  I would like to think that I have moved forward after the tragedy in my life, but also that Jake is in my thoughts and heart everyday.  I always encourage people who have endured loss to write because it is way to vent and grieve.  It is also so simple.  Also, all of you have helped me walk this journey of 8+ years.  Yes, I am still counting…Jake would have been a Junior in High School this year.  I would like to picture him playing soccer and having fun at Heavenly High School.  I sometimes wonder what he would look like, but I see his image in his sister, Becky.  I find myself staring at her longer than normal and have to catch myself because she can see in my eyes that I am remembering a very special boy in our life.
Time to get ready for another exciting week in the classroom.  Good night, my friends.

Today was long and tiring – all day with 5th graders that were unruly followed by a 2 hour Spanish Class for Teachers….Buenos Noches…(Ihope that is the right way to say good night).  I am exhausted.
I have been extended thru Wednesday with this unruly class.  Their teacher is in the hospital.  When she called me today – I was envious because she was resting and I WAS NOT – what’s up with that!?  I will survive…somehow…some way.
Anyway…tomorrow is another new day with a new start.  Wish me luck!

I think I might have blown it today.  I was called and invited in to interview for a Middle School Language Arts position.  The interview was for tomorrow morning.  I had to decline because I already committed to a 5th grade sub job.  (I committed to this last month!  I didn’t think it would be right to let the teacher (my Student Teaching Mentor Teacher) down when she and the kids were counting on me.)  So, the interview scheduler asked me if I had a lunch break tomorrow.  I told  her it was very brief – about  20 minutes.  We both agreed I could not drive to their interview and be back to sub for the rest of the day.  I told them if it was possible, I could interview next week.  She told me they were interviewing for this position tomorrow only.  However, she did say if there was a makeup date she would call me.  Please cross your fingers for me.  In my heart, I think reliability is important, so I think I made the right decision.  Do you agree?

Wow – the teacher job fair was CLOSED to those who did not register on line!  Lucky for me, I registered on-line.  There were 300 registered participants attending this job fair.  I felt like I was in line at WDW (Walt Disney World) waiting to ride the newest attraction!  There were not many districts looking for Elementary Teachers – mostly Middle/High School.  The 2 interviews I did get went well.  I was just one of many trying to land a job.  I am now thinking that I might consider taking another exam to give me dibs on the Middle School jobs.  Otherwise, everything went well and I was able to talk to alot of new prospective teachers.
Today, I cooked meals to keep me nourished for the upcoming week.  I crockpotted a beef stew and also slow cooked some ribs in the oven.  Now I can have real food real quick when I come home from work!
The windy weather caused my fence to need some repair.  I had to have 2 posts put in.  The original posts snapped off at the ground.  The fence guy looked like Adam Sandler and sounded like him, too.  Gee, fence work is NOT cheap!  The posts have been replaced and are ""setting"" and he will be back next week to finalize the job.  At least I got a military discount – saved m $15.  $15 is worth saving in these hard times…
Tomorrow is Sunday; I need to spend alot of time working on my Spanish class.  I have been skating by and now I need to get serious.  I have been able to use what I learned so far in my subbing adventures!
Hasta luego.

Here I am…still subbing…attending job fairs (which I have decided are a royal waste of time) and waiting for the job to appear.  I think my dreams of teaching are becoming a nightmare in this recession.  Please note words of encouragement.  
On the bright side, I bought a book, ""How to Get the Teaching Job You Want"".  It had great reviews on Amazon.com.  I focused on the cover letter section last night and wrote an awesome cover letter!  I think I am going to keep it as my template and edit it to fit the schools, districts, etc.
I have a busy day/week.  I am subbing for Special Ed today – then 2 hours of my Spanish class – then Tues-Thur I am subbing in 2nd grade and I am sure I will be booked for Friday!  On a good note, I recently picked up subbing for a Charter School that pays well!
My plan is to use my latest cover letter to apply for two 3rd grade positions and a 6th grade position.  All are positions at Charter Schools.  I have found charter schools interesting – the curriculum is different than public schools and the approach (Classical education) is different, too!
Anyway, thanks for telling me about the water for the stew, Aunty Em.  
Everyone have a great week!
Soon it will be Jake’s 18th bday in May (May 14th)…sigh.  He will remain 9 in my heart.

I subbed Special Ed on Monday, 2nd grade on Tuesday thru Thurs, and finished the week off with 1st grade.  So here is a joke for you guys and gals:  What do you call a nervous zuchinni?  An edgy veggie!  Yep, I shared this with the class and they liked it except they forgot the answer and said ""an edgy wedgie""…lol.
So…. the 2nd grade science lesson was about the digestive system last week.  They were reading a handout (with some help of course) about the intestines.  OMG.  A student asks me, ""Ms. S. what is a rectum?""  I am like standing there like I am on candid camera or something.  I said, ""That is a good question.""  Then a ""know it all"" in the class raised his hand and said he knew the answer.  So I let him answer it.  He said, ""I think it is something at the top of your botttom.""….lol.  I let it go at that.  Then the kids wanted to know what the ""solid mass"" was that comes out of your rectum.  I just threw in the towel and said ""poop"".  They all chimed ""ewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww!"" I was so glad to finish that story and move on to a read-aloud.
I have heard my student teaching school is getting calls for reference checks on me.  I hope that is good news!  I don’t know if I can handle any more ""crappy"" science lessons as a sub….lol.

We have had quite the snowy weather lately – typical of this time of year.  I live in School District 11 and schools were delayed 2 hours on Thursday.  Unfortunately for me, I was subbing in School District 2 and there was NOT delay!  Oh well, by the time school ended, it was beautiful outside..go figure.  Another cold front moved in over the weekend.  We had lots of wind yesterday and a dusting of snow this morning.
So here was my schedule last week subbing:
Monday – Middle School Science
Tuesday – High School Chemistry (Note:  A student referred to me as the ""B"" word and all I did was give them their assignment.  Of course, I called her on it so her self-amusement turned into embarassment rather quickly.  Man!  You have to have a tough skin to sub in high school.  I just chuckled to myself – remembering how we had to memorize the all the chemical symbols in the Periodic Table of Elements.)
Wednesday – Kindergarten – oh what an adventure that day!
Thursday – 5th grade – had to send three comedians out of class so we could do our Math lesson.
Friday – floating sub at my student teaching school.  Awesome day!  I was able to spend half an hour with the 5th graders that I worked with in Student Teaching August – December last year!
Next week – I will be back at my Student Teaching school on Tuesday for Art (this sounds like fun!) and Thursday to float all day again.  
***On Monday, I am going to Jake’s school; he attended grades K-3 there.  It will be a FIRST for me to sub there.  It has been 8+ years; do you think they will remember me or associate my name with the the school garden dedicated to Jake or the preschool playground ""The Jake Smathers’ Community Playground""?  I better quit thinking about this too much or I might back out and sub somewhere else…lol.
The word for today is ""moue"" (pronounced ""moo"" -like the sound cows make).  Hint:  This is what Kindergartners do when they don’t get their way!

Subbing at Jake’s school went well!  They had some training going on and there were 8 subs!  I met some awesome people.  One of the girls’ 4th grade teachers is still there!  I think she retires next year.  She asked about the girls.  She is still as wonderful now as when she was back then.  The kids were all so well-behaved; it is a model school!
This has been a busy week.  On Tuesday, I picked up another sub job for today!  Yesterday, I picked up a sub job for next Tuesday.  Today I picked up a sub job for May!  The best part is that this school is less than a 5 minute drive from my house!
Today was fun; I subbed for 5th graders.  I think since I did student teaching in 5th grade that this is a favorite grade for me.  Also, my student teaching class was across the hall so I had lots of hugs and ""hello Ms. S"" all day!  I brought an Easter basket in filled with plastic eggs, candy, and mechanical pencils; this was my ""treasure box"".  I had a 5th grade class that was known for being ""unruly"" but we had a great day!  I was told I would probably not get through the math lesson, but we did!  The class actually received a compliment when another staff member walked in to drop something off!  The class was quiet and on-task!
…and tomorrow is another day.
Oh!  Did I tell you I have job interview on Friday?  It is for Middle School English!  I am excited, but I won’t get my hopes up too high since there are so many teachers pouncing on these job interviews.  I will do my best.  If you have any tips – note em’!
Oh!  I don’t know if I ever told you the grief I get from kids when I mispronounce my their names, have I?  For example, I thought ""Antione"" was pronounced ""An-tee-on"", but I was wrong.  It is pronounced ""An-twan"".  What’s up with the ""i"" in there; is it silent?  
Now, I am going to choose a different last name for myself each day.  Now, I use ""Ms. S"" since my last name starts with ""S"".  Next time I sub in a different school, I am going to use ""Ms. O"" and tell the kids my last name is ""octopus"", or ""Ms. P"" for Ms. Platypus, or ""Ms. O"" for ""Ms. Opposum"" (and see if they figure out the ""o"" is silent in ""opossum"").  Or maybe ""Ms. B"" for Ms. Bitche (pronounced ""Bee-shay""…to see if they modify my name by the end of the day…lol).  What do you think?  I will take any other suggestions for names, too!

In Spanish the day comes first then the month – Es doce (12) de abril (April).  You can tell what I have been doing today!  LOL.  Sunday is ""domingo"".  I love learning this new language.  It gives me a new appreciation for how difficult it is for English Language Learners (ELLs) to learn our language.  I think ALL teachers should learn Spanish just to realize this!
Anyway, I bought a new scratch ticket for $2 – Matchplay.  It was a bit confusing to read if I won anything.  I thought I won $15 but when they scanned I was wrong.  I won $30!  I told the lady that I was not sure that it was right, but she said the machine is never wrong.  I asked her how I could figure it out the next time and she read the instructions and was confused, too!  So, instead of buying more tickets, I kept my $30 to use visit Starbucks this month.  
It snowed all day today and it is wet and mushy!  Our lawns needed this spit from the clouds!

"
932,https://www.opendiary.com/m/j8xmom/hannah-montana-3-5368858/,2009-04-18,Hannah Montana,"
I subbed for English Language Learners on Friday.  I had a blast.  Most of the kids were of Hispanic decent and a couple were from Africa.  
There was a book fair going on in the library and one of the kids really loved Hannah Montana.  She did not have any money.
Because she was such a well-behaved child and did her work, I decided to go check out the book fair and see what I could find for her.  I bought a Hannah Montana activity book for her.  The sales’ volunteers told me ""it is buy one and get one free"".  What a deal!  So I chose a nice Hannah Montana poster for her, too.  I did this after the kids were dismissed from school.  After shopping, I found another staff member and asked her to give it to this student on Monday and let me remain a ""mystery"".  
One thing I noticed about these children is that they got along very well together.  I was able to use some of my Spanish, too – so we ""connected"" immediately.  They also taught me some new words – I asked them how I could say ""hush"" in the classroom.  They were telling me how to say ""shut up""; I told them I could never say that to a student.  So they taught me ""silencio"".  I was happy to have learned something new!
Also, one of the students tossed a small 3-ring notebook in the trash.  Another quickly retrieved it and was thrilled to have a notebook!  He tried so hard to erase the name on it, but it was in permanent marker – so he taped a piece of paper over it and asked me to print his name.  I was happy to help him out.  I would like to get all these kids (about 15 of them) small 1/2 inch or 3/4 inch 3-ring notebooks for use in school.  So, I contacted my previous employer and let them know that I would recyle any small 3-ring notebooks that they planned to toss out.  When I was laid off from this employer in September 2007 they were tossing lots of these notebooks in the trash can!  I wish so much that I had some foresight then and grabbed them!  If I get any, I plan to decorate them with Hannah Montana stickers for the girls and some ""masculine"" stickers for the boys – like cool cars and trucks.  

So far – no job offers, but I am enjoying subbing!  Next week, I decided to venture into high school subbing.  I did it once in March and a student called me the ""B"" word so I guess I better be prepared for those delightful comments once again.  Any ideas?
I am planning to take a graduate course in reading this summer.  It will teach me how to diagnose students with reading problems and instructional strategies on how to work with them.  The University also assigns a student to me to work with!  This remedial reading program is designed to increase a student’s reading by 6 months in 22 hours of 1 on 1 contact.  I am excited!  I can use this skill to be a private reading tutor!  Just another skill to put in my back pocket….

Not much to report on this end.  The job search has been fruitless, but the sub jobs are plentiful.  My high school experience last week was interesting.  I have decided it is not worth it to babysit young adults so I don’t plan to sub at the HS level anymore.  Why are kids allowed to come to high school to ""socialize"" and not do any work?  They are such a distraction to those that want to do their work.  I requested Security remove a student who was disruptive to the class and also continuously left the classroom.  Since I was responsible for him, I really couldn’t leave the class to look for him when he disappeared at his own whim.  He was a Jr. in a Freshman English class!  The rest of the classes where noisey and not very productive EXCEPT the English Honors class – they actually did some work.  Also, high school teachers leave subs with ""busy work"" for the students so it is really not ""teaching"" but babysitting.  
On a better note – I had a great 5th grade class on Friday to end the week on a high note!
I took the Middle School English Language Arts exam on Saturday.  The bummer is that I interviewed at a Middle School recently and was told this test was not required.  I had already paid $140 for this test so I took it.  It was not much fun!  There were alot of questions on works and authors.  I am clueless on book titles and authors.  I had to do some major guessing.  Now it is over and I can destress about it until the results come in next month…ugh!
Who knows what this week has in store for me at the moment.  I am not subbing today because I have other things to do – like complete a job application and mail it in to the charter school.  I think I would be better off relocating to another state that NEEDS teachers!  I sure wish I was not anchored to CO because of the house.  If I was in an apartment or renting a house, I would split!
Tonite is Spanish class.  1 more class after tonite.  We are going out to dinner on our last class night!  Woo-hoo!  We have to order our dinner in ""Spanish"".  I hope they have combo dinners so I can say ""Yo quiero y combinacion uno"".  (I want a Combination 1 (or whatever other combo looks good!)
Have a great week.  It snowed in Colorado AGAIN today!

So this week was great!  Tuesday I was the Interventionist and the kids were awesome!  One of the 2nd graders looked at me and said, ""How old are you? 44?""  I said ""Close! – go higher!""  He replied, ""50!""….I said ""Yep!""….  Inteventionists have great jobs; they work with small groups of children that need extra help.  I actually applied for an ""interventionist"" position this week!
Wednesday, I had a Middle School Science class – 7th graders.  It was ok but boring.  They watched a video on ""gravity"" and completed a worksheet.  Heck!  When I was in Middle School, we didn’t have cool movies like ""Bill Nye the Science Guy""!  I could tell you all the answers to the worksheet by heart by the end of the day; I had to endure that movie 4 times!
Today was an awesome 5th grade class in an International Baccalaureate (IB) elementary school.  I didn’t get to teach much because they already KNEW how to multiply fractions!  
Tomorrow I am subbing at a Middle School as a Language Arts/English teacher.  There is actually going to be a Student Teacher in the classroom; I will be there to assist her, as needed.
Then – it is the weekend again – woo-hoo!  It is supposed to be cold and yucky though.  I am hoping to go to the Riverwalk in Pueblo the next sunny weekend we have in Colorado Springs!
Have a great weekend!
P.S.  My daughter and I were recently discussing some of Jake’s friends and wondering what they were up to these days.  She found one on myspace.com.  We have been emailing him.  He is graduating the 27th of May and plans to go to a local community college.  Wow – time flies.  Jake would have been graduating next May; I held him back in 3rd grade.  This time next year I will be wondering what direction he would have taken after high school.  Maybe he would have went into the Air Force like his siblings.  Maybe not.  We will never know will we?…sigh

..is a great movie!  I just finished watching it!  Now I am off to bed.  Have a great weekend everyone!
By the way, today was an awesome sub day with 6th graders!  I learned a new improvisation game, too!  It is called ""Taxi"".  Ask me to write about it later.  The class had a Student Teacher so she ran the show today.  She is lucky, too.  She already has a job lined up to teach 8th grade in Chicago!  Maybe looking out of state and moving is the best for me, too.
I also went out to dinner tonight; I didn’t feel like cooking.  So I had yummy BBQ at Red, Hot, and Blue.  Nice and satisfying.

…as I was leaving the Walmart parking lot there was a man with a sign; it read: Broken down: Need food, fluid, and funds.  As I left the parking lot I thought about his situation.  I went home unpacked my groceries and packed a bag of groceries for him (granola bars, chips, fruit, and bottles of water).  I headed back to Walmart and found he had crossed over to a new location.  I decided to get him dinner at Sonic.  While I was in the drive-thru, I saw he had walked over to Sonic!  I thought to myself ""Self, what am going to do with a Combo 4 (Grilled chicken sandwich, tator tots, and drink) if HE is ordering his own dinner!  Yikes!"" So, I decided I would not worry about it.  After I was done at the drive-thru, he had walked back across the main intersection and was in the Walmart parking lot again.  I am thinking ""Wow, this guy is very energetic; I wish he would stay put!""…So I drive back to the Walmart parking lot, park, get his meal and his bag of groceries and proceed to walk over to this total stranger.  He looked my way and I said, ""Hey, I brought you some dinner"".  He smiled a very grateful smile.  I think he was hungry.  I also told him I brought him some food.  He was very happy from his reaction.  I asked him where he was from and he said, ""Arkansas"".  I asked was he traveling alone and he said he had two other people with him.  So, I reached into my pocket and gave him some cash, too.  I told him ""You never know when you will be in this situtation; it could be me.""  He smiled and said he would definitely stop for me if I was stranded.  So, I went back to my car and drove home.  I thought with me between jobs, I should not be giving cash away, but then again, who knows when I will be standing in the rain with a sign, right?  Between you and me…in the bag of groceries is a Random Act of Kindness card with Jake’s name on it.  On the back I wrote my email address and ""Life is too short to NOT do kind deeds for others"".  
Maybe he will email me when they arrive safely back in Arkansas. It sure feels good to help people out.  Jake’s bday is this month – 11 days away (May 14).  Maybe the timing was just right to do this Random Act of Kindness a little earlier than usual, huh.  
Have a great week and remember ""be kind to others and help them out if you can"".  Life is too short to turn your back on someone else’s misfortune.  I hope when my time is up in this world that Jake and I can talk about all the kind deeds I did in his memory.  Actually, I guess I will be too busy hugging him and telling him how much I have missed him.  I will be too busy crying and probably won’t do much talking with him the first few days.  We will be planning what to do in our new life!

I was asked to sub until the end of the school year for a 3rd grade class!  Yay!  I will have the same faces for awhile!
Last night I went to the Pikes Peak Center to see ""Rain"".  This a group that pays tribute to the ""Beatles"".  It was a great show!  They sounded great, too!  
Tonite I am going out with the girls to see a new chick flick ""Ghost of Girlfriends Past"".  There are about a dozen of us going to the movies.
I am so ready to sleep in on Saturday and NOT have an commitments!
Sunday I am going out to dinner with a friend.  She brought me back a ""gift"" from her Caribbean cruise.  I am excited to see what it is!
Then next week – I will have a routine – going to the same school, same 3rd grade class – for the next 2 weeks until school is completed this year.  Yay!
I hope everyone has a nice Mother’s Day weekend!
P.S.  It was in the 80s on Wednesday and I got burnt while subbing for track day at an elementary school.  So, I have proof that Colorado had some very warm weather this week.  This weekend it is going to get cold again…sigh!

I fractured my end bottom molar on the left side of my mouth.  My options are:  Pull the tooth or get a dental implant.  Any advice?  Note:  The tooth is NOT between any teeth.  My dentist says pulling the tooth is okay, but I might loose the top tooth because it won’t have anything to bite down on.  The specialist is pushing for an ""implant"".  
Cost:  Extracting the tooth is about $350 and my insurance will pay half ($175 out of pocket expense).  The implant is about $2500.  Keep in mind that I am a big wus when it comes to dental work – extraction OR implant – I will be stressed with either!

I finished my first week with the 3rd grade class.  (I was asked to sub for the last 2 weeks of school for this class.)  It went well.  They kind of grow on ya after awhile…lol.  Thursday we went to the Zoo and on Friday we had Field Day.  I have had so much sun that you would think there was a beach in Colorado and I was hanging out there!  Today I cut the grass and got more sun.  I think we are so close to the sun that Coloradoans don’t realize how hot it really is out there!
Tomorrow I am finishing up with the 3rd graders.  My last day should be Wednesday.   I have an appointment on Thursday – so either I will have a Sub for me for the morning or maybe the whole day.  I hope I can come back to see the kids in the afternoon and wish them a fun summer.
Today I worked on a surprise for the teacher of this 3rd grade class.  I bought a tri-fold (like you use for Science Fair projects) and created a large card for her.  I attached several pics that I had taken in the classroom, at the zoo, and during field day.  Tomorrow I plan to have the kids sign it and write notes to her.  I will give it to her son (who is also a 3rd grader at the same school) or her husband to take home on Monday afternoon.  I think it will bring her some cheer!
Also, I received my official Colorado Teacher’s License in the mail on Friday; I am now ""officially official""!  
Thanks to those that remembered Jake’s bday on Thursday.  He would have been 18!  He was in my thoughts that day.  He is in my thoughts everyday, but his birthday accentuates the point that he is not here to celebrate with us and his friends.  I sure miss that guy…(sigh).  Alot of his friends will be graduating next week.  Since I held Jake back in 3rd grade, his class will be officially graduating next May…sigh…where does the time go?….
Have a great week!

It is very cool in Colorado today.  We have had damp weather since Thursday.  We actually had pellet-sized hail yesterday afternoon!
I have been tired since Friday.  I wonder if that is a symptom of Swine Flu.  When I am busy teaching, I don’t get tired.  When I have a day without obligations I seem to nap.  Oh well, it is nice to crash for a 4 hour afternoon nap these days.  I napped for almost 4 hours yesterday!  I felt like a slug.  So this morning I was up b4 6 and took a morning walk around the neighborhood.  Then I grabbed my paper off the driveway and drove up to *Bucks for my favorite coffee.  It was very relaxing to sit at a sunny table inside, read the paper, sip on my favorite cup of Joe, and munch on an apple bran muffin.
I would really like to drive down to Pueblo, CO and walk on the River Walk.  I have never been there.  Maybe if tomorrow is drier and warmer, I will venture down there.
I finished up my 3rd grade long term sub job and it was sad to tell the kiddos goodbye.  One student said, ""Ms. S., I wish you could come back to our school and be a 4th grade teacher"".  I wish I could, too!  
I attended the 5th grade promotion of my student teaching class on Thursday morning.  It was wonderful to see those kids again.  They have really grown a few inches in height!  I had to dart out and rush back down South to finish a half day with the 3rd graders.  Their regular teacher owed them a party, so I planned it for her.  The office ordered pizza for us and I brought in drinks, cookies, and chocolate.  Another Mom showed up with cupcakes!  We ate and watched ""A Bug’s Life"".  It was a very relaxing afternoon.  By the way, I bought the Planet Earth boxed DVD set ""used"" on Amazon.com.  I showed the episode on ""Jungles"" to the 3rd graders this past week and they LOVED it!  It is a great item to stuff in my ""Sub 2 Go"" bag…lol.  
Yesterday, I brought cupcakes to the 5th graders that graduated on Thursday.  It was odd seeing them graduate b4 the last day of school.  Anyway, b4 I made it to their classroom, they spotted me in the hall and asked me to sign their yearbooks, hats, and tees!  I felt like an ""American Idol""…lol.  I sure hope I sub at their Middle School next year to see how they are doing.
The agenda for next week is:  I have a job interview on Tuesday at a Charter school and I sub at a Middle School on Wednesday.  This Middle School is in a district that is still in session until 1 June.
I also plan to sub for summer school this summer AND I plan to keep looking for a full-time teaching job.  Subbing is great, but my health and dental insurance cost me about a week’s pay!
One district is hiring full-time subs next year and I hope I land one of those opportunities.  It is a contracted job for the school year with a salary and benefits!

Well, I subbed for the ""last day of school"" at a Middle School yesterday.  It was ok; the kids were sure excited for school to finally end!
The interview went well.  The Principal was laid back and easy going.  Her questions were not the typical interview questions.  She told me this ahead of time.  The first question:  Are you a risk taker?  Answer:  Yes! 
She had about 10 questions and I was able to answer them.  Oh!  Here is an interesting question:  Do you feel respect should be demanded?  Answer:   No, I feel respect should be earned.  
So, now I am on a brief hiatus from subbing until Monday.  Summer school starts on Monday.  I doubt I will be called at all for summer school, but I signed up to be a sub for them.  Then, I am still planning to sign up for a summer graduate course to learn about diagnosing and working with remedial readers.  This should entertain me for a month; we are also assigned a young student to work with during this time.  Then year round school starts on July 20 and I signed up to sub for it, too.  Then regular  school resumes in mid August.
Have a great week!

I decided to take a summer graduate course at the local university.  It  deals with diagnosing and instructing remedial readers.  I have decided it will be an interesting class and I can volunteer to tutor in the community.  I have decided to stop looking for a teaching job and see what happens besides taking the stress off of me!  I really had to think about whether to invest more money in schooling, but I realized in this recession that people lose homes, cars, etc., but not their education!  Tomorrow should be a great week with this new project underway.  Wish me luck.  Plus, I won’t be around for the spontaneous phone interviews that are a waste of time anyway.  I will be meeting new people and this is a great distraction!

I went out East to Ramah, CO today with a friend.  She purchased a chiauhauhau (che-wa-wa).  She is taking him to Aruba on Saturday for her Uncle.  Anyway, I noted the small rural towns along the way.  I thought…hmmm….teaching out here would be like being on ""Little House on the Prairie"".  So the light bulb came on and now I am going to pursue some teaching opportunities out there.  I am hoping I can work out a deal with housing included so I don’t have to move out of my house.  School is 4 days a week out there.  I think this sounds like a doable adventure.  What do you think?
Also, thanks for all the positive notes!
Oh – BOP – you need to watch Planet Earth, the section on the jungles.  There is a great scene about Birds of Paradise!  The extra ""diary notes"" when they made this documentary are funny, too!  (I never knew there was a song ""Bird of Paradise"", did you?!)I thought of you when they were filming these exotic birds and their beautiful displays of feathers!

So I started my new class this week.  I am being taught by the greatest reading Guru in our area…lol.  I am learning 17 weeks of material in 4 days this week.  I had no clue I was going to become such an expert on phonograms, dipthongs, digraphs, silent ""e"", blends, double vowels, etc.!  I will definitely be an expert on helping kids read better!  It has been an intense, information processing 3 days so far.  Tomorrow our class meets at a local elementary school.  We will be shown our classroom and assigned a ""student"".  We meet the students on Monday and begin our testing.  You will never guess which school we are using — Jake’s school!  Jake attended this school from K-3 grades!  I will be passing his ""garden"" and ""playground (The Jake S. Community Playground)"", located on the premises, each day (Monday – Thursday) starting tomorrow.  It is kinda coincidental that this class has taken this added ""twist"".   It is kinda like Jake will be with me each day and I walk to school to tutor my student for the next 3 weeks!  I tutored Jake for 6 months, leaving a full-time job to work part-time, and he progressed so well during that time.  I think Jake is ""with me"" during this class to give me his moral support.  What do you think?

So..the other day, Wednesday, I was in my graduate reading class working with a 10 year old student.  I chose the book ""Black Whitness:  Admiral Byrd Alone in the Arctic"".  I was reviewing the word ""Admiral"" with my student.  I explained to her that ‘Admiral’ was a ""rank"" used in the Navy.  Since she was not exposed to a ""military"" environment, I explained that ""Admiral"" was like a ""title"" instead of Mr. or Mrs.  For example, I explained that if her Dad was in the Navy and was an Admiral, that I would call him Admiral Brown and NOT Mr. Brown.  She smiled and said, ""I would call him Daddy"".  I LOVE teaching!  I will probably NEVER get a job, but these volunteer experiences ""priceless"".  I recommend to all my readers to volunteer and teach children (i.e. reading tutors, homework helpers, etc.) and add some adventure and chuckles to your life.  I would not trade these experiences for ANYTHING!
P.S.  If you run across a teaching job, let me know!  I think after this summer class I am leaving CO for some rest and relaxation.  Maybe I will find a job in GA or FL while I visit family.  I heard a quote today:  If a door shuts always look for a window as you walk away from the door.  I have had a lot of doors slam in the past 3 weeks and I have just decided to look out my OWN window and enjoy the smaller things in life (i.e. rain drenching my parched grass, the neighbor walking with her granddaughter, etc.)  I think the next school that calls me and gives me this line ""Hi.  This so and so from so and so Elementary.  We have had so many applicants for this 5th grade position that we have decided to do phone interviews.  We have 3 quick questions to ask you and if we call you back, it means you have made it to Round 2 of the interview process.  If you don’t hear back from us, you can assume that you did not make it to Round 2.  OK?  So, is this a good time for you to answer a few quick questions""?  My reply will be ""I am sorry, but I am on the ‘Don’t Call’ list"" and I will quickly hang up.  At least then I would feel in control.  What do you think?
P.S.  I am just venting so don’t get worried about me actually doing this.  I am just expressing my innermost thoughts.

No, I did NOT get a job.  I tested my elementary student today for my summer reading clinic.  She improved so much!  I feel we both succeeded in this 3 week summer reading clinic.  She also brought me a gift.  I was so surprised to receive a gift.  It was a very nice gift, too.  It was a talking picture frame.  I think I will put my granddaughter’s picture in it and record her voice the next time I see her.  
After testing, we walked around the school to relax and we played on Jake’s Playground.  After our walk, I let my student read silently; she chose to read a book about bats.  Instead of quizzing her on her comprehension during this last session, I asked her to share things as she read each page.  I learned bats are gentle once you get to know them.  Also, there are almost 1000 types of bats.  I can’t tell you the pride I felt in watching my student read and share bat facts with me.  Life is good even when you are unemployed.  
My teacher gave me great feedback on the class, too.  I may not have a teaching job, but I know I changed a life in the reading abilities of my student and that is all that matters.  It is the simple things in life that really matter.  
Today has been great so far.

a.  The states of matter or the laws of motion.
b.  Using context clues to find meaning
c.  Finding the area and perimeter of triangles and rectangles
I  think all of them would be fun to teach for 10 minutes.  I think ""c"" would be boring.  I think b is in ""high demand"" since it is a reading lesson.  I think ""a""would be fun.  Which one would you choose?  Should I prepare for all 3 and let them choose?

Yep – the interview was today and I chose to teach the math lesson:  finding the perimeter and area of a rectangle and triangle.  I thought it went well.  The lady b4 said hers did not go well.  She said she did not bring all her notes.  She was teaching the 3 laws of motion.  So, I think she was not prepared. 
I built a powerpoint presentation for my lesson and taught using the computer and an overhead projector.  I was worried that my software would not be compatible with the school software and my worries came true!  I planned ahead and brought a hardcopy of my slides to teach from but the committee let me continue with my presentation.  I guess they were curious about my presentation.  They said they liked my lesson even though my 10 minutes ran out b4 I finished.  I was able to complete the section on finding the perimeter of a rectangle and triangle.  I was just about to explain how to find the area of a triangle when my time ended.  I was able to get 75% of my lesson completed and I had fun so that is all that matters, right?  They admitted it was difficult to do a lesson in such a short time.  I interacted with them as if they were 4th graders and it was kinda funny to hear their answers.  They tried to stump me with a question, but it was easy to explain.  
So, now I am waiting..for the thumbs up or thumbs down.  I should hear something by the end of the week.  
Later today, I went to the library to tutor my reading student and it was a great experience.  He is 10.  We read a story about basketball.  He plays basketball and shared his knowledge with me.  I am so clueless about basketball.  It was such a refreshing end to my day.  Oh!  I also met a tutor who taught school for 8 years.  She quit and now CAN’T find a job!  So, after tutoring, we commiserated together…
And..tomorrow is another day…good night my dear OD friends.

You have all been so supportive.  This is considered a ""temporary"" job for one year, but it will work!  In this economy, beggars certainly cannot afford to be choosy.  I think this is a test program for this district, too. They are hiring full-time subs to place in their schools; they have 25 schools!  I would prefer my own classroom but this may be a small stepping stone to that goal.  I let the interview committee know that I would like to tutor in reading also and they seemed to like that so maybe I can create a small afterschool program OR maybe I can do it on the days they do not need a sub.  Maybe I can create a niche for myself!  
So THANKS for all your SUPPORT!

So – picture this…lady (that’s me) walks into the post office today to mail a carefully packed box to her daughter in TX.  As I sat the box on the counter, patiently awaiting my turn in line, the lady in front of me and I start a conversation.  I noticed she is reading the writing on the box.  The box I used to for this package was an empty Ronrico White Rum box.  I felt the need to let the lady know that I got this box from the liquor store to mail things in and it was leftover from Christmas (basically, I don’t drink – at least not by the boxes…lol); I never used it to mail anything in.  Then the postal lady behind the counter informed me that I cannot mail my box unless all the letters referring to rum or alcohol (i.e. 80 proof, etc.) were covered up completely.  OMG!  The look on my face was a Kodak moment!  I felt like I was on Candid Camera!  Can you believe this?  After all my careful packaging NOW the box is not mailable?  My choices are:
– go home and find another box (non-alcholic)
– wrap the entire rum box in brown paper
– buy the very transparent brown packing tape and hope that I can cover all this writing (not to mention the barcodes on this box, too!) with a $4 roll of packaging tape that I did not plan to purchase
– call my daughter and tell her the package is ready for pick up on her next visit or 
– become irate and entertain the rest of the postal customers with my unhappiness.  
Well, I started to leave the post office and return home and choose one of the first 4 options above BUT I decided to buy the brown packing tape at the post office since I was already there AND there was no waiting in line at the moment.  Time is $, right? So, I patiently covered each alcoholic reference once then twice (since this brown tape is so transparent) and conversed with the postal employees.  As they conversed, they pointed out the barcodes, the terms, (i.e. rum, 80 proof, 750 ml, etc.) that I needed to cover with tape.   Man!  I learned so much about alcohol in just this one trip to the post office and none of us were even drinking!  I think afterwards, I could have used a drink…lol.  As I taped over these alcoholic reference words, I thought how God has blessed me with lots of patience (I guess this is why I became a teacher, too).  I cannot even imagine someone mailing several XMAS packages in empty liquor store boxes during the holidays and having to do what I had to do with just one box!  All I can say is I hope I am around if that ever happens because I am the ""expert"" on taping up alcholic terms on boxes and I can help them!  Random Act of Kindness, right?!  Why did I not get upset during this ordeal?  Because life is too short to get upset over simple things.  There are worse things in life that can happen to you and I know from personal experience.  Right?

August 11th, 2009…today the kids return to school.  I am excited to see how much excitement fills our building today. 
Yesterday was the last day of New Hire Orientation…AMEN!  It was a long day yesterday.  I have to list my courses for my teaching certificate because I learned I am entitled to more $ for any courses completed after my Masters – woo–hoo!  The district gives step credit for up to 60 hours of graduate work beyond a Masters.  I think I have about 56 hours!
A week from today, Jake would have started his Senior year.  I like to think he is starting his Senior Year at HHS – Heavenly High School…sigh.
Have a great week, Friends.
P.S. Our principal says there is  money available if any staff members would like to teach a before or an afterschool enrichment class.  I am thinking about teaching/hosting a reading class!  It will either be something like ""Using Context Clues to Find Word Meaning"" or ""Reading Assistance (Reading with Ms. S.)"".

I was assigned parking lot patrol this morning.  My job was to tell the parents to drop off kids only – NO PARKING unless in designated areas.  This poor guy told me he was separated from his wife and he wanted to wish his son well on his first day; I had to tell him to park somewhere else and he could still walk over and see his son.  I was really taking some heat from some parents for the insufficient parking spaces.  At one point, I said, ""I am sorry for the parking situation.  I am a new employee this year so go ahead and yell at me and get some venting done; I can handle it.""  The lady smiled as she drove off and said she didn’t want to take it out on me….lol.
I had to relieve a Kindergarten teacher for 20 minutes so she could have her full lunch time.  I read a story that I don’t think rocked the Kinders world at all.  Then I walked them to recess and hung out there for a few minutes – then to the cafeteria for lunch duty.  Let me tell you how much fun that was…NOT.  Wiping tables in nice clothes is not my idea of fun.  I survived.  I spent a lot of time in the Art room helping the Art teacher get his things ready.  Then – parking patrol in the afternoon.  I have this same schedule for the rest of the week.
I left school and went to a hair appointment.  My hairdresser was so happy to hear about my new job that she took me out to dinner afterwards!  We ate Korean food; she is Korean.  I was so stuffed that I took an evening walk (about a mile or so) still dressed in my work clothes…lol.  It was quite warm tonite.
I get to Sub in 3rd grade on Thursday afternoon – woo-hoo!  
I guess I better get out of my duds and slip into a my night shirt.  
***Why is it that  your hair NEVER looks as great the next morning after your appointment?!  Maybe I can sleep standing up?
OK – good night ODers.  Jake’s Mom is signing off….

Starting week 3 in my new job.  This week I will be a rotating sub between 1st and 4th grades.  Tuesday is 1st, Wednesday is 4th, etc. – that’s my schedule for the next 2 weeks (Tues – Fri).
The janitors/custodians have been so wonderful to the new employees.  I am bringing them some home-made southern apple-pecan pound cake today!  It is an easy recipe that my Mom sent me from GA last week.  It is tasty, too!
Gotta run now.  I haven’t gotten this a.m. routine fine-tuned yet.  So I have to eat my breakfast, fix my lunch, and pack up the van. 
Have a great week ODers.  
By the way, this is entry 979 in 8.5+ years.  I must say I am so glad I started doing this.  I was able to share my loss with you and you all listened.  Now I am sharing my new job with you.  You all were great cheerleaders as I made my career transition and I have successfully completed my goal!  Thanks!
Someone asked me to post a pic, but I don’t have any recent pics.  The most recent is from May.  I will see what I can do about that.

I just got an email from another school district that needs a 5th grade teacher ASAP…(shakes head)….oh well…they are almost a month late getting back to me.  I like my school and feel it is a ""good fit"".  Therefore, I will not respond to the email.  I am sure there are at least 250-300 candidates racing to fill it anyway.
Another district has called me twice since I accepted this position.  It is nice to be on the other end of the interview saying..""I am no longer available""….lol.
Tomorrow I sub 1st grade.  I am sure it will be quite the adventure.

So I had to teach in the 4th grade classroom yesterday and one student continued to stay off task.  I had to be the ""mean"" person and take away his toy truck.  I had to lose my voice telling him to ""turn around and do your work"".  Then I discovered the ""key"" to his ""personality"".  I told him to take his work and move up to the front table and do his work.  I told him he needed to be away from distractions.  Then ""magic"" occurred.  He DID his work and he DID it CORRECTLY!  I praised him and patted him on the shoulder and said ""You are a genius!"".  He liked the positive feedback and the word ""genius"".  As we changed from one lesson topic to another, he asked me if he could move up to the table to do his work without distractions.  The day got better and better.  He asked me if he could take extra work home for the weekend!  I told him I did not have any extra work but to ask his teacher.  He asked me if I was coming back next week.  I said I worked at the school and he would see me around.  He asked me where my office was located.  I told him.  He said he would come see me next week and pick up some extra work from me.  I am now going to put together a folder of work for my ""genius"" little boy.  Yesterday was a great day; days like that validate WHY I chose to teach!

Yesterday we shopped and worked out together at Curves.  Today we are going to the State Fair in Pueblo; I LOVE the State Fair!  She is taking her younger half-brother, too!  He is 13 now.  
She has spoiled me a little bit, too. She cooked me breakfast on Friday b4 I headed out to work.  She also cooked dinner last night; we had chicken adobo – a Filipino dish!
I have been up since 5am and she has been gone; she is out on her 10 mile run.  She is gearing up for the Austin, TX marathon!

There is not too much to report this week.  I am enjoying the Fall weather as it slowly creeps in.  It is cooler now, but the days can still surprise you with some warm heat!  I am surely enjoying this 3 day weekend!  I cut the front yesterday; today I will cut the back lawn.  
Last week, my daughter and I rented ""Medea Goes to Jail"".  When we got ready to watch it, the movie in the case was ""Madagascar""!  We returned it and got another Medea movie a few days later.  As we were getting ready to watch it, it would not play in the DVD player.  Ugh!  So, finally, I got one more on Thursday night (my daughter already had left for TX by now), grabbed some dinner to go, and got ready to watch it and eat dinner and IT DID NOT PLAY IN MY DVD PLAYER!  So, I gave up.  Watching Medea was not meant to be for me.  Instead, I rented a different movie, ""Home"".  This was a serious movie about marriage, illness, and life in general.  It was good.  
Have a great Sunday!
P.S.  I really want to watch Medea!

…against his chest.  He slowly paced up and down the sidewalk on Austin Bluffs Parkway.  I am sure he could smell the delicious aroma of KFC.  Lines of people in cars were stopped at the redlight.  They all stared at him like he was a 3-headed monster in a circus.  Cold stares.  It bothered me.  I turned around and went to the KFC and bought him a meal.  I approached him on the sidewalk; he said ""hello"".  I returned the greeting and handed him the medium drink and 3 piece combo meal from KFC and said, ""This is for you.  I read your sign.  I wanted to help you.""  His eyes lit up and you could see the gratitude in his face.  He said, ""Thanks a million!""  He took the food and drink and walked away.  I didn’t want to turn around and see where he went.  I didn’t want to see the people in the cars talking about me in some sarcastic way.  I walked back to my car and pulled out of the parking lot at KFC.  I saw him; he found a place away from traffic to eat his meal.  He was hungry; he was very hungry.  This Random Act of Kindness was done is memory of my friend’s brother Greg.  He passed away on October 22, 2007.  He died of lung cancer; he was 50.  He had quit smoking 20 years BEFORE his diagnosis.  SMOKING is the silent killer.  Remember, life is too short to NOT help someone out in this lifetime.  Have a great week!  I picked up ""The Secret Life of Bees"" DVD from the library yesterday.  It was great!  It was a tear jerker.  I guess I needed to release some emotions yesterday after the ""very hungry"" man scene.

I think I sprained my left foot, too.  I slipped on some black ice at school on Monday.  It happened so quick.  One moment I was talking to a 4th grader and then the next moment I was looking up at the sky surrounded by concerned kids.  They helped me get up and I said, ""How did you like my latest break dance move?""…lol.  They laughed and so did the teachers standing nearby.  I felt no pain until the next day when my left butt cheek was sore!  By Friday, I am limping…

P.S.  Maybe I SHOULD go out for a drink to prep me for tomorrow…lol.
On a good note:  I went to dinner with a friend.  We had dinner at Famous Dave’s BBQ – complimentary to us – since we are both military veterans.  It was a nice dinner and adult conversation.

I was subbing in 4th grade this week and the principal walked in and evaluated me.  It was a BAD day for anyone to stop in!  Anyway, after a discussion with the principal and a tour of the school INCLUDING a stop in the same classroom the next day with their regular teacher, I noted how the kids behaved and SHOULD behave when their regular teacher is in the classroom.
So the next day, I reinvented myself and became a strict new person!  I let them know how their behavior was observed by the CINC (Commander-In-Chief) of the school and how it reflected on me.  I told them my rules; these were from my student teaching days – dusty but efficient!
1.  Be prepared for class.  If you are coming to my writing class don’t come without a pencil.  I asked them, ""Would you go to the beach without your swimming suit?""  They said ""No!"".
2.  Stay in your seat.  Nobody should be wandering around my classroom when I am teaching unless you have permission.  Basically, you better have an important mission if you are OUT of your seat!  (i.e.  like a Fire Drill alarm!)
3.  Do NOT ask to leave the classroom.  If you have to go to the bathroom, you better take care of that b4 you come to my class.  If you have an accident, you better pack a diaper bag for the rest of the week.  4th graders should know when to go to the bathroom – b4 class!
4.  Raise your hand to answer a question.  I don’t need to ask the class what is 4×3? and get 20 answers – all WRONG answers!
5. There will be NO talking during instruction.  The only voice that should be on is mine!
6.  Break my rules and YOU pay the consequences.  You get a referral to the principal’s office and explain to her why you are there.
Afterwards, you would not believe what a great day I had in the classroom!  2 students tested me and both went to the office!
So yesterday, the principal stops in my classroom unannounced and was very pleased.  It was a writing class.  Soft instrumental Christmas music was playing in the background.  The students were all working quietly on their task.  So the moral to this story is:  As a sub, set your expectations up front for the class and follow through on your consequences.  
I do not like to see kids cry, but one of my students cried and did not want to go to the office.  Well…readers…it was not a choice…it was a direct order!
P.S.  During my math class, my co-worker walked in and said, ""Here is an early Christmas present"" and handed me a paper.  I read it and congratulated her.  It was an evaluation that I thought belonged to her, but it was MINE!  She got it out of my mailbox and thought she would make my day since the previous day was not too good.  I was so happy I didn’t know what to do!  All of the students were looking at me and one said, ""What is it?""  My response:  ""Do your math.  Did I ask you a question?""

I also plan to wrap my gifts for my Secret Santa today.  We are doing ""Secret Santa"" at work.  I chose the name of a 2nd grade teacher.  I picked up some fun stuff at the $1 store.  She likes to laugh so I got her 2 Christmas plaques:  Don’t Get Tangled Up in Your Tinsel and My Friends are Flakes (snow is all over the plaque).  I also got her a small bag of ""Santa’s Coal"".  The package says ""Naughty Never Tasted This Nice""….lol.  I have other things, too.  Yesterday I put a bottled water and 2 small packages of peanut m&ms in her mailbox.  Another surprise will include:  a Christmas CD, Christmas socks, and a blinking red (her favorite color) Christmas cup.  So far, I have covered 3 days of surprises for my Secret Santa.  I think this is fun!  Another day will be a Christmas wine bag with a holiday drink inside.  I am thinking something like Sparkling Apple Cider or something along those lines.  I might bake some cookies to go with it.  For the ""Reveal"" Party on Friday, I plan to give her some holiday themed scrapbooking items.  She likes to scrapbook.  So what do you think?  Any ideas?  Am I doing this the right way?  
So today will be the perfect day to wrap and relax.  I might have to walk up to Starbucks for one of their holiday coffees, too!  I will call it my bday treat early!
I think I will bake today, too.  I am sending baked items to my kids for Christmas this year.
P.S.  This is entry number 1000!

So yesterday we had a Reveal Party for all the Secret Santas.  I would have NEVER guessed who by Secret Santa was this week!  However, she stepped forward yesterday and she is the 2nd grade teacher on my hallway!
Today is my birthday!  I think I will take myself to a movie or get one from the library.  Heck!  I think I should take myself and splurge on myself today..what do you think?  I am going out for BBQ tonight…yummy!
Have a great weekend!

 So I was in the Holiday Market in Nashville, GA (Redneck City by any other name).  I grew up here!  I was cashing in my $18 winnings from scratch tickets I received as a birthday present.  I was dressed like I always dressed (in Colorado) – very colorful with mismatched bright knee-high socks (from www.littlemissmatched.com).  Some local Rednecks were in the corner of the store drinking coffee and talking about people.  Next thing I know, one was standing by me looking at my socks and said, ""We was wondering if you was walking on the yellow brick road and got lost?""  I’m like thinking to myself (what the heck is he talking about?).  I looked down at my socks and forgot that I was not in Colorado anymore.  He said something about being lost in the Land of Oz.   I smiled and said, ""You are just jealous because you want a pair of these cool socks,"" and they all chuckled.  I so wanted to say, ""Yea, I am Dorothy.  Who are you?  Are you the Scarecrow without a brain?""….lol.
These are my socks:  I was wearing the yellow and red striped one.

My son’s wife took me to her salon today to cut and color my hair for FREE!  I was thrilled.  She does such a great job.  My son told me tonite, ""You hair looks good"".  I smiled and said he could thank his wife.  Family gets FREE service at the salon.  It pays to have a hairstylist in the family.  This saved me some $!
Tomorrow I return to GA for a final night with my Mom and brothers.  I am off to the Atlanta airport on Saturday.  Wow – this was a quick 2 weeks.  I have enjoyed this time with my granddaughter and her family.  I enjoyed cooking and spending time with my granddaughter.  I will miss her.  I have also enjoyed the time in GA with my Mom, brother, nieces, nephew, and friends.  All good things must come to an end, thus, I am returning home – – miles and miles away from family.  Mom is 84 and seems ageless.  She moves slower due to arthritis, but she still looks the same to me – ageless.  I sure hope that is a hereditary trait!  I might come back and spend a month or so with her this summer.  I enjoy spoiling her as much as she enjoys spoiling me.
Did I tell you that I got an email from orbitz.com?  I purchased my plane ticket from them.  They notified me that another Orbitz customer purchased the same trip as mine for less money.  They are sending me $95 in the mail once my trip has been completed.  Woo-hoo!  So, if you are planning to travel, buy your ticket from orbitz.com.  If the price drops after you made your purchase – you get the difference back in CA$H!
I made a great dinner tonite for the kids.  We had a pot roast with carrots and potatoes.  I also made some yummy brown rice (rich brown rice – made with beef consumme soup, butter, and an onion).  The kids loved it!  I also made some home-made banana nut bread that turned out great!  Hey – you cannot NOT bake when you are surrounded with pecan trees that produce lots of nuts!  You would be a NUT not to bake! 
Have a great night!

Well, I am back home again, in Colorado.  I am sad because I had such a great visit with my family in GA and my son’s family in FL.  Now, I am getting ready to start another week at school.  Today is a teacher work day so it will be very low key – no students.  Then the next 2 days I will be subbing as the music teacher.
I would really like to research finding a job in GA and being closer to my Mom.  I really miss her.  Maybe I will look for job opportunities back there in my spare time at home.
Gotta run.  Here is a new word for you – felicitous.  I had a felicitous trip home.

I recently read an article in the newspaper about an Acts of Kindness on-line course and decided to join.  It is free and I think it will be fun!  It started in Seattle, WA at the Puget Sound Community School (PSCS).  It is free!  Send an email to pscs@pscs.org and let Andy know you want to join!  
You get a theme each week and you respond by doing an act of kindness.  The first theme dealt with ""doing a kindness to yourself"" because you can’t be kind to others unless you can be kind to yourself.  Then you do your kindness deed and post it on the blog.  I met a friend for lunch and we hung out for the afternoon and I purchased a new book!
This week’s theme is ""being kind to someone you love"".  I am still thinking about what to do with this one.  I am thinking that I will buy a plane ticket to San Antonio, TX in February to visit my twin daughters who are now 23 (as of January 5) and have a ""Mother-Daughters Weekend"".  Both the girls are spending 2 weeks together in TX since the one stationed in TX is alone for 2 weeks because her husband is going to be away at school. (Wow – I think I just wrote a ""run-on"" sentence – oops).   Her sister is stationed in MD.  Also, my TX daughter is being assigned to Germany for 3 years in June!  I will miss her so much!  I asked for a ""Personal Day"" at school yesterday, but the principal has not replied back.  I think I should just buy my ticket; if the price drops Orbitz will reimburse me anyway.  Plus, we are entitled to 3 personal days with no questions asked (supposedly).
Anyway – check it out – pscs@pscs.org and tell them Jake’s Mom sent you!

I got my personal day and I am planning my trip to San Antonio – woo-hoo!  I think I want to do some girly things with my daughters, too.  I am thinking we should go to a spa and get a facial, manicure, and pedicure together.  What do you think?  Or – we could just go to Starbucks, catch up with each other, have a nice dinner and maybe go to the movies.  I think the spa thing is overrated.  Comments?
I am off to the library to escape from my home.  This weekend is going to be MY weekend with ZERO commitments!
Last Saturday I was in class (for the district) from 8-4!  I felt I had NO WEEKEND.  Then this week – I was in another district class 2 nights from 4-8pm!  So can you imagine being at school from 7:30am to 3:30pm THEN driving to another location for 4 more hours!?  So…you now know why I am turning off my phone and having ""Patty"" time.  On another note:  the classes were interesting and fun!  BUT – I am recharging myself this weekend and plan to do for me!
Have a great weekend!

It all began with a Princess who lived in a castle and was very rich.  She was single and LOVED it!  Then her parents insisted that she get married.  So the Princess created impossible tasks for each suiter.  All suitors failed to achieve the tasks.  Then along comes Prince Swashbuckle who succeeds with all the tasks.  This earns him the ""magical kiss"".  Surpisingly, the kiss turned the Prince into a toad.  In the end, the Princess gets a bad rep for turning the Prince into a toad and lives happily ever after – SINGLE.
**So this is the type summary I was taught to write in the ""Write Tools"" class that was held in my district.  It was fun to learn, but I am sure it will be an adventure to teach.  Teaching it will be like asking a person with no teeth to grind his/her teeth…lol.
I have been enjoying this weekend and doing what I want to do.  Yesterday started out with breakfast from Starbucks, a library movie, ""Definitely, Maybe"" (which I highly recommend!), and a peanut butter cup Blizzard from the DQ.  Today, I went to breakfast at Perkins and am reading a funny book, ""Educating Esme"".  This book is about the first year teaching from the eyes of a 5th grade teacher in the inner city of Chicago.  It is very funny.  I will share a quote:  ‘She looked at me with a sad smile, the smile of a single-parent teaching veteran who has eaten more shit than fits in all the septic systems in Chicago.’  The book brings many chuckles to me as I turn each page.  Since this weekend is all about taking time for me, I am enjoying my time reading.
Have a great Sunday OD friends.

I sure enjoyed doing nothing this weekend.  I have decided I will do the same next weekend.  I think I overbook myself during the week and weekends, but I plan to stop that!  I watched another good movie:  The Road to Rodanthe (Richard Gere).  I don’t think I have ever watched a bad Richard Gere movie.  Next weekend, I plan to slip out and see Avatar.  Everyone says this movie is really great; my daughter just went on and on about it.
I also finished reading the book I got from the library:  Educating Esme: The Diary of a First Year Teacher.  It was funny and WAS NOT edited.  She was also recognized for a few awards.  The next book I plan to read is:  32 Third Graders and 1 Bunny.  This was written by a veteran 3rd grade teacher.  I read one story in it so far and it was very entertaining.
Gotta jump in the shower and get out of here b4 7am.  I heard Walgreens is putting their Chai Lattes back on the coffee bar at ""Cafe Walgreens"".  I love them and the they are soooooo cheap!  My co-worker called yesterday to tell me she would be in late and I might need to cover her sub job – 2nd grade.  So today will be ""jump into survival mode"" because this class has a rep! At least this is a s-h-o-r-t week.

I watched a tiny bit of TV and decided to lie day for a spell.  Now it is almost 11pm.  Where did my day go?  What can I do at this hour?  I think I will read.
Have a great rest of the weekend.

So I found a great book to read, ""Igniting the Passion for Reading"".  It is ez to read and so TRUE.  We have a lot kids that have the ability to read (can read) but they do not read.  So this book gives one great ideas to increase reading in your classroom.  
It is great to have all these great ideas, but I really cannot implement them since I am a building Long Term Sub; I don’t have my own classroom.  However, I will bank all this great knowledge for when I DO get my own classroom.
I think I will bake for the 3rd graders today.  They came up to me on recess duty recently this week and asked for some cookies.  I reward them for their excellent behavior when I sub for them.  I make my cookies from scratch, but the kids are so anxious they told me to just buy the cookie dough and pop it in the oven.  
Here’s something for you to ponder:  I was subbing in a 5th grade classroom and one of the girls said she smelled pickles.  I told her I don’t smell anything.  A 5th grade boy looked at her and said something like ""Maybe you are pregnant and are craving pickles!""  Wow!  I reprimanded him (when all the laughter finally died down) and told him it was very inappropriate and told him to apologize to the girl.
Teaching is NEVER dull!

…I had a meeting with my principal and my mentor teacher last week before I left for Texas to visit my daughters.  It was basically an information gathering meeting for myself to clarify some questions I had.  Nobody knew where to start so I started the discussion saying that I have never had a job where I prayed so much.  I pray going to work, leaving work, in the shower before I get ready for work.  I even mentioned that I invited God to come to this meeting with me and that he is sitting over there and I pointed to the empty chair across the table from me.  Talk about a Kodak moment…..Anyway the meeting went well and I felt we accomplished alot.  
I went to TX on Friday and was back to work on Monday and it was crazy all over again!  Apparently the class I was assigned to on Monday had another sub on Friday and she left very detailed notes about the behavior problems.  So I followed up on the 6 boys that misbehaved and sent them to the Counselor along with the Sub’s notes from Friday.  The counselor sent them back with a note about how these boys are usually well-behaved and that I should not have any problems….WRONG!  I ended up sending 2 of the boys to the office on a referral.  Validation.  That is all I want from this Long Term Sub job…validation…support…backbone from the administrators…etc.  The good thing is that I have support from the grade level team to justify that these boys are NOT WELL-BEHAVED so I am not hallucinating…thank goodness.  I got to leave now and pray before I get ready for another exciting day.
P.S.  God is a great person to take to meetings!  I just hope saying the ""G"" word doesn’t cause problems in a school.  You know what I mean?  Hey – we would not have schools or anything else without Him.  Right?  I knew you would agree.  Have a great Wednesday; I am planning to have a great one, too!  Guess who is coming to work with me today?  Yep!

Oh, well…another journey is about to begin.  It will be ok.  I still plan to go home for the summer and visit my Mom.  I am not going to waste my summer feeling sorry for myself; that is for sure!  Heck, I will look for a job in Georgia and write off my trip to Georgia as a ""job hunting expense""!

I spent Easter doing my taxes.  I decided to grab an ""Easter"" meal at Perkins restaurant.  It was not bad:  Slice of ham, corn, green beans, roll, and dessert (lemon meringue pie!).  I brought a book to read to get my mind off of taxes, too.  When I went to check out, the cashier was nowhere to be found.  I was getting a bit impatient (since I was on a roll with my taxes and needed to finish up) waiting for someone to check me out.  I was patiently standing around looking at my receipt when a great idea popped into my head.  The restaurant phone # was on the receipt so I casually took out my cell phone, dialed the number, and let it ring loudly by the register.  When I saw someone coming to answer, I clandestinely hung up my cell phone and slid it back into my jacket pocket.  The employee was irritated that nobody was on the line, but I was happy that I could finally pay and leave.  Cell phones come in handy!

The Ten Commandments of Working in a Hostile Environment
1st Commandment:  Know that You are Annointed for the Job or Position that You Now Hold 
This is what I have taken from the this 1st commandment:  
1.  I am on a journey and I must take what I have learned from my current job on my journey to my next destination.  (My backpack is full with ‘lessons learned""!)
2.  I am the light in a dark environment.  (It is tough at times, but I have kept the light on!)
3.  This job was given me to build my character.  (Wow!  This was so true!)
4.  I am where I am at for a reason.  He has anointed me for this job.  (He put me here for a reason.)  
5.  There is a ""master plan"" unfolding in my life and my current job is a precursor to His final design.  (I am excited to see what happens after I file for unemployment!)
6.  I am the ""Chosen One"" not the ""victim"".  I am being trained for future greatness.   (I like this idea!  I am surrounded by many victims!)
7.  He troubles the waters so  we will reach out to him.  (This I know for sure! A friend shared this book with me when the waters were getting too turbulent!  I felt like a surfer about to lose the wave and drown!)
———————————————————————–
I LOVE this book!  Everyone needs to read it!  
I will write more later.  The 2nd Commandment:  Don’t Expect to be Appreciated!  (Stay tuned for the enlightenment I achieved from this commandment!)
For now, I have to get my day started.  I am off today; the district is closed!  Yay!  I am taking a shower and going to Starbucks to read the paper and more of T.D. Jakes’ book!

1001,https://www.opendiary.com/m/j8xmom/dont-expect-to-be-appreciated-5368932/,2010-04-16,Don’t Expect to be Appreciated!,"
…this is the 2nd Commandment in T.D. Jakes’ book, The Ten Commandments of Working in a Hostile Environment.  This is what I learned in this chapter:
1.  Your workplace is not the place to be affirmed.
2.  You job DOES NOT define you.  Do not lose your identity by accepting the opinions of others.
3.  God will reveal Himself thru us.
4.  Who we are is not defined by what we do in the workplace.
5.  Don’t waste your time trying ""to be appreciated"" – just do your job.  
6.  Your co-workers will manipulate you if they know you thrive on recognition.
7.  You will be evaluated by Him not by the people in your work place.
8.  God is training you for later success.
9.  Failure is a ""lesson"" not a ""deficiency"".  We must be willing to risk and fail and trust in Him.
10.  Do NOT compartmentalize who you are.  For example, I am not just a teacher; I am so much more.  I am a person with many gifts.  Or, you are not just a cook at McDonalds.  You are so much more.
————————————————————————
***Stay tuned for the 3rd Commandment from this awesome book:  Embrace Opportunities for Change
I decided to buy 2 of these books – one for me and one to play forward!

1002,https://www.opendiary.com/m/j8xmom/wow-uplifting-moment-5368933/,2010-04-23,Wow!  Uplifting Moment!,"
So, it was another typical day at the K-5 school.  I was subbing in 5th grade.  Lunch time finally arrived and I went to my office to eat.  Then I heard a tapping on my office door.  I quickly opened the door and there were 2 Special Ed teachers and a student standing there.  The student is one of my favorites!  Apparently, she spoke in complete sentences with the speech teacher today!  Awesome!  When she returned to her class, it was Free Choice time.  This means she can choose whatever toy she wants to play with during this time.  She chose to come see me ""She wanted to come see her friend (me!)"".  I was so moved by this!  I congratulated her for her great accomplishment for speaking in complete sentences and gave her a small surprise – chocolate – after I asked permission from her teacher.  Wow – another validating moment.  Sometimes I think I am tired and burnt out of teaching as a Substitute, but moments like to today validate my career change.
I heard the school recruited 50 new teachers at a job fair up North.  I was a bit taken by this information, especially since they are letting 20 Long Term Subs go and could have offered us a permanent position.  I didn’t fret too long about the news.  Since reading the book I am currently reading and writing about, I concluded that God probably doesn’t want me to remain in this district and has other plans for me.  So be it.  I will take the lessons learned from this job and take them to my next destination, wherever that may be.
 
"
1003,https://www.opendiary.com/m/j8xmom/embrace-opportunities-for-change-5368934/,2010-04-24,Embrace Opportunities for Change…,"
..is T.D. Jake’s 3rd Commandment for Working in a Hostile Environment.  This chapter was so fitting!  Things I learned:
1.  Change is inevitable.  Even though we are comfortable in our job – expect change.  One thing we can count on –> God is our secure anchor.  We need to hang on and trust!
2.  ""To everything there is a season, a time for every purpose under heaven."" (Ecclesiastes 3:1, 2:17).
3.  He puts change into our lives to spur us into action and to encourage us to extend ourselves so we can reach the next level.  He discusses Moses and how Moses told God he wasn’t the one for the job – to bring God’s people out of Egypt.  Moses was told to trust in Him.  When He annoints you for  a position, nothing can get in your way.  
4.  When change occurs in your workplace you may enter a ""holding pattern"".  You will either return to your workplace or you will be re-routed to another destination.  For example, I am losing my job due to funding, but I am so excited to find out my new destination!  I plan to go home to Georgia and return to CO to see if my final flight plans have been laid out.  I trust He is preparing me for a new destination so I will not fret – I will go home and visit my family.  I will enjoy good conversation, great home-cooked food, and some great fishing!
5.  Sometimes it is best to be silent and not react in the work environment.  Do not get caught up in the gossip about work.  ""Even so the tongue is a little member and boasts great things.  See how great a forest a little fire kindles."" (James 3:5)  Basically, don’t get caught up in the flames of gossip.  J.D. Jakes says in his book, ""…tame that tongue!  Your mouth can talk you out of more blessings than you can count on.""
6.  Psalm 142:2:  ""Pour out your complaint before God.""  He is the one to talk to – not co-workers!
7.  ""In quiet and confidence shall be your strength."" (Isaiah 30:15)  It is best to remain silent and not react to those around you.  You can actually minister to the environment in silence.  Jakes discusses the story of David and Saul alot in his book.

So..what do you think so far?  This book has changed my life!  I was recently told my a co-worker that I am upbeat and positive and that she needs to hang out with me.  I referred her to this book.  The shelf price is $13.00, but I purchased 2 from Amazon.com for $1.99 each plus shipping!  She checked one out at the library.

…until this school year is over!  Today I am going to the zoo on a field trip with the 3rd graders. This should be FUN being outside all day looking at animals.
Yesterday I was tagged to teach 2nd grade and the teacher did not have any Sub lesson plans.  So the team gave me worksheets.  I survived and we had a nice day.  I have decided to put together emergency sub plans for each grade level: K-5.  This way I can pull one out in an emergency.  I will keep them in my sub bag at all times.  
All I want for XMAS is my own classroom—ugh!
Things are getting more and more toxic at work – thus the countdown.

The last day of school was Friday; I am free!  I am officially a statistic and unemployed once again.  Oh well – I can’t stress or worry about it because it doesn’t change things…lol.
The temps in Colorado Springswere warm today – 80 degrees finally!  Walking through the Walmart parking lot felt like I was walking in front of a super sized space heater throwing out the heat! I love it when it is warm!
My daughter is now in Germany and her twin sister leaves for Korea in November.  I am so happy my son and his family relocated back to Colorado; they live less than 15 minutes from me!
My plans for the summer – R-E-L-A-X! (and file for unemployment again….)  I think CO is officially at 8% for unemployment numbers these days.  Of course, there will be plenty from my school district upping those numbers!
Have a great rest of the weekend!

My neighbors bought a 1999 Ford Escort for $500!  It only has 68K miles on it!  Awesome!
So school ended last Friday, 21 May.  
My first week of vacation:  
Monday I had to report to jury duty.  I was able to leave after a couple hours.  
Tuesday I spent the afternoon and evening with my beautiful granddaughter.  
Wednesday I went to a Dr. appointment with my granddaughter and her Mom.  The little one has Scarlet Fever and strep.  To be so sick, she is so cheerful.  
Thursday I spent about 3 hours at the swimming pool with my granddaughter and her Mom.   I also filed for Unemployment again…sigh…I am just another statistic….. 
Today, I putzed around the house and cut the front yard.  Just came back from Curves and will be leaving in about 20 minutes to meet friends for ice-cream at Rizutos!  Yum!
Have a great weekend!

Do you believe in soul mates?  Once upon a time, I dated a wonderful guy when I was in the military – back in 1983.  Over the years we have reconnected to chat a couple times.  I recently chatted with him this past week.  He lives in FL and I live in CO.  He told me to go see ""Letters to Juliet"".  Wow!  Did that movie send me a message or what!?  
In a nutshell, it is never too late to go after your true love.  As for us, only time will tell.  In the movie, it had been 50 years for Lorenzo and Claire…..As for me and my soul mate, it has been 27 years and time is still ticking by…..the last time I saw him was in 1999.  He met my youngest 3 kids.  We had dinner at my house and a surprise bday party for him.  It was fun.  We recalled the good times many years ago.  The last time I spoke to him was when Jake had his accident; he called me to pay his condolences.  Jake really liked him….sigh.
Timing is never right for us.  One of us was always married when when we crossed paths.  I met him when he was separated from his wife in 1983.  I later got married to someone I met in Alaska in 1985.  He eventually got divorced and found me again in 1990.  I was married and unavailable.  When I got divorced in 1996 he was remarried again.  He recently saw this movie and told me to go see it.  Wow…what a timely movie.  I guess you really never 4get someone who made such an impact in your life.  We were in our 20s when we met.  Now we are in our 50s and still remember the special times we shared long ago…..and time goes on….He is coming out to CO on a business trip.  I am struggling with whether I should have dinner with him.  What would you do?  Friends will always be friends, right?  Of course, his plans to come out here may be during the time I am in Georgia with family.  Maybe it would be easier to just go home to Georgia and say..""I was outta town…when you were in town"".

I am reading an awesome book, The Four Agreements, by Miguel Ruiz.  Wow!  This book is transformational!  It is a book about how to change your life from your current pre-programmed life to one of your own.  Basically, everything you are today was ""programmed"" into you by your parents, teachers, peers, etc.  You did not even choose your own name!  So, in a nutshell, the 4 agreements that you should incorporate into your life are:
1. Be impeccable with your word.
2. Never take things personally,
3. Never make assumptions.
4. Always do your best.
I recently made a trip to the Northeastern plains of CO for a job interview.  I applied all 4 agreemens on my way out there, while I interviewed, and on my way back.  It was a 500 mile roundtrip!  I felt so good during this time. 
The book is easy to read, too.  This book would lend itself well to a book discussion group.  It is so ez to NOT do the 4 agreements because we are creatures of habit.  I plan to try to re-program my life now. 
Have a great weekend!  It is chilly in CO Spgs today.  BRR……….It is 46 degrees right now.  I have to pull out my winter duds just to drive over to CURVES.  Hmmmm…this is a great excuse to stop at Starbucks after my workout, too.  A nice cup of my favorite joe…

I have written in OD for over 9 years.  I needed a place to go to grieve the loss of my 9 year old son.  Where can you go on sleepless, tear-filled nights to talk?  You can go to OD.  So I started writing about my memories of my son.  As time progressed, I started writing about my life in general.  I have had a topsy turvy life since my son’s life was cut so short, but somehow I have survived.  OD helped me survive the loss of my son, the turmoil of the teen years with twins, career changes, etc.  OD has become my best friend.  I can come here to journal.  I have made many friends.  I would like to thank Bird of Paradise for telling me about this place over 9 years ago.  It is hard to believe that my son has been gone almost 10 years.  Sometimes it seems like yesterday and sometimes it seems like another lifetime.  His name is Jake and he would have been 19 last month.  My twins were 13 when I started journaling and they are now 23, married, and in the Air Force.  One is in Germany and the other is in MD.  My oldest son is now 31 and has a beautiful family.  I am almost 10 years down the road on my grief journey and I have been able to help others walk this path that NO ONE never expects to walk.  I left defense contracting work to pursue a dream to become a school teacher and I met my goal.  I now have a teaching license but no job.  It is ok though.  I am sure things will fall into place for me eventually.  Thanks OD!

I met with a couple of friends today and we talked about teaching English in Korea.  I am warming up to the idea.  I think it would be awesome experience and great stuff to add to my resume.  I sent an inquiry email to the recruiter tonite.  
There are not many teaching jobs in CO so I might as well ""think outside the box""!
My daughter is visiting from MD.  She is a Korean Linguist with the Air Force.  She is in favor of my idea to go to Korea to teach.  It would be so cool to be over there when she is over there.  We could travel and sight see together.  She could also teach me some survival ""Korean"" language…lol.
So, it has been wonderful having her for almost a week.  Her week ends Wednesday morning…bummer.
As for me, I am doing fine.  I am making my job contacts and networking as much as I can to find a teaching job for the upcoming Fall.  It sure would be nice if my unemployment benefits would kick in!  
Hmmmm…living in Korea for a year with all expenses paid including airfare sounds like something I  should research more in depth!  All of this PLUS a salary that is more than I made this past school year in Colorado Springs!
I am beat!  It is after 11pm – about 2 hours PAST my regular bed time.  Good Night my ODers…sweet dreams.  Tell me what you think of me going to Korea —- thumbs up? Thumbs down?  Heck…we also talked about China looking for Kindergarten English teachers!  Hmmm…I would prefer grades 3-8.  No Kinder for me!

….in my backyard?  Depends on the time of day.  If it was early morning, I would invite them in for a tasty southern breakfast in Colorado.  I would fix some cheesy grits, over easy eggs, turkey bacon and some toast.  I would put on a pot of coffee, too.  We would eat out on the deck and visit.  It would probably be weird if we could not communicate, but everyone knows food is universal communication.  I would check out their space ship and get a tour.  Maybe they would take me for a short flight over Colorado Springs and land on Pikes Peak!  How awesome would that be to walk out of a space ship on the Peak and shock all the tourists!  I bet we would be on the front page of The Gazette!

So, here I am, an unemployed teacher looking for a new job in the upcoming school year.  You will NEVER guess what happened this week.  A principal emailed me the teacher interview questions!  I have to respond to them (about 15 questions), email them back, and if they like what I wrote I will be called in to interview.  Now this is a FIRST!  I guess this is the ""new technique"" used to screen all the numerous applicants!  
Well, all I can say is…I am going home to Georgia for 4 glorius weeks with my Mom, brothers, and neices (18, 11, and 10 years old)!  I am also going to camp at the KOA campground in Savannah with a friend from 3rd grade.  We will be less than an hour from Tybee Island, where The Last Song, was filmed!  We plan to spend time at the beach and time at the KOA.  You can’t beat a 2 bedroom cabin for $55/night!  We are sharing expenses so this is a GREAT DEAL!  The KOA has a pool, too!  Heck, maybe I can post my teaching resume in the bathhouse!…lol.
This month has been busy.  My daughter from Maryland came to visit a week on June 16th.  Then my brother and nephew dropped by for a couple days on June 28th and 29th.  I LOVED having family over.  Also, with my oldest son and his famiy living about 15 minutes away, we all ate together at my place.  
I am counting the days til I leave on July 10th and return on August 7th!  V-a-c-a-t-i-o-n-!
P.S. I will email back those teacher questions with my answers next week.  I was also thinking about including a link in my answers.  They can click on it and it will take them to a youtube video playing the ABBA song ""Take a Chance on Me""  http://www.youtube.com/watch….lol…since I know they are looking for veteran teachers and I am not a veteran teacher with lots of teaching experience.  I just want to have my own classroom for a change and get out of the Sub World.

My plane was delayed out of Denver for about 2 hours!  We had mechanical problems in the beginning.  Once that was resolved, we had weather problems.  Since I had a tight connection in Atlanta, I figured I would be missing my flight into Valdosta, GA and I did.  Since reading the 4 Agreements, the way I treat life has been totally altered.  I got off the plane, looked up at the connecting flights boards and saw that my connection read ""DEPARTED"". 
I walked up to a Delta ticket agent and told her about my situation.  She sent me to the Delta Assistance Center and everything worked out fine.  They gave me a new flight and boarding pass to leave the following morning PLUS a dinner and breakfast voucher worth $6 each AND a hotel voucher for a night at the Marriott!  I cannot tell you how comfortable my room was at the Marriott; I did NOT want to get out of bed the next morning!
I caught the airport shuttle back to the Atlanta airport and caught my flight to Valdosta with no problems.  The only problem I have dealt with so far is the H-E-A-T-!  OMG – it is So HOT in Georgia!  The temperature at 5pm yesterday was 94 degrees.  The temperature inside a fast food restaurant was 84 degrees!
How do you spell relief? P-O-O-L!  I am going to a new outdoor pool with a large water slide at the local military base today!
Can I tell you one more time?  IT IS SO HOT IN GEORGIA.  I can’t wait to get home to Colorado next month!
By the way, it is 7:17am and it is 79 degrees with 94 percent humidity!

I finished my other Jonathan Hull book, Distance from Normandy.  What an awesome read! Great ending, too!  It is another historical fiction book about a WWII Vet .  He is widowed and invites his 16 year old troubled grandson to spend 3 weeks with him.  The boy’s Mom is a single, struggling Mom.  He ends up taking his grandson to Europe to teach him about the war and how to appreciate life.  This book has a great mixture of history, love, loss, and life lessons.  I wish there was another book by this author!
I also finished a book I bought from my small home town library, Welfare Mother, by Susan Sheehan.  This is an inside look at the life of a mother and her 10 children (1 died at a very young age and one was aborted) living on the ""system"".  Very interesting look at life.  The subject of this book is Puerto Rican.
My next book is going to be Dianna: My Last Word.  This was written by her close friend/confidant/therapist – Simone Simmons.  It is an ez book to read.  I read the 1st Chapter and it tells about her brief fling with JFK, Jr.  She rates him as a great lover with a great body!  Unfortunately, for Prince Charles, he did not even rate on her scale from 1 to 10 on lovers.  Lucky for him – his rating might of been the subject of the Dave Letterman or Jay Leno show!
For now, I am going to bed.  It is 11pm in the hot SE!

I was doing some housecleaning and a terrible nosebleed came upon me.  I was a bit freaked out since it was really a gusher.  My mom is retired from the medical field.  She was so CALM!  She told me to recline in the recliner and she put a cold compress on my forehead.  Then she took her stethoscope out to check my vitals.  It was kinda funny when she appeared alarmed because she could not find my heartbeat.  Her eyes got wide and she said, ""Patty! What is wrong with you?! Please sit up.""  I was like, ""Mom, I am not dead or I could not be talking at the moment.  I cannot sit up because my nose is bleeding.""   I told her to check my pulse to verify I was ok.  I was fine.  She then checked my blood pressure and it was fine, too:  110/74  I asked Mom to sit down because I was worried this excitement might make her lose her balance and cause her to fall.  So I said, ""Mom, please sit down.  If you fall, I can’t pick you up.""  I couldn’t jump out of my chair to rescue Mom since my nosebleed was such an inconvenience.
I have now recovered. I finished my house cleaning.  I am excited to be leaving for St. Mary’s, GA tomorrow to go camping with my brothers.

Summer ended and school has started; I am an unemployed teacher once again.
So my last day teaching was May 21, 2010; due to school budgetary reasons, my job was eliminated.
I have had 2 face to face interviews and 1 phone interview; all chose another candidate.  It is so difficult for a ""new"" teacher to compete with the unemployed ""seasoned"" teachers.  I have not given up.  I have decided to lower my standards and apply for teacher aide jobs (para professionals); afterall, beggars cannot be choosy.  It is not the pay that matters; what matters are the benefits (medical, dental, vision, etc.).  Also, any job in the education field will add experience to my resume.
I have also decided to venture into retail sales.  I actually got an interview with Office Depot last week!  They might call me this week and give me a second interview.  They might not, too.  I am not going to worry because worrying will not fix anything.
I have a job tomorrow as a Substitute in a Middle School for half a day.  This should be fun!  Middle School kiddos are fun.  Their fiestiness and my sarcasm make the day an adventure.  After my Sub job, I have to scurry across town to another face2face interview in another district.  Wish me luck!
This summer was great!  I went home for a month and visited my family in GA.  I LOVED every minute of it.  My favorite part was camping in the KOA in St. Mary’s, Georgia.  We boated over to Cumberland Island.  It was very hot and humid on the island.  I wonder why Gilligan and his crew never seemed to sweat on Gilligan’s Island!  
So, OD people, I have reappeared back on the OD scene.  Have a great week!

I have today and tomorrow off because I am having oral surgery – having a cracked molar pulled and an implant started.  Don’t worry; I am NOT going to one of those places where they pull the tooth, put in the implant, create the new tooth, and the whole shabang in one day.  I am going to a highly recommended oral surgeon; he was recommended by my dentist.  This is step one today.  Then when it heals in 4-6 months, I get the new tooth.  I have to do this now since my insurance runs out at the end of this month!  Wish me luck and no fear.  I fear the dentist even though I have never had a bad experience.  It is the fear of a bad experience….lol.  I hope I get some insurance soon!  I will spend today and tomorrow getting new insurance.  I know it is going to be expensive.  I guess I will opt for the higher deductible and the lower premium.  Any ideas?  Please share with me!

Today I start my Thanksgiving break from school.  I return on Monday.  I am thankful to have job.  It has been long hours, full of stress.  I was told by the principal that I have the toughest class at the school.  They are 5th graders and some come to school just to disrupt class and rob others of their education.  I was also told this class has run off Subs by throwing things at the Subs.  Additionally, I was told that some Subs come into the classroom and leave before the day is over!  When the principal told me this, I smiled and said, ""Well, I am still here.  In the military, I would get combat pay and Sub pay for this duty!""….lol.  He laughed.
The principal installed a webcam in my classroom to catch the disruptive behavior.  It has worked, too!  The other 5th grade teacher said she didn’t want a webcam.  She told me she didn’t want to have one because some days she didn’t want to teach.  Wow.  She has a contract to teach, too.  She has what I can only dream of having.
Oh, well.  I am going to enjoy this much deserved time off!  Have a great holiday my dear friends at OD.
Oh, Jody!  If you are reading, you have a great holiday with your family, too!

I had a great Thanksgiving today.  My son and his family came.  My daughter-in-law’s sister and her 3 kids came, too.  I made turkey, dressing, and 4 sweet potatoe pies!  Everyone that came brought food and we had a feast!  I am so stuffed!  I have lots of dessert left; you should all come over and have pie and coffee with me until Sunday night.  Then it’s another manic Monday for me! http://www.youtube.com/watch
Enjoy your holiday and count all your blessings in life.  Did I tell you I am going to become a Gramma AGAIN?!  My grandson is due in April so you know where I will be in April…at my daughter’s house on the East Coast!  Rumor has it that his middle name will be ""Jacob"" (like my youngest son’s first name).  I think at the moment they are thinking his name will be Austin Jacob.  I think Jake is looking down on us smiling about this blessed event coming up next year.  
P.S. I don’t write too often about Jake anymore, but please don’t think that I have forgotten him.  Everyday I remember things he and I used to do together; I guess that’s why I never moved away after he left us.  For example, I remember our special parking place in the Target parking lot, the last lunch we shared at the local Taco Bell, his last hug and his last words to me, ""I love you, Mom, I will be back at 7 tonite.""  His accident stole him from our lives that day at 5:19pm.  It is painful today as it was 10+ years ago.  It is not as intense because I think God gives us some type of spiritual valium that helps us live with the loss.  I am sitting in his room typing this entry.  His room is now my office.  His toys are still in his closet.  His name is still written on the dresser I bought him; I guess I will never get rid of his dresser.  I have so many ""linking objects"" that I cannot part with.  As I speak, I still have his Snoopy Easter piggy bank sitting by my laptop.  It held Whitman’s candies at one time, one Easter long ago.  His money is still in there.  I have never counted it; it is too painful to touch.  This is proof about death and money; you can’t ""take it with you.""  Jake didn’t take it with him.  He took our hearts….love is greater than money.  I know it; he knew it, too.  I miss you, son.  We talked about you today.  It is hard to believe you are 19 and spent your teen years in Heaven without us.  Do you think you will recognize us when we come up to see you?  I can only remember you as 9 years old, but you are probably a handsome young man in Heaven.  I still have not watched the videos your childcare provider gave me after you passed.  Seeing you in videos would be too much.  This summer I dreamed that you were in the hospital and were coming home.  I was excited to be picking you up.  Then I woke up and reality sunk in.  Why does the mind play such painful games with me?  I will never know, but I know one thing – – I miss you and still don’t understand why you had to leave us.  We all miss you.  Your older brother’s little girl picked up a picture of you today in your room.  She asked me who it was.  I told her ""That’s your Uncle Jake.""  She said your name back to me.  She will be 3 next month.  It doesn’t seem fair that you are not here to experience all the things that have taken place in our family, Jake.  I learned another fact about life when you left us.  I learned that ""Life is not fair.""  I am really rambling tonite.  Good night readers.

So my oldest son and his family stopped over to visit me yesterday.  We were sitting in the kitchen having lunch.  He says, ""A miracle happened this week"".  I am looking at him and thinking maybe they landed a great deal on a house.  They have been looking.  His wife was sitting at the table smiling.  So I say, ""What happened?""  He says, ""H (wife) is pregnant"".  OMG!  This IS a miracle!  They tried for 10 years to have a baby and went through In-Vitro twice!  The second time worked and we were blessed with a beautiful baby girl; she will be 3 this week.  H was due to have a hysterectomy in February, but now we have a new baby due in August!  I can’t tell you how excited we all are about this blessed event!  I will have 2 new additions to the family next year!  Renee is having a boy in April and now another baby in August.  I believe in miracles!  The doctors had told H after her first child that she had a 1% chance of having another on her own without in-vitro.
""An extraordinary event manifesting divine intervention in human affairs"" is how Merrian-Webster.com defines ""miracle"".  This is how our family views this event, too!  H asked for prayers and received a miracle.  I am still so overwhelmed with this news!

1029,https://www.opendiary.com/m/j8xmom/christmas-came-and-went-3-5368960/,2010-12-27,Christmas Came and Went,"
I went into solitude this Christmas.  I was so burnt out with my Long Term Sub job that I decided to recharge during the holidays.  I kept my granddaughter on Monday and Thursday of last week so her parents could get some things done.  Starting on Christmas Eve, I went into seclusion.  I had a wonderful quiet holiday.  I watched movies and relaxed.  I had never watched ""A Christmas Story"" or ""Miracle on 34th Street"" from start to finish until this year!  These are great movies!  I also watched ""Flipped"" and ""The Secrets of Jonathan Sperry"" – these are both wonderful family movies.  ""Shutter Island"" was very H-E-A-V-Y, but Leonardo Dicaprio put on another stellar performance.  Last night, I had dinnner at Mimi’s with a friend who I have not seen since last summer.  She and I had a great time catching up.
For Christmas, this year, I baked and gave personal gifts.  I think the most fun I had gifting this year was when I was making ""personalized photo albums"".  You can put 10 pictures in each one and record memories for each.  I made 3 of these books so far.  I still have one more to make and mail to my daughter in Germany.  You can purchase these at the Hallmark Store.  My sweet potato pies were fun to make, too.
I am still enjoying my time off.  My Long Term Sub job ended on December 17 so I am back ""on-call"" starting the first week in January.  I am looking at it as another adventure yet to unfold!
Next year will be filled with special moments – two grandchildren arriving – one in April and one in August.  I will be in Maryland for the April birth.  I am excited!  I try to focus on the positives in my life and not the negatives (being unemployed again).
I suppose I should take my things to the recycle center this morning.  This is a great excuse to stop in at Starbucks with one of my XMAS presents and read the paper and sip my favorite ""cup of Joe"" or tea. 
Have a wonderful week.  I am sure enjoying sleeping in past 5am.  I have been rolling outta bed around 8am each day since Christmas morning.  It feels wonderful!

Today is my 10th anniversary with OD and I have written 1054 entries. Wow.  It is hard to believe I have been here this long.  I started this OD to grieve the loss of my son, Jake.  He died in a go-cart accident 10 years ago on September 24, 2000.  Now this diary has taken many twists and turns with entries about life in general.
Thanks to all of you, I have made it through these past 10 years without Jake.  Thanks to Bird of Paradise for telling me about this place.
Today it is very cold in Colorado.  We had some snow blow in yesterday and it dropped our temps.  I had a 4:38am call to Sub this morning, but I didn’t take it.  I figured if the roads were too bad for a contracted teacher who has full benefits that I better stay home and stay safe.  The same district called me 3 times today!  I have relaxed and read all day.  I will venture out to Curves in a couple hours and then return home.
Have a great day OD Land!  This is now 1055 entries – woot! woot!

…picked up a half day Sub job as an English Language Learner teacher today.  Why does every class have a ""problem"" student?   I had 3 today and they were 3rd graders!  My favorite groups were the Kinder and 1st graders today.  
I thought the half day would ease me back into the adventures of subbing.  Tomorrow is a full day – Middle School Science!  I have to be there at 7am.
Have you heard about people bidding on abandoned/delinquent rental storage units?  I found a cool thrift shop and that’s how he gets his merchandise.  So I went to http://www.aetv.com and researched this storage unit auction business and WOW!  One guy bid $400 on a unit and found a $4000+ coin collection!  Check it out.
Anyway, the thrift shop I found sells kids’ clothes for twenty cents!  I found a great Little Tykes table and chairs for $7.50 plus tax!  I also bought my granddaughter a wooden baby bed for her dolls and a small dresser for her dolls – also wooden – for $2.00!  I bought some books for my granddaughter there, too – 20 cents each – even Dr. Seuss and Newberry Award winner books!  She has plenty of clothes so I didn’t need any of the clothes.  The guy who runs the shop sells his big ticket items on Ebay.  He’s a great guy; he helps out the community in these tough times with his great prices!
So if you ever wondered what happens to stuff put into storage units and the rent is delinquent—now you know.  Someone bids on your unit and makes $$$ and the storage unit personnel get their delinquent rent many times over!
So off to bed I go and you – 
Have a great Friday!

Yesterday was a great Sub job!  I subbed for the Talented and Gifted teacher.  She only had two classes the entire day.  So I helped out in the library.  I learned how to ""refurbish"" books.  It was fun!  The students in the Gifted classes were awesome, well-behaved, and friendly, too.  
Now it is Saturday.  I joined Netflix since BlockBuster is closing.  I loaded up my queue with movies and can’t wait to get my first movie delivered:  Dora the Explorer: Big Sister Dora.  I am getting it for my granddaughter since she will become a big sister in August.
I have decided to stay home today/weekend and focus on the house and declutter and donate to the ARC.
I have a movie to watch today that I got from the library:  Ghosts of Girlfriends Past. 
Have a great weekend!
Oh!  I bought a double mattress/box spring set for my spare bedroom.  My son and his family were planning to move in with me while they looked for a home, but moved in with her parents instead.  I had sold the twin beds in the two spare bedrooms (on Craigslist) so now I am putting together one of the bedrooms.  Jake’s room will stay my office.  I feel close to him while I am in here – like right now.  Anyway, did you know you can purchase BRAND NEW Twin, Double/Full, and Queen mattress sets at Goodwill and the ARC?  I got a great deal at the ARC – full size pillow mattress set for $240 and a frame for $34!  Since my son and his wife stay overnight occasionally, I decided to put the bedroom together for them.  The last time they stayed, they slept on the futon/full size bed in the family room and Isabella slept in the guest bedroom next to me.  She actually slept through the night when she was here!  I think she is very comfortable with Gramma – that would be ME!  What do you think?!

1034,https://www.opendiary.com/m/j8xmom/guest-room-2-5368965/,2011-01-18,Guest Room,"
So my son and his family decided to spend the night on Monday night.  Guess who tried out the new bed?  Isabella!  She loved it!  I was worried about her being scared in the lower level of the house.  She would be alone, but guess what?!  She SLEPT THROUGH THE NIGHT AGAIN!  My son and his wife took the other guest room upstairs.  Everyone had a super duper night.  I cooked Mexican chicken for dinner so everyone has a full stomach, too!  
Tuesday was a Sub job at an IB school – International Baccalaureate – AKA ""school for smart kids""!  It was a great day.  The kids tested me but were respectful when reprimanded.  I have noticed the upscale school districts have more respectful students. 
With that said, today was another day in the low income school district.  The front office told me how tough the class was when I signed in this morning.  They kept going on and on and on.  I told them them better stop telling me this or I might leave!  It was not a ""stroll in the park"" with these students but we developed a mutual respect for one another.  Success!
Well, the weather outside is bitter cold and the wind is whipping things around like a twister!  I am sure tomorrow will bring many sub opportunities due to the weather.  If the roads are bad tomorrow, I am staying home, too!  Maybe I will download a movie from NetFlix onto my computer and relax tomorrow.
Have a super rest of the week!

I have been busy as a bee subbing all over the place!  Today was Middle School Language Arts; the students recited poems.  They also had to write a poem about a teacher and use all kinds of figurative language (i.e. metaphors, similes, hyperboles, personification, etc.)  It was a fun day with 7th graders.  I have come realize that Middle School is my favorite age group to teach.  Isn’t life the pits sometimes?  I am certified in Elementary, unemployed, and love subbing in Middle School!  Go figure…just like Murphy’s Law…lol.

 Never Argue with a Woman
 
One morning, the husband returns the boat to  their lakeside cottage after several hours of fishing and decides to take a nap.
 
Although not amiliar with the lake, the wife decides to take the boat out. She motors out a short distance, anchors, puts her feet up, and begins to read her book. The peace and solitude are magnificent.
 
Along comes a Fish and Game warden in his boat.He pulls up alongside the woman and says, “Good morning, ma’am. What are you doing?”
 
“Reading a book,” she replies, thinking, Isn’t that obvious?
 
“You’re in a restricted fishing area”’ he informs her.
 
“I’m sorry, officer, but I’m not fishing. I’m reading.”
 
“Yes, but I see you have all the equipment. For all I know you could start at any moment. I’ll have to take you in and write you up.”
 
“If you do that, I’ll have to charge you with sexual assault,” says the woman.
 
“But I haven’t even touched you,” says the game warden.
 
“That’s true, but you have all the equipment. For all I know you could start at any moment.”
 
“Have a nice day ma’am,” and he left.
 
MORAL:
 

Never argue with a woman who reads. It’s likely she can also think.
 

Have a great weekend!

I have been in bed since last Monday.  I am battling the flu, I think.  Does anyone out there have a good home remedy?  I am so tired and wiped out.  My chest is congested and I feel sorry for myself.  Blah!  My neighbor gave me soup and tea.  The tea was great – it had honey and whiskey in it.  I can’t drink too much because it makes me very tired.
My soulmate is going to be in town this week on business, too!  I am too tired to have dinner with him, too.  We met in 1983 and travelled separate journeys and lives.  I have not seen him in over 10 years and now I am sick!  Blah!
Poor, Poor, Pitiful Me!  I wish I could feel better for at least an hour.

After 9 days of being sick, I went to the Dr. on Tuesday.  She gave me some anti-biotics.  I started feeling better within 24 hours.  I decided to not push it this week, so I laid low all week.  I hope to be back in the swing of things – back to subbing on Monday morning.  I sure miss working out at Curves, too!  Hopefully, I will be back on track on Monday.
My soulmate came into town Monday and I was so sick!  However, he offered to come over, visit, and take me out to dinner.  It was nice.  It was nice having him do the driving, ordering, talking, etc.  I was too tired to see him on Tuesday night, and he left for another business trip on Wednesday night.  I have been in contact with him via email and he called me today.  He returns to the East coast early tomorrow morning (about 2am!)  Overall, it was great seeing each other after over a decade had passed between us.  Who knows what the future holds.  Life is always full of adventures, right?  Friendship is a wonderful thing.

I subbed all week!  Yay!  Four days were in Middle School and Friday ended in Elementary School.  Wow, it was an awesome week!
To make things more interesting, my soulmate popped into town on Thursday.  We tried to go for a walk around the lake at a local park, but it proved to be too chilly with the wind blowing over the water.  We ended up having a wonderful dinner at the Black-Eyed Pea.  We had the traditional St. Patrick’s Day meal.  It was so yummy!  The young waitress came over to talk to us quite often.  We were so impressed with her being a single Mom, working double shifts waitressing, AND going to massage therapy school.  Soulmate tipped her $20!  I was so happy to hear this when he told me Friday.  He is such a wonderful, REAL person.
Friday, I threw a roast into the crockpot for dinner before I raced out the door to work.    I made a couple sides to go with it when I got home at 4pm.  Soulmate arrived around 5pm.  I think he planned to go out to eat, but I wanted real home-made food.  We both enjoyed a quiet dinner.  We were able to talk a lot about life.  He left about 10pm since he had to be back at the airport at o’dark thirty today.  He texted me that he arrived safely.  
He is just so real.  It is amazing how time with him makes it seem like the day we met almost 30 years ago.  In the great jigsaw puzzle of life, I think we will be ""interlocked"" forever.  Friendship IS a wonderful thing. 
He flies into Colorado Springs every month on business.  I told him he can always come over for dinner if he wants company, conversation, and lots of laughs.  I think he will be visiting my place next month again.  What do you think?  I did worry that the neighbors might be curious, but that worry soon passed.  I think it is good for the neighborhood to be curious, don’t you?  Afterall, we ARE a Neighborhood Watch area…lol.  This gives them some real-world practice with ""strangers"" in the area.
By the way, I am thinking of writing a Haiku to put in the paper on Jake’s 20th birthday next month.  Remember the format?  5 syllables in the first line, 7 syllables in the second line, and 5 syllables in the last line.  For example:
Remembering Jake Today and Always
You loved your go-cart.
Riding it to Heaven hurt.
You were too young to leave us.
This is just a quick example.  Wow!  Writing this hurt…(teary eyed)…
Have a great Sunday!

Austin was born last Tuesday (April 12) at 8:54pm.  He weighed 7lbs, 7oz and was 21 inches long.  He was born at the National Naval Medical Center (NNMC) – ""the Presidents’ hospital"" – Bethesda.  The hospital and staff were stellar!  I have my first BLONDE grandchild!   I assisted in his birth and cannot even describe what an experience that was!  I don’t think think I would want to do it as a living, but it was priceless.  Mommy, baby are doing fine.  The new daddy is awesome!  Maryland is beautiful, wet, and green.  I wish I could pack up some of this moisture and bring it back to Colorado.
"
1044,https://www.opendiary.com/m/j8xmom/welcome-to-the-month-of-may-5368976/,2011-04-30,Welcome to the Month of May,"
May is here and we are still having cold weather and snow in Colorado! It was snowing last night – light snow, but snow is snow.
I have to apologize for not being a regular writer like I used to be on here. I started this OD to write about my grief for my son Jake. In thirteen days he would have been 20 years old. It is hard to think of him as a young adult. I will always remember him as a young boy who enjoyed life.
So–to catch up, I was in Maryland for 2 weeks to become a Gramma again. I got back home on 20 April and have been busy subbing. I was back in the classroom on 21 April. I was booked all last week, too! 
21 April – 2nd graders – oh my!
22 April – PE teacher in elementary – FUN!
25 April – Middle School Science/6th grade- awesome!
26 and 27 April – Middle School Language Art s/8th grade- awesome
28 April – Elementary computers – piece of cake half day!
29 April – Elementary/5th grade at an IB school – super!
2 May – Middle School Math
3 May – nothing at the moment – but I get to baby sit my granddaughter in the evening while her mom does hair; her mom is a professional stylist
4 May – half a day with 4th grade – nice!
5 May – half a day with ESL (English as a Second Language) – these are usually very low key days. I have never been to this school so it should be an adventure. This is a rural school so it should be a cool assignment!
6 May – 4th grade – I have never been to this school so it should be an adventure.
So, as you can see, I stay busy subbing for school districts. Districts pay between $85 and $91 per day. If you get tagged to supervise a class on your planning time, you get paid $20+ extra. So – it is not a bad gig, but having my own classroom will always be my goal, if I can hold out long enough. 
I saw a real WOLF on Tuesday last week! Yepper! The school had a presentation by the Colorado Wolf and Wildlife Center (CWWC) from Florissant, Colorado! It was so cool to see the wolf. All the students were fascinated and were allowed to pet him! So – subbing – has some perks, too!
My daughter, not the one who had the baby recently but her twin sister, deployed to the desert (Middle East) on Friday. So keep her in your prayers. She is stationed in Germany at the moment and left on a six month deployment. She will return some time in November. She invited me to come to Germany during the holiday season – Nov/Dec. She will have a two week ""down time"" after her return from deployment. She wants me to come out; she wants to take me to all the places she has visited (Brussels, Switzerland, the Netherlands, etc.)! So you know where I will be this holiday season! So, I need to get my passport paperwork started! How exciting! I will post pics! The plan is to visit her in Germany and fly back together and stop in Maryland so she can see her new nephew; he will be about eight months old by then. Then I will either return to CO or fly down to GA to visit with my mom, brothers, and nieces (<- is that spelled right – i before e except after c rule?) for Christmas. 
So today is Sunday. I am thinking I need to go to Starbucks to read the paper and relax. I went to Church on Thursday night so don’t think I am skipping out…lol. I also need to shop for my next grandson whom the stork brings in August. His parents are registered at Target.
Wow – I wonder what Jake would think – he is an Uncle twice over and soon to be 3 times! He recent nephew has his middle name (Austin Hunter Cox). I think his upcoming nephew might have his first name as a ""middle"" name (Isaiah Jacob Smathers). We will see. It was a possibility three years ago, but my older son and his wife had a girl. This time, it has been confirmed they are are having a boy.
P.S. My soul mate is back in town tomorrow for ten days! I have not seen him since March. He stayed in touch throughout my trip to Maryland. We enjoy talking and remembering the ""good ole days"". We also talk about our families and how life seems to reconnect people for a reason. Whatever the reason for this reconnection seems somewhat unclear at the moment. All I can say is ""He has made my life more interesting and exciting."" He knows my children, too! He met Jake and my girls in 1999. Funny as it may seem, my girls remember him! You can imagine how much my girls are into my ""kool-aide"" lately! 
Have a great week! I am thinking about going away next weekend to enjoy a quiet Mother’s Day without phones or computers! I want a place where I can soak in a huge hot tub or jetted bathtub, filled to my neck in bubbles, and a good book. I want to wake up to someone cooking MY breakfast! Embassy Suites might fit the bill! It is a lot cheaper than the Bed and Breakfast that I really would like to go to in Manitou Springs, too! What do you think?!

Hmmmm….I would say my favorite subject in school was Language Arts.  I enjoyed learning about nouns, pronouns, adjectives, adverbs, etc.  It seems like schools today focus very little on these types of things.  I remember subbing in a 5th grade class for three months at the beginning of the school year this year.  I was trying to review adjectives, nouns, pronouns, verbs, etc. and the students were clueless.  I remember having to diagram sentences in high school…like the sentence –> The dog walked slowly across the yard.  We would have to identify each word(s) in the sentence!  The (article) dog (noun/subject) walked (verb) slowly (adverb) across the yard (prepositional phrase).  It was fun back then, but now I have to review myself since we don’t do it in the classrooms anymore.  (Math is so different today, too – I have to review all this ""new math"" stuff.)

Well, I went to Taco Bell last night.  This was where you and I had our last lunch together on September 23, 2000.  Remember?  I looked across at the table I think we sat at on that Saturday afternoon.  I remember you got a chill and I went outside to the van to get your coat.  I helped you put it on and you said, ""Thanks, Mom.""  We were eating lunch together and having a great mom and son time.  I never thought it would be our last time eating out together.  I NEVER thought that you would be gone in less than 24 hours…  In my mind, I could see you still sitting there with me..full of excitement, loving your tacos, and only 9 years old.  In my mind, you will always be 9 years old…
The Taco Bell has been remodeled, but I think the table we sat at is still there.  I remember we were sitting close to the door and there is a table still there.  The table we sat at.  Tears are rolling down my face writing this, Jake.  I once had  a dream that you were in the hospital and coming home.  I was so excited!  I thought for a brief moment that your loss was all a dream, then I woke up….  Why do dreams play games with us?  I hate it!
So, I sat there –  alone eating a burrito supreme and a regular taco..drinking a cup of water…thinking about us.  If I really enjoyed fast food, I would try to escape often to Taco Bell and ""go back in time"" to that afternoon you and I had so much fun together.  I am not crazy about fast food and I don’t need to go to Taco Bell to think about you, Jake.  I miss you and it still hurts.  I didn’t ""lose it with tears"" last night; maybe because ""getting lost in thoughts of a happy time"" were good.  I watched a family with their kids and their kids’ friends.  They were eating and having a great time.  There was a boy about your age.  He liked Taco Bell, too.
I don’t know much about life, but I know one thing…life is not fair, Jake.  I love you and miss you.  Your birthday came and went and I wonder how many people realize how much we miss you.  You would have been 20 years old on Earth.  I wonder what you would be doing now.  Would you have followed your brother and sisters into the Air Force?  Would you be in college?  I doubt that!  You never liked school and it was such a struggle for you.  I held you back in 3rd grade and you really ""turned yourself around"".  I think you needed to have been held back in Kindergarten like your teacher suggested.  I wish I would have done that even though your Dad detested that idea.  He was not crazy about me holding you back in 3rd grade until he realized how you ""excelled"" in school that year.  You were in a new school and off to a good start.  You made many new friends.  Then ""poof!""; the accident happened and you were gone.  You were in school three weeks and your friends greatly missed you.  The empty desk…I have the empty bedroom.  Your bedroom is now where I spend alot of my time on school work.  I think of you as I look out the window.  You had such a great view from your bedroom window.  You will always be in our hearts, Jake.  We miss you more than we can say…Leo Sayer says it so well…

How can you tell who reads your OD regularly?  I never know who reads me unless they note me.  Is there an easy way to find if Tom Thumb reads my OD.  Of course Tom Thumb is just an example diarist – not real to my knowledge.

Don’t worry about the last entry.  I was just curious if you could tell who reads your OD.  I don’t need to block anyone.  If I want to share with my faves – I make my entry for faves only.
My ""Dear Jake"" entry was a bit emotional for me and my readers, but sometimes, I need to write out my feelings.  It has been 10 years and my heart is still 4eversad without my son.
However, on a good note, I had a super sub day today.  I was at an elementary school located on the US Air Force Academy.  Today was also the graduation at the Academy for the class of 2011 so I was able to watch the Thunderbirds do their spectacular flyover.  They flew directly over the school!  OMG!  It was so exciting.  The kids were were very excited and waving!  I was the PE teacher; I love subbing as a PE teacher!  The kindergarten class and the 3rd graders went outside with me to watch the aerial show.  It was absolutely breath-taking!  The entire school was outside enjoying the sunny weather and the air show.  
Tomorrow I have a workshop hosted by Troops to Teachers at the local university, UCCS.  Friday is the last day to sub for this school year.
Georgia….I am coming home!  I won’t be catching a train, but I am going home…

This past Fall, I took a job as a long term sub in a low income school. The area the school was located in was nothing to write home about. I never knew that I should be walking out ""escorted"" at night. Apparently, it was a BAD neighborhood.
The students were 5th graders and they were nothing to write home about either. It started out very difficult, but in the end, the students and I had ""connected"" and it was difficult to walk away from them in December. I became very attached to them and knew them all when I left that school. I did tell them to invite me back to their graduation. 
I never heard from that homeroom class again. So I took it upon myself as a ""mission"" to attend their graduation. So, I slipped into the gym on that day and took a seat in the back row. They came in, all dressed in their ""Sunday best"" attire. As they lined up in the staging area, I noticed them checking out the audience. Then a group of them whispered, looked in my direction, and gave a little wave. I gave a small wave back and their faces lit up and they beamed at me. They knew I came back for their big day. 
It was awesome to see the awards those students earned on their last day of school. The principal and assistant principal were glad to see me there. They said the kids would be so excited to see me there…and they were. Several students came up to me during the reception to tell me thanks for coming to their graduation. I also was asked to pose for some pics with some students while their parents snapped a picture of us. One parent said, ""He wants a picture with you"". Wow, had I known that, I would have worn my ""Sunday best"" outfit…lol.
The best moment was when ""H"" appeared. He was looking ""sharp"" in his outfit: nice slacks, long-sleeved maroon button up shirt tucked in with a belt, tie, etc. His mohawk was braided nicely. He came up to me and said, ""Hi Ms. S. Thanks for coming."" I smiled, congratulated him, and gave him a hug. ""H"" once told me in class that he wanted to grow up and go to prison. He also told me that his Mom was worried about him because most of the sons in his extended family were dead. I am guessing this was all gang related. He told me that he was his Mom’s only son and was born on her birthday which made him a double blessing. I took a moment that day to listen to him. I told him that I worried about him like his mother. I told him I did not want to ever see his Mother experience the loss of a son because it is so painful. I looked into his eyes and said, ""H, I lost my little boy in 3rd grade. He never made it to 5th grade."" He asked me what happened and I told him Jake’s story. ""H"" and I ""connected"" in a different way that day. As much as he was ""Mr. Tough Guy"", he changed and the rest is history. 
What I learned in this long term sub assignment was:  Academics are very important, but caring about your students, taking time to listen to their stories is almost more important than the academics.  Baking them cookies and planning parties for them is something they need, too.  Students need to feel that ""someone cares"" about them when life is going crazy around them.  Sometimes you need to be ""real"" when trying to function in such an ""unreal"" world.  I would cringe if I had to walk through their neighborhood at night, but I know ""H"" would have my back.  Being a sub is a very ungrateful job, but this assignment reminds me of what life really is about….I don’t know if I will ever get my own classroom, but this journey has been interesting…

I watched a NETFLIX movie, Marie Antoinette. Wow! This was a PBS documentary and it was awesome. People actually narrated the movie in French (with subtitles). I think this movie told a bit too much personal information. In a nutshell, Marie’s Mom was Queen of Austria – Queen Teresa. Queen Teresa had 16 children, Marie Antoinette was the 15th. Anyway, to gain power, Queen Teresa married her daughters off to her advantage. She sent Marie off to France to marry young prince Louie (future King of France – King Louie XVI). They got married when Marie was 14 and Louie was 15. They were just kids! The movie detailed too much about the marriage bed and Louie’s problem producing a heir. (I would think with all eyes on the bed it would be difficult for anyone to consummate their marriage within the first 5 years!)It took 7 years to produce a heir. Marie had 4 children – 2 boys and 2 girls. Anyway, the movie told the story of the downfall of King Louie and Marie. It was very sad, but it was moving story. 2 of Marie’s children died of illness at very young ages. Her last son died in prison at the age of 10 and his sister was able to return to Austria. I think kids would like history more if we incorporated movies. This would not be a good movie to show, too much sexual discussion throughout the movie.
I also enjoyed watching The Lost Prince. This is the story of King George V’s epileptic son, Johnny. He was sent away so as not to disgrace the royal family. He had a wonderful nanny! I was not ready for the tragic ending; it caught me off-guard.
I don’t know why I have taken such an interest in these historical movies, but I really enjoy them! Young Victoria was a wonderful, romantic story. She was Queen of England at a very young age (18, I think I recall) and married Prince Albert from Germany. You learn alot about royalty and politics in this movie! 
I think after watching The King’s Speech, I became hooked on these historical flicks.
Did you watch the news showing O’Bama at the State Dinner in England? He made an etiquette error when he toasted the Queen and lifted his glass first. It was one socially awkward moment, but he recovered well – so smooth!
Have a great 3-day weekend and remember our troops on Memorial Day as often as you remember flip your meat on the grill.

My son and his family came over to grill dinner with me yesterday.  I think the most precious thing in the world is to see my three year old granddaughter standing at my front door yelling, ""Gramma!  Let me in!  Do you want to play hide and seek with me?!""  OMG!  She is so sweet.  So you know what we did while my son and his wife were grilling….yep..playing hide and seek!  I tried so hard to pretend that I could not find her even though the blanket on her bed was moving and giggling noises were coming out from under it…lol.  
""Let’s make a tent Gramma!"" was the next thing on our agenda.  So we built a tent inside then moved the blanket to the deck.  Picture this:  A pink blanket draped over the patio chairs and table and a little voice inside says, ""I love you Gramma.""  She and I were both sitting under the tent on a bath rug, she called our ""couch"".  She jumped into my lap, gave me a great big hug and said, ""I love you Gramma.""  I hugged her tight and said, ""I love you, too.""  She smiled from ear to ear and then said, ""Tell me a story, Gramma.""  Wow!  She keeps me busy so I told her a story about a Gramma and little girl making a tent outside.  
Unconditional love is so rare, but when you experience it; it is AWESOME.  I love you, Isabella and am so excited you are coming to spend the night on Friday night.  I will plan some adventures for us!
P.S.  The interesting thing is that my soulmate is back in town this week and my weekend is already booked with Isabella!  I KNOW where my priorities lie!

When I read your entries about Sharon, I thought of this song:
http://www.youtube.com/watch
I can really relate to this song when I talk to my soulmate.    ""What if’ questions always come to mind, but I cherish our conversations and ‘looking back in our rearview mirrors’.  We had dinner last night on the deck at my place and we talked about alot of different things.  This makes great conversation, too!  I wonder about a lot of things, but I know for sure that had we ""hooked up back then"" we would be sharing life together today..still…..but now I am too scarred and too afraid to make another ""commitment"" to anyone…
I just hope you can find Sharon and share great memories and let her know how much you really felt for her long ago and how much you FEEL for her today.  Sometimes..we have to say the things that mean so much to those special people.  Things left unsaid…well…will never be noted…do you know what I mean?
Sharon, if you are out there in OD Land reading this…find ‘The Voice Inside’; he has something important to tell you.  His voice is held captive locked inside his heart; you have the key, Sharon.  Release his voice and free him to find you.  True love, I think, only comes around once in your life.  Grab it!  Hmmm…this sounds like a future episode for Dr. Phil – ""Blast from the Past: Where are You Today?""
I have bookmarked you.

Hello World! I went to the circus today and it was truly ""The Greatest Show on Earth""! It was my first time to see Ringling Brothers Circus. It was AMAZING. My granddaughter and her parents enjoyed it, too. A performer fell from high above, but it was announced that he was receiving excellent care, in good spirits, and would return.
Nothing else is going on. I have been enjoying summer break. I filed for unemployment again. I applied for 17 jobs last week so I have met my job contacts for 3+ weeks now. I have to make at least 5 contacts/week. I had to apply for all these jobs up front because they all closed on 8 Jun. I am sure they have been ""filled from within"", but what else is new. On the job front, I think it would be fun to be a vendor at the World Arena. It is a people job and I like people. I think it would be fun to work at the circus, too!
My grandson is now 13 lbs, 23 inches long. He is in the 97th percentile for his growth. He is sure growing!
I SKYPED with my daughter from Iraq this past week. It sure looked hot over there. 
Soul mate was in town the first week of June. I really don’t have much to write about that other than dinner was nice. We had Chinese one night and steak another night. We ate at my place one night. We saw the movie ""Water for Elephants"" and I enjoyed that. 
I enjoyed the sleepover with my granddaughter. (I bet you thought I was going to say my soulmate…lol!) I took her to her first movie, Gnomeo and Juliet. It was fun movie. I would like to buy it when it is available on DVD.
This is my month of medical catching up: Dentist, Doctor, Mammogram..etc. I think next year, I will spread them out throughout the year! I did not plan on getting a Hepatitis A shot and that hurt! Found out I was low on Vitamin D so I got some Vitamin D3 chews from GNC. My cholesterol is a little high (total cholesterol is 209 and they would like it to be under 200) but not life threatening so I am taking fish oil pills – OMG! It is like swallowing baby sardines whole! I am also taking Niacin to see if it will raise my good cholesterol. 
I hope you all see yourselves in the mirror tomorrow; if so, that is a good sign! 
I watched ""Last Chance Harvey"" last night on DVD. I had never heard of that movie before. It was cute. I bought a few DVDs (used) to add to my collection. That was one of them. I also bought ""Before Sunset"". It seems interesting. It is about ""what iffing"" a relationship from the past. I thought it fits well in my life at the moment. I also bought ""Lars and the Real Woman"". This is such a funny movie. I saw it long ago. It is about a quirky guy that purchases a mail order doll. He has her sleep at his brother’s house to ‘respect’ her…lol. It is so funny – you should watch it sometime. I might send this copy to my daughter in Iraq; it would liven up things in the desert. It is a clean, fun movie, too.
I also baked 6 dozen raisin oatmeal cookies and sent them to my daughter in Iraq. Her friend requested some. I also sent her some ""food"" since she is not crazy about eating MREs (Meals Ready to Eat). MREs come in a can and look like dog/cat food. You have to be starving to enjoy them. You also need a good imagination before you put it into your mouth – visualize it as a nice steak in a different form…and texture…lol.
P.S. When my soulmate and I went out for Chinese, these are the fortunes that fell from our cookies:
(His) Do what you love and the necessary resources will follow.
(Mine) Everything is possible; just not so probable.
Interesting, huh?
Anyway, I think I am going to watch ""Before Sunset"" and have nightcap – Rum and Coke.
Why is life so hard to understand?  I think because life makes us study it (life) harder, right?  I am so ""studied out"" nowadays.  
I have been waking up like someone ""beat me the tar out of me"" in my sleep.  I sometimes ache from my shoulders upward and my head aches like someone has pulled my hair!  What is up with this?  I don’t even dream about fighting!!  I am getting paranoid that I am ill with something…it only bothers me first thing in the morning.  Maybe I need a stronger night cap – something with whiskey in it?

This was an interesting and deep movie.  It ended abruptly and left you to decide what happened in the end.  In a nutshell, this guy and girl met 9 years ago in France.  They agreed to meet again in 6 months; it never happened.  He got married and wrote and book about her.  He was in Paris for a book signing and guess who was at the bookstore?!  Yes…and the story picks up from there.  You will relate to some of the ""lines"" in this movie.  How many of us have had a relationship long ago only to wonder about it later…if things had been different…?

Today I had to go to the dentist to get my teeth cleaned.  I missed my last 6 month appointment so I felt like I went through the ""deluxe teeth wash""!  I have a great dentist.  It is a family owned business.  The father tried to retire, but business is so good – so he keeps getting called back from retirement.  I saw him, Dr. Ray, today.  He is such a wonderful man.  I will never forget his tender words after my little boy passed away in a tragic go cart accident.  He is just a sensitive, wonderful person.  His son is a dentist, too, and two of his daughters run the front office.
My first experience going to a civilian dentist after leaving the military was quite the experience!  In the military, you are herded in like cattle.  In the civilian world, they treat you like a person.  So I have been going to the same dentist since about 1993 – a very LONG time.  I don’t even live in the same neighborhood anymore and drive 13 miles to see him twice a year for cleaning and anything else that comes up.  
I fixed a crock pot of northern beans today.  I threw in a couple ham hocks, some seasoning, and let them cook.  I fixed some corn bread to go with it and had a nice dinner.  I took some beans and bread to my neighbor, too.  She is always feeding me delicious homemade Mexican food – complete with home-made tortillas.
Tomorrow son and family are coming over for a BBQ.  I have some steaks marinating in the fridge.  My son loves to grill so we will have nice dinner tomorrow night.  I will provide all the food and he will be the griller!
I heard the circus performer who fell 30 feet on Saturday (we were there!  My son heard the man’s body hit the pad – a very thin pad) was released from the hospital yesterday.  The news reported that he was only bruised.  He was very lucky and blessed!
I need to get motivated to dig up one of my sprinkler heads and clean it out.  It quit rotating.  It is such a job to dig up a sprinkler head, but is so much cheaper than calling a sprinkler company!  Maybe tomorrow I will get ambitious and start digging.
I remember the last time I saved money and did some work on my own.  I replaced a part in the dryer and the dishwasher.  OMG!  It was a chore, but the parts were a fraction of what the service call would have been.  I recently replaced the governor spring on my lawn mower; it was easy.  Is this why people get married?  To have someone help with the ""honey do"" list?  Well, I think I am fine learning how to fix all these things.  It sure is cheaper than getting married, too!  
I can’t imagine having to share my bed with someone after almost 17 years!  I like the whole bed to belong to me!  If I got married, I would never sleep because the movement in the bed would wake me up. (You thought I would say something else, right?! – OK – let’s get our minds where they belong…lol). Additionally, marriage requires planning elaborate dinners and that is too much work, too!  On the other hand, I know some very happily married people and I admire them.  I tried it once and I didn’t get it right the first time.  I decided not to try again.  Both my brothers have been married and divorced twice.  I think it must be in our genes..what do you think?

So today I made a ""Shower Bucket"" for my daughter in IRAQ.  She needed something to carry her bath items in on the trek to the shower mod.   She has been using a plastic bag.  So in my infinite wisdom, I bought a two gallon plain white paint bucket at Home Depot.   I then picked up some interesting craft stuff from Joann Fabric.  I was quite proud of my creation.  I will post pictures soon!  Now, I have to find a box to put it in.  It needs to be an 11"" by 11"" square box. 
What is a good site to upload pictures so I can link to this entry?
Also, went to spend time with my granddaughter while her Mom went to a Dr. appointment.  We played outside in the pool and with the water hose.  Then we played hide and seek.  I ended up staying for dinner with the family and giving my granddaughter a bath.  She is so cute!  She never wants me to leave!  Where else can you get that kind of unconditional love?  
My son and I are planning to take my granddaughter fishing at one of the local ""stocked"" ponds soon.  I know she will absolutely love catching several fish!  This will give her Mom some much needed rest.  This will be another photo opportunity!
Tomorrow we are off to the park to play in the fountain.  My granddaughter wanted me to wear my swimming suit!  OMG!  I told her someone might know me at the park…lol.  So anyway, we will have fun.  We always do.
Note for the Voice Inside:  Do you need a lesson on installing sprinkler heads?  It will move you up a notch on the manly man scale.  And…you DON’T drink coffee?!  Hmmm…you are fun to spar with on leaving notes…lol.

So I mailed the shower bucket with some other goodies enclosed, too.  The people at the post office thought I may have started a ""new thing"" and might be getting orders from Iraq for shower buckets!  Wow – then I would not have to teach anymore?!  It sounded kinda exciting.  I could name my business ""Buckets 2 Go""..lol.  I would sure like to make a personal bucket for The Voice Inside and you will never guess what I would put in his bucket…!  Don’t you just love his cute notes?  He keeps me in stitches.  Go visit his diary and cheer him up.  He is having ""Divorced Man Blues"" or is it ""Post-Divorce Depression""?  He needs to celebrate and leave some more entertaining notes to others in OD land.
So next, I had to get a mammogram.  I cannot even describe this experience today.  Let’s just say that if my nipple would have popped off due to the pressure – it would have felt like a weapon of mass destruction to whatever got in its path.  OMG!  I wish men could experience this with an important appendage on their body.  ""Sir, place your manhood in this vice grip and hold your breath and don’t move""!  
After returning from the mammo, I was called for a last minute job interview.  So of course, I went.  I drove through a rainstorm to get there.  All went well and I was able to get the committee of four to let their guards down and laugh a little.  They wanted to know a little about me.  So I told them I changed careers to be a teacher and ""make a difference"".  I told them I left defense contracting because it was ""feast or famine"" in that industry.  I told them I entered teaching at a bad time and have not ""feasted"" yet – still in the ""famine""…lol…no jobs.  Anyway, I felt the interview went really well.  They worked their schedules to work me in since I was unavailable during the time they had open – so that is a good sign…I hope.  They gave me an opportunity to ask questions so I was bold.  I told them my daughter was in Iraq and would be returning to her home base in Germany in November.  I told them I made plans to go over to visit her.  The Assistant Principal really supported me on this and told me no administrator would have a problem with this.  So…maybe I am ""in""?  Or ""out"".  She explained how I would have paid time off – so maybe this is a hint of something good?  She said she would call me on Monday afternoon…whether I got the job or not.  So, I like this honest up-front approach.
Later this afternoon, another school called to give me the dreaded ""pre-screening phone interview"".  This is Level 1.  She said I would hear back if I made it to Level 2.  Whatever!  She asked me a couple questions – very broad, but I answered them.
To wrap up the day, I watched ""Legends of the Fall"".  It is an old movie, but my son loaned it to me.  Awesome movie!
Now..it is time to wrap up the day and get ready for tomorrow.  I am thinking of taking a drive up to Green Mountain Falls tomorrow to check out ""Gazebo Lake"".  It is supposed to be a picturesque place to fish or hang out.  I want to take my granddaughter fishing.  If it looks promising at the Lake, I will tell my son and we will go fishing there soon!
Maybe I can post a picture or two later when I return from my adventure.

I have decided to rename my OD to match my personalized license plates on my car. I have had personalized plates in Jake’s memory for a long time. My new OD name will be J8XMOM (Jake’s Mom). What do you think? 
So today was a lazy day. I took my granddaughter to the park and played with her for about a half hour. Can I tell you how much FUN we always have together?! Then her Mom picked her up to take her to swimming lessons. A good friend called me when I got home so I never made it out to Curves. It was such a nice cool day that I took a nice long nap…oh the joys of living alone and having a carefree, uninterrupted nap…sigh.
So I never made it out to venture over to Green Mountain Falls. Tomorrow that is the first thing on my agenda. I will probably be on the road between 7 and 9 am. I will swing by Starbucks and grab my favorite ""cup of Joe"" to sip on along the way. 
Did I tell you that a good friend from my defense contracting days chatted with me on the phone recently? She is bringing me a gift card that she got but has no desire to use—> a STARBUCKS card! OMG! I will certainly enjoy using that this summer. I will stretch it out as long as I can!

…to all the Fathers out there and to those that are not here to celebrate with us anymore.  I miss you, Daddy!
My Daddy and I were very close.  He always called me ""Chick"" and was so happy to see me when I would come home on leave from the military.  I have his outgoing personality and great sense of humor.  My Mom always tells me ""You are just like your Daddy"".  What a compliment!  However, I don’t have his beautiful blue eyes or fair skin and red hair.  I took my Mom’s Asian genes in that area – darker skin, brown eyes, dark hair (but now I am silvery white and I LOVE it!).  I starting becoming a little salt and pepper in my early 20s.  Then I was talked into coloring my hair when I was in my 30s.  Now I am authentic and a very confident woman!  
So…I took a Motrin PM so I could sleep soundly and not be restless and as usual I slept late!  I woke up about 30 minutes ago.  I am normally up before 0600!  I woke up at 0730ish!
So now I am off for my adventure to Gazebo Lake.  I love you all and will report back in on my findings!  First stop –> Starbucks!
Have a wonderful Father’s Day!

Isabella is 3 and Austin was ""brand new"" in this picture.  I was holding him shortly after he came into the world….

It was beautiful at Gazebo Lake in Green Mountain Falls today!  OMG!  There were so many people fishing.  I talked to some children and they said they caught some fish!  I didn’t ask to see them, but the kids were having a blast today.  I will definitely be going back with my son and his daughter.  We are giving his wife a day to rest and relax at home; she is due with their son in August.  I hope you enjoy the pictures!  There are nice places around the lake to eat out, too!  If I had someone along with me to eat with, I would have eaten there, too!

It is 53 degrees in CO Springs!  It is quite brisk outside today.  Am I complaining? NEVER!  I would take CO weather over any hot, humid day!  We got some rain last night and we needed it!  It is windy and chilly outside at the moment.  
I just got off the phone with my little brother.  He is an ACE certified auto tech (they don’t use the word mechanic these days…) and we chatted about working in our own business.  He really would like to have his own business.  We discussed options.  I think we should open a BBQ’d pulled pork sandwich joint.  I love people and he loves drinking!  He thinks we need to get a liquor license so we can sell liquor.  He thinks we need a tobacco license to sell cigarettes, too.  Heck..I just want to cook and visit with the customers.  I think we should call our joint ""Park and Pork"".  What do you think?!  I am not crazy about the liquor and cigs.  I don’t really drink or smoke, but I know people will always drink, smoke, and eat!  I guess we could have a combo meal like:
Pulled Pork Sandwich
Chips or Fries
Coke or Beer
$5 or $8 (depending on the beer brand)
I miss my family in Georgia.  I am headed there soon.  After being there a a couple days, I miss the CO cool weather.

So I picked up this movie at Walgreens today.  Yeah, I know it is an OLD movie, but I have never watched it!  OK – give me a break; I was busy raising four kids and making a living back then…lol.  However, I did enjoy the movie!  I can almost relate to it – almost.
I have been hanging out at home today.  I did go out to pick up a few groceries; I can’t eat cereal without milk, right?  I did go to workout at Curves.  I always have fun at Curves.  No men allowed in there so it is fair game to talk about them….lol.
I didn’t get the job.  How tacky is it that they sent an email and did not call?  
EDIT:
I would like to thank you for your time and for your interest in _______.
The interviews have concluded and the committee has selected another applicant to fill the Educational Assistant position.
I wish you the best in your quest, and hope that if the future opens another door that you will keep _______in mind.
Oh well, when God shuts a window, he opens another one somewhere along the way.  It was raining today so he didn’t open any…lol.  So can you explain exactly what that last line meant?  I am clueless!  EDIT:  If the future opens another door — in their school?  Like I would like to be slapped twice?!
I looked at plane tickets to go home to God’s country – AKA Georgia.  Ouch!  Not cheap!  I am still planning a trip home…regardless of flights.  I still could not drive back there cheaper than air fare since gas is pricey.  Factor in food and motels along the way and flying is cheaper and I can also stay longer.
Fixing some dinner at the moment.  Having leftovers but I needed to make some fresh steamed rice – not that fake stuff like Uncle Ben’s or Minute Rice – bleah!
I am so torn about this trip to Georgia.  I want to stay until 30 Jul but I don’t want to miss my grandson’s arrival.  He is due on 5 Aug but my daughter in law is measuring two weeks ahead.  What do you think?  I can always see him when I come back, right?  She has parents and a sister here to help out, too.  It is not like I am assisting in his delivery.  The bottom line is that my Mom is 86 years old and I want to go home and spoil her again with shopping trips, outings, cooking, housework assistance, etc.  I think I just convinced myself to go and stay the three weeks!  It is not like I am going to get offered a job, right?  I can always check my voicemail and respond to job opportunities.  OK – my mind is made up: http://www.youtube.com/watch

I am being quiet and waiting for my daughter to SKYPE me from Iraq.  It is almost 7am and everyone else is asleep over here.  (I have to figure out how to turn off this Godzilla looking creature on my dining room table.  It is one of Isabella’s toys.  He has been screeching since early this morning!  He is quite frightful to Gramma!  Isabella took him into the tub last night before we figured out he was ""electronic"".  When we took him out, he no longer made noise.  I guess he is dried out now and is ready for action!)  
EDIT x2:  Added creature picture and park pics:

My granddaughter and her Mom spent the night with me last night.  My son is working out of town.  I invited the girls over for dinner and a movie.  We had an easy dinner – Digiorno Supreme Pizza.  Then we got dessert from the DQ!  Yum.  Before dinner, I took my granddaughter to the park while her Mom had a doctor appointment.  We had a blast.  Her Mom picked us up so we didn’t have to walk the mile home 🙂  
I watched Lars and the Real Girl last night with my DIL.  It is such a fun movie!  I was exhausted when I crawled into bed at 1130pmish.
My DIL is a professional stylist and I asked her to trim my hair or give me a new ""doo"" since the job interviews are perking up again.  I need to trim up the shaggy appearance…lol.  I will have a new look soon!  I want a layered, textured ""look"".  She also offered to add some jazzed up color, but I dare not!  I cannot ruin my new ""confident"" woman look…lol.  It would be nice to have some jazzy color on my white, silvery hair – like some maroon highlights, red, blue…but I am so past that now.  That was my look ""back in the day""….I have such a vibrant personality that I could pull that off really well.  Now that I am a teacher – I have to be more ""tame"" with the whole hair deal…boring..but necessary.
I will check in later.  Have a great Wednesday!
Edit:  Breakfast was delightful.  We had sausage links, scrambled eggs, and blueberry muffins.  We also were able to SKYPE with my daughter in Iraq.  She looked so sunburned!  I guess that desert heat is sweltering!  She seemed sad to see us and not be able to be with us.  Isabella made her laugh alot.  I had to feed Isabella because she was too distracted to feed herself; I am not complaining!  Every moment with her is delightful.  I would have posted a picture of us, but I went to bed with wet hair and I was having a ""crazy hair day""…lol.  Also, all I had on was a night shirt that says ""Motherhood:  The strongest tranquilizer available without a prescription"" and my favorite fleece mixed-matched socks!  I don’t think I would want the world to look at me like that!  However, I DID go outside to buckle Isabella in her carseat to get ready for the rest of her day.  Her Mom has a hair client this morning.  I am sure the neighbors were talking about me!  Lol…hey..at least I am interesting..right?!  I must go now and tackle the kitchen cleanup.  I guess I do get lonely living alone and live for and LOVE cooking for company!  You all should come over sometime for breakfast!

I am feeling bummed again…I guess it is the unemployment blues settling in.  I am sure once I go to Georgia I will be very busy with family.  I just got to get there!  I can’t decide if I want to drive or fly.  The ticket is about $500, but gas, motels, and food will probably add up quick on a road trip.  However, I thought it would be so much fun to stay in KOA cabins when I stay overnight somewhere.  The KOA Kampers are such wonderful people!  Decisions…decisions…decisions…
Today I made a decorative bucket for Isabella.  She loved the shower bucket I made for my daughter.  I was working on hers while I was cooking breakfast – French Toast with sausage links.  I found some fun things to put in there, too!  
I have a headache, too!  I think it is the suppressed UEH – UnEmployment Headache.  I am starting to doubt launching into a teaching career.  It has not been a marketable skill since I have been looking almost four years ago.  
I had a pre-screening interview on Friday; can I tell you how much I hate those?!  Next time they call, I think I will tell them ""It isn’t a good time at the moment.  I have company.  Can you call back in September?..You know…the kids came back home with their families and children and problems…etc.""…lol. So how do you answer a question like:  What qualifies you to teach 4th grade?  Hmmmmm….well…I am licensed in the state of Colorado.  My endorsement is in Elementary.  I sub in four school districts and have subbed in 4th grade…I student taught in 5th grade and I enjoy intermediate students…""  The voice on the other end says, ""Is there anything else you would like to share?""  OMG!  I so wanted to say ""I am on the ""No-Call"" list and I don’t field calls from solicitors…!""..lol.  Heck!  I think I will volunteer in a homeless shelter and tutor the children there.  At least THAT is rewarding and appreciated.  What is a Sub? Chopped Liver?!  I am NOT answering and district calls today!
OK – now I have told you all how I really feel.  Next…I might go to  a movie today and chill.

Wow – yesterday was a real downer.  I stayed home all day..just moping around..applied for a couple jobs on-line…watched useless daytime TV – like Maury – OMG….etc.  I finished watching a NETFLIX movie ""Welcome to the Rileys""…OMG…how did I ever pick that one out!  It was about a couple who lost their only child in a car accident when she was 15.  Their lives really took a dump…which I can personally attest to as being ""typical"".  Anyway, the Dad meets this young stripper and tries to be a ""father"" to her and his wife joins in on the scene…and it was so difficult to watch.  Anyway, I would not recommend this flick.  Moral to the story:  You can’t change a stripper…
Today I am going to Starbucks to ready the Friday paper and see what is going on in the Springs for the weekend.  Next, I will run some errands and go have a workout at Curves.  In the afternoon, I think I am going to watch a movie.  My choices are:
1.  Mr. Popper’s Penguins (Jim Carey flick)
2. Bad Teacher (Cameron Diaz)
3. Midnight in Paris (Owen Wilson flick)
4. Tree of Life (Brad Pit flick)
5. The First Grader (documentary about an 84 year old student who wants to learn to read..takes place in Kenya..)
So – no time to feel depressed!  I might even confirm my plane ticket to GA today.  
I also made my granddaughter a decorative bucket yesterday.  She loved the one I made for my daughter.  I will post pics soon.
Oh!  I need to get the batteries out of the Godzilla creature; he started screeching at me again yesterday and scared me!  So..got to dismantle him and put new batteries in him.
Dear Depression, I do not have time for you 2day!  I don’t take Cymbalta to fight you, but my Starbucks will be a great option to meds.  So go away!
I heard this on Maury yesterday:
Girl comedian to secret crush guy:  Your ex is such a ""hoe"" that when she gets a Christmas card with ""Ho, Ho, Ho"" in it, she takes it personally!
Girl comedian to secret crush guy:  Your ex was such an ugly baby, her parents sat her in the corner of a room and used a shot gun to shoot food at her to feed her.
Yea, when depression strikes – don’t watch TV too long…lol.

So, first I would like to post the pics of the bucket I made for my granddaughter.  I met her and her Mom for lunch today and brought the bucket with me.  She loved it!  I tucked some surprises inside for her, too:  Princess wand, fairy slippers, lots of beaded necklaces, sand molds (to take with us to the park!), pink purse, and some plastic garden tools to play in the sand with on our next park outing.  Can I say what a big hit it was for her?!  OMG!  This is the only thing that made me happy yesterday -> being creative and making Isabella a surprise.  Tell me what you think of this bucket.  I have one more to make to send to Iraq – another shower bucket for my daughter’s friend, Kendall.  I am going to surprise her for her bday in August.  Her own family never writes her.  So I have adopted a daughter—>like I need another one with raging hormones…lol.  They are easier to maintain when they are several countries away…lol.

I went to Starbucks, had my Chai and read the paper.  I went to Curves for a morning workout.  I had a nice Chinese lunch with my DIL and Isabella….my fortune cookie revealed:  Do not underestimate yourself.  Human beings have unlimited potential.  (My interpretation:  I will get the teaching job that God wants me to have.  He is going to make it a good ""fit"" for me.)  I think I should buy a lottery ticket today, too, and play the numbers from my Chinese fortune.  There are six numbers – just the right amount to play the Lottery or Powerball!  Wish me luck and if I win, I can volunteer to tutor and not worry about teaching!  
Next on my agenda – I am going to shower and get put together to go see ""Mr. Popper’s Penguins"".  Jim Carey was one of Jake’s favorite actors.  So…I am having a movie date with ""Jake"".
Thanks for all your nice notes.  If I didn’t have you in my life, I would REALLY be lonely :0
Off to the shower I go….

Update:  So I went to the 3:50pm showing of ""Mr. Popper’s Penguins"".  It was a delightful, fun movie.  There was a little romance, lots of humor, and penguins of course!  Yepper – this was a great choice in movies.  A friend asked me to wait to see ""Midnight in Paris"" with him.  So…I guess I will eventually see that movie.  At least I will have someone to share my popcorn with, right?!  The soundtrack for ""Mr. Popper’s"" was great, too!
So today was a totally ""all about me"" day.  I still need to go to the grocery store, but heck! I can do that tomorrow.  I picked up a Mighty Kid’s Meal from McDonalds for dinner tonite.  It sure is easier than cooking.  Of course, I collect the toys for Isabella.  Tonight her toy is a ""Liv"" girl..whatever the heck that is supposed to be.  It looks like some 21st Century ""independent woman doll""…lol.
Tomorrow is definitely the Walmart grocery store trip.  Then I get a new ""doo"" from my DIL and off to the water fountain in downtown Acacia Park with Isabella and DIL in the afternoon!

The Voice Inside thinks I need to get a ""mohawk"", but I don’t think that will go over very well in a teacher interview unless I take a job in Compton, CA – there I would blend in nicely…lol.  Heck – I would get a mohawk with fire engine red highlights if I worked in Compton!…lol.
So, do YOU have a ""mohawk"", The Voice Inside?
Now, I am going to rest and reflect upon my wonderful day!  I hope all y’all have a great weekend.  
I will be back in the morning to check on all of you.
P.S.  Who needs Cymbalta for depression?  I can tell people how to fight depression and have a blast!  The only meds I took for depression was Prozac.  The doctor prescribed it after Jake’s death.  It helped take the edge off, but after 6 months, I quit it altogether.  I realized Jake would never be coming home.  I got a lecture from the Doc for quitting it ""cold turkey"" without his supervision and direction.  I never thought I would live this long without my son, but life has proven me so wrong.  I guess I am here to collect alot of memories to bring to Jake when we see each other again…so we will have something to talk about…who knows..sigh…

Good Morning OD World!  It is Saturday! Yay!  Today I am going to the Uncle Wilbur Fountain with Isabella.  I am looking forward to her excitement with the other children.
Today I am going to put my computer away for the day. No more on-line job applications for me!  No more distractions hanging out on here all day.  I will miss you all, but I will return in the evening.  The computer is relocating to my office area in Jake’s room.  It has been on the kitchen table for most of this week.  
Have you ever heard of Angel Food Ministries?  If not, check out this link:
http://www.angelfoodministries.com/menus/menu_2011-07_en.asp
Angel Food Ministries is a food program you purchase through a local church at a huge $aving$!  I like it; it fills up my freezer and pantry with extra food at a super deal!  I have not purchased any in a couple months, but I am picking up a $35 box this morning.  I usually get the $46 box, but I still have so much food in my freezer!  I am also planning on purchasing a box when I go to GA to introduce my family to the great deal on grocery savings!  My family has to see it to believe it.  So I will purchase a July box and pick it up and bring it home to them.
Have a great Saturday and tell me all about it!
J8XMOM is signing off for the day and will return tonite to check on all of you.
P.S.  To clear the air, I DO NOT and have NOT taken Cymbalta.  I just referred to it as a depression med on my OD.  
Also, I am going to start making my entries ""friends only"" to avoid those weird notes with the weird links from posting on my OD.  They are sexual in nature and I am not going to allow that on my OD.   What do you think?

Here are pics from our trip to Uncle Wilbur’s Fountain. Isabella had a blast and so did I! She chased me around the fountain with a plastic cup full of water! She got me, too!

I told her we would come back again and bring a picnic lunch and large blanket for Gramma to spend the afternoon sitting and watching her. I will probably wear my suit under my clothes, too since she loves to soak Gramma! She loved jumping on my lap so I was fairly wet when I left the park, too!
I had my first experience eating a Chicago Style hot dog from Sonic yesterday. I am not a fan of hot dogs because of all the fat in them, however; this hot dog was delicious. I treated myself to an M&M Sonic Blast, too. Yum!
Today I have nothing on the agenda. I should cut my grass, but maybe I shouldn’t do that on Sunday? Maybe I will save it for tomorrow.
I bought my ticket to GA! Yay! I haven’t told anyone back there yet. I plan to write a letter and tell them about it in the end: P.S. I am coming home! I know my Mom will be thrilled and that is all that matters to me. 
Soul mate wanted to come visit me there; he lives in FL. I told him we would have to plan it out because I am so busy with my brothers, nieces, nephew, and Mom. When I am in GA – my family is my #1 Priority. Plus, soul mate has such an unpredictable schedule..so 4get it! I will still try to write in OD when I am home 🙂

Miss Beatrice, the church organist, was in her eighties and had never been married. She was admired for her sweetness and kindness to all. One afternoon the pastor came to call on her and she showed him into her quaint sitting room.  She invited him to have a seat while she prepared tea.  As he sat facing her old Hammond organ, the young minister noticed a cute glass bowl sitting on top of it. The bowl was filled with water, and in the water floated, of all things, a condom!  When she returned with tea and scones, they began to chat. The pastor tried to stifle his curiosity about the bowl of water and its strange floater, but soon it got the better of him and he could no longer resist.  
""Miss Beatrice,"" he said, ""I wonder if you would tell me about this?"" he said as he was pointing to the bowl.
""Oh, yes,’""she replied, ""Isn’t it wonderful?  I was walking through the park a few months ago and I found this little package on the ground. The directions said to place it on the organ, keep it wet and that it would prevent the spread of disease. Do you know I haven’t had the flu all winter.""

So today I went to the Kimball theater downtown. I saw the 2pm showing of ""The Tree of Life"" starring Brad Pitt and Sean Penn. It was definitely not what I expected it to be. It received great movie reviews, too! It was deep…very deep…too deep for my shallow mind…lol. In a nutshell, it was about life and death with breathtaking cinematography scenes. You should not fall asleep in this movie or you will get lost when you wake up. My friend fell asleep. She said she got confused during the movie. I didn’t tell her she slept through most of it. This is the second movie I have been out with her and she slept. The first time she SNORED! I guess I should not go to the movies with her. She doesn’t enjoy them because she sleeps through them! We also had another friend with us. After the movie, we went to the Olive Branch for appetizers.
At the moment, I am having a security system installed in my home. ADT has a great deal! They install a free system for advertising purposes. They advertise by putting a sign in your front yard. All I pay is the $40/month monitoring fee. If I sell my house, the system stays and the new owners pay an ""activation fee"" and a more expensive monitoring fee. When I move into a new house, I get a new system and pay only the $40/month monitoring fee. Sounded like a good deal to me! I called my son and he got one installed today, too! Normally, this setup costs about $1300 (without the monthly monitoring fee included!).  
Tomorrow I am going out to dinner with a friend – Texas Roadhouse!  I love the ribs and sweet potatoes there! 
Do you have anything in particular you would like me to write about next time?  You name it and I will write about it!

So I asked you what I should write about.  I rec’d some private and public notes with ideas.
1.  Write about my soul mate.  This would require some thought.
2.  Write a special story about Jake.  I have written so many at the beginning of my OD.
3.  Write about the day in the life of the ""Sprinkler Head Woman"".  One of my faves has given my that name.  This might bore you!
So..I am still thinking. 
My agenda today:  Cut the grass!
By the way, it was awesome to have a security system on last night!  Sometimes, when I get scared, I turn on the TVs up/downstairs.  Now, I have to remember to deactivate the system if I get up to get a glass of water in the middle of the night.
I remember how lighthearted I use to respond to friends who worried about me living alone.  I would tell them, ""Heck! If I get raped and he is ""good in bed"", I would tell him to come around at least twice a week when I am NOT teaching – like in the summer…lol.  I would get his business card and pass it on to my friends who need a boost in that area..lol.""  It was a Kodak moment when the Neighborhood Watch police officer heard me say that.  I quickly said, ""I am JUST kidding!""  Wow, some people just don’t have a sense of humor.  Loosen up, Officer!  Heck!  Who needs to be awake when I can be sleeping.  I would say, ""Get out of my bed and get a blow up doll!""

I am tired!  I went out with a friend for dinner tonite.  We talked quite awhile!  We left the Texas Roadhouse around 8:45pm and went to get dessert at Yo Yogurt.  It is a new place in town!  First time for me!  You choose from a large assortment of flavors and then add your toppings.  I was not too hungry so I got a little bit of the peanut butter yogurt and put Reece’s pieces on the top.  They charge 37 cents an ounce; my total was $2.11.  The cups are huge so I am sure it, alone, was a few ounces.  I enjoyed it.  My friend got the ""birthday cake"" yogurt topped with Reece’s pieces.  We sat outside until I could not stand it anymore.  It was windy and cold.  We talked about men and relationships…like I know anything about that stuff…lol.  Finally, I got so cold, we left.  So here I am, back in the safety of my home talking you guys again.
Tomorrow, I need to finish cutting my yard.  I got interrupted with a brief spit of rain – very brief.  However, I think it is going to rain a little bit tonite.  When the grass dries tomorrow, I will finish the backyard.  I got the the front mowed today.
I am so tired!  I think the carbs did me in.  I had the ""loaded"" sweet potato with my ribs at the Texas Roadhouse. .  I brought some ribs home with me, too Then the yogurt.  I am carbed out and tired.  My bed is calling me.  
Soul mate is going to Philly for the weekend.  He lives in FL.  He is visiting his daughter there.  He is always going somewhere; it tires me to think of his schedule.  I am glad I am on my own schedule.  I leave for GA on July 9th.  I am dreading the heat, but seeing my family is worth it!
So..where is The Voice Inside tonite.  I have not heard from him.  Maybe he has laryngitis and can’t talk.  OR maybe he found Sharon!

Wow! It is July already! Where does the time go?
I woke up ambitious today. I vacuumed up and downstairs, unloaded and reloaded the dishwasher, and call my family in GA to let them know I am coming home. My Mom was very happy to hear that. 
I have to still run the Bissel in a couple of areas to finish up the ""detailed"" cleaning. I also have to tackle the backyard with the mower – ugh!
On a better note, I finished watching ""Nowhere Boy"" – the formative years of John Lennon. It was sad. He was raised by his Aunt. His Mom was quite the ""hoe"". John was fathered by a military man. When he left, his Mom was not ""faithful"". She actually had another child while John’s dad was away. She had a daughter (Victoria) and who knows what happened to her. If it was not for John’s Aunt Mimi (his mother’s sister) who knows what would have happened to him, too! Anyway, John reconnected with his mother – she was married with two young daughters when he re-entered her life. She loved John. She was tragically killed while crossing a street and it devastated John. The movie ended with John leaving for Hamburg, Germany with his band, The Quarrymen. I would love to find the sequel to this movie! Apparently, John called his Aunt Mimi every week for the rest of his life.
So..you see, I do take breaks during the day for some entertainment.
Now, I have to head to the post office and mail pics of my grand kids to my Mom – the Great Gramma. I also have to take a moment to apply for my passport so I can be ready to leave for Germany when Becky returns from Iraq.
The backyard – OMG – I guess I will get it done, too. Before or after my Curves workout? Maybe after….no reason to get all dirty and sweaty in the yard and shower only to go workout and do it all over again – the sweaty part – not the dirty part.
I also wrote one of Becky’s friends in Iraq. Nobody writes her, so I adopted her as a pen pal. I got her first letter last week. She is one of six kids. She comes from a blended family. She has a 31 year old step-brother, 4 sisters that are 21, 19, 17, and 10. The 19 year old is her only ""real/blood"" sister. Her step brother has 3 girls. Her 21 year old step-sister is expecting. The one I am writing to is going to be 22 in August. So – I have to get her letter mailed today. I actually wrote to her today.
Anyway, this is my day so far – the life of a Sprinkler Head Woman Super Hero. I woke up at 6:15am today. I am enjoying sleeping in past 5am these days. I have also been known to take a nap in the afternoon occasionally :0 
It is now 2:09pm – I must get back to the grind….I need to fix some lunch, too!
Have a great Friday!

I had my granddaughter from about 1230 until now. Her Dad needed to do some yard work at his place and she wanted to come to my house. I had yard work to do, too! I can always do it tomorrow 🙂
We had fun. We had an early afternoon playing in the sprinkler. We came in for an ice-cream treat and a bath. She took an hour nap and we were busy again until now. Son and DIL picked her up. She is going to spend the night with me on Tuesday. She wanted to stay with me tonite but her Oma and Opa are coming to see her at her parents tomorrow. So – I will get her on Tuesday night…maybe Wednesday night, too! I am not sure. I still have to get things in order at home before I leave for 3 weeks.
We got another nice thunderstorm today, too! Isabella and I sat on the front porch in her tiny little chairs and watched it rain. There is nothing more peaceful than watching rain with your granddaughter. 
Well, I am whipped and need to wind down now. Have a great day off tomorrow! I will, too. Unemployed people have too many days off; I am one of them!

I was wide awake at 0530 today!  I tried to go back to sleep, but I was unsuccessful.  So here I am…getting letters and pics out to family and friends.  I am soon headed to the Post Office to buy stamps, weigh letters, etc. 
My son’s in-laws are coming over to his place for the 4th.  So, I am sure they will have a great time.
I am going to tie up loose ends here at home and start packing.  I want to be all packed before Friday because my son, Isabella, and I are going fishing on Friday afternoon.  (DIL gets the afternoon to rest and relax.)  We are going to Gazebo Lake!  I am excited.  I was teaching her how to cast an open-face reel yesterday.  She loved it!  My neighbor gave me a very small ice-fishing rod and reel to give to Isabella.  Isabella has a kids’ push button rod and reel.  She was asking me, while holding the ice-fishing rod and reel yesterday, ""Gramma, where is the button?""  She is just too cute!
Hopefully, I will get my yard work finished before I leave on Saturday.  I am SO dreading the heat and humidity in Georgia, but I am SO looking forward to visiting my family.
Have a great 4th of July today!
I have a hunch that I will not be able to collect unemployment.  The Department of Labor has called me twice to get more information.  I was hoping I could still collect from when I was laid off in May, 2010.  Because I have subbed for that district since then (including a four month Long Term Sub job Sep.-Dec.), the Department of Labor considers that ""reasonable assurance to return to that line of work"".  Ummm..ok.  Less headache for me making all these job contacts.  Can you believe that since the second week in June I have made almost 50 job contacts!?  And the results of those contacts?  No job offers.  Oh well…off to Georgia I go.  Heck!  I should bring my flash drive with all my teaching info (resume, letters of reference, license, etc.) and see what I can find in Georgia.  For now – I am more focused on going home to visit family.  As for work, I am very confident I will be busy subbing again starting in August.  Subbing keeps me busy 5 days a week, but it is not as rewarding as ""teaching"".  It is more like…babysitting the class while the teacher is away..ugh!   However, I have really honed my classroom management skills!

Good Morning World,
I am trying to still wake up!  I woke up around 4am and shut off my sprinklers.  I did not want them to turn on at 6am because we got a ""gullywasher"" yesterday.  I don’t like to waste water; it is expensive in Colorado Springs.  We are having such a drought.  
As I was lying awake in bed today and looking at the clock, I heard a big truck.  It was about 0815. I thought it might be the garbage truck.  So I jumped out of bed and threw some clothes on and starting hauling my trash to the curb.  I hope I didn’t miss him.  He is usually here mid- morning.  Then my son called and decided to go fishing in the morning to avoid getting ""rained out"".  OMG!  I have about an hour now to throw my lunch together, shower, and get dressed for my morning adventure.
I will write more later.

This guy goes into a bar with his pet monkey.  The monkey is eating powdered donuts.  He makes a mistake and swallows the cue ball – GULP!
Another day, the guy goes into the bar with his monkey.  The monkey is eating grapes and upsetting the bartender.  The bartender says, ""Sir, you have to get your monkey out of here.  He is grossing out my customers.  He is eating grapes.  First he sticks the grape in his butt, then he eats it.  It is upsetting all my customers."" The guys says, ""Oh!  He is just making sure that what he eats comes out of his butt easily.  Last time he swallowed a cue ball.""

I had a great day yesterday. I have adjusted to being home. I was up before 7am yesterday and did NOT nap all day! Went to bed around 10:30pm and was up at 6:37am this morning. 
Today I am taking my Mom to a Dr. appointment. 
I will fill you in later on the events of the day. I think I might go shopping for my niece’s bday today, too. I might bake her some cupcakes, too.
Edit: The Dr. appointment went well. Mom and I picked up treats from the DQ after the appointment. We brought them home to eat after lunch. Yum!
Mom wanted to go shopping, so we went to a store called Goody’s. I found some costume jewelry that the store people said was ""in"" with teens. So we will see how that works out on Saturday. 
Mom wants to go to Kohl’s tomorrow. Believe it or not, but she has NEVER BEEN to Kohl’s. So that is our adventure tomorrow. 
Today it was 93 degrees, and it felt like a hot furnace outside. I am thinking Friday may be a swimming pool day at the military base for this Colorado woman!
Oh! My brother picked up a good used bike for me today. It is a ladies English racer; it has skinny tires. I tried it out and was sailing down the street with the hot air blistering my face and guess what? The brakes DID NOT work!! Lucky for me, there were no cars around. Well, what do you expect for $40, right? Then I took his EBay special mountain bike for a spin (another $0 bargain). Nice ride! It has a cute basket on the front and suspension in the rear. The seat was more comfortable than the other bike, too. So, I am thinking I will cruise around this small town with my camera and take some picks for you! I could put my camera in Jake’s backpack or in the basket. I will keep you posted.
OK – now it is time to wind down for the day. It is 9pm.
Have a great evening!

Well, don’t worry about missing the dog picture. It was a bit too revealing for me, too.
Today is Monday. I am already starting to think about my 8.5 hour drive to Hopkinsville, KY. I talked to my friend last night. I will leave on Friday and arrive 8.5 hours later – probably later with stops for gas, eating, etc. We plan to go out to dinner on Friday night. We will swim all day on Saturday to keep cool. We are going out to dinner on Saturday night; it is her bday (#51)! Then we will go to her Mother’s place for cake and ice-cream. I have not seen her Mother since 1984! Wow – that was like the last time I dated my soul mate, too! We will swim all day on Sunday and I will hit the road for GA on Monday. I hope I have some interesting things to write about when I return to GA. I won’t have access to a computer after I embark on my road trip. I hope to resume writing on my return to GA.
So today…I have no clue what is on our agenda. My younger brother and his family dropped in last night from 9-11pm. Can you believe we were eating dinner at 8:30pm!? I am going to have to try to get on a better schedule today! These people from the South are so ""laid back"" that they don’t have a routine!
P.S. I have not been to Curves since before I left Colorado. It will be hard getting back into that routine!

I cannot believe this is my last day at Mom’s. I have so enjoyed my vacation. I have really stayed busy with my project and it has definitely been noted! 
I have a funny story to share with you. I went to the DQ on Wednesday evening about 8pm. It was warm, humid. Three elders from the Mormon Church walk in. One was fanning his face while in the DQ; the a/c was on, too! I chatted with them and found out they were from AZ, AK, and UT. We talked briefly about the weather. I told the one fanning his face that he made me chuckle because the DQ is air-conditioned. It is not like he was outside. He scowled and said, ""It is just habit."" I reckon he is tired of being in South GA. What do you think?! I have succeeded on NOT complaining about the weather on this trip home. Secret: I can hardly wait to get back to the cool mountain air in Colorado though!
My friend from KY called and she is back in the hospital. I don’t know if I told you this, but she has heart disease. She is 52, has had several heart attacks and 30 stints! She had the last 2 stints put in yesterday. AND – – she still smokes! I am so glad she was well when I came to see her.
This is how to keep cool in Georgia:

What a wasted day.  I completed the application for my passport and took it promptly to the post office for processing.  Unfortunately, the birth certificate I have had all these years is not the ""official"" one.  It is the ""souvenir"" one from the hospital.  I was born at Ladd AFB, AK many moons ago.  I had to order an ""official"" birth certificate today.  However, I have frantically searched for the ""official"" copy I KNOW I ordered years ago.  I cannot find it anywhere.  I found some interesting things..like pictures and cards from my children over the years.  
I also have a job interview tomorrow.  It is for a Teacher’s Aide at a local Charter School.  It is not what I would like, but beggars cannot be choosy.  The pay is less than $10/hr, but the job has benefits.  What do you think?  It will be in a 3rd grade classroom.  The benefits make it worthwhile.  Who knows, I might get promoted.  I have always heard the Charter Schools don’t require their teachers to be ""licensed"" so it will be interesting to say the least.  If I get the job, I will most likely be working for a teacher who does NOT have a teaching license.
I still have to mow the backyard.  I guess I better get motivated to do that soon.   We are expecting rain today – flooding type rain!  It will be nice for our yards!
Have a great rest of the day!
Here is a funny that I got in an email today:
Yesterday I was at my local COSTCO buying a large bag of Purina dog chow for my loyal pet, Jake the Wonder Dog, and was in the check-out line when a woman behind me asked if I had a dog. What did she think, I had an elephant? So since I’m retired and have little to do, on impulse I told her that no, I didn’t have a dog, I was starting the Purina Diet again. I added that I probably shouldn’t, because I ended up in the hospital last time, but that I’d lost 50 pounds before I awakened in an intensive care ward with tubes coming out of most of my orifices and IVs in both arms.  I told her that it was essentially a Perfect Diet and that the way that it works is, to load your pants pockets with Purina Nuggets and simply eat one or two every time you feel hungry. The food is nutritionally complete so it works well and I was going to try it again. (I have to mention here that practically everyone in line was now enthralled with my story.) Horrified, she asked if I ended up in intensive care, because the dog food poisoned me. I told her no, I stepped off a curb to sniff a poodle’s ass and a car hit me. I thought the guy behind her was going to have a heart attack he was laughing so hard. Costco won’t let me shop there anymore.

I stayed up late on Monday night looking for the certified birth certificate I KNEW I had in my house…SOMEWHERE.  OMG!  I finally found it in the last place I looked.  Yesterday, I took my passport paperwork to the post office for processing.  Now the ""waiting game"" has started.  I don’t plan to go to Germany until November, so I am sure I will have my passport by then.  I feel a sense of accomplishment.  The passport fee was $110 and there was an additional fee to the post office for $25.  
Monday, I also had Gramma time with Isabella.  Her baby brother was having a fitful morning after a fitful night.  He was not eating and appeared to be having tummy issues.  I took Isabella with me to the Farmer’s Market.  We had a delightful morning.  Then we went to McDonald’s for lunch.  She played in the ""play area"" with some children and had a lot of fun.  Then I took her home and kept her and her baby brother while DIL ran out to get some ""Gentle Ease"" formula and ""Gripe water"" (doctor suggested these items) for the baby.  It was fun being with Isabella and Isaiah for that brief period of time.  I enjoyed holding the baby, but Isabella is a tad bit jealous.
DIL called last night to say the baby is much better.  I was so happy to hear that news.  Will post pics of him whenever my son emails them to me.  They are on his camera.

When Jake died, I was given some VHS movies that were taken at his day care. I have had these movies for almost 11 years and never had the courage to look at them. I put one in today. It was a Halloween celebration at the day care. Jake was dressed up as BamBam (from the Flintstones) with a blond wig. He looked so cute. There were scenes of him playing in the snow in December 1994; he would have been 3 and a half years old then. I was just so mesmerized in seeing his face, watching him play. Hearing his voice and seeing him laugh…sigh. Why did he leave us? 
Now I am missing him so much. I never knew he would leave us 5 years later.
P.S.  I am so glad we had camcorders and used them back in the day.  All I have are memories.  I miss you, Jake.

The interview went well.  I have to call in two references for them.  The School Age Child Care Center on the Army Base is very nice.  It is new!  Very nice facility!
After the interview, I was home less than five minutes and I got a sub job out East – Falcon, CO.  I accepted it and headed back out the door.  I was the PE teacher in the afternoon for Kindergarten, 1st, and 2nd grades.  It was a busy but FUN afternoon.  The students were very respectful.  My favorite class was the Kinders!  They were such great listeners!  
Now, I am off to Curves, after I change clothes and shoes.
Have a great evening!
Oh!  I did mention at the interview that I was going to be gone for 4-6 weeks during the holidays.  The Director did not seem to care.  She said she could relate to deployed troops!  Score!  However, this job would expect me to come in various hours, as necessary.  I am not too keen on this requirement.  I would hate to have a Sub job lined up in the morning and then have to cancel it.  This job at the Army post is part-time, 20 hours a week, either mornings or afternoons.  My goal in life is to teach so I might have a dilemma if I get offered this position.  Any suggestions?

I feel much better but cannot seem to get rid of this cough.
I subbed half a day today for ESL kids: ESL is a class for students with English as a Second Language. The kids were wonderful. I worked with kids from China, Haiti, Korea, Germany, etc. It was a nice, sweet, short day. Now I am off to go to Walgreen’s to find some type of quick acting cough syrup. The Nyquil I take at night makes me lethargic when I awaken in the mornings. Ugh!
I have any annual eye appointment tomorrow and found out my Blue Cross Blue Shield Medical insurance does NOT have the ""vision"" coverage. Ouch! So, I called and found out my eye exam is going to be $100. Might as well go in and do it and pay for it. 
P.S. We actually had a decent ""school lunch today"", too! I had a sloppy joe sandwich on WHEAT, peas, and a piece of fruit. Kudos to Springs Ranch Elementary!
Either my nose is running or my cough is always in gear…(sigh). Maybe I should make my follow up to see my doctor sooner than later. She can discuss my cholesterol (my blood work revealed my overall cholestrol and my bad cholesterol #s were down, 
BUT my good cholesterol was DOWN, too!  So much for fish oil and niacin.  My triglycerides jumped up, too!  I wonder if it was the southern food at my Mom’s that caused the jump in the tri-glides…) and MAYBE prescribe something for my chest cold.

Nothing eventful to report today. I enjoyed my morning walk and then had a doctor appointment. Hmmmm…my cholesterol is on a roller coaster ride. My overall cholesterol has dropped the lowest it has been in the past 3 years, but my HDL (the good cholesterol) dropped, too. So, my doctor prescribed something to help it. She gave me two weeks of samples. Hopefully, my insurance will make this doable. The doctor says, without a good prescription plan, this med cost is ""prohibitive"" – like $100/month. Ouch! I think it is called Niaspam or something like that. I think my cholesterol problem is ""hereditary"", but I will do whatever the doc says to try to combat it now. I exercise, eat right (most of the time), and take the OTC supplements (Niacin and Fish Oil). I will go back for more blood work in 6 weeks to see how the Niaspam fares in my body.
Then, I THOUGHT I had a sub job today, but is for next Wednesday. So I relaxed today. Enjoyed a short nap, too. I did not sleep well last night…too much on my mind.
I had to fax in my time sheet for the month of August for one charter school. I only worked half a day this month, so after taxes, it is probably chump change. Change is better than no change, right?!

I hope your weekend is going well.  Mine has been quiet and relaxing.  I took a nice three mile stroll in the morning.  I was so ambitious after my walk that I tried out a new recipe.
http://www.food.com/recipe/cajun-chicken-sausage-pasta-283707
It was delicious!  I made so much that I brought a casserole dish of it to my neighbors.  I used whole wheat rotini pasta instead of the boring fettuccine pasta.   The motivation to try this dish was because I found some smoked chicken sausages in my freezer; they are from the Angel Food Ministries.  I didn’t want to just grill the sausages and eat them so I googled recipes.  The Cajun Chicken Sausage Pasta is definitely easy to make and will be added to my repertoire of everyday recipes.
Nothing else to report to you today.  I think I will watch Gnomeo and Juliet now that I brought it back to my house.  Isabella liked it so much she wanted to keep it.  This will be my first time watching it uninterrupted!

Hello OD World.  Today is the 10th anniversary of the 9/11/2011 attacks against our country.  Take a moment to reflect.  Close your eyes.  Be thankful for today.  Be thankful for your family.  Be thankful for your country.  
Remember those that lost their lives on that fateful day.  Do a Random Act of Kindness in memory of those that are not here with us today because of that fateful day in history.
I did a Random Act of Kindness today.  I left $5 cash with the cashier at Starbucks, after buying my favorite coffee and a Sunday newspaper.  I said to the cashier, ""I would like to buy someone’s coffee in memory of those who lost their lives on 9/11.""  She looked at me with surprise and it was truly a ""Kodak Moment"".
What are you going to do today to remember those who lost their lives 10 years ago?  Write about it on OD.
Have a great day.  Be thankful that you are alive today in our great country…""one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and JUSTICE for all…""

Ms S.,

I am a regular customer at the Starbucks store on Flintridge and Academy.  Being a retired USAF person, I used to live in New York, worked at LaGuardia Airport, and visited the Twin Towers several times with my wife and daughter.  Although we were all living here in Colorado when that terrible tragedy struck, I recall the many times our aircraft (Eastern Air Lines) took off and landed at LaGuardia, JFK, Logan Airport in Boston, or almost every other airport in the U.S.  Unfortunately Eastern Airlines was a victim of the economy (closed in 1991) long before 9-11, but it’s still fresh in many of our minds.
Since I go to that Starbucks quite often, I’ve become friends with many of the employees and they know I try to be nice, plus I usually try to pick up the trash in the parking lot on my way in to the store.  Imagine my surprise when they presented me with your card (or one of your cards, if you passed out more than one); but along with the card my Venti Vanilla Latte for the day was FREE.  So, I thanked them; want to thank you – and I’ve taken the liberty of putting your card along with a small gift of money (in a blank envelope) and “Paid it Forward” (as the movie says).
Thank you for reminding me how important it is to be nice to other folks; whether we’ve met them, or not.
Blue Skies & Blessings

I received a sub request at 4:33am – 4th grade AND no lesson plans. I think it should be interesting. I will bring some emergency stuff.
Yesterday was awesome! Besides the Random of Act of Kindness success, my son’s family came over to visit me! I got to hold my new grandson (he is 5 weeks now) and Isabella was ""ok"" with it! They also asked me to baby sit next month while they go to a Bronco game. I am looking forward to it. I need to go over more often to bond with the baby..now that Isabella is letting me hold her little brother. Prior to them having dinner, they left Isabella with me for awhile and we had a blast…as usual. 
I invited the kids to stay over for pizza and we had a nice family dinner. We had Papa Murphy’s take and bake pizza – the Hawaiian Pizza with garlic bread and tossed salad. 
Now the week has started out with a bang! So I better get in the shower and get some things together for my sub bag.

Wow!  It has been almost a week since I have written in here.  
Monday: ran errands
Tuesday:  worked a brief period in the morning for a teacher in a small country school – 5th grade.  Well-behaved, respectful kiddos!  I also took my 2000 Sienna XLE van in for a tune-up.  Yikes!  Those Toyota parts are NOT CHEAP!  I have to keep this van maintained; it might be my future home down the road!  
I attended a university mixer in Denver on Tuesday night, too.  Western Governors University (WGU) hosted a mixer at a Denver restaurant for all Colorado students.  I got my teaching certificate from WGU.  So, it was fun to mix with other WGU students and alumni.  There were only two alumni there (myself and a Marketing person), the rest were current students.  I met a few ""teaching"" students, too.  We talked about the scarcity of jobs for teachers.  I won a door prize for my granddaughter.  It is a pink plastic piggy bank with the WGU emblem on it.  I will give it to her tonite when she comes over to spend the night with me.
Wednesday:  I attended an interesting training at a local Charter School.  OMG!  This school was so interesting!  They do ""direct instruction"" – basically it is scripted.  The kids are so attentive; there was no observable classroom management issues.  The kids were sitting up like statues in their seats and chorally responding to the teacher.  Scenario:  The teacher might read the script like ""Colorado is located in the Midwest.  The capital of Colorado is Denver. Class, what is the capital of Colorado? Ready?"" (Claps her hand or snaps her finger and the class responds all together – ""Denver"" then the teacher says, ""Correct, The capital of Colorado is Denver.""  You have to see it ""in action"" to get the total concept.  The kids walk silently down the hall, too.  They teach cursive writing in KINDERGARTEN!  The teacher told me – ""No printing in this school."" Uh..ok. I ended the day by having lunch with another Air Force veteran at this training.  We networked and gave her some tips on taking the PRAXIS Elementary Content exam.  I also told her about a charter school she might want to check out to sub there.  We exchanged emails, etc.
Thursday and Friday I was in a Middle School math class.  I enjoyed both days there, too.  I was actually approached by two younger students when I was doing lunchroom duty.  They were 5th graders that remembered me subbing in their 4th grade class last year, when they attended a DIFFERENT school.  It was so sweet of them to come up to talk to me instead of racing outside for recess.
Can you believe I have NOT walked since Sunday?!  I feel like a slug!  I plan to go out shortly for a long stroll.
Favor:  Today is the 11th angelversary for Jake.  Please consider doing a Random Act of Kindness in his memory today.  It can be something as small as opening the door for someone.  I miss Jake so much and this is my way of keeping his memory alive.  I will be doing one for him today, too.  I passed out four Random Act of Kindness cards 
http://www.missfoundation.org/miss_shop/catalog.html
at CURVES last night so my friends could do something in his memory today.  I will be thinking of Jake on my walk this morning.

Good Morning OD Friends!  Thanks for all the thoughts, kind words, and RAKs you did in memory of my son, Jake.  
Well the weekend is over.  I did not have an opportunity to do my RAK but I did get an idea over the weekend.  I had my granddaughter with me over the weekend.  I took her to a place called Artful Adventures.  It is a place where you can paint unfinished ceramics and make your own creation.  It is a bit pricey, I thought.  I probably thought this because I am in the financial situation I am in – unemployed and an on-call Guest Teacher.  So – Isabella chose to paint a small pig.  It was about the length of a business card and about as tall as half the length of a business card – tiny!  It was quite the interesting pig when she finished.  I will pick it up next weekend when they call me.  The small pig was $13!  After you paint your piece, the place ""fires"" it and ""finishes"" it.  It is supposed to come out with a nice colorful glaze.  I am thinking that when I pick it up, I will leave a RAK of kindness card and $5 towards the next ""child’s"" purchase.  What do you think?
As for today, I accepted a full day in 1st grade.  The classroom has a student teacher so it should be a smooth morning.  I am on my own in the afternoon.  OMG!  I prefer grades 3-8, but I will hope for the best in 1st grade.  I picked up a couple interesting picture books at the Scholastic Book Fair at Jake’s school on Thursday night.  I specifically chose picture books because I am going to sub in more lower level grades to broaden my horizons.  The picture books are:
1.  Cool Dog, School Dog by Deborah Heiligman
2.  Aliens Lover Underpants by Claire Freedman and Ben Cort
I read them both at the book fair and enjoyed them.  They are both very colorful with short passages in each page – gotta keep their attention, you know!
Ok – off to the shower and maybe a brief morning walk!

1st grade went well yesterday!  We had such a delightful learning experience.  Teaching little peeps how to subtract and write subtraction number sentences was a Kodak moment.  We had fun.  They were so attentive I thought they were older!
Today is Middle School!  Got to get ready and race out the door!  It should be a great today -> computer lab!

1116,https://www.opendiary.com/m/j8xmom/wednesday-night-100-5369119/,2011-09-27,Wednesday Night,"
Middle School went well on Tuesday.  Can I tell you how unhappy I was that I was in MS on Tuesday?!  The teacher DID NOT leave any lesson plans!  Thank goodness the kids were honest and went to their teacher’s wiki page to find the assignment.  Guest teachers are not allowed on the district computers.  I survived with their honesty and choosing which battles to fight.  The disadvantage of subbing in computers is that the kids will surf the net if you are not careful.  One student asked, ""Does the school block Face Book?""  OMG!  Do bears poop in the forest?!Lucky for me, they were working on projects and typing skills.  
I was also tagged for an additional class at the end of the day – 6th graders in math.  This extra class brought in extra $.  So, I think I made $110 for Tuesday.  Plus, I actually met the teacher b4 he left.  He had a lesson plan in place.  OMG!  These kids were a bit loud but quieted down when asked.  I always carry a couple soft balls (stress balls) in my sub bag so we can get in a game of ""Silent Ball"" during the last few minutes of any class.  The kids toss the ball to each other and cannot talk.  They are ""out"" if they miss the ""catch"".  I have learned a ""few tricks of this trade""…lol.
Today was 5th grade.  It was fun today.  They were a super class!  They stayed on task, too!  The teacher taught math in an odd way.  She meets in groups/centers for 20 minutes each.  Afterwards, the kiddos proceed to another center.  I would have taught the math mini-lesson ""whole class"" and used the advanced kids as peer tutors.  Oh well…I had to follow her plans…so I basically taught this mini-lesson three times!
Tomorrow, I am back in second grade for a half day.
I have a dilemma.  I have befriended a principal at a Charter School and she likes me.  She calls me in to sub for her school.  Problem:  I usually sub for half days.  In reality, I could sub a full day in another school.  However, I do this as a favor for this principal, hoping I might get ""my foot in the door"" for a classroom of my own.  She hires her Guest Teachers to fill vacancies.  For example, I am subbing for her on Friday afternoon.  I have turned down full-day assignments.  What would you do?  I am thinking that I will keep this Friday half day with her, but let her know in an email that I prefer full days.  What do you think?  Should I let her know that I am missing ""full day"" opportunities when I book half days with her and subbing is my only ""earned income""?
Advice needed.

I subbed in 2nd grade today.  It was busy to say the least.  During our writing block, the students went to centers (i.e. handwriting center, writing center, abc center, etc.)  One of the little girls was off to herself sitting quietly.  She had a clipboard and a piece of paper and pencil.  As I circulated in the room, I stopped by and asked her what she was working on.  She said, ""I am writing a letter to my Mom. She’s in jail.""  OMG.  I put my hand on her shoulder and told her to tell her Mom that Ms. S. said hello and to have a nice weekend.  I read the letter later as I passed by her desk.  It broke my heart.  She asked her Mom why she doesn’t call her anymore.  She told her Mom that her birthday was coming up.  She also wrote down her birthday, Nov. 22, in case her Mom had forgotten. She ended with an ""I miss you and I love you.""
Life is hard – especially on the children.
P.S.  I cancelled my 2nd grade assignment yesterday and took a high school assignment.  It was in a charter school.  It wasn’t too bad, but it wasn’t a walk in the park either.  I was the Language Arts teacher for Freshman and Sophomore students.  The Freshman were writing about their heroes.  We later debated qualities of heroes.  The Sophomores wrote an essay on whether the school should or should not allow Public Display of Affection (PDA).  OMG!  That was opening up a can of worms!  One student wrote that it was painful to see others showing PDA when she had nobody to share PDA.  She did not think PDA should be allowed in school.  The majority of students were in favor of PDA.  Seems to me that PDA does NOT belong in schools.  They are sent to school to learn – not publicly display affection.  It is a distraction! What do you readers think?  Should your high school kids be allowed to show PDA in school?  I thought it was a strange essay since the school allows ""some"" PDA – such as holding hands and hugging.  Either have PDA or NO PDA!  We have child care centers in alternative schools now to house the ""results"" of too much PDA.

Thanks for all the notes and words of encouragement on my last entry.  I guess I was having a ""down"" day.  It did get better for me even though I was exhausted most of the day from being up so early.
I went to the teacher’s store, School Crossing, yesterday.  I bought some more goodies for my ""sub bag.  I did not expect to spend $52, but these things will all be useful and fun in the classroom.  I bought a couple of these:
http://www.amazon.com/Think-ets-Tiny-Trinket-Imagination-Original/dp/B000XT78US/ref=pd_sim_t3
I think they will be fun in both elementary and middle school classrooms.  I plan to have the students work in cooperative groups using 5 of the different trinkets from my bags of Think-ets.  They will then either write or share a story they have created from the trinkets in their groups.
I also bought a couple math card games:
 http://www.eaieducation.com/Product/534621/I_Have%2c_Who_Has_Addition_Grades_1-2.aspx
I am excited to use the trinkets!  
Last, I bought a magazine and book for use with elementary school students.
I did have a better day today!  I got my dreaded grocery shopping done at Walmart.  I could not believe the cost of groceries!  I spent almost $200.  
Tomorrow I will be in middle school in the late morning.  I don’t have to feel rushed!  Amen!!  It is the Talented and Gifted students so it should be a quiet day.  
I also sent the email to the principal at the Charter School yesterday.  I advised her that I need to work full days in the future.  I wonder if I will hear back from her.  Hmmmm…
Oh!  I was awakened at 2am this morning by loud noises — sounded like two gunshots.  I didn’t hear the sirens…so maybe it was a car that backfired.  
Tomorrow starts another week for everyone.  Have a great week!

Middle School math has been quite interesting.  I have never heard of ""geometric sequences"".  Can you imagine how much fun that lesson was to teach!  I told the students we would be learning together…lol.  We learned about arithmetic, geometric, and Fibonacci sequences.  Google it!  Sequences were my lesson yesterday.  Today I assisted in Language Arts and ran Study Hall at an alternative school.  It was a very pleasant day.  The students were respectful.
5th grade.  I better get psyched up for tomorrow.  Middle Schoolers are much more independent than 5th graders. However, I did student teach in 5th grade and I enjoyed it.  I prefer grades 3-8. 
So today, I went on my three mile walk and thought about life.  My walk was not long enough!
Thanks for the comments on the WEN hair products.  I have seen the commercial so many times.  I thought it would be nice to ""try it"".  For some reason, WEN likes that ""auto ship commitment"".  If I pay by check, I can always mark the future package as ""Return to Sender"", if I do not like it.  I will have to think about it.

Those of you that answered the question about Columbus were right!  So enjoy taking tomorrow off, if you can…lol.  I will be at work all day thinking of you people that have the day off.

..the 4th grader in my class today.  This was AFTER he said, ""I like your gray hair.""…lol  I told him I was not from China and proceeded to help him work with his versatiles and math worksheet.
So, today, I was the math resource teacher in elementary school.  It was a fast-paced schedule of different classes (i.e. 5th, 4th, and 3rd) and topics.  We worked out decimals (subtracting, multiplying, and adding), subtracting whole numbers (with borrowing), and correctly saying names of numbers (ex. 1,024 is one thousand twenty four and NOT one thousand AND twenty four).  It was a busy and fun half day.
I ended my day browsing at the book fair in the library.  I found a few Christmas presents for my nieces and my granddaughter.  It seems like I ALWAYS find something I want at the book fair.  Sometimes I find things to add to my ""sub"" bag, too!
Today started off quiet.  I did not have a call to sub until 7am.  I had to report to the school at 9:55am.  So………..I had time to fix scrambled eggs for breakfast AND a pot of coffee!
Now, I am going to relax.  It is 4:06pm.
I have Wednesday and Friday still open for subbing.  I am sure those days will fill up, too.

Last night the regular teacher where I subbed yesterday personally called me.  She is still under the weather and wanted to know if I could return to her class today.  I like that teachers try to use the same Guest Teachers for multiple days to keep it ""consistent"" for the children.  Well, of course, I said yes.  I even asked her if she could email her lesson plans directly, because the office waited until I showed up to print them.  She said she would and I am reviewing them now!  I love email!  It is so convenient and fast!
Now, the only open day I have to fill is Friday.  Fridays seem easy to fill.  Of course, I did enjoy my Friday off last week.  I had a chance to ""catch up"" with household matters . 
I fixed another great breakfast today:  Grits, over easy eggs, turkey bacon, and half a whole grain muffin with grape jelly.  I am enjoying my coffee before I head into the shower.  I don’t have to be at the school until 9:55am….another reason why I chose to return to this assignment.

So yesterday I subbed a full day in 4th grade.  OMG!  The roll call was a killer!  Some of the names looked like foreign countries (i.e. Yunique).  
So picture this, I am sitting at a table with a small group of children for reading.  One of the kids says to me, ""What color did your hair used to be?""  (Talk about having a ""tough skin"" to teach!)  I looked at her and said, ""Why?""  She replied, ""It used to be dark, right?""  I said, ""Yes, why?""  She replied, ""Because your eyebrows are dark and don’t match your hair."" 
As you all know, I do not color my hair.  I guess my eyebrows have not grown in silvery white to match my hair color…lol.
Otherwise, I had a great day!  Today, I have not received any calls.  I went on my three mile walk.  Now, I am going to pop in a NETFLIX movie.
Have a great weekend!

Wow!  What a powerful movie!  This movie is about ""being a better father"".  I highly recommend it to everyone!  Bring some tissues; it is definitely a tear jerker.  I wasn’t prepared for the ""loss of a child"" part.  A nine year old girl loses her life in a car accident and it changes her father’s outlook on life – in a positive way.  He decides to become a better father based on scripture.  
The movie also has a mixture of some funny parts!  You will enjoy this movie about ""life"".
A funny story:  My daughter was in the store recently in MD.  She stepped away from her shopping cart while her son was in the cart.  Her son is 6 months old now and weighs almost 20 lbs.  So he is quite the chunky monkey (must be all that rich breast milk she produces).  So anyway, some Korean women stop by her cart and admire him and are speaking Korean (remember, my daughter is a Korean linguist and can understand every word they are saying).  The Korean women take a quick look around and then they say in Korean that the baby is fat and Americans make their babies so fat.  My daughter hears this, returns to her cart, and starts speaking to her baby in Korean.  She tells her baby to say ""hello"" to the nice ladies.  She says all this in Korean.  It was a Kodak moment.  The ladies are so surprised and say in English, "" You speaka Korean?""  My daughter smiled and answered in Korean, ""Yes. I am a Korean linguist.""  Knowing that my daughter just overheard their conversation and understood every work, the ladies quickly walked away.  Lol.  
I have another funny story to tell you about her in another entry.  I have to jump off this computer now and get my morning rolling.  Have a great weekend!

I had such a great night last night. I put a pot roast in the crock pot before I went to work. I called my DIL after work and invited the family over for dinner. She had a church meeting so my son and the kids came over. We had a nice time. We had roast, beef rice AND steamed rice (Isabella loves steamed rice), steamed carrots, and cornbread muffins. 
Isabella took a bath at my house and really enjoyed her visit. The baby was a bit fussy, but turns out, he was tired and hungry. After he ate, he napped until they left. I really enjoy having family so close by.
Today, I have no clue if I am going to be called in to sub or not. I think I will shower in anticipation of going in. If I don’t get called in, I will pick up Isabella and take her to preschool for her Mom.
Yesterday was an odd day. I was the Special Ed Resource Teacher, but they seemed a bit disorganized at the school. I am thinking, I won’t go there again. However, the kids were fun to work with. Autistic children don’t do well with change and seeing me was a change. However, we all made it through the day. 
Have a great OD day!

So today, I surprised Isabella and picked her up from preschool.  She was so excited to see me.  She looked up at her teacher and pointed to me and said, ""That’s my Gramma.""  So touching to me.  
I am worried about life.  I did not get a sub call today.  Hmmm…wondering if the state of the economy has taken a toll on teachers, too.  Maybe they have to be on their death bed to call in sick?  Maybe there is pressure for them to have perfect attendance since their absence would require the district to pay out $ to pay a Guest Teacher?  Who knows…but I need to find something more regular when I return from Germany.
Tomorrow I have a full day with ESL students.  I like this assignment.  It will be the 3rd time I have been in for this teacher.  Friday I have half a day.  I hope to replace the half day with a full day b4 Friday.

It is 5:49am and I am killing time on the computer. Gotta get ready to scoot out the door by 7am. I am in ESL at the Middle School today.
Nothing much to report since yesterday. I am still reading ""The Help"". The southern drawl makes it hard to read. It’s funny because I grew up in the South. I am sure I used to talk like that! Living almost 30 years in CO has changed that to a point,
Have a great Thursday. Thursday? OMG! I better take the trash out for the trash man while I am thinking about it!
What is up with the Hepatitis shots my Dr. is suggesting? I got one in June for my physical. Now I get a note in the mail that I need the second one. How many are there?! Why do I need them? I need a J-O-B more than I need a S-H-O-T!
Here’s an idea I came up with. I am thinking about sending out notes to the local elementary/middle schools near me. I am going to let them know that I sub in 4 districts, but I would like to sub in my neighborhood. Then I will put my business card in the note. I will also ask them to contact me if they need volunteers. I will volunteer in the school if I am not subbing. What do you think? It is a great way to get to know the right people in these schools.

Today went well.  The regular teacher is odd.  She likes ""lamps"" to be in her classroom.  Since I am the Guest Teacher, I like a well lit room for instruction.  So, last time I was there, I turned on the lights – NOT the LAMPS.  The kids liked it!  Well, three kids mentioned it to the teacher upon her return.  She directed the para in the classroom to let me know that ONLY LAMPS will be used when she is away.  Uh…ok.  So we functioned in a minimally lit classroom today.  What is your opinion on this?  I think if I am the teacher, I should be able to choose how I want to light the classroom.  The kids LIKED the well-lit room, too.  I think this teacher has ""control issues"". 
Moving on, I noticed a group of deer by the major road on the way to work today.  There were about 4 or 5 of them.  They appeared to be very young.  They are coming into town from the mountains because they are searching for food, I think.  It was a beautiful sight to see at 7:15 am today.
I am exhausted.  I think it is because I had about 4 hours of ""down"" time today.  I read off and on.  My eyes are tired.  I learned that porcupines are rodents and have about 30,000 quills.  I also learned that skunks spray from two nipples located in their anus.  Last, I learned there are two types of camels.  The ones with one hump are called dromedary camels.  The ones with two humps are called something else….lol.  I was reading this from books in the classroom.  
I am tired of learning and sharing.  I am going to sign off now.  
Tomorrow is 2nd grade for half a day UNLESS I get a better offer between now and 11:30am tomorrow.

So today I was in 2nd grade. I can describe today in three letters: OMG
This class was so out of control. During spelling, the word was ""wrinkle"". One of the students said, ""Grammas are very wrinkled"". One student asks me, ""Are you a Gramma, Ms. S.?"" I responded, ""Yes. I have three grandchildren."" She quickly looked across the table at the student who said all grammas are very wrinkled and said, ""You are wrong! Ms. S. is a gramma and she doesn’t have any wrinkles!"". Kids say the darnedest things!
That was the highlight of my day!
The class was glad to see me, but their behavior was appalling! It was unlike the other two days I have subbed in their classroom in the past!
Geography was fun for me and some of the kids. However, some kids were successful in damaging their globes…denting them very badly. I sure hope they remember the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. The Equator should be easy for them to remember. As for me…this is why I don’t like to sub in K-2!
I just came in from eating out. Trust me! I needed someone to wait on me after today! They opened a new Mexican place nearby: La Perla Lapatia. The food was excellent, but the service was slower than a funeral procession. I am stuffed! 
Have a great weekend!

Today I did not have a Sub job. I got up at 5am, as if I might get called in. When nothing happened, I took an afternoon nap.
This weekend was not a good one for me. I hit ""rock bottom"" again. I spent too much time thinking about the economy, being unemployed, and wondering if I should take ""just any job"" and give up teaching. I decided I needed a break from everyone and ""laid low"" most of the weekend.
I decided on Sunday night that I would stop trying to ""teach"" as a Guest Teacher and NOT take things too personally if the day did not go as well as I expected. Monday I subbed in 5th grade and had a DELIGHTFUL day. My new attitude about Guest Teaching was put into action and all went well! At the end of the day, I threw in a last minute lesson on the term ""mode"" in math. Mode is the most often occurring data point in a set of data. For example, if test scores for spelling were: 85, 100, 95, 95,95, and 70 – the mode would be 95. The score of 95 occurred most often in this data set. My lesson opened with ""What flavor do you suppose occurs the most in a small bag of Skittles? Is it orange, lemon, lime, grape, or strawberry?"" We took a vote in the class after we discussed what the term ""mode"" meant. Then, I passed out individual bags (small ones – like trick or treat size bags) and everyone ""analyzed"" their candy and reported the results. Then, I polled all the students and put tally marks on the board beside each flavor. Guess which flavor occurred the most? Strawberry! They then enjoyed their treat before dismissal! We all left school feeling some type of fulfillment. They had their stomach filled and I felt that I taught a meaningful lesson that ""connected"" to their world.
We are expecting snow tonight. I have a half day tomorrow in 4th grade. I guess I better get some Skittles for tomorrow. Or maybe we will analyze ""M&Ms"" . I think I am going to put together a writing, reading, science, and social studies lesson, too. If the teacher’s plan is not working or if I have extra time, I will teach my own lesson. I think a short lesson on the planets for science would be cool. A brief lesson on CO for Social Studies. Hmmm…reading could be a fun read-aloud. I could tie the read-aloud to a short writing lesson – summarizing what the book was about. 
My days as a Guest Teacher are taking on a new life! Thursday I have a full day in 4th grade. Friday concludes the week with a full day in Middle School Language Arts.
If you have any other ideas that I could teach a lesson on – feel free to note me!
Now, I am off to Curves!

I am happy to be with Becky!!!  I will try to post pics soon.  
She lives in a ""village"" that is supposedly out in the country.  It is a nice place!  I love her place!  The toilets look funny and the fridge looks like a cabinet/pantry – so unAmerican looking.  I will take pics!
I have learned that ""hollow"" means hello and ""chuice"" means good-bye.  Of course these are phonetic spellings.  I cannot write/spell like Germans.  The Base Exchange makes me feel like home.  I cracked up my daughter.  She wanted to buy a loaf pan to make banana bread but the Base Exchange was out of them.  I told her we could go to Walmart and the look on her face was a Kodak moment.  I guess they don’t have Walmarts over here…lol.

OK, Becky’s clocks says it is 8:40am which is 12:40am Colorado time…ok…now I feel really tired…lol.
So, my bag weighed 64lbs at the airport in Denver, CO.  It was going to cost me $150 to ship it to Europe.  The US Airways attendant coaxed me into opening my bag and taking things out to carry on the plane.  In all the confusion, she never charged me for my bag!  I asked to pay at the gate, but they let me fly without the charge. How convenient was that!?
Next, on the flight over to Europe, I declined the dinner on the plane because I ate at the Charlotte, NC airport.  The lady next to me asked for my dinner and I graciously said she could have it.  She was starved and I was so glad I was able to help her out.  She was the one who slept like a baby on the plane.  I was jealous watching her peacefully snooze!  She was able to eat both entrees, the pasta and the chicken.  In this economy, we cannot waste good food!
My daughter was so excited to see me that she arrived at the airport a day early and freaked herself out when I did not get off the plane!  She waited for me for 3 hours!  She talked to airport personnel because she thought I was lost in the Frankfurt airport.  They looked me up and advised her that I was coming the NEXT day.  She is happy that I am safe and sound in her home now.  
I am excited that we are going to see the REAL Cinderella castle – Neuschwanstein Castle – in the Bavarian Alps!  I will take pics on the tour IF we make it over there!  Apparently, it is nearby!  I think my daughter is going over there to snowboard with friends.  I am hanging with the locals; I don’t want to break a hip over here because I am sure I am ""out of network"" on my insurance coverage…lol.

However, I am getting tired now. She has been asleep for over an hour.
Today we went to the commissary on Base. Then we walked around Bitburg. We had coffee tonite and like lunch yesterday – we had trouble translating the menu.

Yesterday, we walked around her village, Landschein.  We found a bakery/coffee shop.  I am thinking about stopping in there this morning.  If so, I will fill you in!  My daughter left me some Euros; the Germans do not accept American money.  The American dollar is worthless over here like it is in the US; it is 73 cents on the Euro.
Will write more soon.  Got to jump in the shower and look presentable.  It is 7:50am in Germany and 11:50pm in CO.  No wonder I feel like I am sleepwalking!

The doorbell rang and a delivery man was speaking German to me.  He was showing me paperwork, but my daughter’s name was not on the paperwork.  I shook my head and told him, ""No. Smathers’ lives here.""  He continued to point to the paper and speak German.  I continued to shake my head like ""No.""  He left.  I felt he was mad.  Oh well.  This was an interesting experience.
I also saw a homeless man on our walk in Bitburg.  Lucky for me, I could not understand what he wanted.  My daughter told him we did not speak German IN German.
I guess there are homeless people everywhere.  It is a sad thing about the world.  We are all probably a few steps away from being homeless in this economy.
Have a great week!

I strolled over to the local bakery this afternoon.  OMG!  I had a fresh German pastry and a cup of milk coffee.  D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S-!  I brought one home for my daughter, too.  She had her fitness test (1.5 mile run, pushups, and situps) today and scored  a 100%!  She was the first woman to do this!  Kudos to her.  She deserves this pastry!

I am reading book about a kitten dropped into a library book return chute.  It is a nice little read about a small town in Iowa, Spencer, and the farm crisis in the 80s and life today.  The book is titled ""Dewey"".  Creative name for a library pet, huh?  I have had this book since this time two years ago.  I thought it would be a nice book to read in the German coffee shops since I can’t read the menus or the newspapers…lol.
I received an email from my brother who lives in GA today.  My mom took a fall in the backyard and nobody was home to rescue her.  She sat outside for over 3 hours.  She gashed her head and had blood all over her apron as she tried to nurse her wound until someone found her.  Thank goodness she is a CNA by trade.  My brother found her in the backyard and took her to the Emergency Room. She had 10 stitches.  I feel much better now that I have called her and heard her voice.  She sounded fine on the phone and relayed the details to me.  Her Emergency Room experience was stellar; she worked for 25 years in that small town hospital.  When she retired from working there, they thanked her and gave her a check for $25.  Life is so hard to understand sometimes.  Many times she was called in on her days off and she never said ""no"" to them.  $25 after twenty five years and NO RETIREMENT funds.  How can small towns get away with this stuff?  Anyway, I am glad I was able to hear her voice and hear about what happened.  My brother’s email did not give me much information…just notes like she had taken a fall, waited for help for 3+ hours, had high blood pressure readings, and needed stitches.  Keep her in your prayers to have a fast recovery.  Thanks so much.

Well, I have been here almost a week. I have to keep convincing my daughter that I am NOT BORED. While she is at work, I either read, watch a movie(s), or take a walk. Yesterday she came home and took me out for Thai food. Isn’t it funny that a Thai restaurant is here?! The menu was in German, too…lol. We had fun. Then she wanted to shop so we went to the Base Exchange and it was closed. Just spending time with her is more than enough for me. 
Thanks for the kind notes and prayers about Mom. She is doing well. Just falling and not having help for 3+ hours scared me!
We are going to Trier this weekend. I hope I spelled that correctly. It is the oldest Roman city in Germany. I should have some great pics for all of you! I hope to pick up some souvenirs for my family there, too! 
Next weekend will be a short week for my daughter due to the holidays. We are going to have so much fun cooking and baking for our Thanksgiving feast!
Today, I might go on another walk. I gave some cash to my daughter to exchange for Euros so now I have ""real"" money to spend! I really liked that coffee shop I went to here in the village. It is a great place to hang out, read, and drink coffee.

I  am doing some laundry today.  The washer and dryer are stacked in the bathroom.  They are small.  It takes 1 hour and 5 minutes to do one load (small load) of laundry.  The washer uses 1/4 to 1/2 capful of soap.  I am careful and use only a 1/4 capful.  The dryer has a tube that you have to drain out the water when it gets full. Interesting, but it works!
The toilets have a push-button on the wall to flush.  I took a picture of it.  I will post it soon.
Nothing else going on at the moment.  My daughter feels like I am bored, but I am very RELAXED and am enjoying this break from the ""real world""!  We have been SKYPing with Becky’s twin sister -> my daughter and her family in Maryland.

Today we went to Becky’s squadron Thanksgiving.  It was so much fun!  Everyone brought something and there was lots of food!  It was all sooooo good!  We drove through a village called Dudeldorf (sounds like doodle-dorf) and it was very German!  We stopped off at a bakery and bought some kale for Becky’s soup recipe, too.  
If any of you want a postcard from Germany – leave me a private note with your address.
We are having company over tonite – a few of Becky’s friends.  Maybe I will teach them to play Spinner dominoes.  A couple of the kids are taking a German class and will be studying over here, too.
Gotta run.  Will write more later.  Oh!  Horses wear jackets over here!  I took pictures and have proof!  Also, you cannot leave your car running in the morning to warm up; it is against the law – POLLUTION!

It is the day after Thanksgiving and my daughter and I are just relaxing. After a morning and afternoon of cooking yesterday, we had a wonderful get together with her military friends in another village for the holiday feast. OMG! We had so much food! We brought home-made cornbread stuffing, banana nut bread loaves, mini pecan pies with home-made crusts (not store bought tart shells!) and a sweet potato pie. We had fun eating, drinking (the younger adults-not me), and playing games. I played two new games: Bunco and Mexican Train Dominoes. We had so much fun and left about 10:30 pm and were in bed by after midnight. I lounged all day and finally came alive at 2pm to cook some more banana nut bread for the house.
She has her tree up and she is so happy to have me here with her. We cancelled our trip to Heidelberg today to rest. Tomorrow we are going to Brugge, Belgium. We cancelled our plans for Brussels after hearing from others that it was not a great place to be. It is a crowded, overpopulated city with no regard for tourists. However, Brugge got rave reviews. So off we go tomorrow for an overnight stay in Brugge.

We went to Brugge, Belgium this weekend.  We had an awesome time!  Please look at how much my daughter resembles her brother, Jake.  It is like seeing Jake everyday!
Brugge was so old!  It was like walking into history with modern clothes!  OMG!  The chocolate was everywhere there!  We brought a box home with us.  I am not a big chocolate person.  
We had another absolutely WONDERFUL adventure.  
Next weekend, or should I say 4 more days, we will be leaving to visit Cinderella’s Castle!  Would you like pictures?
Here are the latest pictures.

P.S.  My daughter was teary eyed today.  She called me before she got to the base.  She is so sad that my time with her is almost over.  We have about 10 more days and that includes today!  She has already offered to bring me back if I am still NOT working (i.e. tied down with a job) next year during this time!  I am so happy to be here with her.  My life in Colorado Springs seems like so far away at the moment.
I am making chicken cacciatore in the crock pot at the moment.  It is our dinner for tonite!
Let me know what you think of the pictures or if you are bored with them…lol.

1161,https://www.opendiary.com/m/j8xmom/chili-was-a-hit-5369171/,2011-11-29,Chili Was a Hit!,"
I made chili for dinner last night.  My daughter had a couple girlfriends stop in, and they LOVED the chili.  I decided to add chopped tomatoes instead of the German stuff (Passierte Tomaten) I bought.  I had to modify the recipe since I made it for less than 8 people.  Here is the recipe I used with my modifications added in:
1 lb ground beef, keep drippings – adds to chili juices! 
1/2 cup fresh onions
1 tsp minced garlic from the jar
3/4 tsp salt
1/2 tsp paprika
1 tbsp chili powder
1 can chopped tomatoes with green chilis, undrained
1 can chili beans
Sprinkled in some chili flakes
1/4 of a chopped bell pepper
1 cup of water
Directions:  Brown meat with onions, bell pepper, and seasonings.  Add remaining ingredients and simmer for at least an hour.  
How good was it?  We had ZERO leftovers and many compliments repeated throughout dinner!  I should have cooked more for the hungry troops!  However, I still had some home-made banana nut bread and Belgium chocolate for the sweet teeth (meaning more than ONE sweet TOOTH..lol)!
I had a request for more pot roast so tonite’s dinner consists of two slow-cooked beef pot roasts with carrots and potatoes.  We will also have brown rice as a side dish.  I might make the delicious brown recipe from my former husband:
1 cup white rice
2 cans beef consumme
1 chopped onion
1 stick butter
Directions:  Put all in a covered casserole dish in the order listed and bake in the oven at 350 degrees for about 45 minutes or until done.  Keep checking on it.  This is SO GOOD, but plan brown rice from the bag is more nutritious for you.
Have a great Wednesday!  We are leaving tomorrow for the Bavarian Alps for snowboarding (troops only – not me!) and to check out Cinderella’s Castle.  The plan is to take a horse-drawn carriage ride UP to the castle and walk DOWN when done with our tour of the castle.

I finished reading Dewey: The Small-Town Library Cat Who Changed The World. This was a very heart warming story about a cat that was dropped in the book return chute, on a freezing day in 1988, at the small library in Spencer, Iowa. He was adopted by the library, the patrons, and the world. I am sending the author a postcard to let her know what a tribute her book was to Dewey and the town of Spencer, IA. I am adding ""Make a road trip to Spencer, IA"" to my bucket list.

We had an awesome trip to the Bavarian Alps!  We stayed in a very nice military resort, The Edelweiss.  
edelweisslodgeandresort.com/vacationvillage.html  Check out the Rustic Cabins.
We had a nice rustic cabin.  It was very plush.  Bed linens, pillows, and down comforters were provided.  The cabin could sleep 6, but there were 3 of us.  It also had a large flat screen Sony TV, Sony DVD player, and fridge!  It has a cute kitchen table, and the cabin WAS HEATED!  We only slept there; our days were spent on our adventures.  It was a 2 room cabin; one room was the kitchen/living area.  
We did go to the Neuschwanstein Royal Castle!  It was built by King Ludwig II, the Bavarian King.  It has been well preserved.  No pictures were allowed in the castle.  His bedroom was interesting; we also saw the royal potty…lol.  The artwork on the walls and the elaborate woodwork on his furniture was beyond words!
edelweisslodgeandresort.com/tours.html
We stopped at a woodcarving shop, and I picked up some souvenirs for my children in the states.  I got my son in CO a ""smoker"".  This is made of wood.  It is a person depicting a trade with a pipe in his mouth.  You place incense cones inside and the figure appears to be smoking!  I got one for me, too!  The characters are ""peddlers"".  I bought my daughter in MD a musical nutcracker.  Her twin picked it out, so I went with it.  Twins know each other better than the parents know them!
We also stopped at a very old church.  They referred to it as the Church in the Meadows.  Legend has it that the Christ statue at the front/altar of the church cried ""real tears"".  
When we arrived at the church, we were allowed to enter and sit quietly in the church while the service was going on.  Absolutely no pictures were allowed during the service, but we took some afterwards.  I will update my picture link and show them to you.  I saw the statue!  The service was in German.  I did not understand anything, but it was so awesome to be in this church!

Time has really flown by.  I got back to Colorado on the night of December 14th.  My granddaughter was over for a sleepover on the 17th, and my brother arrived for a week on the 19th.  He left on the 23rd, and I was at my oldest son’s place for Christmas Eve and Christmas dinner.  I have had a busy but wonderful holiday season!  
I stayed home all day today.  I needed some ""quiet"" time for me.  I got two Starbucks cards for Christmas, but I was too pooped out to go anywhere today.  Maybe tomorrow I will go to Starbucks and read the paper and my book.  I have not read my book since I came home on the 14th!
My baking was a big hit after Christmas dinner!  My miniature pecan pies were so yummy!  
I have been invited over to a friend’s church for ""game night"" on New Year’s Eve.  I bought Apples to Apples, a supposedly really fun game!  I am going to bring it and Spinner dominoes.  I am thinking about making some more of those delicious miniature pecan pies, too!
Christmas is over, and I had a great time!  I was able to catch up on all my ""faves"" today, too.  Now, I am going to finish watching, How the Grinch Stole Christmas (with Jim Carey).
Have a restful week!  My subbing doesn’t start til next week!  I think my phone will start ringing on 5 Jan 2012 for available sub jobs.  5 Jan is also my girls birthday.  The one in Germany already has her bday present, and I mailed the other one her present on Saturday. I am ahead of the game!

I subscribe to Joel Osteen’s daily devotional emails.  Today’s email seemed to fit my life right now.  It is based on Psalm 92-12.  Basically, he compares the palm tree in a storm to life.  The palm tree will bend over so much due to the storm, but it will become upright again and much stronger!  Life sometimes seems to blow us away, but it makes us stronger.  Amen.  
P.S. I dreamed of Jake last night and it was not good.  He had been out with his Dad somewhere and came home injured.  I woke up crying and very sad. I asked God to give me a sign that Jake is happy and so I am waiting….maybe the New Year will bring a signs and good dreams about Jake as I remember him…always ""happy"".

Thanks for all your kind, welcome notes from my last entry.  I slept really well last night.
Remember when I wrote about that book by T.D. Jakes, The Ten Commandments of Workiing in a Hostile Environment?
http://www.amazon.com/Ten-Commandments-Working-Hostile-Environment/dp/B003156B54/ref=sr_1_1
I read this book in the Spring (?) of 2010, and it gave me a survival guide to working in a toxic environment.  Well, a friend of mine is working in a toxic environment now.  I met her for breakfast on Wednesday, and I gave her my last copy of this book.  (I loved the book so much that I bought several used copies from Amazon.com.)  She suggested we start a book group on this very book!  OMG!  I was so excited to hear this request.  So, we are starting our group on Wednesday night at 6pm.  We are going to meet at a coffe shop.  I am so e-x-c-i-t-e-d-!  Unfortunately, I do not have any more of these books, so I put one on ""HOLD"" at the library yesterday.  I am keeping my fingers crossed that it will arrive in time for our discussion group!
OK – nothing else to report to you.  I am really enjoying this relaxing week with no outstanding commitments.  However, I was invited to dinner with a friend tonite.  She wants to hear about my trip abroad, so I am going to her place to have dinner tonite.
Here is something for you to ponder.  I applied on-line to work for JCPenney .  I took a 50 question test about ""situations"" and how I would handle them.  Guess what?  At the end of the test, a screen popped up and said the results of the test show that I am incompatible for the position that I applied for, which was Sales Associate.  The irony of it all is that I worked for JCPenney during my college days!  In my college days, I worked in the credit, catalog departments and on the sales floor in Childrens. Oh well.  I guess I am not a great test taker, and I answered the questions from my heart and NOT like I thought they wanted to hear.  Oh well, honesty is the best policy.
Have a great Friday!  Tomorrow night is my game night!  Woot! Woot!

I applied to work at Walmart.  Of course this was an on-line application, too.  It had a 60+ question assessment.  Interesting questions, too, I might add.  I P-A-S-S-E-D their assessment! Now it is the waiting game to see if they call me.  I still chuckle and smile when I think about the 50 question assessment results with JC Penny–>the results of the assessment indicate I am not compatible with the job I applied for –> Sales Associate, despite having worked for them during my college days…lol.  One of there questions was like:  An unshaven man with soiled clothing walks into your store in the bedding department.  What do you do?
a. Call security
b. Follow him around and tell him not to sit on the bedding
c. Call your manager
d.  Approach him, say ""hi"", and tell him you admire his taste in fine bedding.
Lol…I am not absolutely sure these answers are verbatim or in this order, but I chose the last one…lol.
You should go online and apply to work at JC Penny, take the assessment, and tell me what YOU think of it!
I also applied on-line to Home Instead, an agency that assists the elderly that choose to live in their own homes, and Kohls.  Neither had an assessment like JC Penny or Walmart.  
Hmmm…I think I will try Target, Lowes, and Home Depot next.

I had an awesome time at game night tonite.  I got there before 8:30pm and left about 9:45pm.  I didn’t want to be on the road with the ""partiers""…lol.  
I learned a new card game –> Spoons.  We had so much fun! There were 3 adults and 3 children (ages 9, 12, and 15).  It was a riot!  Basically, you are supposed to get ""4 of a kind"" and grab a spoon from the center of the table.  Everyone else needs to grab a spoon when the action happens!  With 6 players, there are only 5 spoons so you have to be QUICK!  The kids loved it!!
I also got to play Apples to Apples for the first time tonite.  We had 9 people playing!  The kids were 6, 9, 12, and 15.  I got the biggest kick out of the younger two – especially the 6 year old.  He was so funny!  I think I need to host a ""game night"" at my house once a month!
Oh!  The mini-pecan pies were a big hit tonite, too!
Well, it is 10:36pm, and I am safe at home.  I think I will read some more of my Nicholas Sparks’ book, The Best of Me.  It is about a couple who were sweethearts in high school and went separate ways.  Now they have reconnected again after 25 years.  She is unhappily married to a dentist and has 3 children.  He never married.  They met when they returned to their hometown of New Bern, NC, to attend a funeral of a dear friend, an older man that they looked up to as teenagers.
Don’t stay up too late; the New Year will sneak in quicker than you think!  It will come whether stay up and wait for it or not.

My ""wait time"" at the post office was less than 30 minutes so that was probably good for the USPS!  Everything seemed to have went well.  It was hard to keep looking at my watch, but I think I reported a fairly accurate ""wait time"".  It was approximately 22 minutes.  
I also went on my short (1 mile) walk today, AND I was at Curves tonite!  So, I am starting the New Year off with a great start.  I was at Curves last night, too!
Tomorrow night is the first night of our book discussion group.  I am excited!  I recruited another person tonite; she works in a very ""toxic"" environment, surrounded by a lot of negative people.  I am sure she will benefit from our book discussion!
I had coffee with my neighbor tonite.  She said the city passed a law about no more parking on the street in front of our houses.  I am researching it and emailed the city.  I have 3 vehicles and a single car garage.  I see many cars parked on the street in my neighborhood.  I sure hope my neighbor is not ""fabricating"" this story to stress me out!  I asked my other neighbor about it and she had not heard of this new law.  My son and his wife had not heard of it either.  I sure hope I don’t get ""towed""!
Remember the teacher that was going to teach in Afghanistan?  Well, she is not going there anymore so my job opportunity is OBE (Overcome By Events).  However, I saw this teacher at CURVES tonite!  She told me she was going to make $143,000/year TAX FREE if she went to Afghanistan.  The job is filled; they had too many applicants.  I told her I was glad she stayed in CO; it is too dangerous in Afghanistan.

My book group went well yesterday.  We decided we would move the date to Thursdays and move up the time to 5pm.  We are starting off with reading one chapter b4 our next meeting – next Thursday.  If it is too slow for discussion, we will bump it up to two chapters.  We will also decide next week if we want to meet every week or every two weeks.  We plan to meet for an hour and a half.  Otherwise, we had a great time!  We have four people:  a civil service/retired Air Force Reserve person, a retired teacher, a 911 dispatcher supervisor and me.  Two people did not show, but they have an opportunity to join next week.  After that, we are closing that opportunity.  We can’t wait too much longer; it hinders our group discussion.  We had a wonderful organization meeting.
Today I am going to the library; the book for our group discussion is now available.  I put it on HOLD since I gave away all my copies.  Sometimes I think I am too generous.
Last night I watched ""Country Strong"" with Tim McGraw and Gwen Paltrow.  It was an awesome movie!  It is due back at the library today.  It is about a couple aspiring country singers and a grammy award winning country singer.  I highly recommend it.
Oh!  Remember how I told you about my neighbor telling me about the new law about NOT PARKING on the street anymore?  She is wrong!  I emailed the police department and a SGT called me yesterday.  He was surprised a neighbor told me this!  The most remote law that would apply to me is the ""72 hour rule"".  You must move your vehicle at least every 72 hours, whether you move it up or back an inch or so.  Of course, I have been in violation of that rule for sometime, since I don’t drive my truck much.  However, it HAS NEVER been an issue!  It is never parked in an area that would be a nuisance to anyone.  I don’t know what to make of this neighbor.  What do you think?
Gotta run and call my girls and wish them a Happy Birthday.  Have a great Thursday!  The weekend is coming. Well…being unemployed makes everyday a weekend..sigh.

I got a call to sub in 5th grade for half a day, so I went in.  It was a great way to ease back into the routine.  The students were awesome, too!
As for the notes about mystery shopping, I have been a mystery shopper occasionally.  I think the shop I completed before the Post Office was in 2010.  I also was a mystery shopper during my college days.  I think it fun.  Free meals at restaurants are always nice.  At the moment, there are several post office shops available, but I don’t really have any pressing packages to mail.  I mailed something to my Mom when I mystery shopped this week.
I had dinner with my oldest son and his family yesterday.  It was a nice, low key visit.  The grandchildren are doing well, too.  
It is almost 6am here and nobody has called for a Guest Teacher yet.  I think I will jump in the shower and get completely woke up for the day.  
Have a GREAT weekend.
Whatever happened to ""The Voice Inside"".  I guess he made his diary private?  He left some funny notes, and I miss that.
Oh!  Guess what!?  My doctor put me on 5 milligrams of Lipitor before I left for Germany.  My total cholesterol at the time was 201 – nothing earth shattering, but I think I have a proactive doctor.  So my blood work revealed this week that the med is working!  My overall cholesterol is now 132 and my LDL (bad cholesterol) almost was cut in half!  Prior to the med it was 124 and now it is 66!  Thank goodness the Lipitor has a ""generic"" now, too.  It was almost $70 for a 30 day supply when I got it in November.  Unfortunately my HDL (good cholesterol) has not changed much.  She is putting me on another med for my triglycerides, which are slightly elevated at 191.  They would like to see them be under 150.  That is the scoop on my latest battle with the cholesterol ogre.  I think I am going to win the battle eventually.

I joined Twelve in 12; this is an OD that challenges everyone to read a book a month, 200 pages, any genre, etc.  You will also review/report about your readings.  I am excited because this challenge will hold me accountable to reading for a year!  I also like to share about my reading.  Graytabby, you should do this because you read a-l-o-t!  
I began my challenge last night with a book my daughter suggested while I was in Germany.  I am reading ""Hotel on the Corner of Bitter and Sweet"".  Her Dad recommended this to her because it was a ""good story"".  I am only briefly into it, but I think I am going to like it!  It is a FICTION story.  I will have to google genres when I am finished with the book to choose the most accurate genre that fits the book.
Today, I am going to relax, read, and watch some movies.  I set my thermostat to 62 degrees, and it is chilly in the house.  I think I will have to pump it up a few degrees – especially since I will be in the lower level/garden level of my house.  It is as least 5-10 degrees chillier downstairs!  Now – off to put on a pot of coffee!  CURVES today?  Probably so—sometime between now (7:26am) and 11am.  They close at noon.

OMG.  I think my neighbor is going to drive me crazy.  Remember the story about the new law about not parking on the streets?  I researched it and spoke with the police department; it is NOT TRUE.  New story–> I found a coat hanger in the back of my Nissan truck bed today.  I don’t know how long it has been there, but it was rigged into a tool to slide in car windows to break in.  Well, I mentioned it to my neighbor tonite.  She told me that she heard noises early Friday morning or Saturday morning around 3am.  She saw some kids checking out vehicles – particularly my 1997 Camry.  She watched them looking in the windows of my car and said she saw them throw something.  She thinks the ""something"" was the coat hanger I found in my truck.  OMG!  I don’t know whether to believer her anymore.  I took the coat hanger and threw it into my trash tonite.  Any suggestions?  I should call the police department and tell them to interview my neighbor who ""witnessed the whole thing""!

Thanks for your notes.  I think the neighbor likes to make things up and appear important.  She likes to ""stir the pot"".  I think I will be carrying around a pot cover these days.  If she asks ""why"", I will tell her I am putting a cover on the pot so she will quit stirring it…lol.  I will think about calling the police, AND I am always cautious in securing my vehicles.  I don’t like to invite trouble.  Maybe calling the police to report my findings will put more patrols in our neighborhood.  I think my neighbor would DENY seeing anything if the cops came over to her house.  Then, I would look like an idiot!
Have a great Tuesday!

WildRose asked me a couple questions.  They are listed below.  I am going to ponder upon them and will answer them either later today or for sure – tomorrow.
Have you ever been on a date since you’ve been single? Well, I have to look over the past 16 years, and the answer is:  Yes, I have, but none were ""serious"".
Are you interested in becoming romantically involved with a man and if so, what qualities are you looking for in him?  I am not interested in becoming romantically involved with anyone, because it complicates matters.  I would like a companion to go out to dinner with, see a movie with, and take walks with.  The qualities in a man I am looking for are:  Independent (not co-dependent on me!), fit (someone who takes care of himself), sensitive, compassionate, hardworking, sense of humor (a MUST with me!), has a plan for the future (or tomorrow for that matter) and last but not least – someone who respects me and my children.  No smokers, pot heads or drinkers would interest me at all.  Looks are important, but you all know a man can be handsome on the outside and ugly on the inside.
How did I score, WildRose?

The winds woke me up today.  They were making my deck chairs waltz across the upper deck.  It was 4:21am.  So..here I am.  I am out of milk, sitting in my flannel pjs, and my stomach is growling.  I think I need to put on my tennies, grab a jacket, and head to the store.  I get my milk from the Royal Crest store.  I love their slogan ""Don’t let your friends buy grocery store milk"".  It is true!  The milk is much better from Royal Crest!  BRRRRR…but it is chilly outside!  Maybe a waffle, eggs, and coffee will cure my dilemma.

I really had to make myself go to Curves tonite.  I am bushed!  I sure wish I could sleep in late tomorrow, but my body is such a morning person.  Anyway, I am going to read a bit before I turn in.  My book, Hotel on the Corner of Bitter and Sweet, is such a great book.  I try to read as much as I can.  I read a few minutes during my lunch break today.  I hope I can finish it before January ends!

Today is the last day of the long weekend. Wow! Saturday and Sunday flew by so fast. I had company come over on Saturday afternoon. She arrived at 2pm ish and stayed until almost 10pm! We watch the DVD I purchased at the Neuschwanstein Castle in the Bavarian Alps. It was great! I fixed us a late lunch of pizza and salad. We had oreos and milk for dessert.
Sunday I kept to myself. I went to the coffee shop in the afternoon to read Chapter 2 of The Ten Commandments of Working in a Hostile Environment. So I have my homework done for Thursday’s book club meeting. Yay!
I went Walmart after the coffee shop visit and was so surprised at how much groceries have went up! OMG! I spent $126 and can’t say I bought much of anything! I purchased 26 items:
Bubble Mailer .94
2 boxes of Pure Protein Bars $12.54 (For Daughter in Germany)
Frozen Chicken Nuggets $4.47
Fish Sticks $4.98
Packaged Salad $2.48

This was just a Quick Trip to pick up a few items. Can you imagine if this was my Major shopping trip for the month?! Thank goodness, I had meat and most items I need at home. The frozen items I purchased are a just a few ""extras"". 
Look at your most recent grocery store receipt and tell us what you spent.
Today I am going to enjoy to myself. My daughter from Germany is supposed to SKYPE with me in about an hour (10am Mountain time).
Oh!  I watched a moving movie last night:  Miracle in the Woods.  It is a story set in the South.  It is about a family whose Mother passed away and the two daughters (played by Patricia Heaton and Meredith Baxter) have to decide what to do with the 100 acre pecan grove that was NOT willed to either of them.  They discover an elderly woman (played by Della Reese) living in a shack amidst the pecan trees. The pecan grove is worth $150,000.  I found this movie at ""The Book Rack"" in my town.  It was used, but it sounded like an interesting movie.  It was worth the purchase!  
Have a great day!

Today I subbed in 2nd grade.  I am wiped out!  I had a student cry on the way to gym.  He misses his Mom.  He said she got out of jail and moved away.  He misses her so much.  He said he lives with his Dad, but he misses his Mom.  It was heartbreaking to hear this and see the tears of an 8 year old.  I told him his Mom will probably look for him.

I have been remiss in my writing lately.  I apologize.  I don’t have anything interesting to report. I subbed for that 2nd grade class again on Thursday, and it was a much better day.
I took Friday off; the 2nd graders wore me out…lol.  Our book club met late on Thursday night, too.  I got home after 8pm.  Our club met at 5pm!  My phone rang all morning for sub jobs, too!
Actually, I had some personal business to take care of on Friday.  I applied for a Middle School English/Language Arts Long Term Sub job.  The district is not my preference, but I do enjoy Middle School teaching.  The pay is much better as a Long Term Sub as opposed to a daily sub.  The job posting closes on Monday.  Maybe I will hear about an interview sometime next week, or maybe not…
I also kept my grandson on Friday for a few hours.  My son and his wife went out to grab dinner and have some quiet time.  It was fun.  Isaiah is now five months old and is very verbal.  I love to hear him coo.  His latest thing is nodding his head.  He is so darn cute!  His big sister was spending the night with the other grandparents.
I was supposed to go to a matinee movie with a Curves friend, but she decided not to go.  Darn!  I  missed dinner with my son and his family just waiting for her call.  She said she will let me know about whether she wants to go tomorrow, but I think I will make plans to take my granddaughter to the library and to my place.  I am not giving up another whole day to wait on a phone call that might not come.
Oh!  I followed up on my Walmart and Kohls’ on-line applications.  Two Walmarts are not hiring til maybe 1 Feb.  I still need to follow up on the 3rd Walmart.  The first time I called, the Personnel Staff were in a morning meeting (Monday).  I called again on Tuesday and the Personnel Staff were not in the store! Then I subbed on Wed. and Thurs. so I did not call them back.  I had other things to do on Friday, so I still need to follow up with them on Monday.  Kohls is not hiring until April or May.  So I will call them again when Spring rolls around.  I am still waiting to hear back from Hallmark.  I am sure I am 1 of the many 1000s who have applied for the local job…sigh.  
Today was nice and quiet.  I washed the Sienna van and the Camry.  It was a beautiful day today.  I also worked out at Curves around 11:00am.  I have been productive, so my day was not totally wasted on waiting for the phone call about the matinee.  It is 7:10pm; I have plenty of time to read and/or watch a movie.  I have a NETFLIX movie to watch:  The 5th Quarter.  I will fill you in on the review after I watch it.
Have a great rest of the night!

Since I last wrote, I had a very productive Sunday. I went to a new church. It was a great place. The congregation was so small. I am guessing there were less than 25 people there, and I may be stretching that number! They were all so friendly. I attended the fellowship after the service and sat and visited with a few people. I had a cup of coffee and some 16 bean soup with crackers! The message was about answering God’s call from the book of Mark. Do you think I will know if God calls me to service? Maybe he is telling me not to teach? What do you think?
Afterwards, I went home and called my son’s wife. I asked if I could pick up Isabella and take her to the library. Isabella loves playing on the computers at the library. She and I visited the library for about an hour, and then she asked to go to my house. We spent a little time at my house, and then I took her home and stayed for dinner. It was a wonderful Sunday.
I have been booked to sub all this week. Monday was 3rd grade. Tuesday was Middle School/8th grade. Today was 4th grade. Tomorrow and Friday I am booked for Middle School. I don’t have a clue what grades for tomorrow and Friday.
I got an email yesterday from Hallmark. I didn’t get the job. Oh well. I knew I had to have been one of several applicants. 
I have been so exhausted lately. I think staying up late over the holidays spoiled me. Getting up again between 4:30 and 5am is taking its toll on me.
Today, one of the 4th graders asked me if I knew how to jump rope. I said I did when I was a kid. He handed me the jump rope, and I discovered that I could still do it! It was fun; I didn’t want to give the jump rope back…lol. Next week will probably be jumping on a pogo stick…lol! I remember trying to ""mountain board"" during student teaching. Mountain boarding is like riding a fat skateboard. I crashed into the ditch! I was OK though. The kids were scared and raced over to check on me. I told them I was just ""stopping"" to get off the board…lol.

Title: Hotel on the Corner of Bitter and Sweet
Author:  Jamie Ford
# of pages:  285
Genre:  Historical Fiction
This was definitely a ""page-turner""!  This is a story about a young Chinese boy who fell in love with a young Japanese girl.  Both lived in America, but the Japanese were at war.  The Japanese had already bombed Pearl Harbor and were not well liked.  The boy, Henry, met the girl, Keiko, in grade school.  They became great friends then Keiko, her family, and the rest of the Japanese people living in Japantown in Seattle were shipped off to internment camps.  Henry was devastated.  Henry ends up marrying a Chinese girl, Ethel, and has a family.  His family is very pleased about this!  Ethel passes away and Henry is reminiscing about his first love, Keiko.  He actually thought of Keiko during his marriage to Ethel.  Technically, he never stopped thinking about his first love as a 12 year old boy.  
The story takes you back and forth from the present to the past.  You get so caught up in this story, that the transitions are so easy to follow.  The questions you ponder:  Will Henry ever reconnect with his lost love after 40 years?  Is Keiko still alive and if so, where is she?  Where does he begin to solve this puzzle?  
The title of this book is in reference to the ""hotel"" that Keiko and her family resided in before they were shipped away.  ""Bitter"" and ""Sweet"" describe the relationship of Henry and Keiko.  ""Sweet"" describes their friendship at school. ""Bitter"" describes the separation they encountered due to Keiko’s ethnic background.  Despite the fact that Keiko and Henry were both born in America, they were regarded as ""Japanese"" and ""Chinese/chink"" by the the majority of the citizens in Seattle.
If you want a good, wholesome story, I would recommend this book.

…at 5:05am.  Good Morning!  I am trying to get my day in gear.
I am reading a new book, The Dry Grass of August.  I picked it up at the library on Saturday.  It is ""new"" fiction.  It is very interesting.  It takes place in the South during the 1950s when things were very racist.  If you ask me, I believe it is STILL racist in the South.  It never fails to amaze me when I go home.  I hate it!
So far, the book is about a family with four children.  There are 3 girls and one boy:  Stella, June, Puddin’, and Davie.  The father drinks alot and beats June often.  The mother seems very unhappy in this marriage – go figure.  Who would let their husband take a belt to their young daughter?!  She should have left him long ago but he has a good job.  Oh well…  Anyway, they left NC to visit a relative in FL.  The father did not go.  Yay!  In the book, the family refers to their maid as ""the girl"".  She cannot go in restaurants with them or stay in the same motel with them.  Her room in FL, while visiting relatives, is in the sweltering attic.
Other than reading a good book, life is the same.  I subbed in Middle School yesterday and will be in another Middle School today.  
Oh!  My bank gave their members an ""appreciation"" surprise.  The bank deposited from $25 to $1000 in member accounts.  The amount is based upon the number of deposits you made this year and payment on your loans.  Mine was >$25<$1000.  I am happy.  Ever little bit helps, right?
I watched a movie last night; it was strange—Blue Valentine.  Michelle Williams and Ryan Gosling were in it.  It is a love story, but it is nothing like Romeo and Juliet.  Seems like it is one that happens too often in our society.
Oops..it is 5:46am!  I better jump in the shower and get ready to rock and roll.  I have to leave the house around 7am ish.  Have a great week!

I have been so busy subbing that I cannot find time to write.
Game night has been planned for 24 Feb at 8pm/Friday.  I will probably not participate.  I am so bushed after a full week of teaching.  If they had planned it for a Saturday or Sunday afternoon, I would have been a player.
I did meet with a friend for Spinner dominoes at Pikes Perk last Saturday, but she and her friend wanted to just eat and visit.  We did have a nice visit.
I was booked solid for subbing last week and this week.  However, my sub day was cancelled on Friday, because the district was closed due to a snowstorm.
I did enjoy my Friday off!  I vegged all day, stayed in my pjs, and watched ""Bad Teacher"" with Cameron Diaz.  It was funny, but the movie had too much inappropriate language and scenes.
I will be going to Maryland for my grandson’s 1st bday.  I am looking forward to seeing him and his parents before they leave for Korea in June.
My book is getting more interesting as I read each page.  I better not spill too much info, because it might ruin my book review…lol.
The unemployment rate is dropping (8.3% now), but I am still unemployed.  I need a full-time job with benefits.

I have been asking God for help in finding my way as a teacher. I thought maybe He had a better plan for me. Money is so tight and I feel so ""broke"" at times. I feel so broke that I make Humpty Dumpty look good!
Then an amazing thing happened last week. A principal called me and asked me if I would be interested in proctoring the state exams in March. OMG! March is usually a slow month for subs due to state assessments. Of course I returned her call and said, ""Yes""! I have 6 days booked in March now! 
Amazing thing #2 happened on the same day. I was called by a company that found my resume on careerbuilder.com. They wanted to know if I was interested in being a tutor for them for $20/hour! Of course I returned the call!
Amazing thing #3 happened with my taxes. I was so down because I had to tap into some investments to make ends meet this year. Of course I was penalized and had to pay taxes on that money, too. I was looking at paying almost $1000 (federal and state together) to Uncle Sam. My son and his wife suggested I gather up my medical expenses (co-pays, premium payments, prescriptions, dental expenses, etc.) and see if I had enough to take the deduction. All this info in available from your insurance company’s website. I had $6640 in expenses and that gave me an additional deduction of $4000+. Now I have to pay Uncle Sam same less than $100 in Federal and I actually get a small refund from the State!
They always say things happen in threes.
On another good note, I worked all week last week.  I have 3 days booked for this upcoming week, too.
It has been snowing since yesterday, and it is so cold in Colorado Springs.  My heater is running non-stop.  
Now, I have to run to the store to pick up my Sunday paper.  Have a great weekend!
P.S. I decided I might give up my cell phone and save some $ each month.  I am considering giving up my basic cable expense ($24), too.  My financial planner suggested that I stop investing, too, since I could use this money now.  I would give up my internet, too, but I need that resource to look for jobs and to apply on-line.

I read about roses and their colors in Hints from Heloise recently.  I wanted to share this with you.
RED –  true love
WHITE – innocence or purity 
YELLOW – friendship, affection, caring and joy
PINK – elegance, admiration and happiness
ORANGE – enthusiasm, desire, admiration, attraction, passion and excitement
LILAC/LAVENDER/PURPLE – love at first sight, passion or luxury
Today was a great Valentine’s Day for me.  I finished my second day subbing in a 5th/6th grade combo classroom at a charter school.  The students were having a fun raiser; they were selling roses (hand-made paper ones) and chocolate suckers for $1.50.  One of the students brought me a stuffed bear holding a rose (pink one) with a note attached: Thank you for being a great teacher when Mrs. J. was gone. Sencerly, C.  I cannot even begin to describe the wonderful feeling I had inside when she handed me this stuffed bear and rose.  I must be doing something right in the classroom.  I plan to write her a Thank-You note.
Then, tonite, my daughter-in-law called me to tell me she had a ""little something"" for me for Valentine’s Day.  So I stopped by after Curves and was greeted by Isabella at the door.  Isabella had made me nice card at Church.  It read:  To Grandma Patty, I love you and thank you for taking me to the park.  Love, Isabella.
She also gave me two cupcakes she helped bake with her mommy.  Last but not least – her mom had me a plate of dinner waiting, too!  I ate pork short ribs, potatoes, and mac n cheese!  What a wonderful Valentine’s Day for me, today!
I had something small to give them, too.  I brought them some candy.
I hope you all had a wonderful Valentine’s Day, too!  I am bushed and ready to slide between the sheets now.
Good night to my OD buddies.

I didn’t sub today.  I got a new badge from one district and went to check out teaching in South Korea.  
The Korean job would be more like an immersion program for the Korean students.  The job sounded interesting.  I am going to look into it further.  If I decide to do it, I would leave in August for a year.  I would have my son check on the house while I am away.  The job pays $25,000/year and includes room, board, AND insurance.  Another perk:  I could visit my daughter and her family; they have an assignment there this summer!  I think it would be such an adventure to teach in South Korea.  I could stay here and still be unemployed.
It is very cold outside.  
Have a great night!

I was so glad that Friday finally arrived.  You will never believe how busy I am with this Long Term Sub job.  I get to school early so I can do cross walk duty from 7:15-7:45am.  Then I get the students into the classroom at 7:55, but usually there are about half a dozen already hanging out in the classroom.  Then I take roll and do the Pledge and we are off again to put the flag up.  Then back in the classroom until 11:30am.  I have recess duty everyday from 11:30am to noon.  Lunch is from noon to 12:30.  The regular teacher always ate in the cafeteria with his students.  I have been doing that, but I think I am going to have to have some ""me"" time during this time.  After lunch we are back in the classroom until the day ends.  My class is also responsible for lowering the flag so this is a hectic time.  We lower the flag and return to the classroom to pack up and leave.  Whew!  I am going to be busy until this assignment ends.  However, I am grateful to have a permanent home from now until the assignment ends.  No more 4:30am wake up calls telling me where to be each morning.  However, I do get up between 4:30 and 5am just to get my day started.  I have a 5th/6th grade class.  I have 12 5th graders and 7 6th graders.  They each have a grade level reading textbook.  I teach 5th grade math, and the principal/former teacher takes the 6th graders for math.  I also have 6th graders only for Math Focus (prep for the state assessments) and American History.  This week the former teacher did all the planning to make the transition easy for me.  I get to start planning starting this week.  However, I am in a dilemma.  The class each receives a 25 word spelling list, but they are never tested.  I think I will change this.  I think it is fruitless to give a spelling list and not hold them accountable.  How will they ever learn to spell the words correctly?  They are also responsible for writing their reading vocabulary words.  They write the word.  Break the word into syllables.  Write the definition of the word.  Write a sentence with the word.  Last, they write the word 3 times each.  They are never tested on these words either.  I think this should change, too.  I asked the former teacher specifically about these items. He said I could do it my way, but he quickly let me know the kids could not do 25 spelling words AND 8 vocabulary words.  I will can make this work.  I am thinking they will be held accountable for 18 spelling words and  2 vocabulary words (or 15 spelling words and 5 vocabulary words).  What do you think?  I think accountability is important or just eliminate the spelling words and vocabulary words altogether.  I think is it ""busy work"" if the students are not measured on their knowledge.

Title: The Dry Grass of August
Author: Anna Jean Mayhew
# of pages: 279
Genre: Literary Fiction
 
Literary Fiction is a term for more serious fiction. I had to Google it to figure out why the author called her book “Literary Fiction”. I would have called it “Historical Fiction”, but after researching “Literary Fiction,” it is definitely not Historical Fiction. Calling this book ‘Historical Fiction’ would be a disservice to the author.
 
Literary Fiction focuses more on the character(s) than the plot. ‘The Dry Grass of August’ tells a story set in the early 1950s during the time of segregation. The Watts’ family of six, four children (Stell, Jubie, Puddin’, and Davie) and the parents, reside in Charlotte, NC. They have a maid, Mary, referred to in the book as “their girl”.
 
The story is told through the eyes of the second oldest daughter, Jubie. The reader will experience segregation and the cruel treatment of the black people during this time period. Mary could not eat in restaurants or sleep in the same motel room as her white family, despite her being the “rock” for her white family.
 
Readers will become very involved in this book. Stell is the typical 16 year old. She is into looking nice and impressing the boys. Jubie is 13 and is very close to the maid, Mary. Puddin’ and Davie are the younger children. The reader will read about infidelity (yep – it existed back then, too!), dishonest business procedures (Mr. Watts had his own business), murder, abuse in the family, etc. There are a lot of characters in this book and each has his/her own distinct personality. This is a hard book to put down, because you get hooked right away.

How in the world I decided to put his movie into my Netflix queue puzzles me!  However, it was not a bad movie!
Last weekend, I saw my first 3D movie, The Lorax.  I went with my son, his wife, and Isabella.  Wow!  3-D is a ""whole other dimension""!  It was awesome!  I want to go see ""Titanic""; it is being re-released in 3D!  I am sure I will feel like I am on the ship!
Sorry I have not been writing lately, but I have been swamped with life.  I am still alive and well.  It is beautiful in CO Springs, Colorado, today!  I am just chilling and taking the whole weekend to myself.  The time changes tomorrow, so I am sure I will be dragging with the ""loss of an hour""….lol.

This whole entire week was wonderful; it was Spring Break!  My friend from Kentucky came to visit me!  We had so much fun just visiting, talking, and enjoying our time together.  I went to swimming lessons with her when we were so young…so long ago.  I think we were about 9 and 10 years old.
I took her out to her first 3D movie!  We saw Journey 2: Mysterious Island.  She loved it!  
She also met my daughter-in-law and my two grandchildren.  My son is in Costa Rica on a mission so she missed out on meeting him.
I am enjoying these last few days of Spring Break b4 school starts up again on Monday.  My friend left on Thursday.  
I am headed over to the library to get me a copy of the Colorado 2011 State Tax Form.  My federal is completed.  I plan to mail it in after I get the info off of it that I need for the State Form.  I am getting a small refund from state and I owe a small amount to Federal.  
I think I have almost decided to punt teaching out the window.  I need a full-time job with benefits.  I plan to drop off my technical (defense contracting work) resume at a staffing agency to see if can ""hook"" a job.  Defense contracting is not a fulfilling job, but it does pay the bills.
At the moment, I am in a Long Term Sub job until 22 May unless they hire a new principal.  If they hire a new principal, the regular teacher will return to this class.  He is the interim principal at the moment.  I am blessed to have this job and a place to call ""home"" everyday at this school.
The Mega Millions’ jackpot of $460 million caused a frenzy at the local retailers.  People were scurrying to buy tickets.  The 3 winners reside in IL, KS, and MD.  I bought two tickets.  Hey!  I had to be a part of the ""frenzy""!

I am subbing in Middle School Social Studies tomorrow.  I am brainstorming a backup lesson plan in case I need one.  Any ideas?  I was thinking of having the students use index cards and list 3 things they enjoyed learning about in Social Studies, 2 things they would like to learn more about, and 1 thing they found uninteresting/1 thing they did not learn but would like to learn.  Another idea is to have them write about a current event that took place during this school year that they found interesting (i.e. anything in the news).  My last idea is to have them write a letter to the incoming students to give them advice on how to do their best in Social Studies class in the upcoming 2012-2013 school year.  I thought about also letting them make a time capsule that they can collect next year.  The time capsule would describe them, what classes they like, type of music they like, what they thought was the most interesting thing they learned in school this year, etc. Maybe they can make predictions about the upcoming school year.
I would love any other creative ideas.

Well, it was fun playing BINGO last night.  I have not played in so long.  They have the digital boards now.  I used the old-fashioned paper cards.  The jackpot was $1000 and a single winner won it!  Several pots had to be split.  My friends won $75, $100, and $125.  They are big spenders at BINGO.  I bought a single pack for $8 and 5 of the Blazing Balls ($5).  I also bought a soda for $1 and a Blotter for $2.  I brought $20 and came home with $4.  When you live in the donut hole, you have to budget your luxuries…lol.  I think I will go again this summer.  It was relaxing and NO SMOKERS!  I think I will go out for breakfast with my leftover $4.

Thanks for your kind words. I think I will buy some lavender spray. I always heard that ""lavender"" helps you sleep. Last night I took the generic brand of Tylenol PM from Walgreens. I got some sleep, but I would rather have the old-fashioned sleep without any meds 🙁 because sometimes the sleep meds make me tired all day. I have tried the sleepy time tea, but it doesn’t work for me.
On another note, I watched ""We Bought a Zoo"" with Matt Damon. It is a wonderful ""feel good"" movie for the family! Check it out. I got it from the library.
I also signed up with a temp agency last week. I hope something pans out for the summer. I may just go home to GA for a visit to ""get away from it all"" for a few weeks.
I downloaded all the paperwork to teach in Korea. It is ALOT of paperwork. I think I will tackle that project slowly. My daughter and her family will arrive in Korea in July. This is the incentive to teach in Korea — family!
My daughter in Germany wants to fly me out to visit next summer. Wow! I am looking forward to that adventure, too! I need to start building my ""fun money account"" for Germany!
My son and his family came over yesterday. I invited them over for breakfast. It was a wonderful visit. We had eggs, grits, bacon, home made hash brown potatoes, and biscuits. We had a blast! Then Isabella stayed with me for a couple hours. She enjoys the time we have together without her new baby brother…lol. She is a great Big Sister, but she likes her time alone with Gramma.
Oh! I stumbled across a great book, The Noticer. It is supposed to be a life-changing book. It is about ""perspective"". ""Sometimes, all a person needs is a little perspective. (The Noticer)"" The first chapter definitely makes you start thinking about life. I am already reconsidering leaving teaching. I became a teacher only to find the economy tanked and the jobs are not there. Subbing is not the same. I guess it is time to move on and use some of the other skills I have acquired in my lifetime. It is all about ""perspective"" – the ""big picture."" Teaching was never meant to be for me in this lifetime. Maybe down the road I will be in a different job that requires me to ""train"" someone or others.
Time to hit the shower and greet this new day! 
P.S. Remember – it is all about ""perspective."" ""Incidentally,"" he said with a smirk. ""you ate sardines and Vienna sausages in the sand. I dined on surf and turf with an ocean view."" He slapped me on the back. ""It’s all about perspective."" (The Noticer) 
As for me, I took a break in life to try teaching. I learned a lot. It was fun. Now, my break is over, and I need to move on. The temp agency told me that I still have access to my security clearances so that is a BIG PLUS for me. I wonder what the summer has in store for me. I don’t know, but I do know that today is another day to be filled with adventures.  Today, I have a new movie to watch, ""Blue Valentine.""  Steve Gosling is in it.
Oh!  When I think about teaching and life, I realize that we teach everyday…like when I helped a person learn to use the Automated Postal Center at the Post Office.  Also, the time I helped someone choose a printer to purchase.  Don’t forget the times that we teach different life lessons to our children and grandchildren.  Heck!  You don’t need a teaching license to do those important things.  I spent too much money going to school to get licensed to teach…bah!  Life is the greatest teacher.  Again, it is all about perspective.  I wish I could sell my teacher’s license on craigslist or Ebay…lol.  Then I could start my ""fun money account"" for Germany.  Then again, it wouldn’t sell, because the teacher job market is non-existent.  So, I will file it away…like I do my tax returns each year.
Have a Super Summer Sunday!

Well, people, I don’t know if I am going to survive in this job at Walmart.  The training was going well, but then they threw us out onto the floor with snaking lines of people.  Our trainer had told all of us last week that we ARE NOT ready to be on the floor alone.  She told us this on Thursday, and I was out put out on the floor on Saturday!  OMG!  I immediately went into ""survival mode"" on my register! However, this is nothing compared to what happened Sunday….I was in the ""Women’s"" bathroom and a male walked out of the ""handicapped stall""!  Definitely a Kodak moment.  Today is my much needed day off.  I think I might lose my mind!!  At least I KNOW the difference between the bathrooms.  He should have noticed there were NO urinals in the ""Women’s"" bathroom.

I cut most of the back yard. I have about 20 minutes left of work to finish the rest. I will do it before I go to work tomorrow. I am working a couple 12-9pm shifts on Wednesday and Thursday, then I am off on Friday again. I work Saturday and Sunday from 12-9pm again. I think this work thing will get better when I am totally trained and feel comfortable on the register, but until then…it is always an adventure…lol. I put in for 28 Jul – 11 Aug to take time off. I want to go to GA to visit my Mom and brothers. I think if they decline, I will have to leave Wally World. Family is too important to me. What do you think?

Tonite was not so bad at Walmart. Time flew! I had some irate customers, but I have to remember that is life in retail. One guy got very mad when I told him my register was closed. It was after 9pm and I closed my register at 8:54pm ish. I told the last customer in my line that I was closing, but I didn’t put up a ""This register is closed"" sign. I did turn off my light. I guess this is another lesson learned. Life is so full of lessons!
So, I stopped in at Walgreens tonite after work. I have done something to my right arm. The elbow area hurts when I try to do things. Maybe I have a pinched nerve? I have no clue how I did this! So it is very painful at times. I decided to pick up some Aleve at Walgreens after work. Guess what?! Two customers approached me for help finding products! I guess all us retail personnel all look alike…lol. One lady had Shingles and was in extreme pain. I brought her over to a chair to rest. I then went and got a Walgreens employee to help me find the product for the ill customer. As I was looking at the Aleve, another customer asked me where she could find some gauze. I thought I would NEVER get home tonite.
P.S. I prayed before going to work and asked God to help me, and He did!
Have a great Thursday.  I am headed to bed.

So I cooked a nice southern breakfast today, grits, eggs, and bacon (turkey bacon).  As I was making my grits, I had to smile.  A lady in line at Walmart recently purchased grits.  As I was checking her items, I commented on how I loved grits.  She leaned over the counter and told me she was buying it to KILL ants!  OMG!  Someone told her grits kill ants.  Well, the moral to the story is, ‘Grits may kill ants, but it doesn’t work on humans….’….lol.  My cheesy grits were very tasty today!

…if Walmart would get upset with me if I brought some money to work each night and helped out people who don’t have enough money to pay for their groceries. A young Dad came through my line last night and did not have enough money to buy all his baby items (diapers, wipes, dry formula, bottled formula, etc.) I voided everything out except the bottled formula and he was seven cents short (after using a gift card with about $6 on it and all the cash he had in his pocket). He asked people in line for the seven cents, and eventually someone came forward and gave him the change. IF I brought extra money to work each night, like $2-$3 in change, I could make a difference in someone’s life. I think I am going to do it. Who cares what Walmart thinks! What would happen if I used my own debit card to help someone out? I guess I will have to do it and find out. Times are hard for everyone, but if everyone helped out a ""little bit"", it would be easier for most folks. Trust me; I am not RICH. I work two jobs, but I understand the meaning of ""helping out if you can"". Here’s an idea, next time you go to Walmart or ANYWHERE, help someone out. This act of kindness will go a long ways! Let’s see how we can put some ""drops"" into the empty buckets of others. When you throw drops into others’ buckets, you inadvertently fill your own bucket, too! It is all about doing the ""right thing"". Right?  Maybe I should buy a Walmart card and load it with $20 and use it to ""help"" others that cannot afford their groceries.  What do you think?  I know if someone ever helped me out that I would ""pay it forward"" and do the same for someone else in need.  Maybe I am thinking too hard tonight.  Have a great Tuesday!

Remind me to tell you about what Walmart’s reaction was to my request to take a Leave of Absence for 30 days.  (I wanted to take the month of October off to spend time in GA with my Mom who is 87 years old.)  Keep in mind that I am very part-time (12 hours/week).  I was quite surprised to say the least.  It definitely explains the ""high turnover rate"" at Walmart.

So I am home today taking care of ""me""!  I decided that I needed a day to relax.  I am watching ""Narnia: The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe"".  I got interested in this when I was doing a read-aloud with the book in August.  I was reading it to a 4th grade class during a 2.5 week assignment.  I ended up buying the book because the library was too slow in getting it to me.  It was an awesome, detailed read!  Now, I am watching the movie.  I have paused it so I can stroll to the kitchen to fix something to eat.
The Walmart Story:  So Walmart told me I was not working long enough to ask for a Leave of Absence.  I have to be with Walmart a year to take a 30 day Leave of Absence.  However, they did talk to the manager, and I can take a two week vacation.  Walmart has been very flexible in giving me two weeks in August and now in October.  They have also been very flexible in letting me reduce my hours to 12 hours/week due to teaching.  So all in all, I can’t complain at all.  October 16th I am leaving for GA.  Yay!  I am sticking with Walmart, because next summer I will need a job again.  Also, in June, 2013, I will have been with them a year.  I need to plan to take time off in August for my daughter’s wedding in NC.  Since I will be in NC; I have decided to go down to GA for some time, too.
Gotta run and get some chow and get back to my movie.  Have a great week!

Wow! Where does the time go? I have been so busy that I have not had too much time to write.
First, I met an interesting customer at Walmart. She was buying a tortoise Halloween costume for her pet tortoise. Imagine that! So we got into an interesting discussion about her pet tortoise. By the way, this conversation took place AFTER I had clocked out for the evening. I was so amazed hearing about her pet. His name is Anonda, and she has had him for 15 years! I encouraged her to bring him to the local schools for a presentation. I think children would really enjoy the break from being taught how to pass the state exams! We had to eventually exchange phone numbers, because customers continually approached me to help them locate items (remember…I was NOT working; I was done for the night). So I plan to take Isabella over to see him when he awakens from his hibernation in May. Yes, tortoises hibernate like bears.
Next, I am reading a great book, The Five Secrets You Need to Discover Before You Die. I don’t have the time to read a lot these days, but I am enjoying reading a few pages when I can. The author interviewed several people between the ages of 59 and 104. He felt these were the people who have lived long enough to share what had they discovered about living a meaningful life and feeling connected. So I plan to bring it on my trip home to GA.
Last but not least, the time has come for me to pack up and go to GA. I took today off to pack and relax. I leave tomorrow. I am excited to be going home again. This time I get TWO weeks! I have decided to try and go home every 4 months, if I have not secured a job.
Subbing is keeping me busy, and Walmart proves to be an interesting place to work every weekend. I met a woman that has worked for Walmart for 24 years last night. She works in their ""international"" department. She is preparing for a trip to India. I think I would like to research that area of Walmart. I like to travel and obviously this ""teaching"" dream is going nowhere.
Have a great week! Maybe I will have more time to write when I go to GA 🙂

Well, I had a great trip from Denver to Georgia. Both planes were on-time. I had a 2.5 hour delay in Atlanta, but I passed the time with a lady I met on the plane. She was very interesting.
I might post some pics from this trip. There are some interesting Halloween gourd people hanging about the town square. They are interesting and festive.
I cooked a big southern breakfast with one of my brothers today. I got up before 5am to get it started since both of my brothers are working. One helped me with the sausage and bacon! We had grits, biscuits, sausage, bacon, and coffee. I was beat so I took mid-morning nap after watching ""The Help"" with my mom. She dozed off and on through out the movie, but she said she did enjoy it.
I brought some more movies along, too. I shopped at Walmart b4 leaving CO. I love the 10% Walmart Associate discount. I brought ""I Love Lucy: The Complete Season 1"" collection and ""The Exotic Marigold Hotel"". Mom loves ""I Love Lucy"" so we will have fun watching that, too.
I think today, I will walk about this small town of 4,500 people and take some interesting pictures. The weather is NICE! It is 81 degrees with 59% humidity.
Oh! My cell phone rang in the Atlanta, Georgia airport. I picked up a sub job for 15-16 Nov. It is for Middle School Social Studies. So, it pays for me to allow schools to contact my cell phone while I am away. So far, I have 4 days booked to sub in November. There are only 17 days available to teach in November since Thanksgiving week is now ""vacation"" for most teachers. 
I checked my Walmart schedule and they have already booked me to work on 2 Nov. Most likely I will be working every weekend again at Walmart.
As for now, I am on v-a-c-a-t-i-o-n and nothing else really matters to me at the moment.
Have a great rest of the week!

I am back from my vacation visiting family in GA. I had a great time. The highlights of my trip were: Eating lunch with my mom and younger brother at Golden Corral, taking mom shopping and getting treats at the DQ, and spending time with my older brother. I really enjoyed cooking for Mom and having Mom and Daughter time.
I have been reading an interesting book. I wrote about it when I was in GA, but the entry did not save, so you were unable to read it. The book title is ""The Five Secrets You Must Discover Before You Die"". The secrets are basically things we know but never stop and think about them. The author interviewed 235 people between the ages of 60 and 105. His original sample was 15,000 people! He felt that people in this age range had lived long enough to share about their lives. If you want to know the Five Secrets, I will tell you in another entry. However, I thought it would be interesting to post an entry about each of the questions the author asked these people which resulted in his great book.
One of the quotes that I found profound was a quote from an elderly man: ""I spent most of my life on things. People always came in a distant second in terms of my priorities. Now I realize that my BMW doesn’t come visit me in the nursing home."" 
This book is amazing. I would like to start a book discussion!
So here is the first question for you to ponder from The Five Secrets You Must Discover Before You Die.
Pretend that you are at a dinner party, and everyone is sitting in a circle. The host invites each person to take just a few minutes to describe the life he or she has lived. If you were at the party and you wanted people to know as much about your life as possible in those few minutes, what would you say? Describe the life you have lived thus far.

Why does Walmart sell condoms locked in a security container.  I was trying to find the UPC code to scan, and I am sure the gentleman buying them was uneasy and thought I was being nosy.  Hey!  I was just doing my job!  Good for him that I didn’t pick up the phone and announce ""Price check on register 2 for condoms..asap""…lol.

 My co-workers have been telling me their hours are being cut at Walmart.  I was surprised since it IS the HOLIDAY season!  Well, after Christmas, they will be cutting mine to 8 hours a week.  I wonder if it is worth it?  I will stick around because soon summer will be here and I will need a summer job.  What do you think?  I do enjoy it; I am a people person.  If you don’t like people, Walmart is NOT the place for you to work.  People can be rude sometimes…sometimes MORE than sometimes.
I picked up a half day sub assignment today.  I am up early to do some more baking.  Everyone loves a late Christmas box of munchies.  I am doing the scoop and drop cookies right out of a cookie dough tub.  Don’t laugh!  People ask for the recipe all the time.  So far, I have made white chocolate macadamia nut.  I have some ginger molasses cooking in the oven now.  However, I did make from scratch some seven layer dream bites and mini pecan pie tassies.  Not to mention that I have some cookie dough tubs of sugar cookies, chocolate chunk, and oatmeal cranberry still in the freezer! 
On a better note, I have mailed my presents out to my daughter in S. Korea and she already received them.  Her twin sister will be in Minnesota for XMAS, and I hope to get her package in the mail today or tomorrow.  My son and his family live up the road, so I will be delivering their packages on XMAS Eve when we have dinner together.  My son Jake is in my heart so he knows I never forget him.  I wonder what a 21 year old would want for XMAS?  Jake would have been 21 this past May…sigh.  
Oh!  My mom received her present last week.  My brothers will get baked goodies and/or gift certificates to the Waffle House…it is a Southern thing…you have to be there to ""get it""…lol.  
I have a few XMAS cards to put in the mail, too.  I don’t mail stacks of cards out.  I mail one out when I receive one. I am not cheap…just practical.  I have received 5 already.  I think people just call and email these days to wish their friends a ""Merry Christmas""….
I still need to put together at least one ""blessing bag"" to give to a homeless person.  Money is so tight at the moment.  I am so ""broke"" I make Humpty Dumpty look ""chipped"".  I do manage to get the day to day expenses met and keep hoping for a full-time job.  Maybe Santa will bring me one.  ""All I want for Christmas…..is a full time job…""

A friend and I met a local Watkins distributor at Starbucks on Thursday night.  I picked up a catalog; I had emailed him to advise him that I did not want the ""pressure"" to ""sign up"" with the business.  Now, I am thinking about trying the products soon.  My friend is going to order with me.  I think most people want to ""sign people up"" instead of sell the product.  I am not the ""door to door or bug my friends"" kinda of person.  If I signed up, I would display the products at flea markets and craft fairs.  At this point, I am just toying with trying the products.  They have the sample product deal for $9.99.

This young lady comes through my line with a couple of relatives. They were all together with separate purchases.  However, SHE was quite the comedian.  When I scanned her beer, she said, ""Now don’t be asking me for no ID because I don’t have one.""  
I smiled and said, ""I need to see your ID.""
Then she started accosting people in the store by yelling, ""Hey! Do you have an ID I can borrow?  I don’t have mine.""…LOL
My supervisor passed by my register and she asked HER, too!  OMG!
All this time, she was retrieving her ID from her purse.  She was 27 years old.
As I totaled her order ($16.03), she was trying to retrieve 3 pennies from her purse, but at the same time, she was hollering to passing customers, ""Hey! Do you have a $1? I need a $1!""  
She really made my night entertaining.  I told her to come through my line each time she came to shop, because I needed some fun customers.  She said she would.  I hope she stops in tonite, too!

 Wal-Mart scheduled me to work on Friday night, 1 Feb.  Maybe the cut in hours was a temporary thing for all employees.  I also got a 15 cent raise since the minimum wage was increased this year.  However, Wal-Mart pays more than minimum wage.  Colorado minimum wage is $7.78 for regular employees, and $4.76 for tipped employees. 
Money is so tight right now that I have volunteered to work at Wal-Mart on Martin Luther King Day and President’s Day since I will not be subbing on those days.  I might volunteer to work on Spring Break, too.  I am so ""broke"", I make Humpty Dumpty look ""chipped"".  However, I have managed my meager funds so well and most people think I have no financial issues.  This is a good thing except for when people want me to ""spot"" them a few bucks here and there.  I am so thankful that I don’t have four children to provide for during these tough times.  However, I am sure we would be OK…just more stressed than usual. 
Have a great OD week!  It is 6:21am and no sub calls yet!  Thank goodness because I need to still get dressed….lol.  I think I will fix a nice breakfast of waffles and sausage AND coffee! 
P.S. I watched ""New Year’s Eve"".  It was an old new release. (Now does this make sense?)  Anyway, it was a great movie with some great  stars (Ashton Kutcher, Jessica Biel, Bon Jovi, etc.)  I got it from the library in their ""Rapid View"" DVD section.  You get these DVDs for three days.  
I also watched a documentary on Susan Boyle.  It was on NetFlix. I never knew she suffered brain damage when she was born. She is an awesome singer and has raked in some $ with all her records!  She lives in her childhood home, all alone.  She also bought a new home called the ""Posh House"" not too far from her childhood home.  She keeps all her memorabilia from her singing career in the the Posh House.  
Additionally, I watched ""Dave and Monica"" on NetFlix, too.  It was very interesting.  It is a moving documentary about a Down’s Syndrome couple that got married.  Very touching.  The parents were so supportive.

 Why do some teachers choose to ignore students who are ""low"" in academics?  
I subbed in a  3rd grade classroom last week.  The very young teacher was there to give me the lesson plan and comment on students.  She commented on a student:  ""He is very low.  If he doesn’t do the work the rest of the class is doing, just ignore him.  That is what I do.""  
So readers, how would you feel if you had a teacher that chose to ignore your child in school?  OMG!  I would be there in a meeting with the teacher and the principal!  
So here is the amazing thing that I saw that afternoon.  I was reading a book to the students about the life cycle of a butterfly.  I would stop periodically and review with the students to see if they were listening.  They WERE listening and responded well. Next, the amazing thing occurred!  The student who was supposedly ""low"" handed in some work.  He did not write about the stages, but he drew me pictures!  I looked at his work and praised him.  OMG!  I connected with this little guy.  I think because his regular teacher has such low expectations for him that is why he does not participate in her class.  His performance made MY day!
It is a day like this that makes subbing worthwhile.  However, these days are rare!  I was validated as a teacher on that day, in that school, by a little boy that had been mislabeled by a young teacher.  I wonder where this little boy will be academically at the end of the year?  I hope someone rescues him from that classroom…sooner than later.

 One day in February, I was subbing in a 3rd grade classroom.  The children noticed people looking in the door.  I told them to get away from the door so I could see who was there.  I opened the door and saw some people outside my door.  There was a soldier, an older woman, a younger woman, and one or two small children.  They said they were there to pick up a student.  His uncle had just arrived from Afghanistan.  I called out the student’s name.  The student looked at me as if he were in trouble.  I said, ""You have a visitor.""  He looked confused and in walked the soldier, his uncle. OMG!  It was a Kodak moment.  The student flew across the classroom and leaped into his uncle’s arms.  He hugged him tight and could not stop crying.  I was crying, too.  Now, I have experienced this first hand.  I have always seen these scenes on the news, but I experienced it first hand last month.  Writing this makes me cry all over again.  Got to get some tissues.

 I applied for 3 jobs yesterday.  Subbing has been slow due to state assessments.  
I applied to be a tutor with CLUB Z, I sent my resume to a store that sells teacher products (they are looking for a permanent part-time sales person with a teaching background (me!) and retail experience (me! since I have been working at Wal-Mart for almost 9 months), and the last job I applied for was a long term sub for the last three months of this school year.  Keep your fingers crossed for me!  
Oh, I sent in my letter of interest and application to go to Daegu S. Korea to work in the English Immersion Village, too!  They contacted me and the next step is to discuss getting a visa.  So..I am on a roll with putting ""irons in the fire""!  
I think working at the teacher store is more hours but less pay than Wal-Mart.  However, it is closer to home and the parking lot is probably much safer!  I would be working until 7:30 pm 3-4 nights a week and about 3 Saturdays a month (9 am – 6 pm).  I think I would enjoy it.  There are no medical benefits, but I am still about 15 months away from getting benefits from Wal-Mart.  Wal-Mart pays more than minimum wage, and I know this teacher store does not.  Decisions…decisions….  
Oh!  I watched the documentary about Wal-Mart:  Wal-Mart: The High Cost of Low Prices.  It was scary because I could relate to some of it!  Watch it when you get a chance.  Maybe it is time to bail!  The documentary said the benefits were expensive and you still have to pay at the doctor’s office.  I guess it is a co-payment. I pay over $400/month for a personal medical policy with Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield, AND I also have co-payments.  
I guess what really bothered me about the Wal-Mart documentary was the dishonesty with the time-cards.  Management alters time-cards so they don’t have to pay over-time.  For example, if you worked 42 hours one week, they would take the two hours overtime and put them on the next week.  I am only part-time, so I don’t have to worry about it, but it is so dishonest.  Also, Wal-Mart had numerous outstanding lawsuits against time.  Wow!  What an eye-opener that documentary was to me!
Well, have a great Thursday!  I am going to be a PE teacher today.  I am dressed in my Curves workout clothes!  I love the casual dress code for PE teachers.  Plus!  The children LOVE PE so there is rarely any discipline issues unless it is for poor sportsmanship.  Today is supposed to be in the 50s outside, too!  Woot!

They needed to buy the ""store brand cheese (Great Value)"".  I mentioned this to the sister and she ""sighed"".  I told her I would call for assistance.  I guess she was ready to leave Wal-Mart, so she started to leave and get the right cheese.  She probably walked about 3-4 steps away, then rushed back to the cart and said, ""What am I doing?!  I can’t LEAVE the BABY!""  It was so funny.  Of course, I would have offered to watch the baby, but I am a stranger.  The baby might have started crying.  Anyway, her sister returned with the juice, and assistance brought me the right cheese.  So another night at Wal-Mart, another few dollars earned, and another funny incident.
Oh!  My Discovery Toys ""Launch Party"" was yesterday.  It was so much fun!  I had 4 guests plus my Discovery Toys ""manager"".  I made several different types of breakfast muffins (apple-cinnamon, raspberry, and blueberry) and my neighbor (one of my guests) brought over some home-made breakfast burritos.  The tortillas were home-made, too.  I also had $144 in sales (I was short the $56 to get half-price on one item to add to my sub bag), but I had fun and enjoyed the show and interaction with my friends.  There is still the chance guests that did not attend the party will order from my website before the party closes on Tuesday.  Keep your fingers crossed!  I like the new ""Audio Bingo"" game by Discovery Toys.  You listen to a CD and whatever animal sound you hear that matches an animal on your puzzle, you cover that animal!  How much fun is that for smaller children!?  I guess I am a big kid!
Have a great Sunday.  Remember to turn your clocks ahead one hours to ""Spring Forward!"" 
Note:  One of the guests at my party suggested I take my Wal-Mart experience and apply at Best Buy.  Apparently, Best Buy pays their cashiers $10.50/hour.  Hmmm…now THAT sounds enticing to me!

I was eating lunch today at a Chinese restaurant, and I discovered a great idea!  I have the perfect line for any future teacher job interviews!  
You know how they always ask that intimidating question:  Tell us why you are the best candidate for this position. My answer will now be:  According to the Chinese Zodiac, I was born in the Year of the Dog.  I am honest, loyal, and play well with others.  I would be a great asset to your team.

 …has passed by since my last entry.  Where to begin?  What to say?
Well, I am staying busy with subbing and Wal-Mart.  I really am enjoying learning about Discovery Toys.  I got my first bonu$ check from Discovery Toys this week!  Not anything to break the bank, but proof that this is a solid company with a doable business plan.  
We are having some cold, blizzard like weather in Colorado Springs.  I stayed home today.  I didn’t feel like driving in this mess.  I have applied for a couple teaching jobs on-line today, so my day has not been totally wasted. 
I finished and filed my taxes before the deadline.  I owed both State and Federal taxes, but what else is new, right?  It was less than $500 total, but it would have been nice to break even or owe nothing at all.  Next year with be interesting with all the tax changes this year, 2013.  
I subbed in an unprofessional school last week.  The principal was totally rude to me.  It is her loss.  I am not going back. Apparently the Kindergarten sub was more an ""intermediate"" teacher and she was planning on swapping my 5th grade assignment to his Kindergarten assignment.  I basically said I was an intermediate teacher, too.  She blew up and walked out of the classroom.  She returned later to give me a side hug and apologize for her behavior.  I am glad she recognized her unprofessional behavior, but I don’t plan to go back there.    The teachers gossiped in the teachers’ lounge and the front office receptionist was seriously lacking in customer service skills.  The 5th grade class was awesome!  I enjoyed my day.  I love the flexibility of subbing.  I can pick and choose my assignments based on past experience.  
I am going home to GA for a week in May.  My Mom is celebrating her 88th bday!  I plan to make her a jello cake!  She doesn’t know I am coming yet.  I plan to drop her a line in the mail soon.  
I will be attending my daughter’s August wedding in NC.  Her Dad is planning it.  I will see both my daughters!  Both are coming home for the wedding.  One is coming from Germany, and the other is coming from South Korea.  I will see my grandson from South Korea, too!  It will have been almost 18 months by the time I see him in August!  
I have been doing a lot of soul searching lately.  After 5 years without a teaching job, maybe it is time to ""throw in the towel"".  What do you think?  
I have made myself available to work any hours at Wal-Mart starting on May 12.  The closer it gets to the end of the year, teaching/subbing is more like babysitting and classroom control.  Yep, it is time to bale!  
Well, I guess I better jump off of here.  
Remember to visit my website before May 1st.  Discovery Toys is supporting Autism by donating money to Autism Speaks when certain toys are purchased.  Visit my website, too, if you have children in your lives and want toys that serve a purpose!  Birthdays?  Early Christmas shopping?  Just stop by to peek, too!

 So, I am awake, because of my hectic schedule.  I worked on Friday night til 10pm and was back at Wal-Mart at 7am on Saturday.  I came got home after 4pm and crashed.  I woke up hungry, so here I am.  
Wal-Mart is keeping me busy.  I was training a new cashier on Friday night.  I guess it is ""OJT"" now for the ""newbies"".  We are having quite a turnover of cashiers.  I would say half or less than half of the 10 people that were hired with me last June are still at Wal-Mart.  
I received my first formal feedback on May 10.  It was great!  I received a high rating in customer service.  They gave me a 40 cent raise.  
I guess I bagged some Downy with some ""gas"" pills (Beano?) recently and a customer complained.  I would think pills would be wrapped securely in plastic wrap, right?  Oh well, I guess the Downy leaked and got on the pills?  Nothing beats the aroma of a Downy fart, right?  I just have to be careful next time.  I still can’t imagine Downy getting to the pills, can you? 
I went home to GA for my Mom’s 88th bday this month.  It was a fast week.  I had a great time.  She had a wonderful bday party with all of her kids present and three of her eight grandchildren there.  
I am wondering if it is time to leave CO and go home.  I could work at Wal-Mart in GA and sub there as easily as I can here.  The cost of living is much cheaper, too.  
I have applied for several teaching jobs since I last wrote in OD.  I have had no luck with that.  Oh!  I guess I can practice teaching as I train new cashiers, huh?…LOL.  
I guess, since I am awake, I could apply for some more teaching jobs…or maybe read.  Reading sounds more fulfilling at the moment.

 A customer at Wal-Mart came through my line last night.  As usual, I asked how he was doing.  He didn’t look like he was doing too well.  
He said, ""I had a baby last night!"".  
I looked at him with a surprised look and he said, ""I didn’t.  My old lady did.  She had the baby in the bathroom.  I didn’t even know she was pregnant.  I feel like I have PTSD."" 
Wow!  I asked him what he named his son and then congratulated him.  
It’s hard to believe he never knew she was pregnant.  He said she gained 10 lbs and has a condition that causes her periods to be erratic.  So, as Paul Harvey would have said, ""That’s the rest of the story.""

1250,https://www.opendiary.com/m/j8xmom/orphan-trains-did-exist-5369296/,2013-06-07,Orphan Trains Did Exist!,"
I finished a great book this week:  Orphan Train.  It is written by Christina Baker Kline.  Wow!  Very interesting.  This is a historical fiction novel about a teen, Molly, connecting with a 91 year old woman, Vivian.  I mean REALLY ""connecting"" here!  The teen is in and out of foster homes and finds herself doing community service by cleaning out this elderly woman’s attic.  The older woman was an ""orphan train rider"" from long ago.  Both these characters had a LOT in common!  Both were unwanted.
Orphan trains really existed!  These were trains that carried infants and children from New York to the the Midwest between the early 1850s and the late 1920s.  The purpose of the orphan trains was to find homes for these unwanted children and get them off the streets and out of orphanages back east.  During this period of time, approximately 200,000+ children were transported to the Midwest.  
So back to the story, the author weaves a great story between Vivian’s life from leaving NY to riding the orphan train and moving from household to household.  It is very sad at times.  Molly can relate because she has been in and out of several foster homes.  
This story keeps you interested from beginning to end.  I didn’t want it to end!  I was so intrigued about this period in history – one I had never heard about in my life that I researched another book to read.  I finished reading ‘Orphan Train Rider: One Boy’s True Story’ by Andrea Warren.  Amazing!  Simply amazing!  
Are you familiar with the ""Orphan Trains"" from long ago?

1252,https://www.opendiary.com/m/j8xmom/another-book-edit-5369298/,2013-06-17,Another Book (**Edit),"
 I cruised through the library to pick up two more books about the orphan trains, and I stumbled upon a very interesting book.  It was on the ""Staff Recommends"" book display.  The title is Cruel Harvest: A Memoir.  The author is Fran Elizabeth Grubb.  OMG!  This book is unbelievable!  It is about a migrant family.  Fran is about the middle child of six  children.  Their father is very abusive to the mother and children.  He sold one of them for $5 to a family member.  He killed another one, an infant.  He ended up in prison for awhile for sexually abusing his oldest daughter.  The mother had to give the children up due to neglect.  Prior to this, two of the older children (daughters – Brenda and Susie) left the household.  (The household was a bus!)  The father reappeared after his time in prison and reclaimed Fran and her sister (Nellie), who were living in an orphanage.  Their brother (Robbie) was placed with a family via Social Services.  The abusive cycle restarted.  Fran’s dad met a woman while working on one of the migrant farms.  She had a young daughter.  He hooked up with her and got her pregnant, bearing him another son.  His first son was sold to a family relative for $5.  The other son was placed with a family via Social Services.  Fran’s Dad had a ""mess of children"" and couldn’t take care of them.  He was an alcoholic.  He ""drank away the money"" earned in the fields.  
Anyway, Fran tells the story.  It is a very sad story.  She interweaves the story with her current life, as an adult trying to locate her siblings, and her miserable childhood.  
I finished the book last night.  Simply put – an amazing story!  Fran found God during her childhood and depended on him to save her and He did.  She is a Christian speaker and lives in SC.  She has two children of her own.  
You should read this book and find out what she discovers when she tries to relocate her siblings.  Did she find them?

 I see a few service dogs in Wal-Mart which I think are awesome.  One day, a customer made a remark about a little dog that was strutting his/her stuff in the store.  It was definitely not a service dog.  I call them ""radio  dogs"".  The customer was not pleased with animals in the store unless they were Service Animals.   Anyway, back to the ""radio dog"".  Remember, back in the day, when you could buy transistor radios that looked like stuffed animals?  You could set them on your bed for the ""decorative effect"" and turn the switch on and hear a radio station.  Anyway, I told the customer I would rather see a little dog instead of snakes.  Then I told them this story…A customer came through my line in the past month with a boa snake wrapped around his neck.  The snake had great eye contact with me!  OMG!  I thought I was going to faint in the Speedy Check-out Lane!

 I really can’t shop at Kroger’s anymore.
Yesterday, I was at my local Kroger buying a large bag of Purina dog chow for my loyal pet, Jake, the Wonder Dog, and was in the check-out line when the woman behind me asked if I had a dog.   What did she think I had – an elephant?  So because I’m retired and have little to do, on impulse I told her that no, I didn’t have a dog, I was starting the Purina Diet again.  I added that I probably shouldn’t, because I ended up in the hospital last time, but that I’d lost 50 pounds before I awakened in an intensive care ward with tubes coming out of most of my orifices and IVs in both arms.  I told her that it was essentially a perfect diet and that the way that it works is, to load your pant’s pockets with Purina nuggets and simply eat one or two every time you feel hungry.  The food is nutritionally complete so it works well and I was going to try it again.  (I have to mention here that practically everyone in line was now enthralled with my story.)  Horrified, she asked if I ended up in intensive care because the dog food poisoned me. I told her no, I stopped to pee on a fire hydrant and a car hit me. I thought the guy behind her was going to have a heart attack he was laughing so hard.
Kroger won’t let me shop there anymore. Better watch what you ask retired people. We have all the time in the world to think of crazy things to say. Forward this (especially) to all your retired friends…it will be their laugh for the day!
Have a good day.

 I was having a late dinner tonite when I witnessed a painful scene.  A  rough looking guy came into Captain D’s with his young son.  The little boy was so excited to be eating out with his Dad.  He raced over to a booth across from me.  His Dad, sounding like drill sargeant, ordered him to move to another table.  The boy quickly moved and joined his Dad.  His Dad appeared to have had a bad day because he was so grumpy.  
""I love this restaurant!"" the little boy told his Dad.  The Dad continued to gripe about how the little boy should behave in the restaurant.  Trust me.  This little boy was NOT misbehaving.  Suddenly, he slipped off his seat onto the floor, under the table.  His Dad swiftly stooped to check on his son, slapped him on the face, and picked him up and sat him next to him.  
OMG!  The slap was so loud when the man’s hand hit his son’s cheek.  I winced when I saw and heard it.  I can’t get over it.  The little boy cried and looked over at me.  I wanted rescue him, but his Dad looked too scary.  I am sad tonite.  Why are some parents so mean?

Wow – I found the diary I started writing long ago when my youngest son passed in a tragic go-cart accident.  He was 9 years old.  I thought I could write something, but I can’t tonite.  I wonder where all my other entries are;  not all entries have showed up on this diary.
I am amazed how time has flown by and my son would be 27 years old now.  He would be an Uncle with one niece and three nephews from his siblings.  Maybe he would be married with kids.  We will never know what would be so we don’t dwell on that.
I am still here and still miss him.  It seems surreal at times to look at his last school picture. His siblings all served in the military.  One is still serving in the Air Force in SD.  All his siblings are married.  They all miss him, too.
If anyone is reading this and has any questions for me about losing a child.  I would be happy to answer them.  One thing for sure, I would NEVER, EVER wish this loss on even my worse enemy.  I don’t think I have any enemies, but I know this type of loss is hard.  Your heart is shattered forever and you will always wonder why.  I do know that you don’t put a question mark where God has put a period.  I do know that you never forget.  I do know the best thing you can do with a person that has gone through this is to be their friend, even if it means sitting in silence with no words.  Knowing you are there means a lot to them.  I also know that saying, “at least you have other children” minimizes my loss  and is a poor choice of words.  When people ask me how many children I have, I say four (he still counts).
Hope everyone had a nice Thanksgiving.

Hello Readers,
J*XMOM is popping in to say hello.
This September will be 22 years since I lost Jake in a tragic go-cart accident. He was nine years old. His sisters are now married.  One has three children. R is an attorney in child advocacy and B is serving our country in the USAF – currently living in Alaska.  As you will recall, his older brother, J, is married. He has two children. I have five grandchildren now and Jake missed out on being an Uncle to all these kids. Jake would have been a wonderful Uncle.
Jake celebrated his 31st birthday in Heaven in May. That was the twenty first birthday that he celebrated without us.
After all these years, I have learned many things about grief:

It never goes away and that is ok.
People will still remember him outside of family. I know this because I see items placed at his resting place.
I still hurt and that is ok.
It is ok to talk about him because he is still my son, a brother with living siblings, and two nieces and three nephews that need to know what a wonderful person he is (i say “is” because he lives on in our hearts).
Life goes on and I will always carry him in my heart wherever I go.

If I can help others through the difficult loss of a child or loved one, then I have honored my son, today and always.

May 14th came and went again. Unfortunately, it fell on Mother’s Day again as it has many times over the past 20+ years. Jake would have been 32 years old.
I wanted to share that I had a great dream about Jake a bit ago. He seemed so real! I could hear his voice that was silenced on September 24,2000 when he was involved in his tragic go-cart accident. It was an amazing dream. So amazing that I could not go back to sleep and started my day at 1:30am.
Another emotional event occurred in April. My grandson is now 12 and is into video game systems. He asked about the game systems Jake played as a kid. He really wanted to have them since they were his Uncle Jake’s. I gathered them up and cannot even begin to describe the pain it brought back just touching the game controllers he last touched when he was nine years old. I gathered his game systems, games and brought them to my grandson. The saddest thing was the last game Jake played on his game system was still in the system, Twisted Metal. After almost 23 years, it is still so painful.
Grief is so hard and the journey never stops. It takes breaks along the way, like we take breaks on road trips, but it is still there.
Have a great weekend!
