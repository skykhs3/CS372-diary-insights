I’m currently watching Saved!, which is both where the title comes from and a film I haven’t seen in years.
Last weekend was Eurovision!  It was a mixed bag this year, to be honest.  The winner was Loreen for Sweden, with Tattoo:

I’m not a fan.  It’s not the best, to be honest.  what it is is safe.  It also means that, coincidentally, the contest will be held in Sweden next year for the 50th anniversary of Abba winning.  I don’t think that the jury vote was rigged to allow that to happen, but I do think the choice of song was designed to improve the chances.
(Prediction for next years show, heavily Abba themed, the theme for the show will be “Thank you for the music” and they’ll probably have something similar to this years Liverpool songbook segment with Abba songs.)
My favourite this year is the song that came second, Cha Cha Cha by Käärijä:

My other favourite song was part of the Liverpool songbook I mentioned before.  It was part of the interval act and was previous Eurovision performers singing songs by acts from Liverpool.  One of the singers was Daði Freyr, who has an interesting history with the competition.  He was Icelands entry in 202 with Think About Things.  Then the pandemic saw the competition cancelled.  He was their entry for 2021, but between the semi final dress rehearsal and the semi final, someone on the Icelandic delegation tested positive for Covid and the whole delegation had to isolate.
So, this year was his first performance live at the final.  And he managed to make Whole Again by Atomic Kitten:

(I’m sorry that’s the only video from the event, the official ones are geoblocked in the States.)
I got bored before Eurovision, so I added something to my baseball cap:

Next weekend, I’m going to be in Bradford for the festivals in Leeds.  I’m still trying to find something to do on the Friday night and on the Monday.  Must admit, for the Friday, I’m trying to decide between going to see When Rivers Meet and going to an adult session at an inflatable playpark.
I’ve refixed the patches to my new jacket.  The fabric glue I was using before wasn’t cutting it, so I got extra strong carpet adhesive.  They’re not going anywhere.

So, Chuck got his new bunnet yesterday.  I watched the ceremony, just to say I did and to give me an excuse miss the next one.  Also, I was kinda hoping something would go wrong, cos that’d be hilarious.
It was interesting.  I did find it funny that the majority of people there couldn’t actually see him having the crown put on him because the throne was facing the wrong direction.
Here’s a couple of pics of my big cross stitch project in progress:
 
It’s Death of Rats from Discworld.  I also got a new lightbulb for the living room, one which does daylight because it makes things easier for me.
Beyond that, not much is happening.  Looking forward to my trip to Bradford at the end of the month.
I was an idiot yesterday.  I tried a new recipe and just realised today that I used white pepper rather than bicarb of soda.  Ah well, I get to try again.
I’ll leave you with the song I got my title from.  Burning House by The Lottery Winners, from their sublime album Anxiety Replacement Therapy:

It’s a record time for me at the moment. Not as in Guinness Book of, as in music.
Thursday, I got the new St Paul and the Broken Bones album, Angels in Science Fiction:

I didn’t know what to expect. Literally. I was introduced to this band as a blues band, then their last album was psychedelic surf rock. This one is more like Fleet Foxes and it really works for them. Straight to the top of my list of favourite albums this year.
Then, yesterday was Record Store Day. I queued for four hours in the rain in the hope of getting the records I wanted. Did I succeed? Hell yes.
First one I got was Nice Idea by Kae Tempest:

If you’ve been reading for a while, you’ll know I’m a huge fan of Kae. This is new stuff they recorded while on tour, so i desperately wanted this one. And I got the last one in the store. It’s good, though I’m not a fan of the title track (don’t like drum and bass).
The next one is Opus One by Mike Oldfield:

This one I wanted more as an interesting curio. It’s the demo that became Tubular Balls. As you can imagine, for a 51 year old recording made on tape, the quality isn’t the best, but it’s still fun to hear how a classic started.
Finally, it’s a bit of Frank Turner:

This is two discs, with the second one being demos of the tracks. Will admit, slightly disappointed that it doesn’t have any of the tracks from the deluxe version of the album, but still.
The inner sleeve is amazing:
  
Next week I get the first album by the legend that is Don Letts, one by Neil Gaiman and a string quartet and the new Lottery Winners album.
So, yeah.
Today, they’re testing the emergency alert system on phones here in the UK.  That’ll be fun.
I’ve started creative writing again.  Forgot how good it felt.
Also, getting frustrated with myself over my big cross stitch project, because I keep fucking up and it’s irritating.
I’ve finally got my electricity problems sorted, so my account is currently massively in credit, because they’ve credited me with all the money from the government I should have had since December.  Watch it all get eaten up by my first bill.
In case you’re wondering what my Sunday morning is like, I’m listening to Cerys Matthews on 6 Music and I’ve got food cooking in the slow cooker.  Bolognaise.  I’m trying adding milk to it, because I’ve heard that it works.
Anyway.  Off for a swim.

I’m currently listening to a radio programme playing TV themes which is airing as a tribute to Paul O’Grady, who died this week.  I remember going to see O’Grady as Lily Savage when I went to Blackpool with an ex decades ago.  Absolutely fucking hilarious.  More recently, my mum would always watch his 5 o clock show when he did that and, of course, his shows about dogs.  More recently still, I discovered his radio show during lockdown, before he was shafted out of it by the BBC.  He will be missed.
I got a new washing machine this week.

I kinda needed it.  The drainage pipe on the old one split and it pissed water everywhere.  This one is bigger, which is both a blessing and a curse, and quicker, as I don’t have to bother with wash-spin-rinse-dry, just wash then dry.  The main thing I like is that it actually has a pump for draining, so I don’t have to raise it off the ground or use buckets, just straight into the sink it goes.
I was supposed to get it on Tuesday, but it never arrived.  Tuesday was a bad day in general for me.  I was supposed to have a job interview, but it never happened.  I got there on time and they left me sitting waiting for 20 minutes before someone came to get me (and even that because someone else phoned and reminded me I was there).  They sat me in the break room and told me it’d be about 10 minutes.  25 minutes later, I was heading out the door, because fuck that.
Which leaves me wondering, do companies like that not realise that as much as I’m interviewing for them, they’re also trying to prove they are a good place to work?  How on earth could they possibly think that looked good or professional?
Anyway…
I’m going to the Sci-Fi Weekender next year.  I won tickets in a competition and have paid the booking fee and the deposit for the caravan.  All I need to do now is get my VIP pass.  Much looking forward to it already.
Also finished the baseball cap:

It’s supposed to be a daffodil.  Not sure if it looks like that, but I like it anyway.
I’ve started on my Death of Rats kit.

Full image:

Wednesday, I travelled down to Great Yarmouth.  My train between Middlesbrough and Darlington was delayed, meaning that as I was running to get my train to Peterborough, I watched it pull away.  Meaning my record of having delays in every single long distance train journey I make had, in fact, crossed over into 2023.
After an hours wait, I finally got going and got into Yarmouth an hour late.  I got to the hotel and, to be honest, I hated it.  The room was tiny, the toilet made a horrible noise when flushed and the shower was crap.  But, worse of all for me, it was unstaffed.  One of those where they text you the code for the door of the hotel and the room, even the lights were on sensors.  If you like that, great, but I really don’t.  I prefer to have someone actually there if there’s an issue.  Not a phone number to call.
I won’t be staying there next year (I am going down a day early again, so much easier).
I headed out for a wander, then went down the pub and met some of the other people who were going and had a good night.
The next day, I left the hotel and headed up to the campsite.  Checked in and discovered that my room was on the edge of the site, almost as if they’re embarrassed of me.  It was a nice caravan.  Smaller than in November, but that was expected with less room.
I finished off cross stitching my baseball cap (let’s just say Lessons Have Been Learned) then went for food.  I crashed for a couple of hours, then went to the first event.  Last November, the karaoke was a bloke in his laptop using YouTube videos.  This year, someone who was attending anyway who does events volunteered.  He did bingo, where I won a Buffy graphic novel, then karaoke.  I got to sing:

Which won me a DVD of a very bad looking film and a cross stitch design.
Friday was the first day.  I went for a swim then watched a few panels.  The first one was Victor Dorobuntu.  He plays Thing in Wednesday and this was his very first con.  He was funny.  He talked about the problems of playing a disembodied hand and him being a magician.
Next up was Nina Wadia.  She was absolutely hilarious and has quite the foul mouth.  also, likes a practical joke.  She also took us through an acting exercise so we knew what it’s like to act when something is going to be CG’d in later.
Following her was Fraser Hines and Wendy Padbury, former companions of the Second Doctor on Doctor Who.  This was fun.  They were funny, Hines in particular, and very informative.
Last of all in the main room was Jon Davey and Mickey Lewis.  They’ve played many, many monsters on Doctor Who.  This one was very informative about what it takes to do that job.
I then went to the small room for a panel about writing being a passion.  I didn’t really learn much about writing from that panel, but I enjoyed listening to the answers to the question.  The two rooms shut down then, so I went back to the caravan, chilled then went back for the nights entertainment.
First up was Pop Up Puppet Theatre.  Which, as the name might suggest, is a puppet theatre that does half hour spoofs of films.  The film in this case was Back to the Future and it was absolutely hilarious.
Next up was someone doing magic.  I didn’t see much of him, but I did see the one trick that was done by Victor Dorobuntu.  I mentioned he is a magician.  Him doing this was thrown together at the last minute, but it was good.
After that was someone doing stand up comedy.  She was OK, but not brilliant, to be honest.  Then a quick game of Chair Congo and we were ready for the music.
First of all was Professor Elemental.  He was, as he always is at SFW, on top form.  He did all the usual classics and broke out some new stuff as well.  There were inflatable unicorns, a lion and a tiger and dancers from Area 51.
Next was Madam Misfit.  I caught the end of her act in November, but only the very end as she was on in the small room when Professor Elemental was on.  What I saw, I really liked so I was glad that she was back and got the upgrade.  She was absolutely fantastic.  High energy, a costume change, half a moustache that fell off (it makes sense in context), glow sticks, sweets and a conga line (which I took part in).  Bonus points for using her watch to que up tracks on her computer.
I got her and Professor Elemental to sign the sign, listened to a bit of Blues Harvest with Darth Elvis then went to bed.
Sunday I went for a swim then to my first panel.  Which was The Ufologists.  It’s a spoof documentary about people who claim to have been abducted by aliens.  They showed the documentary and then did a Q&A in character afterwards.  It was hilarious.
During that, I went to get my sign signed by Victor Dorobantu, who also gave me a fist bump from his Thing hand.
Then there was more Pop Up Puppet Theatre.  This time it was Forbidden Planet.  Now I (shamefully) haven’t actually seen the film, but I still found it to be brilliant.
I did stay for a bit for Richard Ashton, bit only because that was when Nina Wadia was signing.  She thought the sign was brilliant and when I said it was supposed to say “Geek Camp”, she admitted she was tempted to correct it.
I spoke to Death Ingloria, showed them the cross stitch design I made of their logo and got them to sign the sign.
Not being bothered with most of the panels, I went to Asda to pick up some bits and then went back to watch PUPT do BTTF again.  Went back to the caravan for food then back for the evening.
First up was Death Ingloria.  I saw them in November, same room, same day, same time slot, same set.  Different and more impressive set up and still fantastic.
Next was George Coppen doing stand up.  He was hilarious and had a bit about doing panto in Middlesbrough, which sounded about right.
Then The Antipoets.  They were hilarious, whether doing poems about service stations or about teaching children arcane swear words.  (There is a reason for that one.  When they play festivals, people tend to leave their kids at Antipoets sets while they go see other acts.)
Then the small room kinda shut down, so I went through to the main room for the last half of the Jolly Boat set.  They’re a geeky comedy music duo and I was in stitches.  Could have done without the people deciding to have a full on conversation on front of me right through one of their songs though.
Then it was The Dark Room, which I’m not really a fan of.  So I got Jolly Boat to sign the sign and hung out in the small room.  Listened to a bit of Level Up Leroy and went to bed.
Sunday, got up, packed, threw out my rubbish and got the train home.  Which involved a two hour delay as someone was hit by a train at a train station.
And that was my weekend.  Came home with a unique souvenir, some awesome memories and a case of con flu.  (I’ve recovered now.)

The Beans on Toast gig was good.  It was supposed to be at the Westgarth here in Boro, but they’ve shut so it was at the Georgian in Stockton instead.  The support act was Guise, who was brilliant.  some people near the front did start chatting when she started playing a song about her dad, but they were quickly shushed up.  Beans was on top form.  He played some new songs, used a new opening for On and On and had his set list written on a table, which he’s raffling off at the end of the tour.  The money raised at each gig is donated to a local food bank.
Wednesday, I’m going to Yarmouth.  The Sci-Fi Weekender starts on Thursday.  I can’t wait.  I will also admit, it’ll be nice not to have to worry about heating the house.
In a vinyl collectors FB group I’m a member of, someone posted about an offer a band called When Rivers Meet were putting on.  A copy of their last album for £12 with free postage.  I couldn’t resist that, so I ordered one and listened to it as soon as it came in.  Absolutely fantastic blues rock band.  Looking them up, I found out they are on tour soon and they’re playing Bradford they day before Live at Leeds in the Park.  So, assuming I don’t find something else to do that night, I’m seriously thinking of going.  It’s just whether or not I can cope with a gig and two music festivals in three days.
Dyed my hair pink.  Because, I felt like it.
Finally got round to starting cross stitching my baseball cap.  I am never cross stitching onto a baseball cap again in my life.  It’s a fucking nightmare, because the peak makes it almost impossible to hold comfortably.
My entry title is the name of a De La Soul song, because all of their albums are now on streaming sites!  Here’s the song:

So, Tubular Bells.  It was a fun gig.

I was wondering how it would work, considering that the album is only 40 odd minutes long.  The first part of the gig was stuff from Mike Oldfields other albums.  Both Ommadawns, Tubular Bells 2 and, of course, Moonlight Shadow, which is a song I like.  The second part was Tubular Bells in it’s entirety, which was magnificent.  It was a slightly different arrangement, but the changes were minimal.  The real star of the show was the stage crew member who was making sure that one of the guitarists had the right instrument at all times during the gig.
I have new reading glasses:

Now, I’m not sure if my eyesight has massively deteriorated in the past two years, or if my new optician is much better than the old ones, but these are a lot stronger than the ones I had before.  A lot stronger.
The Sci-Fi Weekend is coming up.  And the day I’m supposed to travel down for it is the day of a rail strike.  As the alternative is a 13 hour bus trip, I’m going down the day before and staying at a hotel called The Little Emily.  How could I resist?

So, the Dropkick Murphy’s gig.  It was good.  I misread the times on the ticket, so I missed most of the opening act, Jesse Ahern, but what I saw was good.  The second act, The Rumjacks, were also good.  Pennywise were excellent.  I saw a bit of them at Slam Dunk and I wish now I had stuck around for the full set.
The Dropkick Murphy’s were excellent.  They kicked off the set with The Boys Are Back and the energy didn’t drop.  I got a few fist bumps from Ken Casey, got hit in the back of the head by three different crowd surfers and had a guy basically climbing all over me for half the set.  It was fucking great.
What wasn’t great was the prices at the venue.  £7 for a pint of bad lager and £4 per item in the roped off bit of the bar they called a cloakroom.
Monday was the Frank Turner gig.  Somehow, in the five minute walk from the pub to the venue, I managed to lose my ticket.  Thankfully, the door staff accepted me showing them in my See Tickets account that I did have a ticket and let me in.  but going back over my route looking for the ticket made me miss most of the opening act, the Wilswood Buoys, but the bit I did see was good.  The second act were The Lottery Winners, who were fantastic and, surprisingly, very funny.  Really enjoyed their set and seriously considering getting tickets for their gig in Middlesbrough.
Then it was time for Frank.  He did  not disappoint.  Absolutely on top form. There was one highlight for me in particular.
The first Frank Turner song I ever heard was Thatcher Fucked the Kids:

It’s always been one of my favourite songs of his, but I thought I would never get to hear him perform it live.  He doesn’t like doing so, for a few reasons.
Then, he started singing it at some of the gigs on his last tour, though not when I saw him in Aberdeen.  So, there was a chance.
During his solo set, he went on a rant about how bad the government is, then performed Thatcher.  He followed it up with Love, Ire and Song (which is where the entry title comes from).
After the gig, I got his autograph and a picture with him:

And there was an added bonus.  When I saw Frank in October, I didn’t have the money for a tour t shirt.  They were selling them on this tour, so I got one.
Next gig is Tubular Bells in a couple of weeks.
I’ve been having fun adding colour to more black and white photos:
  
Think I’m getting better at it.
Met up with Kev and Nikki last weekend.  It was fun and a much needed catch up.

Still one of my favourite pics of me and my oldest nephew.
Got a phone call on Monday about a job I applied for. They took some details and told me they’d email with a link for a maths test and an English test. Monday evening I get an email telling me they’ve enrolled me on a foundational skills maths course which’ll give a qualification equivalent to a GCSE grade C.
The problem with this is that I already have a qualification that is that. Well, that and they didn’t warn me about this.
I emailed them back on Tuesday to ask what this was about. Turns out, they just decided I’d want to do the course, but “if I no longer wish to participate in the course”, to let them know.
I simply replied that I never wished to participate to begin with.
Oh, and Tuesday morning, they emailed me the link to the tests. One was an assessment in foundational skills maths.
So, yeah.
I made different slow cooker Dr Pepper ribs on Sunday:

These ones tasted a lot better, probably because I had to mix the Dr Pepper with barbeque sauce. I might add more Dr Pepper next time, I couldn’t really taste it.
Monday, I’m going to see the Dropkick Murphy’s. My first gig of 2023 and my last as a 44 year old. I have my earplugs, I have my pint holder and, if their set at Slam Dunk North is anything to go by, it will fucking rock.

The gig on Saturday was a bust.  After walking an hour in drizzle to get there, because all of the busses had stopped running by 7pm for some fucking reason.  The first act was a rapper who was good, but he didn’t seem to know what his pedals did.  The second act were in a genre I like to call obviously mates with the organiser.  They were awful.  Between that and the fact that just about everyone there was younger than me by at least two decides, I bailed.
Which is how I saw in the New Year watching Rocky Horror Picture Show.
The Dr Pepper ribs were also a bust.  There’s more recipes that need a rack of ribs and I’m going to be out near Morrisons (only place that sells them near me) on Saturday, so I might try another recipe on Sunday.
Beyond that, had a pretty good day.  And not been up to much.

So, yeah, Sunday was a pretty chill day.  I got drunk, watched It’s a Wonderful Life, The Snowman and the latest series of Letterkenny, the stir fry was pretty good, the broth tasted too much of lamb and just kicked back.
I got my money from my parents.  I decided to add some of my own money to take advantage of the HMV 3 for £55 offer on records.  I was planning to get the two Cigarettes After Sex albums.  Alas, just my luck, the one time I have money to get them, they didn’t have them in stock.  Instead, I got You’ve Come a Long Way, Baby by Fatboy Slim, Tape Deck Heart by Frank Turner and Someday I Might Be Introverted by Little Simz.  So, not bad.
Apart from that, not been up to much.  Treated myself to two selection boxes on Monday and had pigs in blankets last night (forgot to buy them for Sunday).
What an exciting life I lead.

Remember when I said a couple of entries ago that my gig going for this year was over?  Well, not so much as it turns out.  There’s a gig at a local venue on Hogmanay, all local bands, and I’ve decided that with a lack of anything else to do, I’m going to go.
Much looking forward to it.
I’m still waiting on my lager.  It was supposed to arrive yesterday.  The tracking was all over the place and it never arrived.  (It was supposedly out for delivery today but, when I phoned them, they said it’s due for delivery tomorrow.  I hope so.
(Still not as bad as my copy of the new Stormzy arriving via the Isle of Man though.)
I’m just about set for Sunday.  Saturday, I have to get the veg and a couple of other bits.  Saturday night, take the meat out the freezer to defrost, put the broth mix in water to soak and switch on the Beer Monster.  Sunday, email everyone’s Christmas presents (still need to get sister and brother in laws email addresses), prep the veg, phone mum and dad, probably go for a walk, put the lager in the Monster and start drinking and watching films, interspersed with cooking.
Monday will be for recovering.

Two entries in a week from me?  What fresh insanity is this?
No, there’s nowt wrong, just felt like writing again.
I’m as ready for Christmas as I can be at this point.  Cards sent to Aberdeen, need to get my sisters Paypal details (for my nephews present) and my father and brother in laws email addresses (for their presents).  After a bit of searching, I have everything I need for cooking on Chrimbo Day, except the veggies which I’m getting on Saturday.  Bit of a struggle finding the turkey fillets and the scotch broth mix, but I got them today.  (OK, it’s country soup mix I’ve got.  Meh, same difference.)  And my lager has been ordered.  I plan on prepping the veg in the morning, before I start drinking.
Last Sunday, my youngest nephew had a swim meet.  He loves his swimming and seems to be good at it.  Case in point, he has started going one morning a week at 6am for training.  Second case in point, he won all 6 of his events last week.
Well, sorta.
It turns out he got disqualified from one for taking too many kicks after a turn.  But, there were only two people in that event and the other boy was also disqualified.  so, they both got the medals they would have won if not for the DQ’s.
I met up with Kev yesterday.  Gave him a bunch of stuff for him and Nikki and just had a general catvhup.  Came home with a new pint glass as well.
This is the song my title is from, More Pressure by Kae Tempest:

I’m kicking it old school with my laptop.  For some reason, the wifi card isn’t working, so I’ve got my modem in the middle of the floor and a wired connection to the laptop.
So, yeah, I’m going to be on my own this year for Christmas.  There are rail strikes on January 3,4,6 and 7 and, though I am supportive of the strikes (always back the workers), it will be a ballache getting back.  As such, I’m not bothering.  Normally, I would stay with Nikki and Kev, but they’re going to be spending Christmas Day with Kev’s mum, his brother and his brothers boyfriend.  So, I’m on my ownsome.
Not that it bothers me.  I’ve got a recipe for instant pot Scotch broth, another one for Hawaiian turkey stir fry, It’s a Wonderful Life on blu ray, Santa Claus Conquers the Martians on Prime and I’ll be getting 5 litres of lager.  I’ll be reet.
I also may have a job.  I had an interview on Teams today and I’ve been told they have people starting on Monday.  I won’t be one of them, I’ve decided I would rather wait until the New Year.  It’s call centre work for a bank, so it isn’t ideal.
But it beats dealing with the job centre.
The Paul Heaton gig was great.  I was annoyed that they didn’t announce that Billy Bragg had started his set, so I missed most of it, but he was on top form.
As was Paul Heaton.  It was supposed to be him and Jacqui Abbott, but she was ill.  It didn’t seem to change the set list.  when it was a Abbott solo song, Heaton sung it and when it was a duet, one of the band took her bits.  It was a great gig and I was surprised when he ended the gig with Caravan of Love.
And that’s the end of my gig year.  I saw Beans on Toast 3 times, Grace Petrie twice, Frank Turner once, had to get an Uber back to Bradford after Superorganism did an encore (gotta stay for the encore) where the driver thought I was in the band, got a sunburned neck at one festival then went back to the scene of the crime the next day for another one, returned to geek camp and had Kae Tempest give me my favourite album and gig in the same year (seriously, listen to The Line is a Curve, it’s fucking fantastic).
It’s been good.
Next year lined up, so far, is the Dropkick Murphy’s, Frank Turner (again), Beans on Toast (again), back to Bradford for Live at Leeds in the Park and Slam Dunk, the Sci-Fi Weekender, TRNSMT for Pulp and Paul Heaton and Jacqui Abbott and hopefully Tubular Bells and black Country, New Road.

Wookie cushion!
Thursday was the trip there. And, as is becoming usual, there was a delay. We were stuck for half an hour because there was a problem with the power line. It didn’t actually make me late getting in though.
I got my pack, and went to the caravan. It was quite nice:
 
Shower was a nightmare to use. I showered and changed then went for a wander. I was hoping some of the traders might be open, as I had lost my earring on the train and forgot to take my spares with me. One of them was, but they didn’t have earrings. The guy running it took pity on me and sold me one that he had but didn’t put out.
Then the small room opened. I stayed for the opening, left for the quiz and went back after. I didn’t get called up for karaoke, unfortunately.
Friday was the first full day. I watched the official opening of the event, where we were told about things like the SFW radio station and the documentary. I then had a look round the traders and got myself a new earring and a thing for holding my pint at gigs:

I went to a panel about making and distributing films on a small budget which was quite interesting.
I missed my slot to meet BRIAN BLESSED, so I just joined the queue and they didn’t seem too bothered. I got my VIP pass signed and I got my picture with him:

Then it was time for the Blessed to talk:

And talk he did. The interviewer asked him “How are you?” and the answer took half an hour and incorporated the Queen asking Blessed to say “GORDON’S ALIVE!”, his friendship with Kenneth Brannagh and a Shakespeare recital. (By the way, the Shakespeare was magnificent.) He later sang opera for us.
He was asked a total of three questions in the hour panel and got a standing ovation when he left the stage.
Then he collapsed.
It was seriously like someone had pressed mute on the entire room. that lasted for about 2-3 minutes until we heard “DON’T WORRY, I’M OK”. It turns out he tripped over a step, which we roundly booed later in the evening.
I then went back to the caravan for a power nap.
The first act in the main room in the evening was supposed to be a cabaret by Hattie Snooks. Unfortunately, she had tech issues, so she performed as her alter ego Queen Mab:

I wasn’t keen at first, but she won me over in the end. I would add a video of her performing, but I can’t find any.
Then, as is tradition, it was time for Professor Elemental:

He was brilliant, as ever. He recorded part of a video (which isn’t out yet) and appeared on stahe with monkeys:

Queen Mab (no pics of that), Madame Misfit:

A hula dancer:

A giant inflatable unicorn:

Which was sent bouncing around the crowd and a lion and a tiger:

It was fantastic. Here’s my favourite of his songs:

Then I went through to the small room for the end of Madame Misfit:

And I do mean the very end, I only caught three songs. But what I did hear I really liked. Here’s one of the songs:

I then bounced between the two rooms then bed.
Saturday morning brought an exchange which perfectly sums up the Sci-Fi Weekender. There’s a swimming pool at the holiday camp where the con is held. I took my swimming stuff, only to be told that it wouldn’t be open. they obviously changed their mind, because I was stood outside finishing a smoke when a lifeguard walked towards me. She stopped, looked at the cosplayers behind me, then looked at me.
“Sci-fi weekender?”
“Yup.”
I then went into the building and saw this:

I watched the puppet parade, then got my swimming gear and went for a swim. One of the waterslides was working so, as a mature, grown up 44 year old, of course I went down it.
I dropped my swimming stuff back at the caravan and headed back in. I went to a panel about crime writing which was interesting to me. I then bought myself a badge:

And got this clock as a birthday present for Nikki:

I then went to a panel called When Trek Goes Wrong about, well, bad episodes of Star Trek. Then it was Just a Minute which, between Ian McNiece constantly complaining about being bored and Andrew Lee Potts not even understanding the rules of the game was hilarious.
The first thing in the evening was death Ingloria:

Who were brilliant. A mix of music and anime, they’ve released two albums, both as comic books. Definitely the musical find of the weekend for me:

I then went into the main room for The Dark Room. It’s something that has a lot of fans and it was funny, but it got repetitive very quickly.
There wasn’t actually anything in the small room while that was on, but it put me in a good place for Queen Mab. Which turned into a Hattie Snooks/Queen Mab mashup set, involving a sequinned cushion with a picture of Lieutenant Reginald Barclay holding a cat:

and monkeys dancing to a cover of The Bad Touch:

8am, Sunday morning, I was at the train station, cursing myself for thinking that getting an 8am train back to Boro was a good idea.
It was smaller than the last Weekender I was at. All the guests were living in the UK, there were less people and definitely less people. But it was a celebration and a damn good one at that. Fun was most certainly had. Roll on the next one in March.
Oh, and part of my journey home was delayed due to signal falure.

Why yes, yes I am watching the Weird Al film.
I had fun on Saturday.  I finally convinced the electricity company that my flat is not the shop.  Which meant that I had to find a new electricity company, as the old one doesn’t do domestic energy.  I tried using comparison websites to find the best deal.  None of them would let me.  The situation at the moment means that people can’t get a better deal than they are on now.  So, I decided to just go with the same folk who supply my gas.  Except they wouldn’t give me a quote online either so I had to phone them.
Still, it’s done now.
Tomorrow, I have a job interview.  While I’m always on the side of the workers, I will admit I’m happy the strike tomorrow has been cancelled as getting there by bus would have been a nightmare.
Thursday, I’m away to Great Yarmouth for the Sci-Fi Weekender.  At which I will get to meet BRIAN BLESSED!
So, lots of pics in the next few entries.

And that’s about all I care to say about the shitshow that British politics currently is here.
I had a job interview on Saturday.  It went OK, I thought.  I was near Hobbycraft though, which meant I could get something I had heard about.
Water soluble 14 count cross stitch material.  It’s expensive.  This is what I got for £6.50:

The instructions show using the whole thing for a small deign.  I don’t bloody think so.
I have an idea what I want to do first.  Just need to get a baseball cap.
Not really been up to much.  I left my swim socks in Aberdeen and my mum thinks my nephew has them.
A good friend of mine is in the country.  He studied over here, got a couple of jobs afterwards.  Then he had to go home to India.  He had a job offer, but they wouldn’t confirm without a visa and the Government wouldn’t give him a visa without a confirmed job offer.  A bunch of us are going out for a couple of drinks on Sunday with him.

So, my weekend back home…
Thursday, I travelled up.  Got to the train station, went to activate my ticket on the app, only to discover they had cancelled the Edinburgh – Aberdeen leg of the journey.  No info on replacement busses or anything, just “Sorry for the inconvenience”.  So, I phoned my parents and decided to worry about it when I got to Edinburgh.
Got the train to Darlington no problem, got on the train to Edinburgh, only to discover that they decided not to bother with seat reservations.  Found a seat and settled down to watch The Bear.
The train stops at Berwick.  And it doesn’t move, even after it became obvious that everyone who was boarding had done.  First of all, we were told it was a problem with the overhead line.  Then, we were told it was that a train broke down, but it was OK because they were sending a train to recover it.  Then, the recovery train got there, only to discover that the problems with the broken down train meant it couldn’t be towed.  Finally, they got the line cleared and we were off.
We got in to Edinburgh too late for a train to Aberdeen, so I was given the choice between a bus or a later train to Dundee.  At that point, I would have crawled if that was the quickest way to get to Aberdeen, so I took the bus.
Friday, I went for a swim.  The council pool nearest my mums house has reopened after about 18 months closed, so I went there.  It’s a nice pool, but I’m not going back soon.  It’s a 25 meter pool and I am not ready for that just yet.
Friday night was the Grace Petrie gig.  The support act was Robyn Davidson, who is from Aberdeen and I really enjoyed her set.  Grace Petrie was on top form.  Highlights include her being surprised when I said I had travelled from Boro for the gig and her getting us to get the attention of a couple who were talking at the bar during her set.  (Seriously, why would you buy a ticket for a gig and spend the time talking?)  Lowlights were having to pay £4.50 for a lukewarm can of lager.
Saturday, I went into town.  I got a frame for mum and dads present.  I also had a look at the plans the council has for the beach.  It’s mostly stuff that’s been proposed before, the plan for the pier is ridiculous and it appears there’s been little to no actual thought put into the whole thing (which my sister would later confirm to me when she told me that the surfing area they are planning was originally placed in an area that’s not safe for surfing.)  I also looked at the plans for the revamp of the main street in town and, again, nothing that hasn’t been proposed before.
Sunday, my  sister and brother in law came round (my nephew stayed over Saturday night) and we went for a pub meal.  It was a fun time.  Then I went into town for the Frank Turner gig.
Pet Needs were the support act.  I’ve heard them before, but this was the first time seeing them live.  They were brilliant.  Frank Turner was excellent.  He had the whole place bouncing and singing along.  I managed to get near the front by the end of the gig and I wasn’t the oldest person there.  There were two women, at least in their mid 50’s, as well.  They were getting jostled a fair bit.  One accepted an invitation to stand at the barrier, but the other one didn’t.  So some of the audience formed a human barrier around her to protect her.
(The main pic is my favourite pic from the night.)
Monday, didn’t do much.  Tuesday, I came home.
Thankfully, I noticed before we left the house that the train to Darlington had been cancelled, so we didn’t need to leave so early.  I got the next train, which was a different company but was honouring our tickets.  Got a seat and thought I’d be set to Darlington.  Which is when there was an announcement that they were only honouring my ticket to Edinburgh.  Changed train there and we were well underway when the train stopped for 10 minutes because someone pressed the emergency button.  Because of course that happened.  Why not.
Finally got home, went to the gym for a swim and a soak in the jacuzzi.
I’ll leave you with some Primetime Entertainment:

Update to my last entry: my younger brother and his family won’t be going to Aberdeen at the weekend.
A couple of weeks ago, there was the Middlesbrough Art Weekender. It was interesting, I found out I’m crap at starting a fire and I got my brick. It’s a thing called The Exchange. The artist made 365 porcelain bricks and put gold guilding on them. People were encouraged to take a brick, in exchange for a days work for charity. The main pic is my brick.
The week before, I went to see Superorganism in Leeds. As I did before, I decided to stay in Bradford. The hotel room was fucking ridiculous. Seriously, it was massive. I’ve spent more to stay in rooms that were smaller before.
I didn’t pack a spare pair of trousers, which was an issue when I discovered a huge rip in mine. I headed out to Primark, only to find they didn’t have any of the type I like. I went through to Leeds, tired the Primark there and they didn’t have either. I ended up having to buy a pair of jeans.
The gig was fantastic. The support act was a guy called Dylan Cartildge. He was absolutely fantastic, signed my copy of his album and posed for a selfie with me:

Here’s one of his songs:

Superorganism were absolutely brilliant. They started with the song Put Down Your Phone during which they, well, urged us to switch on the torch on our phones and hold them up. It was a brilliant night. Here’s my favourite song from their last album:

Then they performed a 2 song encore with Dylan.  It meant I missed my train back to Bradford, but you gotta stay for the encore.  I got an Uber for the first time ever.  It was fine.  The driver asked me what I had done that night, I said I was at a gig and he asked what I performed.  It cost me £30, including a tip.
All in all, it was a good weekend.
Tomorrow, I have a Zoom interview for a job I’m not bothered about, Wednesday I have an interview for a job I am interested in. Thursday, I’m going home, Friday is the Grace Petrie gig, Sunday is the joint birthday meal for my parents then the Frank Turner gig and Tuesday I’m back in Boro. I’m also going to squeeze a swim in there as well.
I’ve also started making my mums Christmas card. I looked at the design and it’s got full stitches, three quarter stitches and back stitches which fair enough. It also has straddle stitches, vertical half stitches and horizontal half stitches and I swear they’re making this shit up. So, I’m not bothering.
Pics to finish:

I was going to write a proper entry about Leeds and the Middlesbrough Art Weekender and other stuff.
But I need to vent.  As you can likely tell from the title.
I’m going home to Aberdeen in a couple of weeks for a Grace Petrie gig and a Frank Turner one.  Mum turned 75 in August and dad turns the same age in November, so mum asked my brother if he wanted to come up with my sister in law and the kids for a joint birthday celebration.  (I made my mum and dad birthday cards and got them a small present, then got them this:

as their main present.)  They agreed to, but said they would not be arriving until the Saturday and they would be leaving on the Monday.
So, it was settled.
I phoned mum today, as I do every Monday (except for special occasions) and she informed me that my brother and his family might not be coming up after all.  Seemingly, the hotel they first booked cancelled their booking because they weren’t accepting bookings from the general public, so the rooms could be kept free for NHS staff.  (This was common during the height of the pandemic, for NHS staff who lived with vulnerable people and they couldn’t risk taking Covid home, though pretty much every hotel has stopped that policy).  They did book a second hotel, which would mean getting the train (also something to do with my brother changing jobs meaning they wouldn’t have a car).  Due to a rail strike and engineering works, they’re not sure if they’re going to bother, but my mum will know by the Tuesday before at the latest as that’s when the last day for them cancelling the hotel is.
Now, my brother has always been my mums favourite.  Which means that nothing was ever his fault and whatever he said was believed no questions.  And this continued after he got married, with everything being the fault of my sister in law.
I’m not sure if it’s just that he hasn’t noticed or if he just doesn’t care, but for at least a year, the latter part of that paragraph has not been true.  Particularly the blame bit.
Time was, mum would have been devastated with what he said.  Now, not only is she not upset, she’s not even surprised.  She expected them to change their minds.
She actually said to me today that she’s not bothered if she never sees my brother and sister in law again, what’ll upset her is not seeing the kids.  And I’m right there with her.  For years, my brother has had little or less to do with me and no-one knows what the problem is.  Now, I just don’t care.  I will miss the kids, but unless they deign to go up to Aberdeen while I’m there and funerals, I’m not planning or expecting to see him again.
I’ll finish here.  I’m going to watch John Oliver then listen to an angry, shouty record.

At 6:30pm BST, it was announced that Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II had died at Balmoral at the age of 96.
I knew something was up and it was serious when I got the BBC News alert that she had been placed under medical supervision. They don’t usually give out medical updates unless it affected her public work. Then, it was announced that the immediate family were flying up to Aberdeen (with the exception of the King and Queen, who were already there). But it was still a shock when the official announcement was made.
This is surreal. Completely surreal. At 44 years old, she was the only monarch I ever knew. Both my parents turn 75 this year (mum at the end of last month, dad in November) and she’s about the only monarch they ever knew. She lived through a lot of change, both in terms of the Commonwealth and in society in general. And now she’s gone.
She lived a life of service. For 70 years, she led the counter and did so by example. Now we have King Charles III (which has been confirmed as his reginal name).
Rest in peace your highness. It’s well earned.

Pink hair, don’t care.
I need to get better at writing here.
So, I finally got a smart meter for my gas fitted.  I’ve been wanting one for ages, to make it easier to top up.  The first two appointments the bloke turned up, told me they couldn’t fit it and left.  The third one cancelled the appointment day off.
So, this time it was actually fitted and then the gas was capped off.  Apparently, there was a gas leak.  I phoned my landlord, who said there wasn’t a leak.  Turns out, there has been ever since I moved in.  The gas pipe into the boiler wasn’t tightened properly.  I do have to point out, I’ve never smelt any gas.
Then, I went to top up, only to find that I couldn’t.  Phoned EDF, only to be told I couldn’t yet, but not to worry as I couldn’t be disconnected.  I was still running up a debt though.
Finally topped up yesterday.  So, that’s sorted.
Apart from that, not been up to much.  Buying records, dying my hair.  I’ve also started buying Christmas cards, mostly because they are cross stitch kits and I need to get going on them.
Friday, I’m going to see Beans on Toast live again.  Much looking forward to it.
This is the issue with leaving it so long before entries.  I forget stuff to write about.

So, I did go to the art car boot sale on Saturday.  I spent £90 in total and got the following:

A pin badge and lino print from Lana Bagu.  I’d actually seen her work before in an art gallery in town centre, so I’m glad to own one of her pieces.

As a Star Trek fan, I couldn’t resist this Barry Fox piece.

This is not going to be the last Lincoln Lightfoot piece I get.  He’s got a lot of great stuff, especially if you’re a kaiju fan.

Yes, I did go from Middlesbrough to Gateshead just to get a print of the Transporter Bridge by Edward Lightfoot.

As a Twin Peaks fan, I was immediately drawn to this The Piss Artist piece.

I got this from Helen Nicholson because I always need bookmarks and I like dragons.

Zombeatles by World of Eldritch.

And a melting smiley face by Adam Pointer.
So, I don’t think I did too badly, really.
Now, I just need frames for most of them and get them hung on the wall.
I also got Tigermilk by Belle & Sebastian and Rumours by Fleetwood Mac.  On Sunday, I also got The Boy With the Arab Strap, also by Belle & Sebastian.
Today, I had a first aid course.  I did CPR, used a defibrillator, did a 10 question test and passed, so I can now put on my CV that I am first aid certified.
It’s too bloody hot and the less said about the Tories committing electoral suicide the better, but I’m going to see Beans on Toast on Friday, so I have that going for me.

As I mentioned before, I decided to get earplugs for wearing at gigs.  I eventually settled on these ones.
And this is where the fun starts.  I got an email from the company with the tracking number for the earplugs.  About a week after I ordered them, they were still saying “DeliveryScheduled” (It’s still saying that now).  I emailed then and they admitted they were having problems with that courier and would send a second pair by a different courier.
Then I got an email saying they had been delivered.  Problem is, i had been in all day and no delivery.  Turns out, they delivered to the shop downstairs.
But, I got them:

And just in time for the Grace Petrie gig the next day.
It was an interesting gig.  The support act had to cancel as she had Covid and the person who was supposed to be on stage with Grace had flown to the States to work at a music summer camp, only for it to be cancelled as he flew over.  So, it was just Grace.  But she was brilliant.  It was quite an intimate gig, there weren’t many people there, but that just made it better.  After asking for requests, she played Coldwaterproofjacket:

After pointing out that the folk who asked for it called it the wrong name.  She also played a song she had just written about Roe v Wade.
She said hi to me before the gig.  I was outside having a smoke, she walked past and said hi.  I didn’t bother her then, but I did get a pic afterwards:

And I left with a pint glass.  That I didn’t technically pinch.  The venue have a scheme where you pay a £1 deposit for your pint glass (it’s actually plastic) and you use the glass the rest of the night.  Take it back at the end of the night, get your money back.  Or don’t, and the money goes to helping up and coming artists in the Tees Valley area.
Get a pint glass and help musicians?  Don’t threaten me with a good time.
The earplugs are great.  Comfortable and I’m able to hear both the music and normal conversation.
The next night, I was out again.  A friend was back in town for the night and I met up with her and some other people.  Highlights include telling someone that they left the Paul McCartney set at Glastonbury just before he brought Dave Grohl out, a friend trying to convince me to start a FB page or Insta for my pictures of street art and truly the worse pint I’ve ever been pulled.  Which was in a gay bar.
Saturday was a friends birthday party.  Much drunken fun was had.  I think this pic best sums things up:

Then there’s this:

Though one of my friends, the husband of the birthday girl, pissed me off.  We were supposed to getting a minibus back to Boro.  Instead, the cab company sent four normal taxi’s.  I was sent back in the same cab as my friends parents and everyone was supposed to meet up in a particular pub.  We get there, choose a big table and wait.  And wait.  Eventually, my friends mum was able to get him on the phone, only to be told that plans had changed and they went elsewhere.
Now, I’m not bothered about myself.  I like his parents and wasn’t planning to stay out after the pub closed anyway.  It’s his parents.  They were massively upset so I’m annoyed for them.
Sunday was about watching the British Grand Prix, which was about three races worth of content in one.
Remember I mentioned before that I finally got round to getting myself a record player?  Well, I decided I needed a stand for my record sleeves while they are playing:
 
And, yes, of course I bought Dark Side of the Moon.  Had to, really.  Same today when I bought Tubular Bells.
Not much happened this week except WE GOT RID OF THE WORST PRIME MINISTER IN THE ENTIRE HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY!
Right now, I’m watching MST3K.  Tomorrow, I’m getting a tattoo of some description.  Not sure what.  Won’t know what until I get there.  Except it’s Stranger Things related.
Next weekend I’m going to an art car boot sale.

I’m writing this before stitching new patches on my jacket.
I finally gave in and got myself a record player last week. It’s nothing fancy, but it does what it’s supposed to. I have since bought:
FTHC (red vinyl) by Frank Turner,
Bat Out of Hell by Meat Loaf,
Bad for Good by Jim Steinman (with the 7″),
Dark Side of the Moon by Pink Floyd,
Debut by Bjork.
I am also waiting on getting the 25th anniversary red vinyl version of If You’re Feeling Sinister by Belle and Sebastian and have pre-ordered the 10″ version of 7 Psalms by Nick Cave.
Glastonbury is on this weekend, so I’ve been enjoying some of that. I watched Billie Eilish’s headline performance last night. Unfortunately, they’re not showing the Sir Paul McCartney one tonight for some reason (edit: am mistaken, they are showing it). They will have Kendrick Lamar tomorrow though.
Do you know how big Glastonbury festival is? There’s nearly 100 different stages.
Also, Wimbledon starts on Monday, so that’s two weeks of tennis for me as well.
I’m actually going to be quite social next weekend. Thursday, I’m finally going to see Grace Petrie live, Friday I’m meeting up with some friends for a drink and Saturday I have a birthday party. That’ll keep me all socialised up for a while.

Seriously, you can probably skip this entry.
Only kidding.  I am, of course, going to write about the festivals.
Thursday, I travelled down to Bradford.  The festivals were in Leeds, but Bradford is cheaper and the train between the two is cheap.  The train journey was uneventful for me, but not for the four people I passed in the vestibule of the Darlington – Leeds train.  It turns out that while the person who booked the tickets was on the right train, his three mates weren’t.  No, I’m not sure how that works either.
I had some time to kill before I was due at the hotel (I had already checked in online), so I wandered round and tried to find a couple of postcards.  I couldn’t find any, so I bought a couple of cards from the most ridiculously gorgeous bookshop I have ever been in.
I went to the hotel, got my key cards and headed up to the room.  It was a decent room, not that big, but big enough.  Had a shower, changed and went to see Top Gun: Maverick on IMAX.  I wasn’t that bothered about the film, but it’s what was on the IMAX screen.  The film was what I expected from a Top Gun film but about 5% less homoerotic.  IMAX, however, is a fucking experience.  At times it almost seemed like too much picture.  Definitely worth doing if you have the chance.
Friday was Slam Dunk.  I got the train through to Leeds and the shuttle bus to the site.  Had a couple of bad beers while waiting to get in, then legged it to the merchandise tent.  Well, as far as an out of shape 44 year old could go before completely knackering himself.  All for naught, as there wasn’t anything there I wanted.
There was, however, something new that I did want.  A craft beer tent that was selling decent lager.  I got a pint and headed for my first act.
The only band I actually wanted to see were the Dropkick Murphys.  I had the rest of the day before their set to do as I wished.  First of all, I went to see Cassyette as the name intrigued me.  I’m glad it did, because she was excellent.  This is the song she opened her set with:

Then I went to see Chunk!  No, Captain Chunk!  Because who could resist a band named for a Goonies reference?  It turns out me, because I stayed just long enough to realise I didn’t like them that much.  I went to another stage for a band called Hot Milk, who I had seen when I first saw Frank Turner live.  Great band, shit name.  However, I wasn’t enjoying them either.  I was just in a bit of a funny mood.
I think part of it was the weather.  The weather guessers (as @zhnee calls them) said it’d be raining.  So, I wore a hoodie and a wooly hat.  I did have a shirt to wear over my t shirt and a baseball cap, but, as I thought it would be raining, I left them at the hotel.  I ended up buying a baseball cap for a band called Deaf Heaven which says “The Future is a Foreign Country” on it.  Never hear them, never heard of them, but it was the best of a bad choice for cap.  I also ended up tying my hoodie round my waist.
It turned out that all I needed to get me out of my funk was some hilariously overpriced food, a beverage of an alcoholic nature, a cigarette and some MC Lars, a rapper who wears a silver plated Legend of Zelda NES cartridge round his neck on a thick gold chain.  Here’s his song Hot Topic Is Not Punk Rock:

I wandered round for a bit, caught some of The Interrupters (not bad) and some Pennywise (good, but did get booed when they mentioned the jubilee) and then it was time for the main event.
The Dropkick Murphys.  Well, most of them.  One of the lead singers mum recently had a stroke so he stayed behind to help look after her.  I’ve been a DKM fan since I first watched The Departed and was supposed to go see them in January, but they had to postpone the tour.  They were excellent.  Really, really excellent.  Here’s their cover of the Gerry Cinnamon song The Bonny:

Back on the shuttle bus, back to Bradford, back to the hotel then bed.
Saturday, I got up, had a shower and my neck hurt.  Checked it in the mirror, it was red.
I got bloody sunburn.  (I don’t tend to burn, I usually just tan.)  I headed through to Leeds, wandered round a bit, onto another shuttle bus and back out to where I was the day before for Live at Leeds in the Park.
I will admit, they did a good job changing the place.  All the adverts, the banners for the stages and closing off one stage completely.  It’s a new festival and had a generally more laid back atmosphere than the day before.
I knew I wanted to see Holly Humberstone and Arlo Parks.  And I wanted to see Dylan John Thomas, who I hadn’t heard before, but had heard good things about.
First I went to see The Royston Club.  A great indie band from Wales.  Here’s one of their songs, Mrs Narcissistic:

Then it was time for Dylan John Thomas.  Really really good, similar to Gerry Cinnamon, Frank Turner and Beans on Toast, so it’s probably no surprise I liked him.  He also has the endearing habit of saying cheers after every song.  This is the song he started the set with:

I then wandered into one of the tents and caught most of the set from a band called Dream Wife.  They were loud and brilliant.  They also gave me my new favourite piece of band merch when they started throwing these out to the audience:
 
They also caused security to move faster than I had seen all weekend, when the lead singer first climbed up onto the barrier, then over it into the audience.  This is them:

Then it was time for Holly Humberstone.  I enjoyed the set, but got pissed off with the amount of people talking through her set.  Pisses me off when that happens.  This is the last song she played:

Having some time to kill before Arlo Parks, I went to see porij.  Again, the name attracted my attention and I’m glad it did, because they were excellent.  A bit of humour when someone asked for them to play one song, got told they already did that, asked for a second one and they did that as well.  This was my favourite song from their set:

The n it was time for Arlo Parks.  She was very good.  The only problem was that security didn’t like it when people climbed up on folks shoulders and the group beside me kept doing this.  One of them was threatened with being kicked out.  Here she is:

Back to the bus, the train, the hotel and bed.
Sunday, I wandered round Bradford for a bit, then headed to the National Science and Media Museum.  They had an exhibition about codebreaking and cybersecurity.  It was good, I got to see an Enigma machine, but the whole thing was a bit too much “GCHQ is your friend, do not worry about GCHQ spying on you” for me.  I know they needed GCHQ helping with the exhibition, but still.
The most interesting thing was actually a closed laptop, which had been deliberately infected with the ransomware that held the NHS hostage.
Back at the hotel, I watched the Wales – Ukraine game, listened to the radio and went to sleep.  The next day I checked out, caught the train and returned to reality.
Have I learned anything?  I’ve learned that it’s time for me to invest in earplugs to wear to gigs.  I’ve learned that next year, remember to prepare for all weathers, protect my neck, leave some money at home for buying stuff I need when I get back and to have breakfast before the gigs.
And, yes, there will be a next year.  I already have me ticket for Live at Leeds in the Park.

Bradford, you seem like a nice place.  But we need to have a conversation.
Yup, I’m on my wanders again.  It’s Slam Dunk and Live at Leeds in the Park weekend, so I’m in Bradford.  Because the hotel is a lot cheaper.
We’ve had Eurovision, but it wasn’t particularly good this year.  Here’s Britain’s entry:

We were second and won the jury vote.  Enter something decent, do well.  Whodathunkit?
Here’s Norway’s entry, which is peak Eurovision:

Went to see Kae Tempest a couple of weeks ago.  The support act was Shungudzo.  Who got all of us to introduce ourselves at the same time and brought this cheerful ditty to my life:

Kae Tempest was fucking amazing and the atmosphere made it one of the best gigs I’ve ever gone to.
Beyond that, not much happening in my world.  So, I’ll leave you with my favourite song from the new Kae Tempest album:

Full picture:

This is a map of all the deserted medieval villages discovered in England by the end of 1968.  It’s from a book I’m reading at the moment called Shadowlands, which was written by Matthew Green.  It’s about places in the UK that have vanished off the map for a variety of reasons.  (@sleepygene, I really think you’d like this book.)
I also have to explain the title.  Recently, it came out that a Tory MP was spotted watching porn in the House of Commons and again in a committee meeting.  To their credit, that Tories immediately said that as soon as they found out who it was, they would be expelled from the party.  It turned out to be an MP called Neil Parish.  He has resigned from parliament and gave an interview for the BBC in which he said that the first time he was caught watching porn, he was searching for tractors and clicked on a porn link.
Yeah…
I had a job interview on Thursday.  I thought it went OK, but they’ve already said thanks but no thanks, so clearly I was wrong.  Ah well, onward and upward.
Mum and dad are coming down on Wednesday.  They’re going to a funeral further south and are stopping here overnight.  They are bringing me rowies though, which gives me a happy.
I was going to court.  I got a letter from an electricity company saying they were going to court to get an order to gain access to the flat.  Something to do with the meter in the shop downstairs.  It was my address on the letter while saying the order was for the shop.  I said I wanted to attend the hearing, to point out that they don’t need to come into the flat to get into the shop and they emailed today to say they weren’t taking it to court.
I’m pretty much set for Leeds over the jubilee bank holiday.  I’m actually staying in Bradford, as it saved me a lot of money for the hotel.
This is why I don’t update more.  Not a lot to say.
I got called a cheeky bugger recently.  I finally went round to my best friends new flat and brought her and her lad a gift and a card.  Now, the reason they moved into the new place is because the block of flats they were in are scheduled for demolition.  They moved into that flat because the block they were in were due to be demolished.  So, I wrote on the inside of the card to try and not get this one demolished.  Which got me called a cheeky bugger.
Which I probably deserve.

I have to get better about writing in here.
So, the kit arrived for my mums mothers day present. Not buying a kit from them again. They sent normal thread instead of cross stitch thread and the instructions are laughably bad. Mum liked the finished result, so that’s the main thing. Sadly, I forgot to get a pic before I sent it.
Here’s the latest card I made:

And, yes, that is a genuine error message.
I’ve downloaded a new browser so I could try having vertical tabs. Not going back to tabs across the top of the screen again. A nice side effect is that it’s improved the use of my computer.
I went to see CODA at the weekend. It’s fantastic, I highly recommend it. It’s also a lot funnier than I thought it would be.
I got one of the books I backed on Kickstater at the weekend. I’m getting a kick out of seeing my name in it.
Bought a ticket to see Frank Turner in Aberdeen in October and I have also discovered that Grace Petrie is playing there the same weekend, so I’m planning to get a ticket for that one as well. Then it’s just letting my mum know I’m coming up.
I’ll also get to see the new Nuart stuff for this year.

I’ll leave you with this. After hearing a band called The Shaggs mentioned in CODA, I had to listen to them. This is one of their songs, called My Pal Foot Foot. I have to be completely honest with you, if you play this song, you’re not going to hear something good. It’s bad. Very bad. But, there’s something about the way they are apparently completely unencumbered by things like talent and things like structure, tuning and storytelling that I’m now addicted to:

If you’ve been reading my diary long enough, you’ll know about my love of street art.  You’ll also know that there’s a street art festival in ~Aberdeen called the NuArt festival.
And it was NuArt that gave me my favourite piece of street art.  Created by a German duo called Herakut, it was painted on the curved side of the Aberdeen Market (better known by me as the New Market) it was an absolutely stunning piece with a great message.
It’s been known for a while that the New Market is to be demolished and replaced.  The council had said that they wanted to save the mural, but it seems they got as far as art = art gallery, worked out that it would be too heavy and promptly gave up.
They started demolishing the New Market this week and the mural is now gone.  I’m going to miss it.  I’m going to miss looking for it when I’m back home and in town.
 
Here’s some pics of it in all it’s glory:

So, I need to explain.  Last week, the Government announced a fresh batch of Russian oligarchs who were being sanctioned.  One of them is Roman Abramovich, the owner of Chelsea Football Club who won last seasons Champions League.  So, the club are restricted and can’t do anything which brings in money.  Including selling tickets to games.  They are playing Middlesbrough on Saturday in the FA Cup and said on Wednesday that they had requested that the cup game be played behind closed doors.
The person in the pic is Bob Mortimer, who is from Middlesbrough and supports the club.
Unsurprisingly, I didn’t get the Poundland job.  As you can tell, I’m devastated.
Some pics from town:
  
The Beans on Toast gig was brilliant.  The hotel was very nice.  Room was small, but it was a single room and I didn’t stay in there long.  A particularly nice touch was giving me two key cards, one for me and one to put in the thing to put the electricity on in the room.  I drank dark lager, which is nice but a bit of a headfuck.  Kitty Liv, the support act was really good.  Beans on Toast himself was brilliant.  Here’s me with Beans and the canvas I bought and got him to personalise:
 
I got the first of Nikki and Kev’s housewarming gifts finished:

My sister in laws father and strepmum are out of Ukraine and have a visa to come over here, which is a huge relief.

I’ve been experimenting with making glitchy cross stitch.  These ones were a nightmare to make.  Oddly, the one on the white aida was a bigger nightmare than the black.  I also made this:

I’m making another of those.  I got a cross stitch to make for my best friend and her lad as a housewarming gift and it was supposed to come with a hoop for framing it, except it came with two hoops.  So, I’m making one of these and putting it in the second hoop for them.
Which reminds me, I need to go to Hobbycraft when I’m at Teesside Park on Tuesday.  (I’m out there for a job interview.  It’s only Poundland, so I’m not bothered if I get the job or not.)  The kit says to stitch felt on the back once the hoop is in place, but the colour of the felt they provided is horrible, so I’m getting better felt.  I know, it’s on the back and no-one will see it, but still.
I also got a couple of new patches and have added them to my jacket.

This is from The Crow.  Getting this was a nightmare.  The shop is in the States and shipping to the UK was about twice the price of the actual patch.  So, I got it shipped to a friend in the States and they sent it over to me.  Took about a month to get from them to here.

Grace Petrie patch.
New Frank Turner album came out a couple of weeks ago and it’s fucking good.  It’s also the first album by him to make it to number 1 in the charts, which is exciting.
Tomorrow, I’m through to Newcastle for a Beans on Toast gig.  Staying in a different hotel from normal.  Hopefully it’s good, especially as I’m already booked in there again for the Kae Tempest gig in May.  Sunday, I’m going to see The Godfather 2 on the big screen.
My swimming has got a better recently.  It was basically an overnight thing.  I’m taking shorter rests between lengths and therefore getting more lengths in.  Next weekend will be the test, as I’m not swimming this weekend due to going to Newcastle.
Anyway, have to go, about to watch brand new MST3K.  I’ll leave you with two of my favourite songs from the new Frank Turner album:

It probably won’t come as a huge shock to any of you that I am a huge fan of Meat Loaf.  So, last Thursday was a sad day for me.  I’m lucky enough to have seen him live and he was absolutely fantastic.  RIP.
I know, long time no write.
I was planning to go see The Tragedy of Macbeth just before New Year, but there was a technical problem in the screen at the cinema, so they had to cancel.  They gave me a full refund and a free ticket, so I went to see The Lost Daughter instead.  I really liked it, with the exception of Dakota Johnson.
The first weekend I was back in Middlesbrough, I went through to Newcastle to see The Tragedy of Macbeth (fantastic) and Licorice Pizza (good, but not PTA’s best, though Cooper Hoffman has a bright career ahead of him).  As I was walking to the cinema, I looked in the window of a tattoo studio and saw some apprentice flash designs, including one that really spoke to me as a Frank Turner fan.  Would I really travel through to Newcastle, £16 for a return train ticket, just to get new ink?

Damn skippy, I did.
I also went to the Life Science Centre, to see Gaia, a giant model of the Earth.

Not going to lie, was slightly disappointed.  It would probably look better if it was lit up like the pics I’ve seen of it.
Met up with Nikki and Kev last weekend for a couple of drinks.  They got me an awesome battle damaged Batman figure.  They’re a bit stressed at the moment.  They’re moving house soon as the block of flats they are in are scheduled for demolition.  It’s not just the move that’s got them stressed, it’s the damp that has infiltrated the flat.

Full picture:

I thought I was clever. I still needed to do my mums Christmas card along with Nikki and Kev’s. I packed everything. The threads, the designs, the aida (which I’d cut to the right size). I was sorted.
I forgot the cards and the inserts.
Mercifully, I had taken all my cross stitch stuff with me and I had cards that the finished stitching would fit in. So, here’s all the Christmas cards I made in about a month:
           
Last Saturday, I went into town for a swim and to go present shopping. I got my present to my mum and dad (a book for each of them). Swimming was a nightmare. Because I bought my pass on the Friday, it turns out I was supposed to use it then and I didn’t know I was supposed to book a specific timeslot for swimming. Got it sorted though, thankfully.
Sunday, spent some time with my nephew, Monday didn’t do anything during the day. I went to see Spider-Man: No Way Home in the evening. It’s really good, though I wish one thing hadn’t been spoiled by the bloody BBC. Tuesday back into town where I got my nephews present (t shirts) and my brother in laws (a poster of pubs in Aberdeen). Thursday, I got my sisters present (an owl decoration for her garden).
Christmas Eve, I wrapped all the presents and then went to see It’s a Wonderful Life, which is a film that I absolutely love and did so again.
Then, yesterday. From my parents, I got money. From my sister, brother in law and nephew, I got an awesome bluetooth speaker (it lights up and the lights react to the music), smellies and a gift voucher, which I’m planning to use to buy the book Storyland (an illustrated guide to British myths) and the sequel to the book When the Coffee Gets Cold.
From the postcard exchange I got, well, all this:

The lager and the passionfruit drink have been drunk, I’ve cracked into one of the packs of Tim Tams. And I’m wearing the socks:

Then my mum went into a sulk. All day she’d been saying that she wanted a picture of her and my nephew, but he refused. She said that she wasn’t going to bother taking any more pictures of him, then that she’s going to go into town on Friday when he’s here, then she stormed off to her bedroom and stayed there the rest of the night.
Thing is, I’ve limited sympathy for her. My nephew is like me, you have to get him in the right mood for him to let you take his pic and he was in a funny mood all day yesterday. Mum should know this by now.
I’m not sure it helped that my brother didn’t bother himself to call yesterday.

I was supposed to be going back home for the holidays on the 21st.  But, I don’t have to sign on again until just before my birthday so I’m going up a week on Friday instead.  Which is fine, gives me longer to do stuff, rather than rushing round.
I was also supposed to get my vaccine booster in January.  I had to wait until after 6 months before getting it, which would have been when I was at home.  A week and a half ago, they announced that they were shortening that to 3 months and today the NHS booking website was changed to reflect that.  So, I’m getting it on Friday.
Nightfall.  I’ll be honest, I kinda forgot I’d booked a ticket for it.  I went, it was freezing, but absolutely magical.  To see full pics, go back an entry.  The pic I’ve used here is now one of my favourite phrases, one I’m actually planning to get as a tattoo.
The pics were taken on my new phone.  Yup, it was upgrade time.  I love my new phone.  It’s 5g, so it’s fast.  Unfortunately, they got rid of my add on that means I can listen to Spotify so they quadrupled my data instead.
I also got a new TV.  I actually got it a few weeks ago, just kept forgetting to write about it.  It’s smaller than my old one, but it’s full HD and, more importantly, it’s not the second hand one that kept pissing me off.  also, it links up with my smart speakers, meaning I don’t have to use my remote to switch it on and off.  I also got myself a Blu Ray player, mostly for listening to CD’s, but I have bought some films.
And I think that’s about it from me.

Storm Arwen hit pretty hard on Saturday.  Very high winds, rain, hailstones.  All in all, a day for staying in.
So, of course, I had to go out in the worst of it to get my flu vaccine.  It took about 5 minutes and the only real side effect is that my arm is sore where the injection went.
Plus, Arwen also brought snow and those of you who have been reading me for a while know how much I like that.
Today, I walked out to Stockton for a Christmas market.  Here’s some pics:
     
My Christmas card making is going well.  I got the kits for some of the cards.  And I’ve got two of the other four made, halfway through the third.  I hope the effect I am looking for works.  Let me know what you think:

You can’t tell from the pic, but the white shimmers.
For fun, here’s how it looks when half done:

I met my best friend yesterday.  It wasn’t a long visit, but it was still good to see her and I fanlly gave her her birthday present.
And that’s about it, really.

New patches!  Yes, I am a Ravenclaw.
I also got a Comedian badge for my bag:

My entry title is from the song If You’re Feeling Sinister, the title track from the album by Belle and Sebastian.  I in no way felt old when I found it was released 25 years ago last Sunday…
I had a job interview on Saturday.  Well, an arts and craft session.  I had to choose between a succession of two things about Christmas.  Then I had to select something from a pile and say why I would want it on a desert island.  Then, we were put into groups and told to design an outfit using bags, wrapping paper, ribbons and bows, Then we were put into smaller groups and asked to create a product for the shop.  Quick one on one and that’s that.
Haven’t heard back, so I assume I didn’t get it.
Finally got my best friends birthday card made.  Her birthday was the beginning of the month, but I’m not seeing her for another couple of weeks, so it’s fine.  I’m making a card for the postcard exchange I run.  Then I have to get one made for the other postcard exchange I take part in.  Then I have to design four Christmas card and get the kit for and make another seven.
So, that’ll keep me going creatively.
I’m getting my flu jab on Sunday.  I’m not eligible to get it on the NHS, but it’s only £15.  I don’t usually get it but I figured, hey, why not.

So, I finished the course.  I passed, naturally (really wasn’t hard).  Now I’m just waiting for the guaranteed interview.  I know it’s going to be with Card Factory.  Last I heard they were just waiting to find out when the interviews were taking place.
I did have an information session for it on Monday, where we were asked to do some role play.  When it came to my turn to be the customer, I said I was looking for a bar mitzva card.  Just cos it amused me.
I’m going to a gig on Saturday!  See Film First emailed me today offering tickets for Elvana on Saturday for £3.50.  So, of course I’m going.  They were the second last gig I went to in March last year before everything shut down (through the same deal with the same people), so I know I’ll enjoy it.  Just won’t be able to have a pint.  Because the only thing they have on draft is cocktails.
Also, the Dropkick Murphy’s gig I’m supposed to be going to in February has been pushed back until January 2022.  Which sucks.
(And, yes, I know I still owe you a Billy Bragg review.)
I pre-ordered the last William Melville Kelley book.  It’s due to be published next week.  So, that’ll be with me by the end of the week.
As will the new ABBA album (there’s a sentence I never ever thought I’d type).
Should hopefully be getting my smart gas meter installed tomorrow.  At the third time of asking.  So, that’s me up early.  Which explains why I’m writing this at the back of midnight.
I went to see Last Night in Soho at the weekend.  Very, very good, I highly recommend it.
I’ll leave you with this:

I had a job interview last week.  It was set up through Triage.  I didn’t get the job, though I’m not that bothered, really.  Not that I’m bothered.  It was working overnight and only paid minimum wage, so it wasn’t worth it.
The reason I didn’t get it was because I didn’t show enough enthusiasm.  Not a surprise.
Thursday, I had an induction for the course I was supposed to be doing, where I once again asked to do the retail course I wanted to do.  They phoned back and I am doing the retail course.  It’s nothing particularly new, but it’s better than something I don’t need to do.
Thursday was also the Billy Bragg concert.  Will be writing that up in my next entry.
I’m currently obsessed with finding a decent carrot soup recipe.  Saturday was carrot and ginger, which I wasn’t a fan of.  Sunday was carrot and coriander, which was better.  This weekend is going to be curried apple and carrot.
Should be interesting.
Hopefully, finally, getting my smart meter for the gas fitted on Thursday next week.  Hopefully.
And that’s about it, really.

I was going to walk out to Stockton, but I left it late so I bussed out.  Stopped off somewhere for a couple of pints, then went to the Globe.
The Globe has been closed ever since I first moved to Middlesbrough over 20 years ago, but I knew they were renovating it and this was the first thing I wanted to see there since it reopened.  It is a gorgeous place, inside and out, and the folk who own it deserve congratulations since it is obvious it’s been done with love and a desire to bring it back as was, rather than updating it.
Now, a down note.  I went to get a t shirt, but it was cashless.  (I found someone to get me one from another gig and send it to me.)  I then went to the bar only to discover that it is a completely cashless venue.
Why?  Bars and shops I can (kinda) get, but a venue that size?  Really?  It’s not a good idea, if only for the number of complaints they’ll get if the system goes down.  (And, yes, I di have a contactless card, but I didn’t have any money on it.)
Also, why no warning until I got there?
Anyway, I left to have a pint elsewhere then went back for the gig.
It was worth it.  Cave and Ellis were on fine form, Cave prowling the stage when he wasn’t on the piano, asking what the on Tees means in Stockton on Tees (pointing out that Australia has straightforward town names like Adelaide), Ellis with a keyboard perched on his knees when he wasn’t playing the violin and showing off some leg:

The music was both haunting and beautiful, ranging from across Cave’s career.  My two favourites were God is in the House, one of my favourite songs from one of my favourite albums No More Shall We Part (and included an audience participation bit that we screwed up a couple of times) and Cave being joined on vocals by a backing singer for Henry Lee, which was a pleasant surprise.  They did an encore, so the whole gig was about 2 hours and definitely worth it.
I then had another pint and went home.  It was a sublime night of music and I really hope I get the chance to Cave with the Bad Seeds in the future.
I’ll leave you with God is in the House:

I needed to get new swim socks. I decided against black this time.
Middlesbrough Art weekender was a couple of weeks ago. Here’s some pics:

This is under a bridge, where they’ve started putting pieces of art.

I was hoping to buy a t shirt with this on it, but I didn’t have the cash unfortunately.

Street art
    
So, this is cool. It lights up every night (the weekender is over, but it’s still in place) and the heart actually beats.
  
Old red telephone boxes, wired for lights.

Window display.
       
Now, this is fascinating. In the shipping containers they built four miniature blocks of flats where the rooms are exquisitely decorated. You go in and they blast various sounds at you, use smoke machines and it’s just a brilliant experience.
Apart from that, there was a structure made out of spirit levels, videos playing three different versions of the songs When The Boat Comes In, a display based on a play the creator wrote and various other stuff.
Some other pics from that weekend that aren’t part of MAW:
 
There was supposed to be a pop up Pride event as part of the monthly market, but it was cancelled because of the weather. (The building is Middlesbrough Institute of Modern Art.)
  
Cool 8 bit street art.
I’m experimenting with making casseroles in the slow cooker.
New patches:
     
In the last pic, it’s the skull and crossbones patch that’s new. The ally patch is because I keep losing the badge from my coat.
I have TV back! Well, after a fashion. They finally switched on the temporary mast today. I haven’t got every channel back and it’s not crystal clear, but it’s still an improvement. I’m planning on buying a new, stronger aerial and that should improve things.
All I need now is a decent TV…

Last Sunday, I went to see Manic Street Preachers live.
I got through to Newcastle about 1.  It was too early to check into the hotel, so I went to see The Green Knight.  I’ve been looking forward to seeing this film for ages, but due to it being released on Amazon Prime at the same time no cinema near me had it.  Which is a shame.  It’s a really good film and it looks absolutely gorgeous.
I then went to check into the hotel.  Normally, I stay at a Premier Inn, but this time I stayed at the Royal Station Hotel.  I’m definitely staying there again.  It’s a gorgeous hotel, right beside the train station.  After checking in, I had a shower, went for a couple of pints then went to the venue.  I had to show my vaccine passport before going in, which wasn’t a problem.
I got myself a t shirt, one for Nikki for her birthday and this badge:

(It also says that on the back of my t shirt.)
The support act was a band called Low Hummer.  I’d never heard of them before, but I really like them.  Here’s one of their songs:

Quick smoke, then it was time for the Manics.  And they were brilliant.  They played a couple of songs from their new album, a lot of their older stuff and a cover of Sweet Child of Mine.
Rock Orchestra by Candlelight and Slam Punk was one thing, but this was what I had been missing.  A load of people crammed into a room singing along with a band at the absolute top of their game.  The lead singer so confident in what they are doing that they can step away from the mic and let the audience carry the singing, even when the song isn’t theirs.
In the Frank Turner song Four Simple Words, there’s the following lines: “Colleagues and friends condescend with a smile, yeah but this is my culture man this is my home”.  And it’s absolutely true for me.  I didn’t realise just how much I missed it until Sunday.
Here, to finish, is one of my favourite Manic Street Preachers songs, which they did perform:

Friday was the 30th anniversary of the release of one of my all time favourite albums, Nevermind by Nirvana.  I remember when I first heard Smells Like Teen Spirit.  I was a rock fan but, of course, it was all hair rock or classic rock, with some punk in there as well.  Then I heard this song that was very definitely was not that.  It blew me away and I was an instant fan.
I still listen to Nevermind beginning to end at least once a year and it still blows me away with the sheer energy in it.
On Friday, BBC 6 Music has nothing but music from 1991 with every track from Nevermind throughout the day.  It was a nice nostalgia trip with a few surprises.  I honestly didn’t realise that Enter Sandman was from 1991, I thought it was older than that.  Speaking of, it did amuse me when I got the triple bill of Enter Sandman, Head Like a Hole and Lithium at 10:30 in the morning.
I did take a break from the music for half an hour to watch the US Open homecoming with all our winners, each with a remarkable achievement.  Joe Salisbury, the first British male to win both the men’s and mixed doubles at the same Grand Slam ever.  Gordon Reid and Alfie Hewitt becoming the first wheelchair doubles team to win a calendar year Grand Slam (in what could be Alfie Hewitts last year as a player, not through choice).
And, of course, Emma Raducanu.  Guaranteed Sports Personality of the Year.  If getting to the second round of Wimbledon as a wildcard before having to retire, she won the US Open as a qualifier (first player ever to do that), without dropping a single set, without being taken to a tie break and with only one player winning more than four sets against her.  Any player who had achieved everything without the qualifier bit would have been impressive.  Raducanu went far beyond that.
I watched the final live.  Both players were exceptional and this could well be a rivalry for the ages.  I can’t wait.
I may have already bought my ticket for Slam Punk next year.  I may also have booked the hotel when the dates were originally announced.  I may also have bought a ticket for Beans on Toast live in March.
At the moment, I have at least one live gig, or event involving live music, every month bar 2 from now to June next year.
Yeah…
I like live music, what can I say?
I’m actually going to a gig tomorrow, the Manic Street Preachers.  I haven’t seen them live since 1998.  Wednesday, I’m going to see Nick Cave and Warren Ellis.  I’m also going to see The Green Knight tomorrow.
Middlesbrough Art Weekender is next weekend.  Here’s some art they put on the town hall:
     
Here’s pics I took during my visit from hell from the parentals:

Full pic:

My parents were down here at the weekend.
Now, normally, they would spend most of their time in Gateshead and come through to Middlesbrough for a day.  This time, they decided to spend a few days in Gateshead and a few here (in a hotel, mercifully).
Also normally, they phone me the day before they come through to let me know what is happening.  I knew they’d be in Gateshead until Thursday at least, as that was my niece’s birthday.
Thursday came and went, no call.  I assumed they’d changed their mind and were staying in Gateshead and coming through for the day on Saturday.
Friday afternoon, dad calls.  He might be coming to pick me up and they might need me to take my laptop.  About 15 minutes later, he calls back.  He is coming to get me and I do need the laptop.  I get dressed, pack my laptop and head outside.  No sign of dad.  He calls again.  He put the wrong house number in the satnav.  I tell him the correct one.  about five minutes later, he calls back.  He’s one street down.  It’s a simple left and left again.  This takes him about five minutes.  Meanwhile, my mum has phoned to tell me to tell dad that the hotel has said if they cancel their booking, they’ll get a refund then they can rebook.  I tell dad this and he finally lets me in on what happened.
He booked the hotel for December.  He swears he didn’t.  I know he did.
Get to the hotel, fire up the laptop, connect to the internet, cancel the booking.  Try to book for the right weekend.  Not able to, showing no availability on three websites, one of which is the hotels one.  They finally got booked in and we went to the room, where dad asks me to book them in elsewhere for the next two nights.
I can’t blame them.  The hotel was dreadful, as was the room.  They actually framed a bit of the wallpaper on one of the walls and hung the frame on another wall.
Yeah.
So, i find them a place in Seaton Carew.  A bargain as well.  My mum wants to pay by PayPal and they assure each other it’s OK because the log in details are saved on my computer.
My mother has never used my laptop for anything at all.  Yet, because it’s the case on their one, they think it’s the case on mine as well.  I point out it’s not.  Dad goes to the car to get the notebook.
Surely not?  Yup.
My mother is one of those people who writes down the log in details for every website she has to log into.  She has them all in a notebook.  Not only did they take the notebook with them, they decided to keep it in the car overnight.
John 11:35.
Eventually got the hotel booked and they take me for something to eat and a well deserved pint.
Saturday lunchtime, dad calls, says they’ll pick me up about midday and that he’ll phone when they’re outside.  I get dressed and am just about to head outside to wait for them when dad calls again.  Jump in the car, head to Seaton Carew, find the hotel (it’s too early to check in) then through to Hartlepool for a bite to eat and a bit of a wander.  Back to the hotel.
Dad gets told where to go to park the car, we park up, grab their stuff and back round.  It’s one of those hotels with no reception.  Mum was supposed to have been emailed the combination needed to get their room key, but she didn’t.  I know this because I checked myself.  Phoned the guy, got the combination and got them into their room.  We sat their chatting for a while, went to Billingham for food then they took me home.
And now, Sunday.
1pm, still hadn’t heard from them.  I try calling dad, straight to voicemail, doesn’t even ring.  Then mum calls from her phone.  They’re outside.  Get dressed, head to the car.  Dad’s phone is out of credit and he can’t make or receive calls.
We get into town and dad decides he wants to go to the bookies to put his bets on.  Insists that me and mum go where ever and he’ll catch up with us.  Me and mum wander round one shopping centre, go to another one so mum can get a radio (there’s no terrestrial TV in Hartlepool, for the same reason I don’t have any).  Then we go back to the bookies to get dad and he’s not there.
If you’re thinking that the combination of dad, on his own and us with no way of calling him means we’ve lost the bugger, congratulations, have a cookie.
We decide to head back to where the car is parked and hope he turns up at some point.  We find him, he’s going to the car to get something.  We’ll wait where we are.
At which point, mum decides to go for a wander.
John 11:35.
Thankfully, she doesn’t go far, dad comes back and we go to the nearest pub for a sit down and a drink.  Dad starts messing about with his phone and muttering under his breath.  He topped it up, but he still can’t make calls.  I take his phone from him and reboot it.  Try calling my phone, it works.  I tell him what I did and him and mum think I’ve factory reset it.  Dad then starts moaning that he never had to do that before when he had a PAYG phone.
It’s at this moment, as I’m resisting the urge to point out that he hasn’t had a PAYG phone in about fifteen bloody years and things change, as mum is banging on about being offered additional data she doesn’t actually need for her phone that I have the following thought:
If I just kill them, right now, the police will agree that it’s justifiable homicide, but my siblings may well be upset with me.
We went to a shop mum wanted to go to, went for a carvery for dinner.  When mum and dad dropped me off, I didn’t go into the flat, I just headed straight to the pub.
Anyway, they’re back home now.  Before looking after them for a few days again, I’d prefer to deal with a bunch of hyperactive 3 year olds.  It has to be fucking easier.

Friday:
I got the train and went to Leeds.  I was worried about how long it would take me to find the hotel.  Turns out I didn’t need to, it was about 10 minutes from the train station.  I checked in, went to my room, had a shower and headed out again.
I went for a wander round town.  I was looking for one place and found it.  Apart from that, I just wandered, found my way round, took pictures of pianos and dinosaurs, stuff like that.  I had a couple of pints, then headed off to see Mark Thomas.
Thomas is a stand up comedian who does political stuff.  Very left wing.  One thing he did for TV was set up a Catholic girls school as arms dealers.
He was absolutely hilarious.  I really enjoyed the show.  I was part of it.  He was doing a bit about the fact that England doesn’t have a national anthem and asked if anyone had any suggestions.  So, I suggested Flower of Scotland.  Because, what better anthem for England than a song about how Scotland beat them in battle?  After the show, I got him to sign my copy of his latest book and I got a picture with him:

Had another couple of pints, then back to the hotel.
Saturday:
Saturday was Slam Dunk day.  I got up and headed to the bus, which picked up closer than I though.  On the bus, I listened to a playlist of one hit wonders.  I walked down to the entrance, showed my vaccine pass, showed my ticket and got a locker for my bag.  Then, I waited.
They opened to doors and I decided to go get merchandise early.  Everyone will be heading to the stages to get a good place, it’ll be quiet, right?  Here’s the queue I joined:

Yeah…
When I finally got there, I got a Frank Turner t shirt, a tie dye Slam Dunk t shirt and a Punk in Drublic t shirt.  Then I headed off to see my first band.
Now, one of the bands I was looking forward to was Days N Daze.  Unfortunately, they had to cancel as they’d be flying in from a red list country and would have to quarantine.  So, I went to see their replacement, a ska band called Buster Shuffles.  They were absolutely brilliant.  Here’s one of their songs:

I put my t shirts in my locker and had a look around the site.  Then, I went back to the Punk in Drublic stage where I caught the end of The Baboon Show’s set.  They are a Swedish rock band, with all that implies.  I stayed there, because I wanted to be on the barrier for an upcoming act.  As a result, I saw Snuff, who were excellent (warning, NSFW language):

I should mention that in between sets, there was a DJ.  Who was wearing a tweed suit and bow tie.  As you do:

Next was Capdown.  A punk/ska band that I’m kind of disappointed I had never heard of before.  The lead singer went a bit too hard and fucked his leg.  Here’s one of their songs:

Next was Frank Turner and the Sleeping Souls.  Yes, that’s who I was hanging out at the barrier for.  They were absolutely brilliant, as usual.  Not sure how much security appreciated Frank encouraging crowd surfing.  The whole set was a huge communal moment.  Here’s one of the songs:

(If you pause at 2:06, you can see me in my denim hoodie hybrid jacket and a baseball cap.)
I went for a wander to one of the wifi hotspots and checked stuff online.  I got myself a Slam Dunk baseball cap and a poster.  Not having anything else to do, I went back to the Punk in Drublic stage and caught The Skints.  They are a ska/reggae/punk band and they are absolutely the find of the fest for me.  I am now a huge fan.  Here they are:

I stuck around for Anti-Flag, who I wanted to see purely because of a t shirt I saw someone wearing:

I listened to a bit of The Alkaline Trio, just enough to discover they’re not my thing, got my stuff from the locker and headed to the bus.
Sunday:
I first off all decided to wander round town, then I remembered reading about Britains oldest working train station.  What does every 43 year old need the day after being on his feet at a music festival the day before?  That’s right, an hour long walk!
I got to the train station and bought a ticket for the train.  A steam train:

It took me to a park.  I walked through the woods and it turned out it was literally a lake and a visitors centre.  I put The Skints on and headed back through the woods, got the train back, got a bus to the hotel and crashed.  I then decided to go see Shang-Chu (which is excellent).
Monday:
I checked out of the hotel, wandered round town and got the train home.
Overall, I had a great time.  It was a much needed break.

Still no TV.  The plan was to put up a temporary mast and have services restored yesterday, but there’s been a legal problem getting access to the site, so it never happened.
Not that it was much of a problem for me, as I’ve had no TV.  Literally.  The picture on my telly wouldn’t work.  I still had my old TV, but it wouldn’t stay on for more than five minutes.  I got a new one today.  It was only £44, but had no remote.  I got a universal one.  I’m going to save up for a new one after next weekend.
In the meantime, I dug out my old tablet and used that as a TV.  The problem with doing that is that it has no SIM card, so I had to use the WIFI.
No problem, right?
For the past few months, whenever we’ve had heavy rain I’ve had intermittent disconnection issues.  We had heavy rain recently, so guess what?
Yeah…
When I phoned EE, I was actually asked about bad weather, so I told them.  The guy booked an EE engineer to come round and to a test.  He was in and out in 5 minutes.  He admitted he was only there because it was something he needed to do before escalating the problem.  EE phoned on Thursday and an engineer was booked for yesterday.  He came round, did a couple of tests then went to check the box.  Dirty connections, which he cleaned.  He then did more tests and discovered that the problem was at the top of the pole.  The cable had got crushed.  He fixed that and did one more test in the house.
The problem isn’t completely fixed, I still need a new router.  Once that arrives, I should be good.
In non tech news, next weekend I’m away to my first ever music festival.  It’s just a one day one, but it should be fun.  There’s only two band I really want to see (Frank Turner and the Sleeping Souls [shock] and Days n Daze), but I’m hoping to discover new bands.
I’ve mostly been watching the Paralympics.  The opening ceremony was absolutely beautiful.  I’m not a rugby fan, but I have to admit that the wheelchair rugby is great to watch.  And my mums friend and his wife both won gold today, which is awesome.
New patch:

My uncle George died on Wednesday.  He was working on a church roof when the scaffolding collapsed.  He was pronounced dead on the scene.  An inquiry is going to start tomorrow.
He wasn’t one of my favourite uncles, but I did get on with him.
TV news.  I can watch TV without streaming!  I can only do so if the show is on the BBC, but still.  Getting there!
Well, are they?

I’ve been listening to chill out stuff on BBC radio today, which has been fun.  I need to make a chill out playlist on Spotify.
I got bored today and did a thing:

Still no telly.  Here’s the story: on Tuesday afternoon, lightning hit the transmitter that serves my area, causing a fire.  Because the transmitter is a tubular one, it took a few hours to put out.  It hasn’t been fixed, because they don’t know if it’s structurally sound (as a sign of how big it is, there’s a 200 metre exclusion zone around it).  Some people do have TV and radio service from another transmitter, but it doesn’t reach many people really.
They’re looking for a suitable site nearby to put up a temporary transmitter.  A wrinkle is that the transmitter is in a site of specific scientific interest, so they’ll need permission to put the temp transmitter up.  All in, might be the end of next week before I get services resumed.  Might.  The temp transmitter is 80 metres tall, which means it might not reach everywhere.
Thankfully, I have my downloads, I have my streaming services (I’ve just finished rewatching Cruel Summer) and I have Spotify.  I usually play one of my playlists, but at the moment I’m relistening to The Drop Out and relistened to WeDrop.
Yesterday I had big plans for my day.  Then I ended up sleeping most of the day.  Still got my shopping done, but I didn’t get for a swim and I missed the chance to shop for mums birthday present.  I need to go into town on wednesday for an appointment, so I’ll shop then.
Made up for it today.  I decided to go to Stewart Park to have a look at the farmers market.  For as long as I’ve lived here (21 years now) I’ve never actually been to the park, so I loaded up If It Bleeds, It Leads (excellent true crime podcast I highly recommend) and started walking.
Here’s some pics:
        
I’m planning to go back for a proper wander round.
Then I went for a swim after watching the final race of the Formula E season.
Some 8 bit street art (shame about the tag over it):

Thankfully, I have this weeks The White Lotus and S1 of Cruel Summer I can watch.
I got my ear piercing changed on Saturday.  I did buy a cute spider to put in:

I couldn’t get it in and it turns out the piercer doesn’t fit any jewellery she didn’t sell.  So, I went a bit Aladdin Sane and got this instead:

Then, after about half an hour and a lot of fucking swearing, I got my spider in:

Just a warning, this will be a bit pic heavy.
I got myself a new slow cooker.  I kinda had to, the other one didn’t cook things properly.  The new one is electronic and it has a hinged lid!
 
So, of course, I had to break it in by making spaghetti bolognaise:

It was creamier than usual, but still nice.
Let’s see, what else…
I have had fun with my neon cross stitch thread.  It looks good:

But it’s not easy to use.  Lets just say lesions were learned.
These lesions made using the glow in the dark thread easier to use:
     
I went to see Another Round.  It’s really good however, as the BBFC warned me, it turns out that a film about people maintaining a certain level of intoxication contains scenes of people drinking.  Whodathunkit?
Saturday, I went to see The Suicide Squad.  It’s absolutely brilliant and I highly recommend it.
Friday was Rock Orchestra by Candlelight.  Of course I was going to get a ticket for that.  The pics are one entry back, if you haven’t seen them yet.  It was absolutely excellent, except for the fact they only had one bar open during the first intermission so I missed the first song.  Which I was looking forward to.
New artwork on the streets of Middlesbrough:
    
And there’s an anti-vax group round these parts that are putting stickers all over the place.  It’s the usual crap (references to clot shot and the great reset) but then there’s this:

I’m not saying that it’s too bloody hot in Middlesbrough, but…

My coconut oil melted in the cupboard.
I got the new gas card for my smart meter.  The one that hasn’t been installed yet.  I’ll need to phone them and find out what’s happening.
I’m currently watching The Show Must Go On, a special concert of songs from West End musicals.  It’s really good, I’m enjoying it.
Yesterday I made chicken chop suey.

It was good.
Tomorrow is freedom day, when all remaining restrictions in England are lifted.  Unless, of course, you are the current Prime Minister, in which case you have to isolate after being in close contact with someone who has since tested positive.
And it’s stories like that that make you realise why The Thick of It will never return.
Patches!  I decided to wash my jacket to get rid of the excess glue.  Unfortunately, it also took of the patches.  So Friday and last night was spent reattaching them.
And here they are.  The front:

The back:

Close ups.

The one what started it all.

I’m proud of where I am.  And I keep trying to remember the middle one.

I was supposed to get a smart gas meter fitted today, so I was up early.  The guy turned up, took photos, went outside then came back and said he couldn’t fit it because there’s something he needs.  Thankfully, this was done by 8:30, so I went back to bed.
I had to get some cross stitch stuff, so I headed out to the craft shop just out of town.  I got the stuff I needed.  I also got this:

Yes, that’s neon yellow cross stitch thread.  Yes, it’s fucking awesome.  (I’ve also since ordered some glow in the dark thread.)
I also got spray on fabric glue for sticking patches to my jacket.  It’s easier than the glue I was using before, gives a more even distribution and needs less time to set.
On Saturday, I also had some Duff beer:

My two latest pics to go up:
 
I’m currently rewatching the new season of Leverage.  It’s excellent.
The Wimbledon women’s final was outstanding.  The Euro’s final was OK.

I just removed a bunch of programs from my computer.  It’s been extremely sluggish, so hopefully this’ll make a difference.  Certainly seems to have so far.
I was also having a problem with my instant pot, where I would have to stop it, vent and restart before it would cook.  So, I did the cleaning thing (2 litres of water, run for half an hour then quick release) and that has got it working perfectly.
I went to an art and vintage clothing sale yesterday.  It’s one of those things where you pay by weight.  I didn’t get any clothes, but I did get some stickers, a coaster to give as a present and a couple of badges.  I also got this picture:

I’ve mostly been watching Wimbledon this week.  And being massively impressed by Emma Raducanu.  She has a massive future ahead of her.
I also got some fabric glue.  I’ve been wanting to put patches on my denim/hoodie hybrid jacket for a while, but the problem is I can’t sew.  Now I don’t need to worry.
I got myself two new books (I know, I know).  One is Cain’s Jawbone by Torquemada.  He was a crossword setter who introduced Britain to the cryptic crossword.  At the end of a book of puzzles he put out, he put a 100 page crime story.  But the pages were published out of order.  The puzzle is to work out the correct order of the pages, the identity of the six victims and the method of death for them.  Only three people have ever correctly solved the puzzle.
The second one is Sophie’s World by Jostein Gaardner.  Which I got because I could get a free book and a line from it is the title of one of my favourite albums.
The title, by the way, is just a nifty line I thought up.  It kinda feels like the title of a story, though what that story is my brain hasn’t told me yet.

I phoned my dad last week for Fathers Day.  Normally, my dad would thank me for the card and present, we’d chat briefly then he’d put mum on the phone.  This time, however, he didn’t mention the card or the present, we chatted for about 10 minutes then he hung up.
I phoned my mum on Monday for a chat and he did get the card on time.  She also moaned that my brother forget to send dad anything, though he did remember to phone.  So, that’s younger brother in the bad books.
You can read about Tuesday in my previous entry.
I’ve been feeling a bit off all day.  I had to cut my swim short because it honestly felt like I was swimming through treacle.  My stomach has been dodgy as well.

I went to get my second jab yesterday.  It was up at the Riverside, so I decided I would also order the new Boro top click and collect so I could avoid delivery charges and having to male the trip special.
I already knew that the vaccine centre was at the back of the stadium, due to Kev going there for his first one, so I walked up and went to go to the back.  Which was when I was told that I had to walk all the way round the stadium and go in that way.
Great.
So, round I go and directed where to go and give my confirmation number.
Bugger.
I had requested a confirmation through both text and email, but hadn’t received either.  After spending about a minute reassuring the guy that, yes, I did have an appointment, another member of staff confirmed that some people never got confirmation.
Inside the stadium, it was very quick, they just confirmed my appointment and gave me a copy of my NHS number.  Slight wait before going into the hut, answered a few questions and got the jab.  In my right arm, the first went in my left and it amuses me to have one in each.  Perfectly balanced.
Five minutes in the waiting room and I was free.  I walked right round the stadium again and went to the shop, where I bought myself a hoodie and picked up my top:

And here’s a close up of the design above and below the band:
 
It’s the Transporter Bridge!
Then, I went to see the council.
You see, the part of town I live in, there’s gates closing access to the alleys.  And behind these gates is where the bins live.  Which is fine, if you have either a key to the gates or access from your house.  I don’t have the latter.  I did have the former, but they decided to change the locks.  I needed to get a new key.
I thought it would be simple.  Go in, hand over old key, get new one, right?
Wrong.  I needed proof of address.
I couldn’t be arsed coming home then going back into town, so I went to the bank to print out a statement.  After getting a lecture about being able to print it out at home, they let me in.
Only my most recent statement was too old for the machine to let me print it out.
Surely the shop for my phone company would be able to help right?
Wrong.  They can’t print out statements in the shop for data protection reasons.
I had to download my bank statement to my phone and get it printed out at a print shop.
But, I got my new key.
As for the jab?  I’ve lost my vaccination card (but it’s all registered on the app I have anyway) and, unlike the first one, the only side effect is a sore arm which is more or less gone now.

The picture makes sense if you know anything about England fans and pundits, international tournaments and a song.
My friend wasn’t able to meet me down the pub and by the time he told me that I couldn’t book a table.  So, I dressed up:

(I took the mask and flag off for the game), settled down with my lager (in one case literally:

) and watched the game.  I have to admit, we should have won.
And, yes, I got drunk.
The last group game is on Tuesday and we need a win to have a chance of remaining in the tournament.  Fingers crossed.
On Tuesday I also have my second vaccine.  Which reminds me, I’ll have to look out my “Not Dead Yet” t shirt.
I phoned my dad to wish him happy fathers day and we talked for a bit.  I know how present made it, because mum told me when I phoned on Tuesday, but I have no idea if the card did.  I’m going to phone and speak to mum tomorrow, so I’ll find out then.

Yesterday, the Scotland men’s national team had their first game in an international tournament since 1998.  How did we do?  Well, I kinda wish we hadn’t bothered qualify after that performance.  Still, hopefully we’ll do better on Friday against England.  It’s not like we could do worse…
The plan for Friday was to get a keg of Schiehallion in and watch it at home while hurling abuse at the commentators.  Then a friend messaged me on Sunday, so I might be meeting him to watch the game down the pub.  If that happens, it’s gonna get messy.
My power went out as expected on Thursday.  However, it went out at 8:30, not 10am as promised.  But it came back at 1pm and I’ve had no issues since.

My power went out on Monday. Then again on Thursday. So, that were fun.
Finished Line of Duty. T’was good. I’m currently watching I May Destroy You which is brilliant.
I’ve also been watching the French Open all day, which is fine because I don’t have to change the channel. Not long until Wimbledon either.
Course, the womens tournament is the most interesting, because unlike the men, I have no clue who is going to win.
Just don’t get me started on the Naomi Osaka thing (basically, she’s right and the tournaments are wrong).

As you might guess from the title, I’m finally getting round to watching Line of Duty.
Saturday night was Eurovision night!  This bit is going to include videos, but none from the night itself as they’re all geoblocked in the States.
Our entry was James Newsome with Embers:

How did we do?  Well, we came last.  And despite the fact that it was theoretically impossible with the current scoring systems, we did so with absolutely no points whatsoever.  Which I think is harsh.  I didn’t think we’d win, but I thought we’d do better then that.
I mean, we got less points than this, for fucks sake:

Now onto my favourite songs.  The first one was Frances entry, Voilà by Barbara Pravi:

As one friend put it, it’s so French that the audience spontaneously started smoking unfiltered cigarettes.  I love this type of music though.
Next up, the Portuguese entry, Time is on My Side by The Black Mamba:

Not entirely sure why I like this one, I just do.
Next is Iceland.  Ahhh, Iceland, represented by Daði & Gagnamagnið (and, yes, I did copy/paste the band name).  Now, they were favourites to win last year with Think About Things:

Which is a song I really, really like.  But, the competition was cancelled.  They were chosen again this year, but had to enter a new song.  They went with 10 Years:

A rather sweet song written about the lead singer and songwriters wife (She’s the keytar player on the left).  Then they didn’t get to perform live in either the semi final and final as two of their team tested positive for Covid.  (To add insult to injury, the lead singers wife tested positive when they got home.)
Blind Channel from Finland up next with Dark Side:

In case you’re wondering why they didn’t actually put their middle fingers up, the EBU wouldn’t let them.  This is obviously Finland trying the same thing that saw them win with Lorde.  It shouldn’t surprise you that I like this one.
And finally, the winners.  Italy.  Måneskin with Zitti e buoni:

Yeah.  Again, no surprise that I’m a fan.  They also caused a bit of controversy as it appeared that the lead singer did a line of coke, on camera, while the results were read out.  He denied it and the band passed drugs tests when they got home.
Sunday, I went to see Judas and the Black Messiah.  Which is a very, very good film indeed.
Hopefully going round to see my best friend and her lad on Saturday.  Then I might book myself a table at the pub.

In case you’re wondering what colour that is, one of them is the shirt I’m wearing in this pic:

So, I now have three shirts that colour, as a bought another short sleeved one yesterday just to in case things didn’t work out (it’s reduced, so I didn’t want to wait and not be able to get one).
Also, I booked my second vaccine shot.  I’m supposed to wait until I get a text from my GP, but I found out that, using my NHS number, I could book one online through the NHS instead.  So, in just over a month, I will be fully vaccinated!
(It’s also at the Riverside Stadium, so it’s easier to get to.)

I is an idiot.  Last night I did a wash and threw in a t shirt I was certain had been washed enough.  It wasn’t.  So, now my brand new Sami Zayne t shirt is blue, not white and my two lovely sand coloured shirts are a horrible grey.
They’re now sitting in a bucket of water, because I have to keep them wet and colour run remover shall be delivered tomorrow.
I’m planning to stop swimming with my cap on.  It’s been a month since I got the ear piercing and it doesn’t seem to be infected, so I should be alright.
That and I hate wearing the fucking thing.
More restriction lifting tomorrow!  Next weekend I will, with any luck, be able to go round and see my best friend and her lad and I’m planning to go to the cinema and watch Judas and the Black Messiah.
Next weekend is also the Eurovision Song Contest, so I’m looking forward to watching that and being bitchy about it online.
I keep meaning to say, I’ve been doing breathing exercises every night, using an app on my watch.  I’m up to two minutes and am planning to go to three in the next couple of weeks.  It’s quite relaxing.
Have another funny:

My internet issues got sorted.  Until it wasn’t.  Then it was.  Then it wasn’t.  Seems to be fine now but, of course, it cut out when I was watching the Stanley Odd livestream.  Right at the beginning of my favourite song of theirs.
I mistimed going for a swim today and ended up having to do lengths because of the swimming class.  So, I left pretty early.  Not much of a swim when you’ve reached the other side in less than three strokes.
I may have bought a ticket for Dropkick Murphys in February.
As you can tell, my life is thrilling at the moment.

I’m having internet issues.  For the past 5 days, my internet has been cutting out completely.  I phoned my ISP and they confirmed that it’s an external line problem, passed it on to BT Openreach and it should be sorted in 4-5 days.
Still annoying when it kept cutting out during a Dropkick Murphys livestream.
I got up too late to make chicken tikka masala in the slow cooker, so I used the instant pot.  Not bad, but not as good.
I swam this weekend with my cap on.  Bit strange getting used to it, but it seems to be working to keep my earring dry.
Don’t really have much going on at the moment.  So, here’s Rainbow Connection:

Warning: political rant.
There’s a fair bit of sleeze surrounding the current Government and the PM, but this one starts with James Dyson.
He decided he wanted to design and build ventilators for the NHS. He didn’t however, want to pay taxes for some of the workers who would actually be doing this. So, he texted the PM personally and got him to change the laws. (It must be pointed out that Dyson delivered a grand total of 0 ventilators as the design was never approved for use.)
We know this, because information about the texts, and the texts themselves, got leaked.
On Thursday night, the PM himself phoned newspaper editors to let them know the source of the leak was Dominic Cummings.
Some of you may remember Cummings from my entry about a year ago about his, erm, unusual eye test.
This is a mistake, for the following reasons. 1) say what you want about Cummings, he’s very good at playing this sort of game. Very good. It’s kind of like taking a sword cut out of a tissue to a nuclear weapon fight. 2) Cummings used to be the PM’s most senior advisor. He knows all the secrets. 3) Cummings loyalty extends solely to Mr D Cummings Esq.
So, Cummings started firing back. And he decided to start big.
Thus it was that the story broke late last night that, after the decision was made to go into the second lockdown in November, discussion turned to the possible need for a third lockdown. In response to which, the PM is alleged to have said “No more fucking lockdowns – let the bodies pile high in their thousands”.
Now, it has to be pointed out that this is just a rumour, though there are people beside Cummings stating it’s true.
But here’s the thing. Here’s what has caused by absolute loathing of the PM. Despite the fact that it’s just a rumour, I can absolutely believe that he said this.
I have no particularly strong feelings about Major and Brown, dislike Blair and May, detest Cameron and outright hate Thatcher. However, if this story came out about any of them, I would struggle to believe it’s true, in some cases even after evidence was presented.
I should not be living in a world where I can completely believe that the Prime Minister of my country would be perfectly happy to see thousands of people die rather than take the action needed to prevent that from happening.
It’s not a nice feeling.
And that is why there are no words to describe my loathing for the man.

The title is a quote from the song Love and Death and an American Guitar by Jim Steinman. I’m a fan of his. Of course I am, none of you should be surprised to hear that. I was introduced to him, as with most folk I expect, through Bat Out of Hell. One day, I mentioned this to a friends dad and he introduced me to Bad for Good, Steinmans solo album. He copied it onto tape for me and I wore the damn thing out.
Steinman died on Wednesday, which is absolutely gutting.
I listened to Bad for Good on my way to get my first vaccine jab on Thursday and was reminded just how damn good it is.
Yup, I’ve joined vaccine land. The whole thing was very quick, I don’t think I was even there five minutes. I got the Astrazenica one. The side effects were not fun (I’m pretty sure that was behind my awful nights sleep Thursday night). Now to wait until my second jab in about 12 weeks.
I also just got my birthday present to myself. I got my ear pierced:
 
I can’t swim tomorrow (which I wasn’t planning to anyway) and will need to cover my ear for about a month after that. I should have a swim cap round here somewhere that should do the trick.
I have to visit the job centre on Monday. That’ll be fun!

*EDIT* I should point out my birthday was in January and it was my intention to get my ear pierced than.  However, with lockdown the tattoo studio was shut.  So, I got it now.  It’s still a birthday present to myself, however

I finally watched Hamilton on Disney+ last night.  It’s really, really good, I just wish I could see it live on stage.
That was after I tried to watch La La Land.  I gave up after 45 minutes, or about 7 meet cutes, when I realised I was enjoying doing the backstitch on a cross stitch card (I hate doing back stitch) more than the film.  Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling have negative amounts of chemistry and neither of them can sing very well which is a huge problem for the stars of a musical.  With Emma Stone it is fucking baffling, because she can sing perfectly well in Easy A.
Friday night I watched Promising Young Woman, which is a devastatingly good film with the most satisfying film ending I’ve seen in a long time.
I also watched the first episode of The Nevers this week.  Slightly disappointed about one thing but, despite that, I’m on board.
Went swimming for the first time since Christmas yesterday and today.  Despite cramping up, which has literally never happened to me before, it was amazing getting back in the pool.
I also did a thing today:

I actually wanted to go fully bald, but this’ll do.  And, no, I won’t smile.
Took a long walk today to get a couple of bits for recipes.  Wasn’t able to get everything I needed, but I did get these pics:
 
Got the third book in the You series this week.  And the new Stanley Odd album, which is in the form of a book.  And the first novel by Akala is winging it’s way to me.
I’m going to finish by plugging this Kickstarter because it’s a fantastic idea and needs money.

I’ve discovered that I’m the last in my immediate family to be vaccinated.  Which, I was expecting and am fine with.  It’s rumoured that they’re opening up vaccines to those over 45 tomorrow, so my prediction to my mum that I’ll have at least one shot by my brothers birthday next month seems to be spot on.
The next stage of lifting restrictions is upon us.  Next weekend I will be able to go the gym and get my haircut.  And possibly finally get my birthday present to myself.
As such, I have washed my swimming trunks and my swimming socks.  My towels have recently been washed, so no need to bother with them.  I think I may have defogged my goggles after I last used them, but I’ll do so again.  It’s not like it’ll hurt.
Apart from that, not been up to much.  Had a virtual meetup with some fellow single Frank Turner fans last night which was drunken and fun.
I also found out this is true:

Not sure if you noticed, but an old man died on Friday.  I couldn’t escape from the news.  Thank fuck for Pluto TV, Netflix and Disney+.
I know that sounds a bit callous but, c’mon, guy was 99 year old.  It’s not like he was cut down in the prime of his life.

Next Monday, I’ll be able to go for a swim and get my hair cut.  I won’t, I’ll be waiting for the weekend, but still.  I could.
I’ve also just found out that the shop downstairs has been paying my electricity bill for a while.  Course, I found this out because they were threatening to cut my power.  Phoned the guy who owns the shop, it’s his issue now.
I made BBQ sauce in the slow cooker a couple of weeks ago:

It’s nice.  There wasn’t much there, do I made more this weekend.  This time, I pushed it through a sieve to make it smooth:

Which was oddly relaxing.
I watched the Aberdeen game and a monster movie marathon on Saturday and classic sci-fi and the Cove Rangers game on Sunday.
Beyond that, not much is happening with me.  Just counting down the days until I can go see Nikki and all my gigs and stuff in the second half of the year.
I’ll leave you with most of my postcard collection:

Snood.  The word you’re looking for is snood.
Had my eye test yesterday.  My prescription hasn’t changed enough for me to need new glasses.  I just need to remember to wear the ones I have as much as I should.
Finished making a bookmark this week:

Well, I say finished.  I finished the design, I’ve still to actually finish it off.  Which I’m not looking forward to, as I can’t sew.  Hey ho.
Went for a long walk today:
          
I made mum a card with a raccoon on it for Mothers Day.  My dad thought it was a cat.
I’ve started watching The Falcon and the Winter Soldier.  Also the new season of Drive to Survive, which has puzzled and annoyed me with how they handled something.
Had a fun Zoom chat last night with some fellow TTZ writers.  We talked politics, podcasts, pets and crazy eyewear.  (BTW, if you listen to podcasts the episode of Reply/All called The Case of the Missing Hit is the single best episode of a podcast I’ve ever heard.)

I wanted to put the patch I told you about in my last entry on the back of my denim jacket, but I can’t sew.  So…

I also went out for my walk for the project today.  Here’s the picture I took to represent change:

And the one with my street level policy:

Unfortunately, I lost the poster.
My terrible t shirt:

Yes, it is terrible:

Last night I made myself chicken chow mein.  It was good, but I need to make more sauce.  Tonight was spag bol with neef and pork mince.  Didn’t really notice the difference.
Apart from that, not done much.  Not much for me to do really.

I don’t know if I mentioned it, but I’m taking part in an interactive art thing called The Peoples Palace of Opportunity.  I’d kinda forgot about it, when I got an email saying it’s about to start.  I’ve got three things so far.  A flyer, with a hidden note containing the badge in the pic, a letter and today a box.  In the box is a letter, a leaf, a biscuit, a piece of street chalk, a patch, a flyer and some blu tack and drawing pins.  I’ve to download something and take the chalk, the flyer and the blu-tack/pins with me.  I’ll do that on Sunday.
I’ve put the badge on my coat, with the “More hope than fear” the right way round.  I really wanna put the patch on one of my hoodies, but I can’t sew.  Can cross stitch, but not sew.
My gym emailed saying they expect to open on April 12.  But, I don’t have to pay anything til May as they still owe me access from November.
Hopefully, I’ll also be able to get what I was planning as a birthday present to myself done then as well.

Finally got my Christmas present from my sister and her family hung up.
So, I now know roughly when I can expect to get my first vaccine jab.  Assuming the first 9 priority groups are vaccinated on time (which they should be), the next group is 40 – 49.  So, that should start mid April and my expectation is that I’ll have the first dose by mid May.
I’m currently making pasta sauce in the slow cooker.  My plan was to cook it overnight, but I underestimated how many tins of tomatoes I needed by a factor of 3.  It’s going now though.
I’m currently trying to listen to the Aberdeen game, but my connection keeps dropping.  Need to speak to EE about that.
I’m getting a new watch!  This one measures REM sleep and has a blood oxygen monitor, which I’ve been wanting for a while.
Supposed to be having a video chat with some fellow Frank turner fans tonight, but not sure if it’s going to be on Zooom, Facebook Messenger or something else.  If it doesn’t happen, I’ll watch Grosse Point Blank instead.
Need to have a shower, but the shop downstairs has switched off the water and I’m not sure when it’ll be back on.  Bah.

I’ve signed up for a thing called Art from Crisis.  I pay £8 a month, I get an A5 print of a painting by a homeless person and the money helps homeless people.  The entry pic is the first one.  Here’s the full thing:

I watched the last episode of It’s a Sin last night.  It’s an absolutely stunning series.  Funny, heartbreaking and the acting is brilliant.  It’s easily the best thing RTD has ever done.  If you have HBO Max, I highly recommend it.  Though, it’s RTD writing about the gay scene, so there’s a fair amount of graphic gay sex scenes.
I bought myself an air fryer.  It’s mostly for making chips, but I’ll have to play around with it as the lot I made today weren’t done too well.  Here it is on cooking gadget row:

Tomorrow, I’m going to try making lemon chicken in the slow cooker.
I’ve got a couple of zoom meetups coming up.  The first, probably next weekend, is a Frank Turner fans silly hat meetup (I’ll be wearing my steampunk top hat).  The other, in a month, is a TTZ one.

There was a guy ranting about God outside two of the shopping centres in town yesterday and that’s where the title comes from.  Curiously, he framed it as not being able to become a prostitute.
I’m weirdly excited about a ring.  There’s a ring I used to have and I absolutely loved it.  Then, I lost it a few years ago and ever since I’ve looked, but never found a replacement.  I was pootling about on Etsy last night and I fucking found one!  Of course, I bought one.  Should be here in the next couple of days.
I made slow cooker spag bol today, but I used turkey mince instead of beef.  It wasn’t bad, but I won’t be bothering again.  Wasn’t quite right.
I’m getting a phone call tomorrow to redo my claimant commitment for the job centre.  So, obviously, they don’t think this situation will be over any time soon.
In typical DWP fashion, it’s only about 10 months late…
WandaVision is fantastic.  The Serpent is good.  It’s a Sin is going to be nigh on impossible to top as the best series this year.  It’s funny, it’s heart breaking, the music is outstanding, the third episode is almost relentlessly bleak.  I would urge everyone to watch it but it’s RTD writing about the gay scene (the show is about the gay scene during the AIDS endemic in the 80’s), so you should only do so if you are comfortable with graphic gay sex scenes.

So, the title.  I can explain…
Frank Turner has brought back his weekly livestream to raise money for independent music venues.  During the second one, some racist cunts decided to try and hijack the live chat.  The chat was immediately filled with heart emojies to push their message off and Frank decided to play this song:

One of them took to Twitter to boast about what he did and my title is his description of Frank.  It’s now Franks Twitter bio and he put it on a t shirt and sold them to raise money for the Leeds Asylum Seekers Support Network.
My birthday was fine.  I watched TV, read some more of Pandora’s Jar and drank some Camden Hell.
Apart from that, there’s not much happening.  Made leek and potato soup in the slow cooker yesterday.  It was nice, but it’ll probably be nicer when I actually remember to put the garlic in next time.  Today I had instant pot chicken tikka masala, which was really nice, but not as nice as the slow cooker one.
At the moment, I’m watching Election.  Great film.
Mum and dad are waiting to get their appointment for their first Covid jab.  Mum, in her late 70’s and having had a triple heart bypass, has said she’d be willing to wait to let someone vulnerable get theirs first.

Innit awesome?  Mum and dad asked me to hunt in the loft to see if there was any of my old stuff I wanted.  There wasn’t, but there was this.  Mum said it was fine, so I got it to fit in my bag and took it back.  It’s now the first thing I see when I get home.
For Christmas, I got a hoodie, some smellies and money from mum and dad and a framed print defining the phrase fit like, some smellies and some candy canes from my sister, brother in law and nephew.
Boxing Day, I went into town which was mostly about the long walk.  Though I did also swap the hoodie I got.  It was a really nice hoodie, but it was a pullover style, which I don’t like, so I swapped to for a zip up one.
I again went into town a few days later, again, being mostly about the walk.  While on the two walks, I finished listening to the Small Axe and Wecrashed podcasts and listened to the Radio 4 adaptation of Neil Gaiman’s The Sleeper and the Spindle.
Incidentally, if you listen to podcasts, the Reply All episode The Case of the Missing Hit is one of the best single episodes of a podcast ever made.
Got home and almost immediately went from tier 4 into national lockdown.  It was expected, in fact it was slightly late.
So I dyed my hair:

Tonight, I made chicken cacciatore:

It was nice, but it needs something.  Not sure what yet.
While away, I finished reading Troy by Stephen Fry (fantastic), read Antkind: A Novel by Charlie Kaufmann (good, but very Kaufmann), The Odyssey by Homer (as good as I heard) and A Promised Land by Barack Obama (which is fantastic and the current President obviously agrees with me)
And that’s about it.  I turn 43 on Tuesday which’ll be spent with some craft lager, a book about women in Greek mythology and a parmo.

Couldn’t resist using that pic.
The journey back to Aberdeen was uneventful.  Read Private Eye, watched It’s a Wonderful Life, had a snooze.
Saturday, I went into town.  Got the pics in my last entry, went for a swim.  The gym took my temperature, I signed in and they told me where everything was.  There’s no changing rooms beside the pool, so I had to walk through the reception to the pool in my trunks and swim socks and then make the reverse journey afterwards while wet.
So, that was fun.
It’s a decent pool though.  Longer than the one down the road, but that sort of gave me a good measure of where I am fitness wise.
I then went for a wander round town (getting more of the pics in my previous entry), during which a complete stranger asked me if I wanted to buy his album, then went home.
Remember me saying about my gym closing for Christmas and New Year and it was good I was up here?  Yeah, well, the whole of Scotland is going to be going into the highest level of restrictions from Boxing day, so I won’t be able to swim after that.  I’m planning to go again tomorrow, but at least I have two more swims than I would have had down the road.
Both mum and dads tech problems are solved.  It took about 5 minutes, to be honest.  the main problem they have is that the computer is 5 years old.

No pics in this entry, they’re all on my phone and I can’t be arsed getting them off just now.
I’m going home on Friday.  Yes, I know i probably shouldn’t be, but it’s either spend the holidays at home with my family or spend Christmas Day in my flat, on my own, drinking all day.  So, off home I go.
My gym has announced they are closing over christmas and new year.  The hotel they are attached to is closing,so they kinda have to.  I’m only being charged for half the month next month.
Not that the closure actully affects me.  They close the day after I go home until the day before I return.
My sister is getting her first vaccine jab today.  Not much of a surprise, she works in a breast cancer screening clinic, so I knew she’d be near the top of the priority list.  With mum being in her 70’s and having had a triple heart bypass it won’t be longbefore she gets hers as well.
I’ll be waiting a while, but that is as it should be.
I’ve discovered that chorizo style British sausages are not an adequate substitution for actual chorizo.  But, I’ve got the base recipe for the paella down, so time to experiment.  I’m probably just going to add a red pepper.

143,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/a-midsummerfest-carol-4-5936267/,2020-12-09,A Midsummerfest Carol,"
On some planets, in some cultures, it’s traditional to celebrate on or near the shortest day of the year. Typical. Celebrating when light is in the shortest supply.
Here, however, we’ve got it right. Celebrate when the day is longest, when there’s maximum light to be able to do so. Much more sensible. Same as in those other cultures, presents, feast, visit from a mysterious visitor leaving gifts.
Poppycock, the whole damn lot of it. I’ve never been a believer that it’s anything other than an ordinary day. Didn’t like getting presents, certainly didn’t like giving them, saw the food as an unnecessary extravagance. It’s still the same. I’m a successful businessman. No one, and I mean no one in my company got the day off. They couldn’t even book it off as a holiday. Business as usual. No bonuses, no gifts. It didn’t make me popular, but I’m not in the business I am to make friends. Just the cash.
All that was true till this year. Then the bloody Electorates did what they did best. Stuck their noses in to other people’s business. Declared that, unless you were employed in an essential service, you had to get the day off, paid. Well, I soon found a way round that. I sacked the bloody lot of them. Every single one. The lucky ones will get their jobs back. The extremely lucky ones will get the same level of pay.
I was enjoying a quiet drink on front of the image box when I got a very mild surprise. My old partner, Joe Cregg, walked through the door. Literally, as it was still shut. That’s not the only thing to surprise me, the fact he was there at all was a tiny shock as he had been dead these six years previously.
‘Jex, Jex, Jex. What is going on? I’ve watched you these six years. I wasn’t that surprised with the direction you took the company, driving costs and wages down while keeping prices high. But sacking everyone just before Midsummerfest. Really? Really? That’s cold, even for you.’
‘Why does that surprise you Joeleph?’ I replied, lighting a cigar. This was deliberately to annoy him. He hated me smoking when he was alive and he couldn’t exactly do anything about it now. ‘You know how I feel about the whole ridiculous thing.’
‘That’s very true. But making them beg to get their jobs back, when you are the only game in town?’
‘If they don’t like it, they can take their chances and go somewhere else instead. You going to try and talk me out of this particular course of action?’
Joe shook his head. ‘I’m not that stupid. I know you, I know there’s no convincing you. I’m more the advance guard. There will be others. Don’t know who they will be, but there will be three of them.’
I grinned. ‘Bring it on. I can take it.’
Joe shrugged his shoulders and walked out the door. I would have been shocked and surprised by what had just happened, if I was capable of being shocked by anything. I finished my drink and went to get another one. I flicked through the channels, getting annoyed by all the bloody Midsummerfest programmes. I gave up and left it on as background noise while I looked over the books finding places to reduce our overheads and therefore make me more money. My favourite pastime.
I heard someone clearing their throat and looked up. There was a strange looking person standing there. Long hair, baggy clothes, I actually had to wait for him to talk before discovering it wasn’t actually a female. There’s no need for anyone to look like that really. Scruffy git. He tilted his head and stared at me like an infinitely patient guru. Or a complete and utter numpty.
‘I suppose you’re one of those folks that Joe warned me about?’
‘Indeed I am. If you would be so considerate as to rise yourself off the chair and proceed in a manner that is following where I lead you, it would be muchly appreciated.’
‘Did you swallow a bloody spellingbook or something?’
He continued to stare at me in a manner that I suppose was supposed to be piercing but merely made me think he had something wrong with his sight. ‘It has been commented before that I tend to communicate in a way that can be described as being ever so slightly on the side of the verbose, that much is in the record as a statement of fact. However, my fine person of the male persuasion, the manner with which I carry out my verbal interactions with other personages is not the matter or mission upon which I am currently standing in this fine room which is part of your place of abode. You, in all actuality, really do need to be following where I precede you to. If you find my style of conducting communications of the conversational variety to be not of your particular taste than the greater velocity with which he hence from this place of dwelling, the sooner I shall no longer be chatting to your good self.’
I got up, sighing. A spellingbook? This guy seems to have swallowed the entire language for dinner then another one for desert. I headed towards the door.
‘Oh, dear me, my fine and upright male type,’ he said. ‘There was a particular and very rational explanation as to why I asked your fine self to follow me. For you shall not be removing yourself from the confines of these four splendidly decorated walls in the manner with which you are quite accustomed. If you would ever so kind as to follow in the direction and general manner of which I shall be leading and proceeding, it would be much and greatly appreciated.’
It usually takes a lot for me to lose my temper but this guy was very close to it. ‘Where are we going?’
‘I would request that, in all humbleness and obsequiousness, that the sooner that we cease and desist tarrying and remaining in this place, the sooner your eyeballs will observe detail and catalogue our ultimate destination.’
‘Do you ever say things simply?’
‘My dear and sweet gentle person of the male persuasion, it is the humble opinion of my good self, your guide, mentor and narrator, that to use one piece of vocalisation when you could use ten is sheer, total and utter laziness. Shall we depart from the ground on which we currently stand and the space we presently occupy with no further delay?’
I gave up and followed him. We walked, not through the door, but through the wall at the rear of the room. Rather than ending up in my dining hall, as I would expect, it being the room through there, I found myself outside. The house we stood outside looked familiar to me, though I couldn’t quite place it. My annoying guide turned to me again.
‘Now I do find that it is my solemn duty to be informing you that in this place, at this time you are as spectral and non-corporal as my own good self, your dear, late and much lamented friend and partner in the world of business and the two personages that shall be paying you the honour and the privilege of a visitation once I have departed from your fine and muchly enjoyable company. Now, my dear sir, if you would once again be so kind as to place your lowest appendages in the steps of my own feet, we shall proceed with the entering of this simple, humble yet very homely abode.’
I followed him through the wall into the house. I got a shock when I saw someone I instantly recognised, sat slumped on the bottom step, crying over a package I again recognised. ‘Soxanna Hamilsmythe,’ I whispered.
‘So, your good self has recognition of this poor, weeping visage that sits before us? And would there be, perchance, any glimmer of familiarity with great concern to the package she is currently blessing and moistening with giant drops of water?’
I looked closer. ‘It is a present that she tried to give me. We must have been in Learning Eight at the time. I remember laughing and shoving it back in her face.’
‘Well, that simple act did give her much reason for the painful act of grievance. The poor, very unfortunate womanly person you see so tortured before myself and yourself spent a lot of time and no small amount of trouble to be absolutely assured that the small but perfectly chosen gift would be much to your liking. The poor dear was completely, totally and utterly head over heels in love with you. That simple but very much of the cruel description act with which you returned the present did break her poor delicate heart. And, may be as bold as to enquire as to the nature and direction of any feelings you may have harboured towards her?’
‘I was in love with her. I did try to approach her after this happened but got short shrift. Now I know why. Is this what you are planning to do, make me visit places like this?’
‘If that was indeed my intention and my plan, it would be very, very easy to do sir. For there is absolutely no doubt or equivocation in my, or anyone else’s, mind that of such personages supply cannot be described in any way, shape or form as being short. Beings of the human variety that may easily be described as friends of yours, familial members, there is indeed a plentiful supply of these types. However, our time together is, by necessity, short and thusly my humble self can only be of a mind to let you view and peek on one such example. This wretched creature was thusly chosen as being the one that you would catch sight and sound of as it may well be the one that made the biggest impression on you. Now, if it would please and pleasure you, I must bid you adieu and the most fairest of wells. You shall be departing of this place by the very means and direction with which you came in.’
With that, he was gone. I walked through the wall I went through to get in and was back in my living space. I went to the drinks cabinet, poured a very healthy measure of alcohol and downed it. What exactly was that supposed to teach me? When I turned back round there was someone else there. Definitely female this time. She pointed at me.
‘You. Follow,’ was all she said. Thank the Gods for that, short on conversation. We left though the front wall this time. We stood outside the house. She pointed to the house opposite mine.’
‘Look.’
The house was festooned with horrible lit decorations. It was really not becoming. Then she turned round and pointed again.
‘Look.’
I did. My house, looking perfectly normal, the way things should be.
‘You not decorate.’
‘It’s cheap, tacky and in celebration of something ridiculous. I really don’t see the point.’
‘But you make.’
‘Of course I do. Low production costs, massive profits. I’d be mad not to.’
She turned again. ‘Follow.’ I did. We walked down the street, turned the corner and followed the next street till she stopped, turned and pointed at a house. ‘Look.’
‘And this is important to me because?’ I asked.
‘Azander MacToro. You know’
‘The name rings a bell,’ I said. ‘Think he works in accounts.’
‘Follow.’
I followed her into the house. Sat there, looking morose amongst the bustle, was Azander.
‘Glad to see he’s not enjoying himself.’
‘First Midsummerfest with family,’ she said. Can’t enjoy. Can’t have fun. Busy worrying if will have job tomorrow.’
‘Good. Anyone having fun at this stupid time of year should be zapped on sight and then zapped again to ensure they are dead.’
She pointed back to the wall. ‘Leave.’ She disappeared and I walked through the hall, back to my place. This time I didn’t move. Sure enough, someone else appeared in my living space. Female again. She looked a bit kinder than the last one, however.
‘Let me guess,’ I said. ‘You want me to follow you.’
‘Dude, you catch on pretty quickly,’ she replied. She walked towards one of the side walls and I followed her. We were in my street, but there was something different about it. The lights looked completely different for a start.
‘Have a look in that bin. There’s something there that might interest you.’
I went over and picked up the box resting on the top. The fact that I could pick it up was a surprise. ‘I didn’t think I’d be able to do that, being non-corporeal and all,’ I said.
‘You shouldn’t be able to, but exceptions can be made if needs be.’
 I looked at the box, drinking in all the information on there. ‘I don’t recognise this.’
‘We’re about 20 years in the future. That box used to contain the very latest in cutting edge technology.’
‘It’s not made by me.’
‘Indeed not,’ she agreed. ‘Come on, follow me.’
I put the box back and followed her down the road. She led me into the graveyard. I never liked this place. Far, far too dark and dingy for my tastes. If they sold me the place, like I’d asked, it would have been turned into an amusement fair.
We walked through rows and rows of extravagant monstrosities dedicated to people who can’t actually appreciate them to a bit at the back. This was the area for pauper’s graves. My guide pointed at one. Written on a tiny, badly whitewashed, crudely made cross was “J Washburne.”
‘That my grave?’
‘It is.’
‘What happened?’
‘Your miserly cost cutting measures made your products unusable. You refused to invest in making anything else new. Competitors moved in and stole your staff. The company went bust. You lost a load of money and, due to your attitude, you had no friends. This is what you become. And now we must part ways.’
She disappeared and I walked through the wall from one version of my living space to the other. I got myself a drink and sat back down, flicking through the channels on the image box and thinking.
Now, you may be under the impression that everything I saw had given me food for thought, made me realise that I had to change things. Sorry pal, wrong story. I was actually recalling everything I learned from the box I held. There was a nice project for the development people tomorrow.

Time for the annual repost.

I can explain the title.
The pic is the scarecrows my parents next door neighbour put up in their back garden for Halloween.
I went to a place I’ve always wanted to go to a couple of times before lockdown.  One was for a hip hop night that never ended up happening, so I just ended up chatting with the staff and the owner.  The second was for a night of soul and jazz.  Here’s some pics of the venue:
           
I got up ridiculously early today, so I’ve been productive.  I’ve got my dishes and my laundry done.  I was planning on not moving from the house, but I need wine for my cooking today.
I’m considering ditching my microwave.  I never use the bloody thing and the space could be used for other stuff like my spices (which I really should get a proper rack for.)
I need to get onto my landlord about the lack of hot water in the kitchen.  I would have reminded him this week, but I managed to blow the water valve in my boiler this week and that needed fixing first.
This is the card I made my best friend for her birthday:

Awesome, isn’t it?  I also made these cards:
 
The cooking is going well.  I’m glad I did this this year.  (Which is to say I left it too long between entries to remember exactly what I made since my last update.)
I’ve also stopped drinking during the week.  It was just something I felt I had to do.  Well, except for certain times.  I drank the night of the US election when watching results come in and on Thursday for the Scotland game.

As expected, the government have backtracked on making sure hungry kids can’t get food thing.  It was announced last night at midnight.  I wonder why they announced it when the entire world was distracted by the USA?
(Incidentally, I am stoked that Trump has gone.  Listening to Biden and Harris’s speeches last night, the difference after the last four years was noticeable.)
And the government are going to do something about the leaks that are coming out, most notably the second lockdown.  They’re going to Tyrion Lannister it and give different people different information and see which version the press get.
And, how do I know this?  It, erm, well it got leaked.

Yes, I’ve decided that the one thing you really need on election day in the US is an entry about politics here in the UK.
So, in June and July the lockdown ended and things started opening up. Then the Government decided to boost restaurants by creating a scheme they called Eat Out to Help Out. This gave everyone 50% of an eat in meal, up to a value of £10, every Monday to Wednesday for the whole of August.
There’s no way whatsoever that this could be a bad idea and exacerbate the situation, right?
One piece of research estimates it boosted transmission by up to 17%.
Ooops.
But at least it helped out restaurants. And, by some accounts, saw widespread fraud.
Then schools went back. Which saw, yet again, a rise in cases. Then universities went back, which saw huge outbreaks in the halls of residence. At one, they literally locked the students in. The food situation was dire and they were at risk of running out of post-it’s from making signs in windows.
Most universities have now gone back to online except where really necessary. After, of course, taking their tuition and rent. Students at one university are threatening a rent strike and at least on firm of solicitors are offering their services pro-bono.
Meanwhile, there’s our track and trace system. The one that was going to be world beating. The first attempt at an app completely failed. This is because, instead of using the Android and iOS systems like everyone else did, the government decided to build their own from scratch.
Even I could have predicted it wouldn’t have worked.
So, they eventually built one that did use the Android and iOS system. And added a QR scanner, for no real reason. (OK, it’s actually to scan yourself as being in places. It’s more hassle than it’s worth.)
Oh, and because it is based on an old version of Android and iOS it gives out false alarms (I’ve had a couple myself). When it was launched, if you didn’t book a test through it then you couldn’t let it know that you tested negative and it still insisted you self isolate.
While this was happening, there was the other side of track and trace. The call centre side. Which has a 60% success rate at contacting people. Some local councils currently have a 95% success rate in the same. That’s right, our world beating track and trace system couldn’t even beat local councils.
The price of this? £12 billion.
While all this was going on, the government picked a new target. And got into an argument with a Premiership footballer about helping hungry kids.
For this story, we have to go back to before summer. When schools were out because of the lockdown, parents were given vouchers for food for kids on free school meals. Manchester United striker Marcus Rashford started an ultimately successful campaign for the voucher system to be extended for the length of the summer holidays. For this, he was given an MBE.
It’s coming up to the Christmas holidays and Rashford has started his campaign again. The Labour party put forward a vote in the Commons on the issue. The Tories, as if they were determined to prove they are indeed the nasty party, lined up to speak against.
Were you aware there’s an epidemic of drug dealers taking £15 vouchers for food in shops in exchange for drugs? Apparently, it’s a serious problem over here.
They then voted the motion down. One Tory MP argued after that most of the money goes to crack dens and brothels and doubled down by saying some of the vouchers would be used to buy scuba gear.
Then, the government decided to simply things by having local situations indicated by a three tier system. Tier 1 is medium, tier 2 is high and tier 3 is very high. What tier 3 actually is is determined by negotiations with local government.
Then Greater Manchester needed to move to tier 3. And the negotiations failed. The mayor of Greater Manchester asked for £65 million in additional funding while the government were offering no more than £60 million. So the government decided to impost tier 3 on them and gave an additional £20 million.
So, now the simple 3 tier system is tier 1, tier 1+ (no, me either), tier 2, tier 3 (with local council agreement) and tier 3 (imposed).
Simple, no?

One of the cross stitch things I made.
Remind me later in the week to write a political entry.  I have thoughts.  Also, probably sarcasm and definitely swearing.
I officially passed the course I was sent on.
Food!
The fish stew I mentioned in the last entry:

For @darkmadonna, here’s the recipe.
The only changes I made was using a half teaspoon of cayenne and adding king prawns.  It’s gorgeous, with just the right amount of bite.
Saturday, I made chicken tikka masala:

It was OK, but not a patch on the slow cooker one.
Sunday, I tried leek and potato soup:

It looks like wallpaper paste and tasted of dirt.  I won’t be making that again.
At least I got an immersion blender out of the deal though.
I also realised I’m an idiot.  The recipe for butter chicken said to use tomato sauce, which I took to mean ketchup, as that’s what we call it over here.  Through making the masala, I discovered I should have been using tomato passata. 
D’OH!

There was a girl at the gym yesterday wearing a mermaids tail.
My landlord came round the other day to get me to sign a new tenancy agreement.  So, hopefully he’ll be sending someone round to sort the hot water tap in the kitchen.
I went to see The Trail of the Chicago 7 last week.  It’s really, really good.  I went to see Saint Maud last night and really enjoyed that as well.
I’ve started doing cross stitch again.  Mostly because of the postcard exchange I run.  I went out to Teesside Park today to see if I could find green aida for something.  Couldn’t find that, but I did get these pics:
  
I’ve also decided I’m going to make my best friend a birthday card saying “Happy Fucking Birthday Nerd”.  It amuses me, it’ll amuse her.
I made the butter chicken last week, with the right amounts of everything.  Well, I couldn’t find heavy cream, but Google tells me I can swap it for whipping cream as they’re basically the same.  Tasted much better, though I will be reducing the amount of tomato ketchup.
Tonight, I’m making Brazilian fish stew again.  But with added prawns.

It’s amazing the stuff I learn from Mystery Hour that I had no idea I wanted to know.
Talked about the power cut, shown off my new ink (see last two entries).
Food! Last week I made chicken curry out of a packet in the slow cooker:

If I use this stuff again, I’ll add some curry powder, because it was impressively bland for a curry.
Yesterday, I made butter chicken in the instant pot:

I messed this recipe up. I used the wrong type of cream (I couldn’t find heavy cream, so got double instead), used too little cream and added too much garam masala. Despite that, it turned out OK, though I’ll wait until I’ve made it properly to really judge.
I got a new mask. I’ve lost my map of Scotland one (it’s in the house somewhere, just not sure where) so I ordered a Star Trek one:

I went to Etsy to get another one (it’s really comfy) and discovered that I actually ordered one in red with the gold logo. So, I’ve messaged them.
I passed my food safety course.
Went swimming yesterday with a patch on my new ink. My tattoo is now angry with me, so went for a walk today instead. Here’s three pics:
  
The government has finally released a track and trace app and they’ve overengineered it. There’s no way to log a negative test, there’s no way to log any tests that weren’t requested from the government. And it’s got a QR code scanner so I can log in to places.
Now, there’s two problems with this. One, there’s no way for me to log out of places and two, it’s made it more complicated than before to go to the pub. Before, it was a case of writing down my details or giving them to a member of staff. Now, I have to get my phone out, unlock it, find the app, open it, open the scanner and scan the code. It’s a classic case of thinking that because it’s tech it’s automatically better. It’s not.

For the second time this year, I’m in the middle of a power cut.
And, unlike last time, it’s not during the day so the only light I have is the torch on my phone and my laptop screen.
Thank fuck for my insane power bank and the 50 gig of data EE gave me.
Will
EDIT: twice niw Ive got a text saying the problem has been fixed, twice now I’ve had to call back and point out it isn’t.
Will
SON OF EDIT: my power came back on at about 9:10 this morning,  Meaning about 12 hours with no power.  I’m going to have to chuck everything in the freezer.  Well, except the vodka.

I can has hot water!
The hot water has been off for a while, but I kept forgetting to phone the landlord about it.  Someone came round to service the boiler and spotted the issue.  He came back on Wednesday and, after going to get another part he didn’t know he needed, fixed it!
Course, now my wifi is playing up.  I’ve been getting an intermittent connection since this afternoon.  EE thinks it’s a router issue, so they’re sending me a new one and they’ve given me 50 gig of data on my phone so I can tether that to my laptop in the meantime.  Which is one of the advantages of my mobile and broadband from the same company.
It’s playing nicely for now, but may that continue for a while.
Two weeks ago, I went to see The New Mutants, mostly so I’d know it did actually get a proper release.  I enjoyed it.  Last night, I went to see Bill and Ted Face the Music, another film I can’t quite believe got released.  I highly enjoyed this as well.
At the moment, I’m watching the Louis Theroux show looking back at his career.
I did make the white wine garlic chicken two weeks ago:

It was good, I enjoyed it.
Then I read about a Brazilian fish stew called Moqueca, so I got a recipe for something similar and made that last Saturday:

This I really liked.  I might add something like prawns and something to give it more of a kick.  But still very nice.
Yesterday, I made myself chicken supreme from a packet:

Definitely getting a recipe to make this from scratch.  Tonight, I’m having slow cooked chicken curry, again from a packet.
And Tuesday I get my new ink.

The pic is nicked from the FB page for my gym and is the swimming pool I use.  On the left is the jacuzzi.  They call it a spa, but it’s a fucking jacuzzi.  The bit benched off is the steam room, sauna and the shower for them.  They’re, for obvious reasons, off limits at the moment.  I just thought I’ve talked a lot about swimming here, you might like to see where it happens.
The course went well.  On the Monday, the tutor was off.  So we did workbook stuff until midday, went to get our free packed lunch then home.  On the Tuesday, we were off, so I had a lazy day at home.  Wednesday was the food safety course, which I hopefully passed.  Thursday was a race to catch up on what we missed (we were supposed to do stuff at home on the Tuesday but, well…)  Friday was finishing up.  I also came home with four bags of crisps as I was the only person who liked the flavour we all got.
Last week, well, read my last two entries.
My slow cooker died on Monday, so I’ve just bought myself a new one.  I was planning to get another 1.5 litre one, but only one place had one and there were plenty of places that had 3.5 litre ones for a couple of quid more.  I had sort of been thinking about getting a bigger one, so I said sod it and did so.
I did see one I was tempted by where the outside is a chalk board, but I’d never use that bit, so I didn’t bother.
Tomorrow, I’m christening the new one with white wine garlic chicken.
Last weekend, I made paella for the first time:

It was gorgeous.
I’ve got an addition to my wall of music:

It’s a signed Emily Barker print that I got with her new album, A Dark Murmuration of Words.  I’ve been a fan of hers since I saw her supporting Frank Turner on tour, so it was an easy buy and the album is absolutely gorgeous.  Highly recommend it.  This isn’t a song from her album, but it’s the first song of hers I heard.  It’s about Sister Rosetta Tharpe:

(And I’ve just discovered that if you paste a youtube link directly into the editor window, it automatically adds the video for you.)
Tonight, I’m going to see The New Mutants, just so I can have the ticket stub to prove it was actually released.
Monday, someone is coming round to do a gas safety check.  They could have done it yesterday, but they didn’t contact me on Thursday to set it up until about 11pm which pissed me off, so fuck him.
Have to go put the washing on.

So, I guess I need to explain my last entry.
On Tuesday, I got a call telling me that one of the folk on the course tested positive for Covid.  Now, I knew that there was a very good chance that I didn’t have it, but I figured better safe than sorry.  So, I filled out the form to get a home test.
That arrived yesterday.  So, at the apopinted hour (I had to do the test just before posting and I had to post one hour before collection) I got everything out, checked it was all there, registered the test online, blew my nose and went for it.
Now, the up the nose bit was fine.  Felt a bit weird, but that was it.  The problem was before that, the back of the throat.  I have the weakest gag reflex in the known unverse, so that was 10 seconds of almost constant gagging while trying to remember to roll the cotton swab round my tonsils.
Then I got everything packaged up and stuck in the post (Ilive about 2 minutes from a priority delivery postbox).
I got my results today.  I am officially Covid free.

There’s a TV channel over here that has Next Gen marathons on a Sunday morning and today had The Best of Both Worlds Pt 1 and 2.  Always good stuff.
How’s class going?  Look at the entry pic.  That’s how.  On Thursday, we were split into teams and told to create a hospitality business.  My group created a bar/restaurant with a reading/computer room called The Sprawl.  So we were asked to design a cocktail, make it on the Friday and offer them round.
Well, it was a mocktail as we weren’t allowed to add fun juice.  My groups is called The Refresher and is a mix of apple juice, carrot juice, ginger syrup (we used ginger beer) and lime juice (we used lemon and lime).  It tasted nice.
Wednesday I do my food hygiene course.
Evolution of a Will:
  
Thursday I cut my hair, yesterday I dyed it purple.  Turned out not too bad, actually.
Mum’ll be happy.  They are starting to lift the lockdown in Aberdeen from midnight, with pubs and restaurants being allowed to open from Wednesday, environmental health permitting.  So, unlike her and dads wedding anniversary, she’ll be able to celebrate with a meal.
Yesterday, I made risotto with bacon and peas:
 

It was really nice and sticky.  Though I’ll probably fry the bacon before adding it rather than in the pan and I might add mushrooms next time.
Today was slow cooked pork chops in barbecue sauce:

I did make a change to this recipe.  I used normal barbecue sauce instead of the honey stuff because I don’t like the honey barbecue sauce.  It was OK, but I’ll need to add something to give it a bit more of a kick next time.
I did go for a swim on Tuesday and Thursday.  On Tuesday, the only other person in the pool was an older lady with a sequined swimming cap.  Not party sequined with small sequins.  The whole thing with big sequins.  I also went swimming yesterday and today.

The jobcentre has sent me on a course.
I had a choice between a call centre course and a hospitality course.  I have plenty of call centre experience, so I chose the hospitality one.
One of the folk in the part of the college I am in for this is someone I was at college years ago.  He’s also inspired me to see if I can do a TV and film production course to get back into that and catch up with how the industry has moved on (last time I did a course, HD was just coming in and we filmed on Mini DV.)
There is an unexpected bonus.  Three of the people on the course were told that they would be getting a food hygiene certificate.  We weren’t, but we are now.
Apart from that, not much is happening in my life.
Mum’s not happy.  It’s her and dads wedding anniversary this week.  Because of the lockdown, all the pubs and restaurants are closed in Aberdeen and they can’t get reservations outside Aberdeen either.
I’m getting back into cross stitch.
My swim on Saturday was slightly frustrating because of people messing about.  On Sunday, most of the pool was closed off for swimming classes so I could only do breadths.  But I didn’t do too badly.  I’m going tomorrow after class.
And I had to get myself a new halogen oven as the timer on my one decided not to work properly.  The new one is digital, so less chance of that happening.

I got back in the pool yesterday.  In terms of getting back to where I was back in March, I wasn’t too bad.  I think the walking helped with that.  In terms of an actual swim, it was frustrating because, again, there was a large group of people who seemed to think that the pool was their private pool.  GRRRRRRRRRRRR!
I did get these pics of signs on the Town Hall:



I also spotted this:

Todays swim was much better.  But, it shows the gym is lying.  According to them, 14 people can be in the pool at a time.  Bullshit.  There was 7 of us and there was barely room to move.
On the plus side, the patches I bought to protect my tattoo worked.  On the minus side, I managed to wear my mask into the shower, which was stupid of me.
I took a long route home to get my weekly walk in and spotted the horse in my main picture.
Food!
The lemon garlic chicken turned out OK:

I’d make it again, but next time I think I’ll only use 1 lemon, because it was incredibly sour.  But not unsalvagable.
Then during the week, I got an unexpected urge to make French Onion Soup.  No picture, because I forgot to take one.  Not quite to my taste, but I’ll play around with it.  But, I now know I can caramelise onion in the slow cooker, which is always good to know.
Yesterday I made Chicken Adobo in the instant pot (I’m pretty sure I got this recipe from @GypsyWynd:

This turned out really well, I’ll definitely be making it again.
And finally, I got confirmation of exactly how brain dead some Aberdeen FC players are.
There’s been a Covid outbreak in Aberdeen, which started last weekend.  Someone who came back from the rigs couldn’t be bothered to wait for his test results before going out on the piss.  They, of course, tested positive.  The outbreak has been linked to 28 pubs, clubs and restaraunts, three golf clubs and a junior football team.  The city is now back in lockdown.
So, what’s this to do with the club?
Well, it turns out that eight of the players decided the best thing to after a weak, insipid performance was to go out for a meal and a few drinks.  And they got caught up in the whole thing.
The result?  Two of them have tested positive and the other six now has to self isolate.  Our game yesterday was postponed (it should have been a forfeit) and our next two games will be played without 6 of our starting 11.
We know who they are, as they put their names to a public apology.  One of them also did an interview for the club YouTube channel.  So, how did they not realise that people from seven households broke the rules about how many different households can meet?
They thought that because they train together, they counted as one household.
Yeah…

So, my sister in law has convinced my brother to raffle their house.
In case you think I’m joking, why would I possibly want to make this up?
She sent me a message on FB asking me to promote the raffle page.  I’m not going to.  I refuse to aid their obvious breakdown.
I’m going swimming next weekend!  I’ve got waterproof bandages for my ink.  Well, I’ve got the thing that was put on the tattoo I got when gyms closed down and the makers swear it’s waterproof.  We’ll see.  I’m currently washing my swimming gear and I’ve defogged my goggles.  I’m actually quite excited.
No pics of the garlic chicken I made last week.  The cream split while cooking.  It looked horrible, it smelled horrible and it tasted horrible.  That’s something I’m never making again.
Today I’m making lemon garlic chicken in the slow cooker.  I would have a picture, but I forgot to switch on the cooker and didn’t realise for three bloody hours.  Just about done now.

Last Saturday, I made Lime Chicken with Rise in the slow cooker:

It wasn’t too bad. I’m not sure if I’m going to use less butter, more lime juice or both nest time because it tasted too much of the former and too little of the latter.
Sunday, hey Jambalaya!

This was done in the instant pot and it tasted good. Next time, I’m going to spice it up a bit and try and get shrimp instead of king prawns (not a bad substitute, by the way).
Monday was parmo day. Normally, I just get this from a takeaway shop, but there’s a butcher near me that’s started selling kits to make it at home:

The chicken could do with flattening out a bit, but beyond that, it’s good.
Wednesday was Chicken Florentine in the instant pot:

This recipe has been deleted. It was aggressively bland. And I can’t think of what to add to change that.
Yesterday was Chicken and Rice in the instant pot:

First of all, I’m not using chicken breast for this again as shredding it was a fucking nightmare. I’ll use the diced chicken instead. I’ll also add more paprika and possibly some chilli flakes to spice it up.
Today I’m going to make the Garlic Chicken again. This time with the right amount of chicken stock.
I also got myself a new garlic press. This one you rock over the garlic to crush it. It’s really good. Much easier to use and to clean. Plus, it came with a thing for peeling the garlic, which makes life a lot smoother.
I’ve just had to order rechargeable AAA batteries. I signed up for Now TV and got the stick that plugs into my telly. But, the remote eats batteries (the new batteries I put in on Thursday are now at about 40%). So, the rechargeable ones seem like a good investment.
I got myself two new books. One is I’m Thinking of Ending Things by Iain Reed. This came to my attention because Charlie Kaufman has adapted it for Netflix and I’m a huge fan. The other is Parkland by Dave Cullen. He wrote a book about Columbine, but this one was the more interesting to me.
And that’s about it.
Well, except the new ink.
Yup, yesterday was tattoo day. It took about two hours, but I’m very, very pleased with the results:

It really is much better than I thought it would be.

*EDIT* at the request of @GypsyWynd, here’s the garlic press:

Cute, ain’t they?
At the moment I’ve got lime chicken cooking in the slow cooker.  The actual recipe is lime chicken with rice, but I haven’t added that yet.  Tomorrow, I’m probably going to make Jambalaya in the instant pot.  Never had Jambalaya before, so it’ll be interesting.
A butcher in town is selling chicken parmo kits, so of course I bought one.  I’m also at some point this week going to be making chicken florentine.  The recipe calls for either two tins of cream of chicken soup or two tins of cream of mushroom soup.  So, I got two tins of cream of chicken and mushroom soup.
I’ve booked myself in for two new tattoos.  The one I’m getting nest week is my clan crest and in September I’m getting a potion bottle with a skull in it with a tooth as a stopper.  It does mean I won’t be able to go for a swim for a month after the gym opens up again next week, but I’m going to keep up with my walking so it’s fine.
I’ve started listening to The Sandman adaptation on Audible.  That’s where I get the title from (though, it turns out it’s a real thing).  So far, I’m impressed.

I’ve spent most of this weekend being an idiot.
Yesterday, I decided to make Spanish chicken and rice in my instant pot.  I bought all the ingredients and cooked it.  And I did think there was too much chicken stock.  And it did almost fill the instant pot.  But I thought it would be OK, cooked it, went to release the steam and it started spewing stock everywhere.  The end result wasn’t particularly nice either.  So I had to chuck the whole thing.
Then today, I was trying to make garlic chicken with tomatoes in the slow cooker.  And it filled it slow cooker and I had to use the instant pot.
Then, I realised something.  I had multiplied the amount of stock needed by a factor of 10.  So, for example, instead of making 350ml of stock, I made 3.5 litres.  That was more food thrown out.
Thankfully, I had decided to have another shot at making the Spanish chicken tomorrow, so I had all the ingredients.  I cooked it again and this is the result:

It tasted good, though I might try adding more tumeric next time.  Or possibly putting it into the pot instead of mixing it with the stock.  I’m also going to use red pepper instead of green, but that’s mostly an aesthetic thing that anything else.
Next week, I’m definitely making lime chicken with rice in the slow cooker.  I wanted to this week, but I couldn’t find lime juice when shopping yesterday.  I got some today, so that’ll be dinner next Saturday.
My new additions for the wall of music arrived yesterday.  The first two aren’t actually on the wall.  When Frank Turner played a live stream gig to raise money for The Grand in Clapham, there were a few other people in the gig.  To raise money, they were selling stuff.  Included in that was a signed photocopy of Franks setlist and a signed photocopy of the setlist for Beans on Toast:

At least Beans actually signed that.  The other thing I bought was a poster for the event signed by both Beans and Frank:

In the top left, you’ll see Franks signature.  In the bottom right, you’ll see a distinct lack of Beans signature.  That’s because he got going on the tequila before signing them all…
I’ve pre-ordered the new Philip Pullman HDM novella.  Of course I have.

The shop where I get my incense started selling these and they’re so adorable I couldn’t resist.  Here they are indivdually:


I’m probably going to get another 2 at the weekend and try and stop myself there.
I’ve finally found a way to stop getting the popup about leaving the page when I try and add pictures.  I have to add them before writing the entry.  This, of course, means I have to change the font back after each picture.
My mum is allowed to cuddle my nephew again.  So, that’s her happy.
On Saturday, I made chiken tikka masala in the slow cooker.  I changed one thing from the recipe, using chilli flakes instead of a fresh chilli pepper.  But the chilli pepper is optional, so it’s not a big deal.
It was absolutely fucking gorgeous.  Stunningly good.  No adjustment needed.  Here it is:

Sunday, I remade the spicy pasta thing I made before.  I used different pasta sauce, which wasn’t hot enough.  But that’s OK, I can add chilli powder to spice it up.  I also added onion and mushroom, which made a real difference:

It also tastes nice cold, which is a bonus.
I’ve gone on a bit of a book buying binge.  In the past two weeks, I’ve bought The World According to Garp by John Irvine (read it before, love it, haven’t owned a copy for a while now), Nick Cave the complete Lyrics 1978 – 2013 by, well, Nick Cave, Why I’m No Longer Talking to White People About Race by Reni Eddo-Lodge, Sorry for the Dead by Nicola Upson and Antkind by Charlie Kaufman.  I also pre-ordered the Penguin clothbound classics edition of The Aeneid.
So, yeah.
I’m going to keep watching I’ll Be Gone in the Dark and reading Antkind.

It’s been unbearably hot the past two days.  It’s raining now, which has cooled things down.
I’m almost finished watching the first season of Evil.  It’s really good, but I’m not sure how the buggery it’s a network show.  It’s incredibly dark.
I made the chicken with shallots.  Here’s how it turned out:

I’m going to need to use less shallots (or more beef) and something to thicken the gravy, cos it’s more like a sauce.
I also remade the beef casserole:

This tasted much better with the tomato paste.  Needs more veg though.
I dyed my hair green:

It’s not exactly how I’d like it to be, but there we go.
Not much happening in my life, really.  Considering taking a photography course.

Full pic:

Last weekend, I decided to make chicken in mushroom sauce in my slow cooker.  One of the ingredients is marsala wine.  A quick Google showed me that I could use Pinoit Noir instead, so I got a bottle of that.  Needing to use the rest of the wine (I’m not a big wine drinker, particularly red wine) I decided to make beef casserole during the week.  I put everything in, started it cooking, when, about an hour before it was due to be finished, I realised I forgot to add tomato paste.  I then discovered that I didn’t have any.
So, here’s a pic of what it looked like:

I’m not judging it taste wise until I make it properly.  And the chicken in mushroom sauce?

I’m ripping this recipe up and starting almost from scratch.  The only things that will survive is the chicken, the mushrooms and the onions.  I’m going to use mushroom soup rather than chicken (seriously, why say it’s a mushroom sauce when it’s not?) and I’m going to try white wine instead of red.  And I’ll be using a damn sight more than a tablespoon.
At the moment, I’m making beef and shallots in a red wine gravy.  We’ll see how that goes.
I did see my best friend last week, but not in the way I was expecting.  She texted last Friday to say she wasn’t up for a visit and that she’d spoken to her doctor about headaches she’s been having.  The doctor prescribed painkillers and she wasn’t sure about going into town to pick them up.  I needed to go shopping anyway, so I offered to get them and take them out.  So, it was a quick “here’s the meds”, but I still got to see her.
My boiler stopped working last weekend.  It was saying low water pressure, but it wouldn’t let me add water.  The plumber seemed to think it was something I was doing wrong.  Turned out, it was a valve that was knackered.  So, it’s working now.
I’ve started a wall of music.  Here’s the beginning:

It’s in the hallway, so it’s hard to get a decent pic of.  The top one is my No Man’s Land one signed by Frank Turner and the bottom one is the first of 13 I’m getting from Stanley Odd.

I haven’t seen my best friend for ages.  Even before lockdown, I hadn’t seen her for months.  In fact, I was thinking about arranging to meet up with her and her lad literally a week after lockdown was announced.
And so, we’ve been texting each other to check in and tell jokes and stuff like that.  And it’s been fine and that’s pretty much what our relationship has always been.
Then yesterday, we were introduced to the concept of the safety bubble by our “esteemed” Prime Minister.  What’s a safety bubble?
Well, as of Saturday, anyone living on their own (or a single parent with a kid under 18)can pick one household of any size.  Those two households can spend time inside together without social distancing.  They can stay over if they want.
Now, there are rules.  Once one house is bubbling with another, neither can do so with another house.  And if one person in the bubble gets symptoms, everyone has to isolate and test.
Now, this is supposed to be so that grandparents can spend time with their grandkids.  But, you can pretty much guess that it’s been described more in terms of people shagging.  It also doesn’t hurt that this means that single parents can have childcare.
There are a lot of questions, but there always are with the Governments announcements.
Now, I live on my own.  So I phoned my best friend and asked if her and her lad fancied a visit on Saturday.  After assuring her this was allowed, she said she would like to see me, but it depends on how she feels.  So, she’s going to text on Saturday.  Hopefully, she’s up for it.

Post walk selfie.
I had to buy a new deep fat fryer, as the old one had sprung a leak.  A slow leak, but a leak nontheless.  I ordered one from Argos and it was ready to collect today.  Which meant that my walk had to go a different route then I was planning.
I thought I wouldn’t get any pictures, but I took a different route back into town and I saw horsies!
        
Completely random.  They were all tied up, it’s not like they were loose.  But, still.
I picked up the fryer.  The place I got it from is a catalogue shop situated in a supermarket.  Normally, I go there and I have to queue for the supermarket and people wanting the catalogue shop got to skip.  The one day I want to go to the catalogue shop and what happens?  I have to queue while customers for the supermarket got to skip.
I then picked up some oil and, I’ll admit, some Innis and Gunn lager.
And, yes, that is a new face mask.  I was tired of having to pull mine down and back on when I wanted a drink or a smoke.  The advantage of the new one is it’s worn around the neck so it’s a lot easier.
I’ve got another one on the way with a map of Scotland on it.  Just because it looks cool.
I also cut my hair again:

Say it with me: no I will not smile.
I’m planning on dying it again.  Just not sure if I’m going to use the five year old hair dye in the bathroom cabinet, or buy more hair dye of the same colour and wait until it ships over from the far east.  Google is torn on the issue.
I’ll probably just buy the new stuff.  I’m was always intending to wait until my hair grew back a bit, so waiting for it to come over will do just that.
I made the orange chicken.  I know I preach not changing the recipe the first time, but I had to.  I couldn’t get four fruit marmalade, so I had to use three fruit marmalade.  I didn’t have light soy sauce, so I used dark.  And I used more than one clove of garlic, but I always use more garlic so that was to be expected.  Here’s the result:

I was gorgeous.  Absolutely loved it.  I might try making it in the future with the light soy sauce, but it’s not likely because I don’t think anything needs to be changed.  First time in a while with a new recipe I’ve thought that.

Not that long ago, I was watching Mad Men with a can of lager, my feet in a foot spa, incense burning and a cigarette.  Bliss.
I’m trying a new recipe tomorrow.  Slow cook orange chicken.  I’m looking forward to it.
Incidentally, a friend on FB let me know about Copy Me That.  It’s a great recipe book thing.  There’s am app and a browser button.  When you see a recipe you want, you press the browser button and it saves it.  You can then access it on the app.  For example, I saved the new recipe on my laptop, used the app on my phone when shopping today and I’ll use the app on the tablet tomorrow when cooking.  It’s also got a shopping list and meal planner function, but I’m not gonna use them.
I’ve been a good boy and not bought any books recently.  I have, however, bought myself an inordinate amount of t shirts since this whole thing started.  There’s the No Close Encounters one I posted a pic of recently, one with a videotape, a 3.5″ floppy disc and a cassette tape, one with a picture of a nurse saying “Stay home, save the NHS”, a road crew one, an OMD one and a Folk on Foot Front Room Festival one.
And that’s just the ones that have arrived.  I’ve still to get my Red Shed one, my Aberdeen home strip (in fairness, this cost nowt), my Dropkick Murphy’s one, my two Frank Turner ones and my new Cove Rangers home strip which I still actually have to pay for.
And I’ll probably get more.
In my defence, the NHS one, the Roadie one, the Folk on foot one and the Red Shed one is raising money for charity.  So, there’s that.
I’m planning to cut my hair tomorrow.  I’m also hoping the weather holds so I can go for a walk.
I’m not going to talk about the situation in the states.  There’s more important stories to be told and voices to be heard.  I will say there is an air of inevitability about the whole thing.  Not if, but when the whole thing would kick off.
I’m also going to reiterate my standing offer: if there’s something you want to get off your chest and you don’t want to write in as an entry, leave me a private note.  Advice if wanted, a friendly ear always.

I was just messing about when I took that pic, but there’s something about it that I really like.
I made this spicy sausage pasta recipe today.  I wanted to make something new, I wanted to make it with pasta so I literally googled pasta recipes and found this one.  I know I’m a stickler for sticking strictly to the recipe the first time I make something, but I used sausage meat instead of sausages.  It’s the same thing, just without having to arse about removing the skin so, hey.  This is how it turned out:

I’ll definitely make it again (and I’ve remembered to bookmark the recipe this time), but I will be making some changes.  It needs more veg (not sure if mushrooms, onions or both) and I’m going to try different sauces because the one I used was a bit too spicy.
I watched the Dropkick Murphys live stream from Fenway last night.  I swear, Bruce Springsteen must have an ageing portrait in his attic.  It’s the only possible explanation for how he looks that good at 70.
I’m watching the Mad Men episode where Roger takes LSD.  I love this episode, it’s hilarious.
I gave in and got myself the foot spa.  It’s awesome.  And it makes my feet not hurt so, y’know, that’s cool too.

174,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/cummings-not-going-5846537/,2020-05-28,Cummings not going,"
This is the political entry I forewarned you about.  Now, there’s a lot I could write about concerning the UK response to Covid-19.  A lot.  Our Government haven’t exactly covered themselves in glory.
But I’m going to write about what kicked off at the weekend.  It revolves round a bloke called Dominic Cummings.
Now, I know that most of you will not have heard of Cummings.  So, here it is: he is a special advisor (or Spad) to the Government,  He’s the most powerful Spad as he is the Spad to Boris Johnson himself.  He was instrumental in the Leave campaign in the EU referendum, part of Johnsons leadership campaign and part of the Tory election campaign in December.
He considers himself a superforcaster, has written about wanting to destroy the current political system aqnd rebuild it in his image, seem a Chancellor quit and ran an advert looking for weirdos to work for the Government.  Weirdo was the precise word he used.
On the day it was revealed that the PM had Covid-19, he was seen running from Downing Street.  It was later revealed by his wife that Cummings was nearly hospitalised.
Now, at the time the governments advice was stay home.  Literally, the full thing was “Stay home, protect the NHS, save lives”.  This particularly applied if you had symptoms and it actually specified not to go to a second home if you have one whether you had symptoms or not.
On Friday night, The Guardian and The Mirror broke the story that when cummings was supposedly seriously ill with Covid-19, he, his wife, and their 4 year old son drove from London to Durham (a 260 mile journey) to stay with his parents.  The reason given for this? They needed childcare if they were unable to look after their son.
This pissed a lot of people off.  There are a lot of parents who were in the same situation who decided to stay home because that’s what the government said to do.  There are a lot of people who were unable to visit dying relatives, whatever they were dying of, because they were following the Governments advice.  There are a lot of people who could only watch the funeral of a loved one on a live stream because they followed the Government advice.  And here was the top Spad to the Government, one of the people who crafted the advice, ignoring it.
This led to a moment out of The Thick of It where a Government minister stood on a podium at the official daily briefing pleading with the press to please ask a question about the A66 being turned into a dual carriageway.
This would not be the last Thick of It moment.
Saturday night saw fresh revelations.  Not only had Cummings and his family journeyed to Durham, he had been spotted in a forrest.  In addition, at a time when they were supposed to have been isloating, it turns out they took a trip to the village of Barnards Castle and made a couple of stops.
The next day, Johnson himself did the daily briefing, something he had studiously avoided doing as much as possible.  At the beginning, he said that he had talked to Cum,mings, accepted his explanation and said that Cummings had simply used his judgement.
If this was supposed to put out the fire, it appears no-one noticed that the water had been replaced by petrol.  Because it came across that the PM was saying that all of the parents in that situation who did follow the Government advice that they are either stupid or de3ficient in parenting skills.
On Monday, with this still being the big topic of discussion, Cummings announced that he himself would be holding a press conference.  This is highly unusual.
After leaving everyone waiting for half an hour, Cummings came out.  What came next is not a The Thick of It moment.  It’s an entire special.  Here’s the story, as told by Dominic Cummings:
On the day that it was revealed that Johnson had Covid-19, Cummings got a call from his wife saying she was ill and thought it was Covid-19.  He then left immediately to be with her (this is the pic of him running).  When he got home, they realised she didn’t have Covid and she didn’t want him to stick around he went baqck to work.
At some point, he pondered what would happen if both of them got seriously ill.  Who would look after their son?  He talked about it with his wife and they decided they didn’t want to risk nyone in London getting Covid, so they would head to Durham where Cummings sister and nieces (it was previously his parents) could do so.  While in Durham, they lived in a cottage seperate from his parents and his sister and her famly.  He didn’t meet them, talking to them outdoors.
Him in the forrest was fine because the forrest in question is owned by his father.
While there, his son needed to be admitted to hospital.  As he and his wife were too ill to drive, they called an ambulance.  The next day, feeling better, Cumming drove to pick up his son.
And the trip to Barnard Castle?  This one is a doozy.
Having decided he should get back to work, Cummings was worried about driving back to London as he waqs having issues with his sight.  So, he bundled his wife and son into the car to go for an hour round trip drive to make sure it was safe.  After getting there with no issues, he talked about it with his wife, they decided to go back to London the next day.  On their way back to Durham, Cummings felt ill so they stopped and sat by the river for 15 minutes.  Further in the journey, his son needed the toilet so they stopped again for that and a bit of a play.
They drove back to London the next day.
Oh, and when asked, Cummings stated he had no regrets.
Yeah.
Johnson, again, did the daily briefing, during which he said his sight had been so badly affected by Covid.  It’s worth noting that sight problems is not a recognised symptom of Covid.
Police forces started tweeting that you should not, under any circumstances, drive if you have impared vision.
As an attempt to clear things up, it utterly failed.  the main thing to come from it was a new beer by Brewdog called “Barnard Castle Eye Test”.
The story isn’t going anywhere.  Enter Michael Gove.  Not content with saying he drove to test his eyes, he then gave us another Thick of It moment when, having been asked about a Bishop who called for Cummings to be sacked, he replied “I wish the Bishop well”.
Seriously.
Oh, and Durham Police have said just today that the trip to Durham waqs fine, but the trip to Barnard Castle might be against the law (for legal reasons here, might = was).  Guess which part Johnson is focussing on?
The Government are going full court press on Cummings being in the right and no-one can understand why.  Why waste all this policital capital, all this goodwill and trust, right when it’s needed to fight Covid, on a Spad?  A minister you could understand, but an advisor?

My books arrived:

Don’t they look fucking awesome?
My copy of The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, the Hunger Games prequel, arrived as well.  And, yes, I did buy myself a new book.  Or rather pre-order.  Stephen Fry has finally finished Troy, the  third in his Greek mythology trilogy.  So I ordered it.  Signed, of course.
My lava lamp gave up the ghost.  I thought it was just the bulb, but the whole thing died.  Naturally, I got a new one:

I’ll probably be writing another political entry in the next day or two, covering what’s been happening over here since Friday.  Shit’s gone crazy.  A teaser: it involves the strangest eye test ever.
I went for another walk on Sunday.  Down one side of the Tees, across the Tees Barrage (which I didn’t know was so close to the flat) and back up the other side.  That’s what the pics in my last entry largely are.  When I was at the Barrage, a young boy approached me and simply said “Hello mate”.  Which made both me and his mum laugh.
I am going to keep up the walking, bit I might need to get a foot spa, or at least a tub to soak my feet in cos they’re aching.
My hope is that when I can swim again I won’t have lost too much stamina.  Though I’ll likely keep up the walking as well.

Full pic:

Would it surprise you to learn that I did buy those books?  And would it surprise you to further learn that I immediately went to the Waterstones website to buy The Odyssey in the clothbound classic range so I could have that and The Iliad from the same collection because I’m a sad collectionist like that?
If so, you must be new to me.  Welcome to my diary!
So, not sure if you guys know, but I take part in a postcard exchange thing on Facebook.  As such, I have a decent postcard collection, most of which is all over the flat.  I finally caved and got something to display them:

I went for another walk this time.  A much longer one than last week.  Here’s some pics:
                   
The dinosaurs in the pics are from Teesaurus Park.  It’s a hidden gem in Middlesbrough which shouldn’t be hidden because it is fucking awesome.  It used to be unkempt, it was almost sold off.  It should be celebrated.
At the moment, I’m watching Mad Men.  Yes, it’s a rewatch, but it’s leaving Netflix soon.
I’ll leave this now.

My stempunk mask arrived yesterday.  Cool, isn’t it?  The ear defenders make all my masks easier to wear.
I’ve been on a book buying binge since this all went down.  So far, I’ve bought Beneath the Streets (an alternate history book where Jeremy Thorpe was successful in having Norman Scott killed), Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, Frankenstein, Animal Farm, The Woman in White, The Hound of the Baskervilles, two instant pot cookbooks and I’ll be getting the Hunger Games prequal next week.
And I’ve just discovered that Pengiun are having a sale where I can buy clothbound versions of The Iliad, Paradise Lost and Oliver Twist for £33.  So, if anyone can think of a good, non monetary reason why I shoudn’t buy them, let me know.
Oh, and because they’ve already solod out of The Odyssey as part of that promotion, I’ll have to get that elsewhere as well.
I need to get in touch with the Sci-Fi Weekender.  I got an email saying that the accommodation I had booked for this years event, which I thought would be rolled over to the one in March next year has been rolled over to November next year instead.  So, I need to get that clairified so I can sort accommodation for the other one.
I’ve signed up for online first aid courses.  It’s a free thing.  My advisor from Working Links thought I should sign up for the anxiety one, despite not having anxiety.  Which, of course, made me anxious about if I have anxiety or not.  But I noticed the first aid ones and plumped for them instead.

I finally got round to getting myself a couple of face masks:
 
The purple one is a bit small.  I’ve just bought myself a steampunk mask which comes with an ear protector, so hopefully that’ll make a difference.
I went for a long walk today.  Decided I should do something to replace swimming.  I listened to one episode of Mystery Hour and when that was finished, I turned round and listened to another one on the way home.  Of course I took pics:
              
Next time, I’m going the other direction.
Beyond that, not much has happened.  Didn’t get one of the things I submitted to, still waiting to hear from the BBC.  Been watching TV.
My instant pot cookbook came the other day.  Still not tried anything from it.

I dunno.  You wait ages for one entry and then two come along at once.
It’s almost 8am.  I’m suddenly reminded that there is an 8am on a Sunday morning.  I woke up at 6 and could not get back to sleep.  So, here I am.
This is what my title is referring to:

I saw it on Qwertees and could not resist.
Forgot to mention yesterday, but I got the platform for my washing machine:

The bucket is for draining the water into.  It’s made a huge difference.  Plus, it raises it to a level where I no longer have to bend down to load and unload it.  Which is a nice bonus.
Last night, the Doctor Who fanzine I write for had a meetup on Zoom.  It was good fun.  There may have been hats involved.  There’s talk about making it a regular thing, which I’d definitely be up for.
I think I mentioned before about a writing thing I’m entering.  Well, tomorrow is the submission deadline, so I thought I’d get round to editing the story I was going to submit as my writing sample.  The sample has to be no more than 7 pages.  The story is 24.
Ooops.
Thankfully, I have another story I can use, so I edited that instead.  Not that either story needed much in the way of editing.  All I have to do now is write the synopsis.
I did submit the other story to a BBC thing.  So, fingers crossed for that.
Now, shower, dishes and get writing.

Bit of excitement outside the flat today.  Looked out the window and a huge chunk of the street was cordoned off with police tape.  According to the local paper, someone was attacked with a bladed weapon at 9:30 this morning.  By the time I got back from town, the cordon was gone.
Frank Turner released a live album yesterday.  It was not only recorded on the tour I went to see him on in November, it was the actual gig I was at.  Of course I bought it and listening to it (have done twice so far) and it really does bring back great memories.
Plus, it means that the individual songs are on YouTube.  which means I can share this one.  This specific version of this specific song was the most spiritual moment I had last year:

Apart from that, not much is happening really.  I used my instant pot to make spaghetti bolognaise the other day.  Not bad, but still tastes better cooked in the slow cooker.  I’ve also bought an instant pot cookbook, so just waiting for that to come through.
My new steampunk jacket arrived and I’ve had to return it.  Simply because it turns out the large would not fit over my stomach.  So, I’m getting a XXL instead.
My nephew and niece have taken up climbing the trees in their garden.  Which my brother can’t really give them into trouble for, because when he was their age he was constantly climbing trees as well.  Which mum wasn’t bothered by, no matter how much one neighbour told her about it.
I’m currently watching Bustival, a live streaming festival to help Vans for Bands, who are donating their tour busses to the NHS for staff to use.  Great music.
I’ll leave things there.  Stay safe and no injecting Domestos, no matter what anyone says.

So, I need to explain the picture.  There was a letter sent to every household in the UK from the office of the Prime Minister, asking us to stick to the lock down.  The font used on the front of the envelope is that same as the font used in Cards Against Humanity.  And, well, we do what we do best.  Take the mick.
I took the washing machine for a spin on Wednesday.  It’s absolutely silent.  Seriously, the loudest thing about it is the timer ticking.
Now, I had a plan.  Draining the machine requires gravity.  So, I decided the best thing to do was to just put it on the floor and lift it onto the draining board when it needs emptying.  Completely forgetting that, while the empty machine may well be quite light, fill it with about 18 litres of water and wet clothes and that is no longer the case.
I then formed another plan.  Prop it up on two chairs.  Problem then was that the chairs were not the same height.
I’ve since ordered a decorating platform (not excessively tall) and I’ll put it on there.
I also learned yesterday that I can only really wash one hoodie at a time, or it’ll take far too long.
Yesterday and today I’ve been watching a sci-fi film marathon.  At the moment it’s 20 Million Miles to Earth.  One of the films yesterday was the title of this entry.  A strange watch for me, I’m used to the MST3K version.
My refund for the train tickets has been processed.  Now Paypal are teasing me by showing me the refund in my account activity but not actually processing it through to my account.
I did something yesterday.  See if you can spot what’s different about me from the norm in these two pictures:
 
It would be green, but I’m not sure if it’s safe to use hair dye that’s been sitting unmixed for 5 years.

So, my washing machine arrived today.  Here it is:

It’s fecking huge!  Also, not light!
Now, due to my dads work, I’ve stayed in a few caravans and I can comfortably say I have never stayed in one where you could store this easily.  I think it’s more for the likes on me who doesn’t have room for a proper machine.
I haven’t used it yet, but I’m going to have to put it on the draining board when I do.  In theory, it shouldn’t drain unless I set it to, but I’ll check that (the draining uses gravity to work).
My refund from LNER has also processed.  I’m just waiting on it clearing through to PayPal.  Will I be sensible with the money?  Will I buy a decent steampunk jacket?  Who knows?
It’ll likely be the latter, to be honest.
Also, they’ve announced what’s happening with this years Sci-Fi Weekender.  It’s not happening.  Instead, they’re having a giant combined Weekender XI and XII in March next year.  And my booking is rolling over to that.  With me having a ticket and VIP pass booked for that one already, that’s rolling over to Weekender XIII in November next year.
This makes me happy.

Last night, Boris Johnson was admitted to hospital.  His symptoms of Covid-19 hadn’t gone away in 11 days and they wanted to run routine tests.
At 7pm this evening, Johnson was admitted to intensive care.  He is, apparently, conscious and it’s a precaution in case he needs to go on a ventilator.
Before I get into the politics of this, a quick personal word.  As long time readers will know, I’m not, by any stretch of the imagination, a fan of my PM.  However, I wanted him out of office through losing an election or a vote of no confidence from the Tories.  I, of course, hope that he doesn’t need to be put on a ventilator and makes a full recovery.
With that said, this is a problem.  We don’t have a deputy Prime Minister.  Nor do we have a clear line of succession.  The law is that the leader of the biggest party in the Commons is invited by the Queen to be Prime Minister.  That’s it.
So, if Johnson does die, or if he recovers but not well enough to resume being PM, who the fuck knows what will happen.
For now, Dominic Rabb, as the designated person to do so, is the interim PM.  Is this good news?  Well, as Brexit Secretary he announced his amazement to find out that Dover was important for importing and exporting goods.  You work it out.

The steampunk is growing:

Theme of the week: What do you miss from the time before social distancing?
Swimming. Which is odd, considering that eight months ago the only exercise I got was walking somewhere. But I genuinely have missed going to the pool these past two weeks. Oh, and not getting excited because I actually found a bag of rice in the supermarket.
One thing I’m not missing is how crowded shops were before.
I got myself a set of hair clippers today. I was planning on buying a pair at some point, but when I saw a pair in a supermarket for £15 today, I decided why not? And, of course I used them as soon as I got home:

And, no, I won’t smile.
I’m watching Home Before Dark at the moment. It’s good. I’ve also got bolognaise on the go. Not sure yet if having with rice or spaghetti.
The Government has admitted that they are considering stopping people going out for exercise, which is pretty much what I was expecting to happen.

I need to dig out my old laptop. One of the bands I went to see on my birthday put out a live EP and it’s only available on CD. And I don’t have an optical drive on this laptop.
The sleeve is the entry pic. It’s delightfully home made. It’s two pieces of brown paper, sellotaped on three sides with the fourth held closed using a dod of blu tack.
I have been able to listen to it, using my DVD player. It’s good.
I’ve just bought myself a portable washing machine. It’s something I’ve been threatening to do for a while, but I had to actually do it. I’ve no room in the flat for a washing machine and the launderette is closed at the moment. And, though I can hand wash, I’d prefer not to.
Beyond that, not been doing much. Watching the weekly Frank Turner live stream. Rewatching Leverage. Getting into Motherland: Fort Salem.
Right now, I’m waiting for the Grand National to start. The actual race has been cancelled, but for the last few years they’ve also done a virtual race as well. So, they’re just doing that instead. I’ve put a couple of each way bets on (online, all the bookies shops are closed) and all profit is going to be donated to the NHS.

So, we’re just over a week into lockdown.  How’s it going?
Well…
So far the police have had to break up a public barbecue, deal with a 25 person coronavirus party, a footballer went round a mates house, got drunk and drove drunk and a triathlete decided to go for a 200 mile, 9 hour bike ride.
Yeah, we’re coping well.
A lot of people can’t seem to understand what the word essential in essential travel actually means.  Now, I’ve had enough arguments with drivers on Reddit to know full well that they think driving is a right, not a privilege (the highlight being the one who said it’s perfectly fine for drivers to not only let their attention wander, but to do so while approaching traffic lights), but, fuck me, it’s becoming more and more obvious.
Take for example, the driver who tried to argue with the police that it was essential that he drive to his weed dealers house.
Here’s an even better one.  At the weekend, a man posted a pic on Twitter of the social distancing birthday party he and his wife had for his dad.  When it was pointed out that’s not an essential journey, he said it was OK because he was dropping off supplies at the same time and that made it essential.
Then man and his wife drove 300 miles in total.  Dropping off supplies is only essential at that distance if there is absolutely no-one else who can help.  Which might have been the case, except for one thing.
The man in question is Stephen Kinnock, Labour MP for Aberavon.  His father is Baron Kinnock of Bedwelty, former leader of the Labour Party and former EU Commissioner.  In the off chance that Baron and Baroness Kinnock know nobody who could help, a quick email to their constituency Labour party “Hi, can someone drop off supplies to my parents?”  Pretty sure they’d find someone willing to help.
And the amount of people defending Kinnock the younger is astounding.  Absolutely astounding.
There’s also the folk who absolutely have to drive to a park or beauty spot so they can have a walk.
The absolute worst I’ve seen is a guy who is driving, with his girlfriend and her brother, a 200 mile round trip to get a dog.
The government are going to clamp down.  They’re going to say exactly what constitutes an essential car journey.  And these same people will moan about the cunts who caused the government to clamp down even further.
And they’ll not realise, nor be happy to be informed, that they are those cunts.

I phoned my mum on Sunday to wish her happy Mothers Day.  She was very proud of the fact that she didn’t open her present from me despite having picked it up on the Wednesday.
She also said that she felt guilty.  When she was shopping, she got herself two bags of what she thought was 500g of rice.  When she got it home, she realised it was 1kg bags.  So she felt guilty about getting more than she needed.
Monday, finally got the email confirming that the Sci-Fi Weekender has been postponed and they’re not sure yet where/when it’ll go ahead.  So, I emailed to get a refund on my train tickets.  Normally, I’d be SOL with the type of ticket I had, but, of course, this is not normal times so I will be.
I also emailed my advisor from Working Links to confirm they are not doing face to face meetings and my appointment was cancelled.
Tuesday, I found out I won tickets to next years Sci-Fi Weekender, which I booked today.
Today, I went into town to put money in the bank and get some shopping.  It was freaky.  Very few people were out, most of the shops were shut.  Those that were open were limiting the amount of people allowed in, with an actual queue at the supermarket to get in.  It was surreal.  People keeping their distance.
I also felt guilty if I went into somewhere and ended up not buying something.  Most shops are asking people to pay by card rather than cash.  I just hope the banking systems are robust enough to cope, really.
I’ll leave you with a Covid-19 funny:

The Government has been very clear.  For the past week, minimum, they’ve been saying keep your distance, do not go out unless there is absolute need to.
However, as Agent K once said, people are dumb.  Such as flocking to public places en mass at the weekend.
So today, instead of the daily press briefing, Boris Johnson put out a pre-recorded message.
As of tonight, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is on lockdown.
What does this mean?  No gatherings of more than two people, with the exception of funerals and where the group is people who live in the same house.  Any shop not selling essential goods is closed.
And we are only allowed to leave the house under certain conditions.  Those are:

Shopping for essential supplies
If there is a medical need
For one period a day of exercise
To go to and from work if it is not possible for you to work from home.

Now, there are some bemoaning our loss of liberty.  But, you know what?  We fucking deserve it.  If idiots aren’t able to follow simple instructions, we all need to be ordered to follow them.  It’s that simple.  In fact, I should have been writing this entry a week ago.
What does this mean for me personally?  Not much.  The only reason I had to leave the house which wasn’t shopping was to sign on or for my appointments for Working Links and they’ve both been cancelled.  I don’t even need to go far to pick up my meds, as the chemist is right across the street.

Monday, I had to sign on. For obvious reasons, they were rushing people through as quickly as possible. When I go to sign on, they give me a card with the name of my work coach on it. They did so on Monday, before realising they shouldn’t be doing that at the moment.
It won’t be long before I don’t have to go in at all. Guarantee it. While they are trying to get people to self isolate and social distance, it’s stupid. I’m kind of surprised they haven’t banned it yet, to be honest.
Tuesday was the Frank Turner livestream on Facebook. Which meant I actually got to hear the support acts. Jess Guise has a beautiful voice and Micah Schnabel is a good singer and his songs are great.
Then, Frank. He very quickly said that, as there were more people in the audience (3) than there were on stage (1) it counted as gig 2473. He kept shouting out his road family and urging people to donate towards helping them out and introduced us to his cat. The set was good, but cut short. Facebook cut it because they thought it was spam. The line he was going to sing before the feed cut?
“Because we’re not dead yet.”
But still, it was fun and it was great to be able to smoke whenever I wanted rather than having to fight my way outside. Besides, as someone pointed out on Twitter, getting your house show busted by the police is incredibly punk.
Now, I had a plan. I decided I would go swimming today then see about getting my tattoo updated, so I would be forced to stay out of the pool for a month. Then I got a text from the gym on Friday saying that they’d be closing for a month as of 6pm tomorrow. So, I was going to go swimming today and tomorrow and see about getting the new ink after that.
Then the PM said yesterday that all bars, clubs, restaurants, cafes, gyms, leisure centres, theatres and cinemas had to shut as of last night. So, the swimming is out. (My membership has been suspended and the days I’ve got left this month will be used when they reopen.) I’m just glad my last swim went well, I’d hate for a frustrating experience to be my last.
Today I went into town, got a few bits and pieces. Came the closest I’ve ever come to panic buying when a shop had only one of something I needed, I didn’t think (correctly) that anywhere else would have it so just got it rather than going back and hoping it was still there.
I picked up book 4 and 5 in the Hitchhikers Guide trilogy and got some hand sanitiser. It cost me £4 for 50ml, but there’s a phrase involving beggers and choosers that springs to mind.
I went to the tattoo studio to see about booking my tat and they could fit me in in about an hour. Came home, dropped off my shopping and went back. The guy was good and here’s the result:

Yes, the number in blue is Tuesdays gig. I watched it live, so it counts. The artist put a plaster on it, rather than using clingfilm, so that can stay on until Wednesday. (also explains why it’s not clean. The blood is normal, don’t freak out about it.)
I had to phone a cinema to get a refund for a booking to see Monty Python and the Holy Grail next month. I’m still waiting for the inevitable confirmation that the Sci-Fi Weekender is at least postponed so I can cancel my train booking (though I won’t get a refund, just credit for the train company) and possibly get my money back from that.
Don’t need to go out tomorrow, so today is rewatching Leverage, the stream of Frank Turner show 2000 and The Invisible Man (which I didn’t get to see in the cinema, despite wanting to) and tomorrow is catching up on wrestling and phoning my mum to wish her happy Mothers Day.
I leave you with Something Beautiful:

So, here’s my Covid-19 entry.
Am I self isolating?  Well, no.  Best of my knowledge, I’m not in an at risk group and I don’t have any symptoms.  I do have a cough.  But it’s a smokers cough and I’ve had it for years.  We’ve only been told to self isolate for a new persistent cough.
Am I social distancing?  Yes.  But it’s not hard for me, really.  During the week, I never go out unless I have to.  The main thing at the weekend is swimming.  I’m definitely going on Saturday, but I’m planning to see about getting my Frank Turner tattoo updated on Sunday so I can’t go swimming again for about a month.
Beyond that, it’ll just be into town to pick up essentials and get food for the week.  I would order online and get delivered, but no-one has delivery times for about a month.
About the only thing that will change will be no going to the pub on a Saturday night and not going to the jazz afternoon.  But I’ve plenty of TV to catch up on.
I also find humour in the fact that we’re all being asked to come together to defeat this by staying away from each other.

Further to what I said about my mum in my last entry:
My sister messaged me today to apologise for not being able to pick up mums Mothers Day gift.  She also said that mum, in her 70’s and having had a triple heart bypass, refuses to believe she’s vulnerable to Covid-19.  My reply?
“Of course mum doesn’t think she’s vulnerable, when does she ever?”
She’s always been like this about her health.  Always.
Example.  When she told me about needing the heart op, she made it seem like she had mentioned to the doctor having chest pains and he had an ambulance take her to hospital in an abundance of caution.
My dad told me the truth.  She had massive chest pains during a doctors appointment and was rushed to hospital.
The thing that annoyed her most though?  Wasn’t the thought of having open heart surgery.  It was needing to go back to the doctors to pick up the car.
So of course she doesn’t think she is vulnerable.  I would be more shocked if she did.
My mother, ladies and germs.  I love her, but she can be fucking frustrating.

So, Tuesday was the Frank Turner gig.  As The Empire doesn’t have draught lager, I went to one of the local craft pubs before the gig.  There, a couple asked if anyone knew where The Empire is, so I said I was going to the gig and would be their tour guide.  Nice couple.  They were up from Sheffield for the gig.  They also had pot, so I got stoned for the first time in over a decade.
The support acts were Jess Guise (AKA Mrs Turner) and Micah Schnabel.  I can’t tell you what they were like because of the amount of fucking twats talking through them.  I absolutely hate that.  I bought a tour t shirt, a sticker (which I bought to put on my laptop, but it’s too big) and a t shirt by Jean Speckman.
Then it came to the Frank set and it was great.  It was mostly older stuff that I haven’t heard live in person, so I was very happy.  Afterwards, my two new friends were wanting to wait for Frank, so I did to.  He chatted for ages and was happy to sign autographs and stand for pictures.  Which is when I got the pic at the top, which I’m reposting here because OD is doing the cropping thing:

My new friends disappeared (hope they got back to the hotel OK) so I went to the pub and then home.
(If you want to hear Frank live, and I recommend you do, him, Jess and Micah are live streaming a gig on his FB page tomorrow [8:30pm GMT, 4:30pm on the East Coast, 1:30pm on the West Coast and 7:30am in Australia] to make up for cancelling the tour.)
Friday, I had to go get my phone sorted because it wouldn’t let me make calls.  Which was annoying.
Saturday, I went to a creative writing workshop for a mentorship thing the organisers are running.  I really want to enter, but the people chosen have to pay £100.  I’ll probably just enter then burn that bridge when I come to it.
I picked up my order for the first three books in the Hitchhikers Guide trilogy, then went for a swim.  I was supposed to be going to a screening of The Room, but the organiser has a bad cold, so it was postponed.  So I stayed home and watched Scott Pilgrim again.  (Hence the title.)
Sunday I didn’t go for a swim because I got up too late.
Today I had to sign on and they were rushing people through for obvious reasons.
Ahhh, yes, Covid-19.
I won’t talk about our PM’s press conference today, because it’ll turn into a rant about how he’s fucking over pubs, clubs and restaurants.
So, how’s it affecting me?
Well, the problem with having an illness that the doctor can’t diagnose is that I have not the slightest fucking idea whether or not I have a compromised immune system.  I’m waiting for the inevitable email from the organisers of the Sci-Fi Weekend to say it’s cancelled.
Thankfully, they’re not forcing over 70’s to self isolate.  Because I know my parents.  My mum will be driven crazy being cooped up in the house all day and my dad would be driven crazy by mum.
And, it turns out, my sister is self isolating.  Which sucks (especially knowing my nephew).  It also kind of screws me as well.
You see, I had a plan.  I ordered my mums Mothers Day present to be delivered to the Waterstones in Aberdeen.  My sister, or my brother in law, would then go and pick it up and give it to mum on Sunday.  Course, that’s not happening now, so my mum is going to pick up her mothers Day pressie.

Forgot to talk about this, but yesterday was the 42nd anniversary of the first episode of The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy going out on radio. (There is a particular reason why this random seeming anniversary is worth celebrating.)
I’m a huge H2G2 fan. Huge. I remember the first time I read the book. I was blown away by how funny it was and just how good Adams wordplay was. I’ve read all five books in the trilogy, watched the TV series, got out of work early to go see the film and got strange looks listening to the radio series in my phone in public (with headphones, naturally.)
I love the characters.  Arthur Dent, being flung around space and time in his pajamas and dressing gown, wanting nothing more than a good cup of tea.  Ford Prefect who isn’t from Guilford but a small planet somewhere in the vicinity of Betelegeuse.  Trillion, who with her two degrees decided running off with an alien was better than going down the job centre.  Zaphod Beeblebrox, the two headed, three armed alien who is both uniquely unsuited and uniquely suited to being President of the Galaxy (he’s just this guy, you know).  And, of course, Marvin.  The paranoid android with a terrible pain in all the diodes on his left side.
If you haven’t been introduced to it and you have a love of strange British humour, I highly recommend it.
Happy anniversary to Hitchhikers guide and RIP Douglas Noel Adams. He was a hoopy frood who really knew where his towel was.
I’m off to Milliways.

Confetti pic because this is a proper entry and not a photo dump!
A long while ago, I mentioned in here having a slow cooker recipe for venison sausage cassolet, but I couldn’t find anywhere that sold the sausages.  Well, I’ve found somewhere so I made it today.  It looks like this:

The recipe said to serve with mashed tatties, but I went with rice instead.  It’s really nice, but an occasional meal cos the sausages are expensive.
Yesterday was the Elvana gig.  Now, the voucher I had said to go to the box office to swap it for a ticket.  But, when I did so, I was told that the voucher was my ticket.  The venue is near my gym, so it’s not like I went massively out of my way.  But still.
The first thing to note is that the venue doesn’t sell lager on draft.  They do, however, have draft cocktails.  I wish I was fucking kidding.  And it was £4 for a can of Carling, which is one of the worst lagers on Earth.  I eventually settled on drinking bottles.
The first band on stage was Love the Sinner (how great a name is that?).  They were brilliant.  The second band was Hands Off Gretel.  They also rocked.
Between bands I went for a smoke and got myself another drink.  When at the bar after Hands Off Gretel, there was a girl beside me who was drunk.  I know this, because she told me she was mortal.  She was draped all over me, kissed me on the cheek and gave me a peck on the lips.  Later, she stood beside me and was holding my hand.
Nothing would have happened (she was too drunk), but it’s nice to get some attention from a woman that’s actually wanted.
Even if she was completely pissed.
Then it was time for Elvana.  For those who don’t know, they are a Nirvana tribute band with an Elvis impersonator on vocals.  It sounds like it should never, ever work but it actually does.  Most of the set was Nirvana songs, but there was a fair amount of Elvis in there.  Most impressive to me was when they went from A Little Less Conversation straight into Smells Like Teen Spirit.  In case you’re wondering, it sounds a little like this:

There was confetti cannons, giant inflatable balls bouncing around the audience and an Elvis led circle pit.  It was wild and crazy and brilliant.
I bought myself an Elvana hoodie and a couple of Hands Off Gretel stickers then went for an actual pint.#

I’m taking part in a book exchange through Reddit again.  These are the first two books I’ve been sent by the person who got me.  I’ve heard of Educated (I think it was through @sleepygene), so I’m looking forward to that one.  The other one I haven’t heard of, but it looks good.
Forgot to mention before, but one of the things that happened as a result of my issues with the job centre is I’ve got back in touch with the person from Working Links.  She’s still on at me about doing the Functional Skills in English, though I think I’ve talked her down from that.  She’s also wanting me to do neuro linguistic programming.  I looked it up and it’s basically pseudoscience.  But, I’ll likely agree to it as she needs a win with me.
I’m busy over the next week or so.  Saturday, I’m going to see The Invisible Man then to a gig.  A band called Elvana.  A Nirvana tribute act with an Elvis impersonator on lead vocals.  Tuesday is the Frank Turner gig.  A week on Saturday, I’ve got a taster session for a creative writing thing I’m thinking of entering.  Then I have my wife to murder, and Guilder to frame for it.  I’m swamped.
Anyway.  My food is here and I’m watching Noughts and Crosses, so I’ll leave this here.

I went to the gym that I had the free session.  I won’t be going again.  I mean, the pool is fine (and I was actually able to swim complete lengths without giving up) but otherwise, it’s not the nicest of places.  They have a sign up asking people not to shave in the sauna.  Another one reminding people to put their razorblades in the bin once they have shaved.  The shower cubicle had an empty tube of toothpaste in it.
Yeah.
When they phone (and it will be when), I’ll just say that I’ve gone with my regular gym as it’s closer and easier to get to (which has the advantage of being true).
Went into town for shopping.  While there, I saw a pop up market, so had a look.  And bought the badge in to pic.  It’s awesome.
Now I’m going to make sweet and sour chicken stir fry while I wait for the Aberdeen game to start.

Just had another of my epic sneezing fits.  I may have a cold.
I had a successful foraging trip on Saturday.  I got the stuff for my broth and I discovered the supermarket had Sweet Baby Ray’s BBQ sauce.  Which is ideal for making my very complicated slow cooked BBQ ribs.  I thusly bought a rack of ribs.
Sunday, got up early, threw the stuff for the broth in the instant pot and set it on slow cook.  An hour later, I set the ribs going in the slow cooker.  I went for a swim then continued watching High Fidelity (fantastic show, by the way).  When the broth was done, I had a bowl and it was delicious.  When the ribs were done, I made some chips and beans to go with them:

They were delicious as well.
Today, I had the meeting at the job centre about my health.  It turns out they didn’t have a record of me even working at EE, never mind why I left.  I was also asked again about letting my work coach have a look at my email account, which I still said was absolutely not happening.
I also got a phone call.  I forgot that, when I found out that the council pool was shut, I emailed about a taster session as their pool is 25 meters.  So, I’m going out on Saturday.  No chance I’m joining though.
And now I’m watching Avenue 5.

My plan for today was to go swimming in the nearest council pool to check my progress.  Went to the website to check the times and they’re shut to the public this weekend for a gala.  Argh!  I mean, I suppose it’s good that I checked the website before I went, but still.
There are other pools I can go to, but none within walking distance and I can’t afford the bus fare at the moment.  Ah well, I’ll go next week instead.
The most annoying thing is the pool is beside a supermarket that I was planning to go to as it’s broth weather and I want to make some.  I’m going to the same supermarket just in a different location.  Just waiting for my phone to charge.  I’m also going to listen to the first episode of the McMillions podcast while heading out there.
I’m really enjoying my swimming.  I’m not going to say it’s relaxing, that’s not the point of me being there.  But, I’m usually tired when I leave and that is why I’m there.  I’ve noticed that my stamina is increasing as well.  I think my SWOLF score is coming down, but I haven’t checked that too religiously anyway.  It’s also good for clearing my head.

Wednesday, I went on a book pre-ordering spree.  I found out that Akala has a YA novel coming out this year, so I went ahead and pre-ordered it.  Then, I discovered that I could finally pre-order the new Steven Hall book, so I pre-ordered that.  Finally, it was announced that the new Cormoran Strike book is going to be released at the end of September, so I pre-ordered that as well.
Thursday, I booked my ticket home from the sci-fi con in April.  Not first class, sadly, but never mind.
Today, I booked my accommodation.  I emailed the organisers to ask if there was any on site accommodation available for one person and was told, due to a cancellation, there was for £200.  I took it.  It’s not a pod this time.  It’s a two berth caravan (though one of the beds is just the sofa folded down).  Score!  I had booked into a hotel, which was going to cost me £256 for the weekend.  Plus, I don’t have to worry about staggering back.  Plus my 2 day ticket automatically becomes a three day ticket.  Woot!
My title was going to be a reference to booking stuff.  So, why the change?
I’m currently watching The Last Leg and the be kind hashtag was brought up.  This was, of course, in reference to the death of Caroline Flack last weekend.  Then the presenter brought up the phrase here if you need.  He got it from playing netball in Australia.  It’s a way to let your team mates know you are open if they need to make a pass.  The presenter suggested it could be used as a catchphrase to let people know you are there for them at times when your mental health isn’t good.
So, here we are.  And it’s about time for my regular announcement of my standing order.  If you feel the need to ask for help, advice or even just rant and you don’t want to do so in an entry, leave a private note.  I’m here if you need.

Parasite is absolutely brilliant.  Then it was Club 30 – 80.  Which was a good night.
Yesterday was the jazz afternoon.  The first band were the Mark Williams Trio.  They play really long songs.  As in, they performed for about three quarters of an hour and played two songs.  Good stuff though.  They didn’t have CD’s to sell because they forgot them.
Next was Archipelago.  They also didn’t have any merchandise because two of the band were busy all week.  Their stuff is more experimental, but still enjoyable.
Last was the Arun Ghosh Band.  He apologised in advance if he talked to us like children because he spent all week working with schoolkids.  He also didn’t have any merchandise, just cos he didn’t.  They were very enjoyable.  At one point, the sax player from Archipelago joined them on stage to highlight the similarity between the sax and the clarinet.  At the end, Ghosh invited Archipelago on stage for a jam session (it’s my pic for this entry).  And it was absolutely glorious.
Today was signing on day.  Everything went well, until I was asked about what happened with the Amazon thing and I said I left as soon as I heard it was working in the warehouse and it wasn’t compatible with my health issues.
Now, here’s the thing.  I’ve never made any secret about my health problems nor the fact it limits the kind of work I can do.  Yet, somehow, the fact I do have health issues was a complete and utter surprise to my work coach and I think she thinks I’ve made it up.  So, I have to go back next week to review my claimant commitment.  Plus, she’s suddenly decided that the way I’ve been recording my job search, which she’s been fine with up to now, is no longer sufficient and, if I’m not going to let her poke through my email account, I have to print out emails I get confirming receipt of my job applications.
I think she’s lining me up for a sanction.

The permanent fix for the power issue I experienced has been put in place.  So, that should be that.
The job thing on Friday lasted about half an hour.  As soon as they mentioned it was picking and packing in a warehouse, I left.  There’s no way my health issues will allow me to do that.  Plus, transport there and back till be an issue, which I know from experience.
The swimming is still going well.  I’m seeing an improvement in my stamina.  Next week, i’m going back to the council pool to see how much better I am at 25 metres.  I also need to spray the anti-fog stuff on my goggles every week.
I’ve been on a bit of a book buying binge.  I got Unspeakable by John Bercow, A Keeper by Graham Norton, Before the Coffee Gets Cold by Toshikazu Kawaguchi and A Brief Guide to Native American Myths and Legends by Joe E Lewis.  I’m good with my Norse and Greek mythology, Roman myths are basically reskinned Greek and I’ve got a book about Celtic myths but not much knowledge about native American ones.  Looking forward to reading it.
Tonight, I’m away to watch Parasite then to a now night being started by a local pub.  Tomorrow is swimming and the jazz afternoon.

Got up at 6:30 because I needed the toilet, had power.
Went to get up at 7:30 as I couldn’t get back to sleep.  Said good morning to the Nest Mini which is supposed to switch on the light (I have smart bulbs in the bedroom, hall and living room).  No response.
Went into the living room, the standby light on the telly is out.  Kitchen?  No sound from the fridge and the boiler is out.
Crap.
Went downstairs to the shop I live above.  Sure enough, they have no power either.  Phone Northern Powergrid (as they be the bods in charge) and they tell me that they don’t know about an outage, but it could be that I’m the first to report an issue.  They’ll send a team but, because of the storm, it could take up to 5 hours.
Thankfully, my power returns at 9:15.  Northern Powergrid calls back about 10.  Was a more widespread thing (35 calls about 70 properties).
So, that was the start to my day.
Will
*EDIT* despite being told that once the power was back it’d be back permanently, it’s gone again.  The issue is affecting 120 properties and I could have no power until 3:30.
Thank Bob I bought my insanely large power bank.
Will
*SON OF EDIT* I got a text saying it may be as late as 7:45 before it was fixed.  10 minutes ago, 5 minutes later than the original estimate, the power is back.  Fingers crossed it sticks.
Oh, and I did get my meds today.

Got the proper shave I’ve been planning to get.  Definitely getting that again.  Proper shave with a cut throat razor, hot towel and even a shoulder rub.  Only down side was he used far too much smelly stuff.
The t shirt is the Charity Miles one I talked about before.  I highly recommend using the app, you can get more details here.
Shades are the ones I bought at the con.  Hat is new, just got it today.  Probably not going to wear it too often, but still cool.  More of the hat:
  
Forgot to mention yesterday, I’m going to a thing for a job at Amazon tomorrow.  As I’ve decided it’s probably a bad idea to wear my normal clothes, I got myself a shirt and a pair of dress trousers:

I chose that style of shirt so I don’t have to wear a tie (fucking hate wearing ties).
I didn’t get my meds today.  Turns out the prescription was sent to a different branch of the chemists and, of course, they’re shut today.  I’ll get them tomorrow.
I’ll finish here, need to go for a swim.

That’s my neon yellow shorts.  Before you ask, no I will not post a pic of me wearing them.  Trust me, it’s for the best.
I meant to go get my meds while in town today.  I just remembered about 5 minutes ago.  So, the numpty of the title would be me.  I’m not completely out of meds yet, but I’m getting there.  Hopefully, I can pick them up the morn.
I did, however, finally get myself a wok today.  I also got a mini whisk.  I’ve been after one of them for ages as well, for making chilli.
The third thing I bought today is a ticket for the jazz afternoon next Sunday.  I’m looking forward to it.
Swimming may not be doing a lot for the size of my stomach, but it’s doing wonders for my stamina.  I’m not getting out of breath anywhere near as easily as I was when I started.  So, there’s that.

So, I’m living in a bit of a time warp every night this week.  The BBC are repeating This Life between 10 and 12 as a tribute to the producer who died recently.  It’s excellent.  If you have Britbox, check if it’s on there and watch.  You won’t regret it.
I also just discovered that Bananaman is free on Amazon Prime.
As I’ve decided to swim twice a week, I bought myself a new pair of trunks.  They’re neon yellow.  They’re awesome.
The swimming is going well.  Just getting annoyed by people who don’t want to be there to swim.  It’s fucking annoying, particularly when the pool is busy.
I had to phone the doctor on Monday.  I needed a repeat prescription and they decided I needed to make an appointment to review my meds.  When I phoned about it on Monday, they told me it could be done over the phone and to wait for the doctor to call.  She did, it went fine.  Basically, nowt is changing.
Finally got my Charity Miles t shirt.  It’s cool.

I’m watching the NHL All Star game.  This makes me happy.
BTW, I’m not doing my Oscar nominee watch through this year.  I wanted to, but the idea of watching a Quentin Tarantino film and two Scarlett Johansson films?  I’d rather wear barb wire underwear, to be honest.
The jazz afternoon was fun.  The performers were universally good.  I’m thinking of going back next month.
The CV review didn’t happen, again.  I have to go in tomorrow for a CV writing session.  Where I’m going to get told the same thing as always.  Which I’ll ignore because it makes no sense.
Seriously, the way they want me to do my CV looks ugly and I refuse to have such an abomination representing me to prospective employers.  It’s.  Not.  Fucking.  Happening.
My work coach at the job centre also emailed me about a course that would lead to a guaranteed interview.  I’m not doing it.  Part of it is to get my license to drive a fork lift.  It turns out I don’t actually need a driving license to drive a fork lift, as long as I’m not taking it on the road.
Here’s the thing though.  There’s a reason I do not have a full driving license.  The only thing I’m interested in driving is virtual vehicles.  I.  Don’t.  Want.  To.  Fucking.  Drive,
Yesterday, I went for a swim then sent round to my best friends house.  I haven’t seen her in a while.  I took over the soundbar I promised her and Vortex Manipulator, which she wanted seeing as I don’t need her any more.  She got me a set of Game of Thrones magnets for my birthday.  They’re awesome.

Still having fun with my new phone.  It’s brilliant.
Got myself a google Nest Mini and it arrived on Tuesday.  I’m paying for it through my phone contract.  I’m having fun asking random things.  I’m also going through the music on the Google Music account and sorting it into playlists.  I’ve also just got a smart light bulb for the living room.  So, now I can switch it on with my voice.  Score!
(Yes, I am a geek, why do you ask?)
As you can see, I got my haircut and a shave today.  The shave was only with a pair of clippers, though.  I’ll wait a couple of weeks and get a proper shave then.
The CV review on Monday didn’t happen as the work coaches email wasn’t working.  So, I’ve still got that to do.
My swim today was frustrated by a group of women who decided that part of the pool was best used by them chatting to their friends outside the pool.  GRRRRRRRRRRRR!  Pisses me off that sort of thing.  I’m going again tomorrow.
Also tomorrow is my birthday.  My age will be the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe and everything.  As well as a swim, I’m going to an afternoon of jazz by bands from Scotland.  They claim it’s for Burns Night next Saturday, but I know it’s actually for my birthday.

It’s been a time of new tech for me.
First of all, yup, new phone. Was that time again. I got an Oppo Reno 2. It’s pretty. It doesn’t actually have anything but the display on the front. The front facing camera pops up from the top of the camera. That’s what I used to take the pic. (And, before anyone says it, I will not smile). Apparently there’s a sensor in the phone that automatically retracts the camera if the phone is dropped but, understandably, I’m not in a rush to test that out.
The only problem with it is that it uses USB 3 C to charge, which means the mini USB stick I’ve got won’t work.
Because I got the phone in the EE shop, they had a look at my broadband and reduced the price of that to £19. Score!
Friday, my new watch arrived. It’s also pretty. It was annoying stopping it after my swim yesterday. The swim tracker is designed so I don’t accidentally stop it while swimming. This also means it’s difficult to stop when you want to stop it and the instructions don’t actually explain how to do that. Cue me spending 15 minutes in the changing room Googling to find out what I’m doing.
Tomorrow my Google Nest Mini arrives.
My uncles funeral is Thursday, so I won’t be able to make it.
That’s about it.

The lunch date was fun.  My nephew wanted a hot dog, but they didn’t have any.  So, he wanted nowt.  My sister got him a cheese and tomato pizza, just in case.  He didn’t want it.  then, he’d try a bit.  Then he didn’t like it.
He left the crusts.
Got some good presents for Christmas.  My parents got me a jumper, a Broons album and £30.  Santa got me some sweets, a tangerine, a banana and some smellies.  My brother and sister in law got me a £20 Brewdog bar voucher.  And my sister and brother in law got me some smellies and this awesome Bali dream catcher:

Just got to decide where I’m putting it.  There’s already a Native American dream catcher above my bed.  Might put it above my sofa, seeing as I’ve been known to sleep there.
Boxing day, I went into town for a bit.
The Saturday, I went to the Cove Rangers match.  I decided I may as well, seeing as I have the top.  It was a good game.  Cove won 2-0.
Then I went to my sisters as they live near the stadium.  We had pizza, I played my nephew at FIFA and beat him twice, then played him at darts where he beat me.  I then went into town and spent my Brewdog voucher drinking Goodest Clear Water.
Yes, that’s a name of a lager.
Sunday, sister, brother in law and nephew came over.  My sister said to my mum that she couldn’t work my Christmas present to her and my brother in law, which is slightly annoying, considering I was over at theirs the day before, she could have asked me then.
Hogmanay, we got the call about my uncle dying.  I went into town that night.  Ended up at a place that played excellent music and where the DJ was late with the countdown to midnight.
New Years Day was spent recovering.  I also watched the first episode of Dracula.
Thursday, didn’t do much.
Friday, train back to Boro.  I watched episode two of Dracula and the first episode of the new series of Doctor Who.  Got back to the flat and went for a swim.
That’s where the title comes from.  Seriously, someone walked out of the changing rooms shaving.  There was someone else who decided the best use of the pool was walking up and down chatting to her friend who was actually swimming.  Grrrrr!  Pissed me off, especially as the pool was actually kinda busy.
Saturday, went for another swim.  My stamina is getting there.  I’ve decided I’m going to try swimming twice a week, every Saturday and Sunday.  Well, most weeks.  I won’t be this weekend, for example, as I’m going through to Newcastle to watch Uncut Gems.
I also watched The Masked Singer, which is oddly addictive and quite bizarre.
Sunday, I watched the second episode of Doctor Who.  I’m not reviewing each episode this series.  Why?  I’m not going to be watching them all.  I’m going to be missing the ones written by Chris Chibnall (which, I think, is most of them) because I just can’t do it to myself anymore.  It’s getting to the point it’s rage watching and I’d rather not do that.
Yesterday, I signed on.  My work coach wanted me to read my CV and I’ve to see her next week so she can review it.
Joy.
It’ll be the same shit it was the two times it was reviewed last year.
I’ve decided I am going to get a Xiaomi Mi Band 4.  I’m tired of having a watch and a fitness band, so I’m getting both in one.  The 20 day battery life doesn’t hurt either.
Oh, I discovered when I got home that I have the Britbox app on my TV.  Score!  You may have thought I got started on the over 600 episodes of Classic Who that’s on there, but I watched the first series of This Life instead.  I’ve been wanting to rewatch it for fucking ages and not found it anywhere.  I’m currently rewatching season 1 of You.  Then, season 2.  then finish This Life.  Then probably Cracker.
I will get round to Classic Who though.

Don’t get too excited about the title.  Yes, I have a lunch date tomorrow, but it’s with my sister and nephew.  She messaged me on FB today to ask if I wanted to meet them tomorrow, seeing as I couldn’t go round on Friday and I, going into town anyway, said yes.  Looking forward to it.
The reason I’m heading into town the morn is because I still have no fucking clue what I’m getting dad for Christmas, so I’m heading in to see if I can find something.
I did find something yesterday when I was on my way for a swim.  The supermarket near my parents had some stalls and one of them had a glass.  On it was some darts with a scroll saying “Dad” and turquoise glitter on the bottom.  I decided to buy it on the way back, but the stall had already closed down.

I’m currently obsessed with a podcast called Fake Heiress. It’s about Anna Sorokin. I’m enjoying it, but I’m not sure about one choice they made.
Sunday, I went through to Hartlepool for the craft fair. It wasn’t very good. And, to be honest, there’s nowt to do there otherwise.
Pics!
       
Thursday was my trip back home. Middolesbrough to Darlington was uneventful. Got to Darlington, dashed to see which platform my train to Aberdeen was leaving from. I already knew, but it’s always worth double checking, just in case. Only to find the train was massively delayed. Which didn’t bother me, because it meant I had time for a cigarette before the train. The announcement came that this was because it was late leaving the depot. Then, on the way to Alnwick, we were running slow because there was another train on the line. Then we were held up getting into one station. All said, it was a miracle the train wasn’t later getting into Aberdeen than it was.
Add to that, because of an IT issue the seat reservations weren’t up. Thankfully the seat I reserved wasn’t taken as it seems most people did sit in their seats. All in all, the train was cursed.
Yesterday, I went into town. There’s another trail, this one is 12 days of Christmas and it’s wood carvings. Absolutely gorgeous. I’ve got all but 4 so far.
I got the rest of mums Christmas present and my nephews. Still no fucking clue what I’m getting dad and I’ve decided my sisters is now between her and my brother in law.
I also eat at Five Guys. I’ve been wanting to do this for a while and finally pulled the trigger. Absolutely fucking gorgeous and the milkshakes are amazing and thick and delicious. Well worth it.
Caught the bus home and all of a sudden started feeling ill. So, I had to miss spending time with my nephew, which sucks because I love doing that.
I went to bed early. And now it’s 6am and I’m awake. Have been since half three. Hoping to go swimming later. It turns out the place near my parents will let me just rock up, pay £5 and use the pool. So, I’ll be doing that.

Tomorrow, I’m heading through to Hartlepool for a craft fair, in the hopes of finding Christmas presents. Which I’m looking forward to. Been a long while since I was up there.
I’m not sure what I’m going to do about swimming when I’m back home. The local council pool to my parents is currently shut for refurbishment. I should be able to use the pool at one of three health centres through my membership down here. Except they won’t bloody get back to me about it. If I don’t hear back on Monday, I’ll email the place in Aberdeen I’d like to use (it’s within walking distance of my parents).
Speaking of, my swim today was good. It actually registered on Time Vortex.
Not sure what’s happening on Christmas Eve, but I’m hoping to go see It’s a Wonderful Life.
Monday, I’m meeting Nikki to finally give her her birthday present.
So, Thursday.
I must admit, I saw the exit poll revealed on the BBC and I audibly gasped. I really did. And it was worse, knowing the exit poll is never massively wrong.
Just how? How could people look at the last nine years and decide “This, but more”? Homelessness on the increase, more food banks than McDonalds restaurants, the NHS on it’s knees (just yesterday it was announced that every single hospital in England and Wales had missed their A&E waiting time targets), police stretched to breaking point and people think this is good?
The constituencies in the North East willing to trust the party that let them die and never gave a shit about them.
And all for something that we know is going to do massive damage to the country.
Fucking madness.
There’s no stopping Johnson. He can basically do what he wants. Even if a quarter of the Tory MP’s rebel, it won’t be enough. That thought it terrifying.
And it’s not like Labour are blameless either. They let this happen. I’m not sure how this happened, but they should have won easily. Yet, at no point were they even talked about winning. It was either a narrow Tory win or a hung Parliament.
My title and the pic are from the song that’s been running through my mind. It’s going to be my attitude to get through the next five years. Be More Kind.

Yesterday, my toilet decided to stop flushing.
Bet you weren’t expecting that start to this entry.
Phoned the landlord and he passed my number onto a plumber, who arranged to come round this morning.  He needed to go get a part and while he was away he told me not to use the toilet.  The one that wasn’t working yesterday and that he left in bits.

So, anyway, it’s fixed.  Mercifully.
Last week, there was a Victorian fair advertised for Stockton.  So, I decided to go through as it sounded interesting.  Well, the “fair” was a big wheel, a merry go round and one of those flying chairs things.  I was whelmed.  Not worth the trip.
Came back to Boro, went to pick up a book I ordered (The Five by Hallie Rubenhold, if you’re wondering) and back home.  Then I went to see Knives Out, which is absolutely fantastic.
Sunday, I had a bit of a random happenstance.  I went to the supermarket after my swim to pick some stuff up and was stood outside finishing my cigarette and someone asked me for a light.  Turns out, it’s someone from Aberdeen!  We stood and chatted for a bit, which was fun.

On some planets, in some cultures, it’s traditional to celebrate on or near the shortest day of the year. Typical. Celebrating when light is in the shortest supply.
Here, however, we’ve got it right. Celebrate when the day is longest, when there’s maximum light to be able to do so. Much more sensible. Same as in those other cultures, presents, feast, visit from a mysterious visitor leaving gifts.
Poppycock, the whole damn lot of it. I’ve never been a believer that it’s anything other than an ordinary day. Didn’t like getting presents, certainly didn’t like giving them, saw the food as an unnecessary extravagance. It’s still the same. I’m a successful businessman. No one, and I mean no one in my company got the day off. They couldn’t even book it off as a holiday. Business as usual. No bonuses, no gifts. It didn’t make me popular, but I’m not in the business I am to make friends. Just the cash.
All that was true till this year. Then the bloody Electorates did what they did best. Stuck their noses in to other people’s business. Declared that, unless you were employed in an essential service, you had to get the day off, paid. Well, I soon found a way round that. I sacked the bloody lot of them. Every single one. The lucky ones will get their jobs back. The extremely lucky ones will get the same level of pay.
I was enjoying a quiet drink on front of the image box when I got a very mild surprise. My old partner, Joe Cregg, walked through the door. Literally, as it was still shut. That’s not the only thing to surprise me, the fact he was there at all was a tiny shock as he had been dead these six years previously.
‘Jex, Jex, Jex. What is going on? I’ve watched you these six years. I wasn’t that surprised with the direction you took the company, driving costs and wages down while keeping prices high. But sacking everyone just before Midsummerfest. Really? Really? That’s cold, even for you.’
‘Why does that surprise you Joeleph?’ I replied, lighting a cigar. This was deliberately to annoy him. He hated me smoking when he was alive and he couldn’t exactly do anything about it now. ‘You know how I feel about the whole ridiculous thing.’
‘That’s very true. But making them beg to get their jobs back, when you are the only game in town?’
‘If they don’t like it, they can take their chances and go somewhere else instead. You going to try and talk me out of this particular course of action?’
Joe shook his head. ‘I’m not that stupid. I know you, I know there’s no convincing you. I’m more the advance guard. There will be others. Don’t know who they will be, but there will be three of them.’
I grinned. ‘Bring it on. I can take it.’
Joe shrugged his shoulders and walked out the door. I would have been shocked and surprised by what had just happened, if I was capable of being shocked by anything. I finished my drink and went to get another one. I flicked through the channels, getting annoyed by all the bloody Midsummerfest programmes. I gave up and left it on as background noise while I looked over the books finding places to reduce our overheads and therefore make me more money. My favourite pastime.
I heard someone clearing their throat and looked up. There was a strange looking person standing there. Long hair, baggy clothes, I actually had to wait for him to talk before discovering it wasn’t actually a female. There’s no need for anyone to look like that really. Scruffy git. He tilted his head and stared at me like an infinitely patient guru. Or a complete and utter numpty.
‘I suppose you’re one of those folks that Joe warned me about?’
‘Indeed I am. If you would be so considerate as to rise yourself off the chair and proceed in a manner that is following where I lead you, it would be muchly appreciated.’
‘Did you swallow a bloody spellingbook or something?’
He continued to stare at me in a manner that I suppose was supposed to be piercing but merely made me think he had something wrong with his sight. ‘It has been commented before that I tend to communicate in a way that can be described as being ever so slightly on the side of the verbose, that much is in the record as a statement of fact. However, my fine person of the male persuasion, the manner with which I carry out my verbal interactions with other personages is not the matter or mission upon which I am currently standing in this fine room which is part of your place of abode. You, in all actuality, really do need to be following where I precede you to. If you find my style of conducting communications of the conversational variety to be not of your particular taste than the greater velocity with which he hence from this place of dwelling, the sooner I shall no longer be chatting to your good self.’
I got up, sighing. A spellingbook? This guy seems to have swallowed the entire language for dinner then another one for desert. I headed towards the door.
‘Oh, dear me, my fine and upright male type,’ he said. ‘There was a particular and very rational explanation as to why I asked your fine self to follow me. For you shall not be removing yourself from the confines of these four splendidly decorated walls in the manner with which you are quite accustomed. If you would ever so kind as to follow in the direction and general manner of which I shall be leading and proceeding, it would be much and greatly appreciated.’
It usually takes a lot for me to lose my temper but this guy was very close to it. ‘Where are we going?’
‘I would request that, in all humbleness and obsequiousness, that the sooner that we cease and desist tarrying and remaining in this place, the sooner your eyeballs will observe detail and catalogue our ultimate destination.’
‘Do you ever say things simply?’
‘My dear and sweet gentle person of the male persuasion, it is the humble opinion of my good self, your guide, mentor and narrator, that to use one piece of vocalisation when you could use ten is sheer, total and utter laziness. Shall we depart from the ground on which we currently stand and the space we presently occupy with no further delay?’
I gave up and followed him. We walked, not through the door, but through the wall at the rear of the room. Rather than ending up in my dining hall, as I would expect, it being the room through there, I found myself outside. The house we stood outside looked familiar to me, though I couldn’t quite place it. My annoying guide turned to me again.
‘Now I do find that it is my solemn duty to be informing you that in this place, at this time you are as spectral and non-corporal as my own good self, your dear, late and much lamented friend and partner in the world of business and the two personages that shall be paying you the honour and the privilege of a visitation once I have departed from your fine and muchly enjoyable company. Now, my dear sir, if you would once again be so kind as to place your lowest appendages in the steps of my own feet, we shall proceed with the entering of this simple, humble yet very homely abode.’
I followed him through the wall into the house. I got a shock when I saw someone I instantly recognised, sat slumped on the bottom step, crying over a package I again recognised. ‘Soxanna Hamilsmythe,’ I whispered.
‘So, your good self has recognition of this poor, weeping visage that sits before us? And would there be, perchance, any glimmer of familiarity with great concern to the package she is currently blessing and moistening with giant drops of water?’
I looked closer. ‘It is a present that she tried to give me. We must have been in Learning Eight at the time. I remember laughing and shoving it back in her face.’
‘Well, that simple act did give her much reason for the painful act of grievance. The poor, very unfortunate womanly person you see so tortured before myself and yourself spent a lot of time and no small amount of trouble to be absolutely assured that the small but perfectly chosen gift would be much to your liking. The poor dear was completely, totally and utterly head over heels in love with you. That simple but very much of the cruel description act with which you returned the present did break her poor delicate heart. And, may be as bold as to enquire as to the nature and direction of any feelings you may have harboured towards her?’
‘I was in love with her. I did try to approach her after this happened but got short shrift. Now I know why. Is this what you are planning to do, make me visit places like this?’
‘If that was indeed my intention and my plan, it would be very, very easy to do sir. For there is absolutely no doubt or equivocation in my, or anyone else’s, mind that of such personages supply cannot be described in any way, shape or form as being short. Beings of the human variety that may easily be described as friends of yours, familial members, there is indeed a plentiful supply of these types. However, our time together is, by necessity, short and thusly my humble self can only be of a mind to let you view and peek on one such example. This wretched creature was thusly chosen as being the one that you would catch sight and sound of as it may well be the one that made the biggest impression on you. Now, if it would please and pleasure you, I must bid you adieu and the most fairest of wells. You shall be departing of this place by the very means and direction with which you came in.’
With that, he was gone. I walked through the wall I went through to get in and was back in my living space. I went to the drinks cabinet, poured a very healthy measure of alcohol and downed it. What exactly was that supposed to teach me? When I turned back round there was someone else there. Definitely female this time. She pointed at me.
‘You. Follow,’ was all she said. Thank the Gods for that, short on conversation. We left though the front wall this time. We stood outside the house. She pointed to the house opposite mine.’
‘Look.’
The house was festooned with horrible lit decorations. It was really not becoming. Then she turned round and pointed again.
‘Look.’
I did. My house, looking perfectly normal, the way things should be.
‘You not decorate.’
‘It’s cheap, tacky and in celebration of something ridiculous. I really don’t see the point.’
‘But you make.’
‘Of course I do. Low production costs, massive profits. I’d be mad not to.’
She turned again. ‘Follow.’ I did. We walked down the street, turned the corner and followed the next street till she stopped, turned and pointed at a house. ‘Look.’
‘And this is important to me because?’ I asked.
‘Azander MacToro. You know’
‘The name rings a bell,’ I said. ‘Think he works in accounts.’
‘Follow.’
I followed her into the house. Sat there, looking morose amongst the bustle, was Azander.
‘Glad to see he’s not enjoying himself.’
‘First Midsummerfest with family,’ she said. Can’t enjoy. Can’t have fun. Busy worrying if will have job tomorrow.’
‘Good. Anyone having fun at this stupid time of year should be zapped on sight and then zapped again to ensure they are dead.’
She pointed back to the wall. ‘Leave.’ She disappeared and I walked through the hall, back to my place. This time I didn’t move. Sure enough, someone else appeared in my living space. Female again. She looked a bit kinder than the last one, however.
‘Let me guess,’ I said. ‘You want me to follow you.’
‘Dude, you catch on pretty quickly,’ she replied. She walked towards one of the side walls and I followed her. We were in my street, but there was something different about it. The lights looked completely different for a start.
‘Have a look in that bin. There’s something there that might interest you.’
I went over and picked up the box resting on the top. The fact that I could pick it up was a surprise. ‘I didn’t think I’d be able to do that, being non-corporeal and all,’ I said.
‘You shouldn’t be able to, but exceptions can be made if needs be.’
I looked at the box, drinking in all the information on there. ‘I don’t recognise this.’
‘We’re about 20 years in the future. That box used to contain the very latest in cutting edge technology.’
‘It’s not made by me.’
‘Indeed not,’ she agreed. ‘Come on, follow me.’
I put the box back and followed her down the road. She led me into the graveyard. I never liked this place. Far, far too dark and dingy for my tastes. If they sold me the place, like I’d asked, it would have been turned into an amusement fair.
We walked through rows and rows of extravagant monstrosities dedicated to people who can’t actually appreciate them to a bit at the back. This was the area for pauper’s graves. My guide pointed at one. Written on a tiny, badly whitewashed, crudely made cross was “J Washburne.”
‘That my grave?’
‘It is.’
‘What happened?’
‘Your miserly cost cutting measures made your products unusable. You refused to invest in making anything else new. Competitors moved in and stole your staff. The company went bust. You lost a load of money and, due to your attitude, you had no friends. This is what you become. And now we must part ways.’
She disappeared and I walked through the wall from one version of my living space to the other. I got myself a drink and sat back down, flicking through the channels on the image box and thinking.
Now, you may be under the impression that everything I saw had given me food for thought, made me realise that I had to change things. Sorry pal, wrong story. I was actually recalling everything I learned from the box I held. There was a nice project for the development people tomorrow.

I’ve decided to make posting this an annual thing.

Last night was another Frank Turner gig.
I was supposed to getting a lift there and back.  Then the person said they couldn’t commit to going because of family issues.  So, I booked a hotel instead.
Got the train through and listened to a couple of episodes of Dolly Partons America.  (I highly recommend this podcast, it’s great).  Then i booked into the hotel.  Eventually.  I wasn’t paying by card and don’t have a passport or driving license.  We got it sorted, I paid one pound on my card and the rest in cash.
Up to my room, have a shower and head out to the venue.
I bought a t shirt an  then I had a couple of drinks in the bar while I finished reading Private Eye and read some more of Girl Woman Other.  Went back upstairs, talked to the folks from Safe Gigs for Women, bought a couple of badges and picked up some stickers.  Outside for a smoke then realised I could take drinks into the hall.
So, back to the bar, got a two pint glass (well, plastic glass) of lager and into the hall.
Unusually for a Frank gig, this was all seater.  which worked for the type of gig it was.
First up was Emily Barker, a singer/songwriter from Australia.  She featured on the episode of Franks podcast about Sister Rosetta Tharpe.  Her set was excellent.  I got a surprise when she mentioned Dolly Partons America.  She apologised for not having merchandise on sale, but the venue was looking for a 25% cut, plus VAT, which would have wiped out her profits from the sales.
Went outside for a smoke, then signed up for Emily’s mailing list and talked to her about the podcast.  Back inside for the second set.
This was Frank solo.  He performed songs from No Mans Land and talked about the women the songs are about and why he chose to write about those women.  It was interesting and the songs are brilliant.
Back outside for another smoke, back to the bar for more lager then the final set.  This was Frank and the Sleeping Souls playing rearrangements of some of their songs.
One in particular I was looking forward to.  A couple of years ago, Frank released an album called Songbook.  some of the songs were rearrangements.  One of those was I Am Disappeared, and the Songbook version is one of my favourite Frank songs.  I never thought I would get to hear it live, then people who went to the earlier gigs on this tour confirmed that the Songbook version of I Am Disappeared was one of the ones they did.
Here it is from another date on the tour:

I’m not sure what it was, but it was the most spiritual moment of my year.  It absolutely moved me.
The last two songs, we were on our feet for I Still Believe and Be More Kind (which was dedicated to Clive James, who Frank got the title from and who died yesterday).  And they were the most communal moments of the year for me.
I left, went o have a couple of pints, finished reading Girl Woman Other (fantastic book, highly recommended and I’m now pissed off it shared this years Booker Prize because it deserved to win on its own) and started reading I Heard You Paint Houses.
Back to the hotel, slept, train back today and listen to another couple of episodes of Dolly Partons America.
And now I have to get my tattoo updated.
Pics!
                
First three pics are Emily Barker, last two are my t shirt, the rest are frank and Franks and the Souls.

Wookie cushion.
The Horror Channel is having a classic monster movie marathon today.  So far I’ve watched Dracula and Frankenstein is nearly finished.  I enjoyed Dracula, but my enjoyment of Frankenstein is tempered by my annoyance that the monster is unable to speak.  In the novel, he’s actually quite eloquent.
Next up is The Mummy, followed by The Wolf Man.  They’re also showing The Creature From the Deep, but the last half hour clashes with His Dark Materials, so I’m going to miss that.
Tomorrow, I’ll hopefully find out what’s happening with me going home for Christmas.  It all depends on if the Job Centre is going to be open on the 23rd and what my brother is doing.
Wednesday is the Frank Turner gig.  Can’t wait, especially as one of the songs he does is one of my favourite versions of that song.
Next Saturday, I’ve already got my ticket booked for Knives Out.  I’m a huge Rian Johnson fan (The Last Jedi is the only film of his I’ve not seen on the big screen) so I really cannot wait for this one.
I have, as a certain paranoid android would say, a terrible pain in all the diodes down my left side.  So, I’ve bought gel to rub into it.  It has helped.

Extra image just cos:

You may remember that I mentioned a while back that Boro has a Snowman trail, based on the 12 days of Christmas.
Well, it was in the papers today that the Snowmen that are in public had to be strengthened due to vandalism.  They also now have a sign on the base saying that they are monitored 24 hours a day by CCTV and vandals will be fined, prosecuted and, here I quote:
“Father Christmas will be told”.
I’ve just booked a weekend away in April.  After the sci-fi con I went to at the start of the month, I decided to save up to go again.  Then I got an email for a competition to win tickets again.  I entered and, unsurprisingly, won.  (Apparently, they are notorious for basically allowing anyone who enters to win.)
So, today I booked my ticket and signing pass.  Accommodation will be booked later, but it’s going to be another pod because it’s cheap and incredibly cute.
Yesterday, I went through to Newcastle to watch The Irishman.  Yes, I know it’s going to be on Netflix soon, but it’s Scorsese on the big screen, which I will never say no to.
I decided to eat at Byrons, which is one of the multitude of gourmet burger chains that have opened up in recent years, trying to pretend they are not like McDonalds or Burger King but really are.
The meal was aggressively average.  Really not worth the money.
The Irishman, by the way, is amazing.  Easily my favourite film of the year.  It is Scorsese’s masterpiece.  It seems like Goodfellas and Casino, themselves brilliant films, were mere auditions for this one.  Scorsese deserves the Best Director Oscar, Pesci the Best Actor one and the film itself Best Film.  Sadly, the Academy’s hatred of Netflix will prevent that from happening.  Which is a damn shame.
Today I went for my swim.  I was the only one in the pool, so I pushed myself.  That’s where the entry title comes from.
Next entry will likely be a political one.

Lauren may have to see a doctor for whatever condition makes her think this is any way acceptable.
I don’t know what I did on Wednesday night, but the lurgy is gone.  Now I’ve just got a cold.  Or, as I say, illness as usual.
It turns out I left the charger for my watch in Yarmouth.  Oops.  So, my watch is dead at the moment.  Until I get a new one.
There’s snowmen in town.  It’s another trail, this one based on the 12 days of Christmas and The Snowman.  There all very close together, so one day I’m going to go and photo them all in a oner.
Planning on making broth on Sunday.  It’s the weather for it.
Tennis on telly next week!

I don’t know if it’s something I picked up at the con, but the past couple of days I’ve been shivery and cold, sneezing my head up and coughing worse than normal (I have a smokers cough).
Not helping things is that I’ve also today got a pounding headache.
Hopefully I’ll be better by the weekend because I was wanting to give Nikki her birthday present.
Still, I’ve got two new episodes of The End of the Fucking World to watch.  So, that’s cool.

As mentioned in my last entry, this weekend was the Sci-Fi Weekender X.
First I had to get there.  Train from Boro to Darlington, fine.  Darlington to Peterborough, first class on one of the new Azuma trains that LNER have introduced.  Fine.
Peterborough to Norwich however was where the problem started.  I went to the platform that the sign told me to go to and there’s a bloody freight train there.  No signs of it moving.  Sure enough, we had to change platforms.  Then the train was delayed.  Eventually got to Norwich.
Went to the platform to get the train to Great Yarmouth.  And waited.  And waited.  Then, it came up on the screen that the train had been cancelled and I’d have to wait another hour.  Fucking great.  No tannoy announcement, you’ll note.
Fuck it, time for a pint.  I’d been on the go since 8:20am, it’s now the back of three.
Finally got on the train, got to Great Yarmouth and walked to the holiday camp where the con was being held.  It was easily in walking distance.  Checked in, got my key and my wristband and my VIP pass and found my pod.  If you’ve read my last entry, you’ll know how adorable it is.
I dumped my bag, put on my wristband and headed bacvk to the train station.  Well, just behind it.  There’s an ASDA (supermarket) there.  Got some root beer, back to the pod, put that in the fridge and wandered round.
The actual complex is quite small.  Which had the advantage that it wasn’t easy to get lost.
I went to the restaurant and got something to eat, which totally wasn’t worth the cash I spent on it.  I then went to watch a band called Dirty Rose (excellent), had a few pints, a few random conversations then went to bed.
Friday, I was up early to go for a swim (there is a swimming pool there that we had the use of).  I only managed a few lengths, but that’s fine.  At least I got that in.
Went to queue for the main room for the opening celebration.  Discovered that because I bought a singing pass, I had VIP access and got to queue jump.  Score!  I had a look around the merchandise stand then watched the opening.  Which is when they mentioned having a number for the signings and how that worked.
Bugger.  I went to reception, asked about this and got my number.  What they did with the signings was they would call numbers up in batches of 50 and, if you missed your slot, you could just jump in at the end.
Back to the main hall to hear Sophie Aldred.  This was one of the things I was looking forward to.  She played Ace, the first Doctors assistant I ever watched.  She made her own explosives and took out a Dalek with a baseball bat.  What’s not to like?
Sohpie was brilliant.  Funny, utterly charming and an absolute delight.  Then there was a surprise.  Sylvester McCoy had appeared.  He wasn’t billed, but he turned up, took a seat at one of the signing tables and basically camped out for the day.
McCoy had been in a lot of things.  Most of you will know him as Radagast in The Hobbit films.  But, for me, he will forever be the Doctor.  He played the seventh Doctor and the first one I ever watched.  (Funnily enough, his assistant for most of his run was Ace.)
I queued up, bought a photo for him to sign (as I was at a sci-fi can, naturally I bought a photo of him on a sitcom called Still Game) and paid for a pic with him.  The camera on my phone wasn’t co-operating with the person taking the pics so it ended up being a selfie.
I bought some stuff.  I got two t shirts, one is a Schrodingers Cat one and one says “I’m full of bad ideas”.  I also got a pair of sunglasses where the lenses flip up and there’s clear lenses underneath.
It was then time to queue for Sophie.  I bought a pic from here, chatted to her about the fact her son is called Will (though he apparently prefers William nowadays) and I got a pic with her as well.
I wandered about a bit aimlessly, then realised that the surprise guest was on stage.  It was, of course, Sylvester McCoy.  I, sadly, missed most of his appearance, but did, fortunately, get to hear him speak about ferret legging.  He was also hilarious.
I went back to the pod, crashed for a couple of hours, then went back to the main room.  I caught the end of Area 51 then saw The Elvis Dead.
This, for me was the highlight of the weekend.  Never heard of it before and was pleasantly delighted with what I saw.  What is it?  It’s a retelling of the the film The Evil Dead 2 utilising the songs of Elvis Presley.
I am, of course, not joking.
It was absolutely hilarious, the high point being how he used the song Are You Lonesome Tonight? where he got a huge round of applause just for the opening line.  I later got a selfie with him and he told me that he got the idea from watching Bubbe Ho-Tep.
Next was Professor Elemental.  He’s a chap hop artist.  Not sure what that is?  It’s this:

He was helped out by Area 51 and thoroughly entertained me.  I bought a copy of his new book Tales of Wrong and got a selfie with him as well.  (Yes, I am a whole for getting pics with celebs, what of it?)
He was followed by Pat Sharp DJing.  It was someone famous DJing, to be honest.  After that I went to sleep.
Saturday morning, I headed back to ADSA.  I needed money because I was running low and the cash machines on site all charged for taking money out.  I then went to a panel about the TV show Ghostwatch.
Now, Ghostwatch needs a bit of explanation here.  It aired on Halloween in 1992 and, though scripted, it was presented as live.  It was looking to the possible haunting of a house and was “presented” by Michael Parkinson, a well respected TV interviewer, Sarah Greene and Mike Smith, who were noted TV presenters, and Craig Charles of Red Dwarf fame.  It prompted a load of complaints and has been disowned by the BBC.  Best of my knowledge, it’s never actually been repeated.  Someone made a documentary about it and it was him hosting the panel, which was interesting.
Then, back to the main room for a Professor Elemental panel officially launching his book.  It consisted him reading from the book (the Trip Adviser reviews for places from horror films are brilliant), songs and him talking about his love of horror.  I then had something to eat and headed to the screening room for the documentary about Ghostwatch then Rocky Horror.  Of course, I sang every song.
Back to the second room for Hats Off Gentlemen.  Science based prog rock.  It sounded just ridiculous enough to be interesting and it was, indeed, interesting.  The lead singer warned us that he wasn’t at 100% through illness but, to be honest, I would never have known had he not said.
Watched a bit of the cosplay final and went back to the second room for karaoke.  I got pissed off with one person.  During one song she kept trying to get me to get up and dance.  I did politely say no, but ended up shouting at her to fuck off.  Them, during another song, she actually grabbed my arms and tried to force me to clap along.  I shouted, again, for her to fuck off and added that she needed to stop trying to get me to do shit I didn’t want to do.
Her husband dragged her away, apologised to me then they left.
After that, I had a lot more fun.  Of course I sang.  I did Killing in the Name by Rage Against The Machine and absolutely killed it.  It was brilliant.
Then it was The Swinghoppers.  Who are a swing hop band.  What’s that?  Well, it’s this:

One of the band is entering a huge beatbox competition, so we were treated to that as well.  They were probably my second favourite thing all weekend, certainly out of the stuff I discovered.  Adorably, there was a little girl who basically danced for the entire set.
Then there was a band called Flesh Tetris.  They were, to be frank shit, so I took my leave.
I also got pictures of some of the cosplayers, including Tilly from Star trek: Discovery, Zahpod Beeblebrox, the half arsed Avengers and a Wookie cushion.  Yes, you got that last part right.
Today (well, yesterday now) was about coming home.  Hour wait at Norwich, hour wait at Peterborough, half hour wait at Darlo.  Home in time for His Dark Materials.  Which, as expected, was excellent.
Overall, i had an amazing weekend and it was nice to get away to somewhere not named Aberdeen or Newcastle.
Next entry will be a huge photodump.  Just fair warning.

Yup, it’s politics.
This is an entry that I wanted to write before, but stuff kept happening.
When I last wrote on this topic, the Tories had been refused a recess for their party conference.  Conference went ahead, which meant that Johnson missed another PMQ’s*.  Now, the tradition is that when the PM misses PMQ’s, the Leader of the Opposition does as well.  This created a bit of history as Diane Abbott became the first person of colour, of either gender, to ask questions from the dispatch box.
Then, Parliament was prorogued.  Again.  This, however was a normal proroguing for a Queens Speech.  Which was light on detail.  Very light on detail.
Meanwhile, the clock was ticking down to Brexit day.  What would Johnson do?
It then emerged, we had a Working Agreement!  What Johnson did was capitulate.  He got rid of the backstop and replaced it with a customs border in the Irish Sea.  This, it has to be pointed out, is something that Johnson had previously said no PM should ever agree to.  Overall, the deal is worse than Mays deal.  For a start, no-one knew what was happening with customs checks for stuff going to NI from mainland Britain.
Still, there was a vote to pass it to the third reading in Parliament, which the Government won.  This is only the second vote that Johnson won and the first was an uncontroversial bill about the environment that was nodded through**.
Then it came to the programme motion.  This determines the passage of the bill through Parliament.  The Government wanted it to go through all of the stages in three days.  MP’s, however, decided that a bill so fundamentally set on changing the country deserved more scrutiny and the motion was voted down.
Then the debate about the Queens Speech finished and the Government won the vote.  This gives Johnson a win loss record of 2 – 9.
So, what would Johnson do about the letter that he had, by law, to send to the EU?  He had said he’d rather be dead in a ditch than send it, but not sending it would be illegal.
Eventually he found a solution.  He sent a photocopy of the letter outlined in the Benn act and didn’t sign it.  Because our PM is, apparently, a child who thinks that means he didn’t send it.  He also sent a side letter asking the EU to ignore the first one.
The EU ignored that side letter and gave an extension until 31 Jan 2020.
Then there was another motion under the Fixed Term Parliament Act for an early General Election.  The other parties were wary, because Johnson said the date of the election would not be fixed until the Working Agreement Bill had been rushed through.  So, in what will not doubt come as a huge shock to you, Johnson lost that vote as well.
Yesterday, there was a bill that started its passage through Parliament to call for a General Election on the 12th of December.  There was some disappointment because others wanted to be on the 9th.  However, the bill passed through all of the Commons stages unamended and went to the Lords today.  It passed through there unamended as well, which means it will become law.
Tomorrow is John Bercows last day as Speaker (he had been asked to delay leaving until the GE, but decided against), Monday is the election of the new Speaker, there’s a couple of bills going through wash up (basically ensuring they become law) then Tuesday Parliament is dissolved and we head into the election period.
How will tings turn out?
The Tories have a lead in the polls.  However, Labour overcame a bigger Tory lead in the polls in 2017 to force a hung parliament.  corbyn is an outstanding campaigner and Johnson, honestly, isn’t.
so, it’s looking likely it’s a hung parliament.  This is a problem for the Tories.  The only way that they will be able to cling to power is to enter a coalition or a confidence and supply deal with at least one other party.  In 2017, they entered a C&S deal with the DUP.  But, considering that they don’t like the deal Johnson made, it’s not likely to happen again.  The Lib Dems will make a second EU referendum a red line, which the Tories will never agree with, and the SNP will do the same with a second Indyref as well, which there’s no way the Tories will agree with.
And no-one knows what’s happening with the Brexit Party.
Labour, however, are already in favour of a second EU referendum and have said they are in favour of Indyref2, just need to haggle on the timing.  So, it’s likely to be a Lab/Lib/SNP coalition, just to get past a second EU referendum then or a C&S deal with both, again, with a GE.

P.S. the UKIP leader has resigned, if anyone cares.  God knows, you’d be the only one.
*PMQ’s = Prime Ministers Questions.  Happens once a week when Parliament is in session.  Every Wednesday from midday.  It’s supposed to last half an hour, but generally overruns.  The questioners, with the exception of the Leader of the Opposition and the leader of the third biggest party in the Commons enter a draw to be allowed to ask a question.  Each MP chosen gets one question, the leader of the third biggest party (at the moment Ian Blackford as the SNP leader in Westminster) gets three, LOTO gets six.  MP’s will generally find a way to work their constituency into the question.  In theory, it’s a chance for the Commons to hold the PM to account.  In reality, it’s worth remembering it’s called Prime Ministers Questions, not Prime Ministers Answers.
**Nodding through = whenever there’s a vote in the Commons, before the division, there is a voice vote.  If there’s audibly more support for “Aye” or “No” it doesn’t go to a division, since the will of the Commons has been indicated.  If it’s “Aye”, it’s described as being nodded through.  Not sure why nodded through, but that’s Westminster for you

The meeting with the new Routes to Work person went well.  I think I’ll get on with her.
The volunteering meeting, not so much.  As I feared, it was about working at the cemetery.  As soon as I said I had emailed to change to the library.  And that was meeting over.
Yesterday, I went through to Newcastle.  I had a ticket to go to an event with Margaret Atwood.  It was brilliant.  She was hilarious.  Seriously, I’ve seen sets from stand up comics that have been less funny than her.  She was also blunt.  When she was asked about it seeming as if we were living in dark times, she simply said that’s because we are.
The first half was her being asked questions by an interviewer and the second was her answering questions that had been tweeted in.  We learned that she doesn’t like telling people what to read, that she started writing The Testaments in 2016 and that she’s got a petit point made by a fan saying “Fuck Aunt Lydia”.
And why beds have legs.
Then I went down the pub for a couple of pints, finished reading Unfollow and started reading Renia’s Story.
Today, I went to the Newcastle Quey market to get more backflow incense cones and came home.  After some time to decompress, I went for my swim.
It didn’t register on Vortex Manipulator this week, but that’s not because I’m backsliding.  It’s because my between lengths rests were longer than I would have liked.  There were three kids who were messing about.  I wouldn’t mind that, but there were spreading out across the pool.  I actually had to stop one length because one of them decided to swim right across me and if I didn’t we would have collided.
That still didn’t teach them.
Got the new Cigarettes after Sex album.  It’s great.
A few pics from Newcastle:
     
The stage pic is just to show the setup.  I didn’t actually take any pics during the event.
Next weekend is Great Yarmouth.

I’ve got a Misfit Ray fitness tracker that I call Vortex Manipulator (Doctor Who fans will understand).  Since I started swimming, I’ve had to add my swims manually because they simply didn’t register for some reason.
Yesterday, I noticed I was taking shorter breaks between lengths, so I was hopeful.  Sure enough, when I synced Vortex Manipulator with the app, my swim was there!  Admittedly, it registered as light activity and I had to change that, but still.
Go me!
Last night I went to a murder mystery thing at a local museum.  It wasn’t worth the money, really.  The story was boring, the resolution made no sense and the food was almost inedible.  In fact, part of it literally was.  Seeing the museum at night was interesting though.
Is it bad that when I went to my local bookshop to pick up a book I ordered the assistant knew me by name?
I have a new person to see from Routes to Work as the last one is off work until the end of the year.  I meet her tomorrow.
I also have an appointment for volunteering with the council on Friday.  Hopefully it’s for the library position.
Next weekend I’m going to the Sage in Gateshead to hear Margaret Atwood speak.  Should be good.
Beyond that, not much happening.

Going to have to mess about with the settings on my phone, it’s doing the cutting pics off here thang again.  Here’s the full pic of my now healed tattoo:

I think I might need to get it touched up, because, although you can’t see it well on the pics, there are bits on the red where the ink didn’t take.  I’m going to have to go back next month to get another gig added, so I’ll see what they say then.
Finished The Secret Commonwealth.  Tis very, very good.  I’ve now started the Megan Phelps-Roper book.  She’s a good writer, but very matter of fact about her upbringing being normal to her (though not normal in the regular sense).  It leads to strange things like her stating drily that she picketed a graduation ceremony at the local high school only stopping when it was time for her to go graduate.
Saturday, I wandered round town then went to see The Day Shall Come, the new film by Chris Morris.  I’ve been a fan of his since The Day Today, so was very much looking forward to it.  It didn’t disappoint.
Also went swimming on Saturday.  Thankfully, I had the pool to myself for the first part of my session.  Then it started filling up.  My new googles worked well, though.  (I had to get a new set, the clip on my original ones broke.)  I have had to get myself some rash cream, the water didn’t react well with the band on Vortex Manipulator (the name I’ve given my fitness tracker) and I got me a rash.  It’s clearing up now.
I have to argue with the council again.  They’ve decided I now need to pay council tax for two plats I lived in about 15 years ago.  In addition, they’re not charging me the tax as it was 15 years ago, they are charging me modern prices.  So, this is my mood when it comes to dealing with them:

Not a bad seat for the match.
Saturday morning I met Nikki and Kev for the game.  There was an African market so me and Nikki went for a wander round.  Nikki bought a bracelet and the person she bought it from also tried offloading a picture, so we pointed out we were going to the game.
There was also a display with notable POC from history.  Up there with Usain Bolt and Harriet Tubman was the person who opened Club Bongo, a notorious local nightclub.
Then we headed over to the Riverside, found where we were supposed to be going, queued for a while and got into the stadium just before kick off.
The game was good, but not great.  They did, however, allow people outside for a smoke.
Me and Nikki spent most of half time looking for someone selling programmes, only to discover that Kev managed to buy us one each from someone that came round.
England lost 2-1, we did a Mexican wave and, as promised, I wore my Cove Rangers top:

We then went for a drink and headed home.
Later that night I went to a rock night.  Never going back there again.  I’ve had some bad lager in my time, but this was the only one with an aftertaste of vinegar.  I couldn’t even finish my pint.
Sunday, I went into town to pick up a couple of bits then went for a swim.  It seems that Sunday afternoon is the time for people to teach their kids how to swim because it was happening again.  It’s fucking adorable and I was slightly envious of the kids water wings because they looked a lot better than the horrible inflatable ones I wore while learning to swim.
Then I went for a quick drink to kill time, then went to see Ghostbusters at my local cinema.  I love the film and it was the first time I saw it on the big screen.  Still as good as ever.
Slightly pissed off with Waterstones.  I pre-ordered The Secret Commonwealth with the idea that it would arrive on the day of release.  It didn’t turn up until the next day.  However, the other book I ordered turned up today, a day early.  Go figure.
The new book is Unfollow by Megan Phelps-Roper.  @sleepygene, I think this one might interest you.  Phelps-Roper used to run the Twitter account for Westboro Baptist and the book is about how interacting with people on Twitter made her realise that the church is evil and her leaving altogether.
And, I’ll leave it there.

There was an open day at an art studio in town today as part of the Art Weekender, so I went along.  One of the studios was a guy that I’ve known for a while, so we caught up and then I made a print.  I thought it would be as normal, where there’s one print you can make in black and white.
But, no.  I was able to make my own print (either a bee of a flower) and print it in colour.  The result is the pic.  As you can see, I’m not an artist.
I did go for a swim today.  It was less busy.  There was someone teaching a kid to swim.  It was nice to see.  There were bits where she would take him so far down and tell him to get to the end by himself.  I did find myself cheering in my head for the kid.

I did go for a swim on Tuesday.  T’was fine.  Not so much today though.
I’ve found things are easier if I swim for 10-15 minutes then go in the jacuzzi (sorry, I mean spa) for about 5 minutes.  Well, I did that once, but the pool started getting too busy to keep going.  Ah well, I’ll go back tomorrow.
When I got there, there was someone in the jacuzzi messing about on their phone.  Seems a bit dangerous.
There was a lot happening in town today.  There is the Middlesbrough Art Weekender going on, so I went to some of the exhibitions for that.  There’s a thing tonight that I want to go to, but I don’t have the cash so I’ll just have to miss it.  There’s a printing thing tomorrow that I’m definitely going to however.
It was also the last Orange Pip marketplace until Christmas and that’s always worth a wander.
There was also pop up Pride.

It’s been a while since there was any kind of Pride in Boro (I honestly can’t remember the last one) so hopefully this is the start of bringing it back properly.
I also bought myself some new toys over the week:

Yeah, I did literally mean toys.  Sonic screwdriver toys to be exact.  From left to right they are the War Doctors sonic, the Ninth/Tenth Doctors sonic and the Eleventh Doctors sonic.

Yes, it’s another political entry.
First thing I have to do is correct myself. In my last politics entry, I said that the Government had lost an appeal at the High Court in Scotland. It was, in fact the Court of Sessions. The High Court deals with appeals in criminal cases, which this wasn’t.
So, a couple of weekends ago, Call Me Dave emerged from his shed and started talking publicly. The reason is because his new book came out two weeks ago and he needed to promote it. In doing so, he said:#

He doesn’t regret austerity, thinks it was necessary and, in fact, didn’t go far enough,
Corbyn did nothing for the Remain campaign and
Boris Johnson only backed Leave in the referendum to benefit his career.

The following Tuesday, the appeals in the Supreme Court were heard. There were the maximum 11 judges hearing the case. This is where I tell you about the questions the judges were looking at.

Is this justiciable? This one is pretty simple. Is the proroguing of Parliament something that the courts can look at, or is it under parliamentary privilege?
Was it unlawful? This should be self explanatory.
What can actually be done about it? Can it be cancelled or is it too late?

The Government offered no defence. Literally, all they said was that it wasn’t justiciable.
Then, at the weekend, Johnson was in trouble again when he was accused of using tax payer money to, basically, get laid. Though the woman involved swears that he only went to her house to learn about technology.
Seriously.
Then, at 10:30am on Tuesday, Lady Hale, President of the Supreme Court, read out the courts decision. Now, it was widely expected that they would either rule it wasn’t justiciable and that it would be a split decision.
The Supreme Court ruled unanimously that it was justiciable, it was unlawful and, as a result, the proroguing was quashed. It never happened.
Enter John Bercow.
He consulted with the Lords Speaker and the leaders of all the main parties and announced that Parliament would be back yesterday at 11:30am.
Labour had to cut their conference short, but they returned. Johnson had to return from his home city, New York.
(Betcha you didn’t know that, huh? Yup, Johnson is American by birth, but he’s given up his American citizenship.)
There were a couple of emergency questions, then a statement from Johnson followed by questions to him.
It was possibly the absolute worst I’ve ever seen the Commons. Johnson was, basically, belligerent. He didn’t seem to care what he was saying. He was asked numerous times to watch his language as some of the things he was saying was inflammatory and he refused to do so.
The whole idea was to try and force the opposition parties to initiate a Vote of No Confidence, but none of them fell for the obvious trap.
Today, there was a vote on a recess for the Tory party conference next week, which the Government lost. For the record, that means that Johnson has lost 7 votes in Parliament and a Supreme Court ruling.

Later tonight, I’m going to do another megadump of pics from the weekend. Tomorrow, I’ll write about the Supreme Court ruling.
In this entry, however, I’ll talk about Newcastle and Mythos.
Now, the timing of the three shows presented me with, shall we say, challenges. The first one was that the first show started at 2:30pm. The earliest I could check in to the hotel was 2pm. This, as you can imagine, was tight. A couple of tweets, an email and I discovered that I could leave my bags at the hotel until such time as I could check in.
Got the train to Newcastle, went to the hotel, dropped my bag off and I headed out. I had to go to Waterstones to pick up a couple of books I had ordered. One is Unbelievable, the book that the excellent Netflix show is based on. The second is Renia’s Story. This is the diary of a young Polish Jew girl during WW2 (@gypsywind, I’m pretty sure I told you about this book a while back).
I then went for a wander round the Sunday market at the Quayside. I got myself some new backflow incense cones and a couple of t shirts. One says “That’s what I do, I drink and I know things” and the second, which has become a favourite, says “Introverts unite! We’re here, we’re uncomfortable and we want to go home”. I also got pics of the elephant figures that have been decorated that I found on the way.
Then it was over to the Sage for Mythos: Gods. It was, well, it was Stephen Fry talking about Greek Mythology. He was funny and informative. This show went from the start up to Prometheus being punished for defying Zeus to give fire to man. It was also interactive. When he talked about the Gods transforming man to different species, he gave the option of which story to tell. The spider was chosen, which made me happy, because it’s one of my favourite Greek myths. We played a couple of rounds of Mythical Pursuit. And during the intermission, we could email our questions to the Oracle and some would be answered after intermission. I didn’t ask a question. Fry also confirmed that not even the Oracle can predict Brexit, in response to more than a few questions.
Back to the hotel, check in, shower, back to the Sage, have something to eat (annoyingly, the coleslaw was placed directly on the board they used as a plate, which, frankly, is ridiculous) and it was time for Mythos: Heroes. This centred round Heracles, the circumstances of his birth, the 10 labours (later extended to 12) and him freeing Prometheus and the two of them fighting with the Gods against the Giants. Another two rounds of Mythical Pursuit and a choice of which of the labours we would be told about. I did ask a question of the Oracle this time, but mine wasn’t chosen. After the show, I had a couple of lints in the hotel bar and went to bed.
On Monday, I obviously had time to spare, so I decided to go to the Metrocentre. Honestly? Once you get past the size of the place, it’s an ordinary shopping centre. Not that impressive. I did, however, see a vending machine for false eyelashes. Seriously. I got myself a couple of bottles of Scottish craft lager, discovered what I’m getting dad for his birthday (craft beer brewed in whisky casks, perfect for a guy who likes both) and also got myself the War Doctors sonic screwdriver. Because, why not?
Quick map at the hotel, then it was time for Mythos: Man. This focused on the Torjan War and the journey of Odysseus. Last two rounds of Mythical Pursuit, choosing one part of the journey of Odysseus to hear about and more questions. Including mine. Fry also confirmed that he is writing the third book I knew was coming and it’ll likely be called Troy.
Then, back to the hotel bar. Where I sent a tweet. And, well, this happened:


Which is slightly surreal.
Today, I had breakfast at the hotel (not worth the cost), checked out, bought peanut butter M&M’s (at the recommendation of @heffay, though I haven’t tried them yet) and came home.
And now I’m going for a swim (though I got plenty of exercise, if I’m going to be serious about swimming at least once a week, I have to actually be serious about it) and catch up on my shows.

Innit absolutely adorable?
As you can tell from my last entry, I finished reading The Testaments.  It’s good.  It’s very good.  My plan was to read it quickly but the prose was so gorgeous that I just couldn’t do it.
As you can also tell from my last entry, I watched Undone.  It’s an Amazon Prime series made using rotoscoping (where they film live action and animate on top of it).  It’s dreamy, it’s trippy and it’s a show that makes you think.  Highly recommend it.
I also watched Unbelievable, which is only made more heartbreaking by the fact that it actually happened.  Merrit Weaver is fantastic and Kaitlyn Dever is a million miles away from her role in Booksmart but really shows her acting chops.  I’m currently reading the article the series is based on.  It’s a tough read.  I’ve also ordered the book, as the true crime geek I am.
Tomorrow, I go through to Newcastle for the Stephen Fry Mythos shows.  Very much looking forward to that.
No swimming this weekend.  I had to wait in for a delivery today and tomorrow, of course, is Newcastle.  Might go on Tuesday after I get home.

I finally got the cross stitch my friend gave me for my birthday last year framed. Here’s a close up:

It’s not been done the way that cross stitch is usually framed as my friend didn’t leave enough material for it to be stretched properly. Still looks good though.
I went to the fitness centre in town that has the swimming pool today. Absolutely night and day difference. I was right, the shorter pool length does make swimming lengths easier. Plus, it’s not as busy. In fact, for the last part of my swim I was the only person there. Which meant I wasn’t pushing myself too hard to try and keep up and I felt less pressure about taking breaks. I established a routine of swimming for about 10 minutes then resting in the spa. Definitely going to be joining up, it’ll be well worth it.
Afterwards I went to the Town Meal, got my free food and also bought a couple of things:

The keyring is made from wood from the top of the Transporter Bridge. And I couldn’t resist the bookmark. Look how cute it is!

I wandered round town, then came home.
I’m currently reading The Testaments by Margaret Atwood. This is the sequel to The Handmaids Tale. It’s really, really good. I was planning on reading it quickly, but Atwoods writing is far too beautiful to do that.
Monday or Tuesday my mum and dad are coming through. They’re in Gateshead for my niece’s birthday.

I know, I know, I said no more politics for a while.  But no-one saw this coming…
One of the things I forgot to mention in my last entry was the court case.  Today, the High Court in Scotland ruled on the appeal against the decision that the prorogation of Parliament was legal.  The reason I forgot about it is because it was widely expected that the High Court would rule against the appeal.  It would then be appealed the the Supreme Court, where it would be combined with the case from England and the one in Wales.
At 10am, the ruling came back.  The High Court ruled that the prorogation of Parliament was illegal on the basis that the Government lied to the Queen for the reason for proroguing.
Not sure if this is  more cat meet pigeon or excrement meet fan.
The Government has, as expected, appealed the decision to the Supreme Court and the three cases will be heard next Tuesday.
Beyond that, no-one seems to know what’s happening.  The opposition parties have been saying that Parliament should be reconvened immediately on the basis that it should never have been suspended to begin with.  The Tories are saying nothing has actually changed until the Supreme Court rules.
Meanwhile, Boris Johnson has added another first to his list.  He’s the first Prime Minister to have a court say has lied to a monarch.
Oh, and today was the release of the prorogation and Operation Yellowhammer documents as demanded by the Humble Address Parliament voted for on Monday.
The prorogation documents didn’t appear as the Government did’t think it was fair they were requested.
Now, I’ve just realised that I haven’t actually explained what Operation Yellowhammer is.  It’s the Government assessment for how bad No Deal will be.
Now we did get something.  5 pages, outlining how bad things were going to be.  This is in no way what was actually asked for.  Not only that, but a journalist to whom Operation Yellowhammer was originally leaked has said the title has changed from being the base line prediction to being worst case.
So, the shitshow from that is coming when Parliament returns.  Whenever that happens to be.

So, I wasn’t going to do another political entry this soon. But then @sleepygene said he was expecting one. So, here it is.
Yesterday was a quiet day in Parliament. Not much happened.
I am, of course, just pulling your leg there. It was a big day.
The first thing that happened was the anti No Deal bill got Royal Ascent and became the law of the land. Now, this is important, because Boris Johnson has said he would rather be dead in a ditch than ask the EU for an extension. If he doesn’t ask for the extension, though, he’s breaking the law.
Now, there was the idea that he could send the extension request along with a side letter asking the EU to ignore it, but it turns out that won’t be possible.
Then John Bercow gave an 8 minute speech in which he announced that he would be stepping down as Speaker of the House after the next election or on October 31st, whichever happens to be first. This was followed by him getting a standing ovation from everyone but the Government front bench. They don’t like him because he’s more keen on letting the House have their say than letting the Government do whatever they wanted.
This was followed by a couple of motions under SO24. Thwe first of these was in the form of a Humble Request. This is an ancient device, resurrected by Kier Starmer, Shadow Brexit secretary, to compel the release of documents. This was was by Dominic Grieve, one of the Tory rebels who lost the whip last week. It compelled the release of documents relating to the prorogation of Parliament and Operation Yellowhammer. It was very thorough. It named specific people and called for the release of documents, both private and public, from a variety of sources including Facebook and WhatsApp.
There was the debate, then the vote which the Government lost. The documents should be released tomorrow 11am.
The second one is quite bizarre, it was compelling Government to comply with the law. This was, of course, in relation to the PM’s dead in a ditch comment. It didn’t even go to a division, going through on a voice vote.
Then, after another couple of bits that needed to be done, the PM again tabled a motion calling for an early General Election. Johnson was on something. He was either drunk or on drugs, but there was absolutely no way he was sober. The debate went pretty much the same as the last one. As did the vote. Yay won, but didn’t get enough votes for the election.
For the record, that means that Johnson has lost his first six votes as PM. Which, in itself is a record. No PM has ever done that before. In fact, in 6 days Johnson has lost more votes in Parliament than Maggie Thatcher lost in 11 years as PM.
Then it switched to the Lords for the proroguing. The House of Lords was basically empty. There was a royal commission, normally made up of 5 members of the House, but there were only 3 as Labour and the Lib Dems didn’t take part. They instructed Black Rod to go to the Commons and summon the MP’s.
Now, what usually happens is that Black Rod walks across to the Commons, gets the door slammed in her face, knocks three times, is admitted and announced, informs the speaker that the Commons is needed in the Lords, then the Speaker leads the MP’s through.
Not this time, however.
This time, Black Rod walked through to the Commons, door slammed in face, knocks, enters, announced, says that the Commons is needed in the Lords and there’s a huge shout of “NO!”
John Bercow doesn’t move.
Then, after the Sargent at Arms is called for, Bercow speaks. He says he’s happy to play his part, but this is not a normal prorogation, some MP’s see it as an act of electoral fiat and he will not force MP’s to the Lords if they do not wish to go. Some MP’s made their way to beside the Speakers chair, try to stop him getting up and hold up signs saying “Silenced”. He leads the Tory and DUP MP’s out to a chant of “Shame on you”.
Royal Ascent was given to one outstanding bill. The Queens Speech was read out. Parliament was officially announced as being prorogued and the MP’s left. Bercow announces to the Commons what has just happened.
And that’s it. For the next 5 weeks. As I said, tomorrow is supposed to be the document release. Then we have the party conferences. After that? Nothing until October 14.
So this really should be my last political entry for a while.

Yesterday was week 2 of swimming. It went better than last week, but only slightly. There’s a fitness centre in town that has a smaller swimming pool. I’m going to get a free day pass and give it a shot. See what happens.
Tomorrow, I’m meeting my best friend in town. Her and her lad are planning to go to the England Woman’s game at the Riverside next month and I’ve decided to join them. So, tomorrow we’re heading up to get the tickets. Yeah, I don’t really have an interest in England playing Brazil, but I am interested in hanging out with my best friend for a bit and the tickets are only £7.50. So, I’ll go and probably be the only person to watch an England match at the stadium while wearing a Cove Rangers top.
I’m getting a provisional driving license. I don’t need one, I’ll never ever actually learn how to drive (to be frank, the idea fucking terrifies me) but the DWP have decreed that I need one. They are paying the £43 fee to the DVLA. I, on the other hand, am expected to pay the £6 for the photos, the £5.38 fee for the postal order and the £1.90 to get it sent signed for (hey, my birth certificate is in there, I’m not sending it through normal post). You’d better believe that I’m asking for as much of that money back as I can get. Don’t see why I should pay out of my own pocket for something I don’t want and won’t even remember having in 6 months.
Sigh.
I’m binge watching the first two seasons of The Deuce in preparation for season 3 starting. Hence the title.
Pics!
I finally got a pic of all 11 book benches in Middlesbrough. Here they are:
          
And here, as previously posted in the entry of much pics from Aberdeen, are all the Oor Wullie’s I got:

I know, I know, another political entry. But I thought I’d just wrap up the week.
By the way, the title is our Prime Ministers full name.
On Monday, Hillary Benn tweeted out the cross party bill he was hoping to introduce to the House to prevent a No Deal Brexit. As a piece of legislation, it is a work of art. It leaves Johnson absolutely no wiggle room, even writing the letter Johnson has to deliver to the EU asking for an extension. This was accompanied by an announcement that there would be an effort under Standing Order 24 for the Commons to seize control of the order paper on Wednesday from the Government so this bill could be debated.
This was followed by a speech by Johnson. In this speech, he said nothing except that he didn’t want a General Election. During this speech, due to it being held outside 10 Downing Street, you could clearly hear people chanting “Stop the coup”.
At the same time, it was being briefed that Johnson was going to call for a General Election, to be held on October 14th. It was also briefed that any Tory MP’s who voted against the Government in the SO24 vote would lose the whip*.
Tuesday saw Parliament return from the summer recess and the start of Johnsons first full week as PM in the Commons. It started with a statement from him about the G7 summit. During this speech, one of the Tory MP’s, Peter Lee, literally crossed the floor and joined the Liberal Democrats, reducing the Governments working majority to zero.
Then came the SO24 debate. During this, Jacob Rees-Mog, Leader of the house and nicknamed the Honorable Member for the 18th Century, was widely criticised for lying down on the front bench.
Then there was the division. When the votes were counted, the Government lost 328 – 301, making Johnson the first Prime Minister since Pitt the Younger to lose their first Commons vote. Sure enough, he said he would call for a General Election the next day.
21 Tory MP’s rebelled. All 21 were kicked out of the party. This further reduced their “majority” to -43. Included in the 21 were Ken Clarke, Father of the House and well respected parliamentarian, Nicholas Soames, grandson of Johnsons hero Sir Winston Churchill, Phillip Hammond, Chancellor of the Exchequer under Theresa May and Rory Stewart, rising star in the party who found out by text while accepting the GQ Politician of the Year award.
Wednesday was a busy day. It started, as Wednesdays always do, with Prime Ministers Questions. Or, to be more accurate this week, Prime Ministers Evisceration. It was absolutely brutal as MP after MP stood up to have a go.  The absolute highlight was this question from Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi

Then there was the debate on the Benn bill.  A slight bit of bizarreness here as one ammendment, calling for the current Working Arrangement (the one that has been rejected 3 times already) was approved as the Government didn’t provide tellers to count the Nay votes.  Eventually, the bill passed 327 – 299.  Second vote, second loss for Johnson.
Then there was the debate on the General Election motion.  And back to kicking Johnson.  Highlights included Ken Clarke sounding like a parent who isn’t angry, just very, very upset and the speech by Jess Phillips.
This one went 298 – 56.  So, that’s a win for Johnson, right?  Well, not so fast…
This one was done under the Fixed Term Parliament Act.  Under said act, a General Election will be held every five years.  There are only two ways two hold a General Election earlier than that.  The first is if there’s a Vote of No Confidence in the Government and no-one else can form a Government that could have the confidence of the House within 14 days.  This needs a simple majority.
The second was to pass a motion calling for a new GE.  This route was the one taken by Johnson, gambling that the other parties wouldn’t be able to vote against.  Especially Labour, who had been calling for a GE for months.
Except the other parties smelled a trap.  Though Johnson was saying he wanted a GE on Oct 14th, it was possible he would then change the date to after Halloween, meaning hard Brexit.  So, Labour abstained (which was a good move) and the Government won.
So, that’s it, right?  Upcoming General Election.  Well, not so fast.  For a GE to be held under a motion calling for one, it needs to pass with a 2/3rds majority.  Not of the MP’s who take part in the vote.  Of every single MP.  This includes the Speaker, who doesn’t vote, and Sin Fein, who don’t even take their seats in the House on ideological grounds.  Which means it needed to pass by a minimum of 433 votes.  Which it clearly didn’t.
This means that Johnson is the first PM ever to lose their first three votes in the Commons.
There was chat that the Lords would filibuster the Benn bill until the proroguation and txhe bill would die.  Early Thursday morning, it was announced that this would not happen.  The Lords started debating the bill on Thursday.
Then it was announced that Business Secretary would be resigning as a minister and stepping down as an MP at the next election.  Does the surname sound familiar?  That’s because Jo Johnson is the brother of the PM.  Furthermore, he stated that the reason for doing this was the tension between family loyalty and the national interest.
Ouch.
Johnson (Boris, not Jo) made a speech on front of police recruits.  He started an hour late, saw a cadet pass out behind him and as for the speech?  Well, I’d call it rambling and incoherent except that would be an insult to things which are rambling and incoherent.  It was, to be blunt a fucking shitshow.  In addition, the fact that he would be giving a speech like that at the event, leading to more criticism.
Today, the Benn bill passed the Lords.  It was also announced that it would receive Royal Assent, meaning it will become law.  It was also announced that Monday would see another call for a GE.  The thinking is that with the Benn bill passed, there’s no reason for the other parties not to vote for.  Except they’ve already said they will until the extension is requested before granting a GE.
And there we have it.

*As I’ve been asked this before, when an MP loses the whip from a party, they are no longer considered members of that party and are now independent MP’s. Unless they choose to join another party. They can also not run for re-election as a member of said party.

Yes, it’s another political entry. No, I’m not apologising.
Today was the debate and votes on the anti No Deal bill. There were a few amendments.
One amendment passed. Why? The Government didn’t supply any tellers for the Nay lobby. This means those votes couldn’t be counted. Meaning the votes for the Ayes won.
This is one of the ways stuff is done in my country.
In case you’re wondering, between PMQ’s and the speeches about the GE vote motion, Boris Johnson has been beaten up so badly I’m surprised it’s actually legal.
Oh, and 21 Tory MP’s had the whip withdrawn last night for voting against the Government.  These include the Chancellor of the Exchequer under Theresa May, the Father of the House, the grandson of Winston Churchill (Johnson’s hero) and one who found out by text while accepting the GQ Politician of the Year award.

258,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/null-and-void-update-5506115/,2019-09-03,Null and void *UPDATE*,"
Yeah, it’s another political entry.
In British politics, we have the phrase “Crossing the Floor”. This is when an MP leaves the party of which they are currently a member, usually to join another party or to sit as an independent.
Nowadays, it’s usually done by the MP tweeting out a statement and a pic of their letter of resignation and, if happening, their new party tweeting as well.
Today, while the PM was making a statement about the G7 summit, a Tory MP literally crossed the floor and joined the Lib Dems.
Now, this is interesting and not just because he literally crossed the floor. With this defection, the Government now has a working majority of…
0.
You read that right. Even with the 10 DUP votes, the Government no longer commands a majority.
With the anti No Deal vote tonight, the possibility of mass expulsions from the Tory party and a very widely expected GE vote tomorrow, its gonna be interesting.
Will
*UPDATE* It wasn’t actually the anti No Deal vote tonight, it was the vote for Parliament to seize control of the order paper tomorrow so that vote can take place.  The Government lost 328 – 301, making Johnson the first PM since Pitt the Younger to lose their very first Commons vote.
He confirmed what we all knew, he will be tabling a motion under the Fixed Term Parliament Act to hold a General Election.  Will it pass?  Only if the anti No Deal bill passes first.  The other parties will not support a GE when there’s the risk that we’ll No Deal during the campaign.

Today, our esteemed Prime Minister held a press conference outside 10 Downing Street.  It was basically about nothing except pleading with potential Tory rebels not to vote against the Government on a bill tomorrow designed to prevent No Deal Brexit on Halloween.  He also hinted at the General Election everyone knows is coming because it has to.
He may have regretted the location though.  Very much audible throughout the whole thing were protesters chanting “Stop the coup”.

So, I’ve decided it’s time to get shot of the Buddha belly.  Can’t really call it a beer belly any more, really.
With my particular health issues, I decided that swimming would be the best idea.  After all, I used to go swimming every Sunday afternoon (advantage of living close to a public swimming pool).  OK, that was about 30 years ago, but it’ll be fine, right?  Go swimming for an hour, that’ll be easy.
Except when I went swimming as a teenager, it was more like just messing around in the pool.  I probably swam for a grand total of 10 minutes then had to give up.
Going to keep going with it, though.
Will
"
261,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/going-prorogue-5504526/,2019-08-29,Going prorogue,"
Yeah, it’s a political entry.
Last time I did one of these, it ended with Boris Johnston being elected leader of the Tory party and, therefore, Prime Minister (or Britain Trump, I’ll let you guess who said that).  I said it was the new stage of the shitshow.  Turns out I was more right than joking.
He immediately started banging on about renegotiating the Working Arrangement, mostly to take out the backstop (that we wanted in the first place).  He did get an agreement from Angela Merkel that things would be considered if he was able to come up with a workable alternative by mid September.
The rest of the parties have been working as well, trying to find a way to stop No Deal Brexit.  The big idea is a Government of National Unity.  This would be a cross party Government which would do two things and two things only.  The first is to get another extension from the EU.  The second is to call a General Election.
Would we get the extension?  It’s very probable.  The EU has always said they would grant another extension for a determined reason and another GE is just that.
The main problem with a GNU is who the temp PM would be.  Labour are very clear on this.  As the leader of Her Majesty’s Official Opposition, it must go first to Jeremy Corbyn.  The Liberal Democrats (well, their leader anyway) and Tory rebels are against the idea of Corbyn going into a General Election from the position of PM.
The problem is, he’s the one with the most votes at the moment.  Every Labour MP would vote for him.  The SNP, Plaid Cymru and Caroline Lucas, the sole Green MP, would as well.  Some of the Lib Dems would if it meant stopping No Deal.
Some have suggested Harriet Harman as Mother of the House (longest serving female MP), but she’s said that it should be Corbyn.  The other suggestion is Ken Clarke.  He’s a Tory, which would get their rebels on board, he’s the Father of the House (longest serving male MP) and he’s already said he’s not running in the next GE so he wouldn’t use the position to boost his election chances.  But, there are some Labour MP’s who wouldn’t vote for a Tory and there are some who wouldn’t vote for Clarke, given he was a member of Maggie Thatchers cabinet.  So, would the number of Tory rebels he would carry be more than the number of Labour MP’s that wouldn’t vote for him?
Then there’s the question of if a Vote of No Confidence would pass anyway…
So, there was a big meeting on Tuesday, the result of which was a decision to try legislative means to prevent No Deal.
Enter our “esteemed” Prime Minister and the process of proroguing.
Now, proroguing is basically just suspending Parliament.  This is generally done for a few days before a Queens Speech, but it has been done for other things as well.
(Should explain a Queens Speech.  It starts each legislative session of Parliament and usually happens once a year.  Because of Brexit, however, the last one was after the GE in 2017.)
When the idea of proroguing Parliament came up before, it was in terms of suspending Parlaiment from early – mid October to the beginning of November to ensure a No Deal Brexit.
Yesterday, Boris Johnston announced there would be a Queens Speech in October.  And, as such, he was proroguing Parliament.  From early September.  For five whole weeks.
Now, it is true that includes the period of conference season, when Parliament is normally on recess, but it was possible that recess would be suspended.  So, for five weeks, there will be no scrutiny of Government, there will be no chance for legislation to prevent No Deal, there will be no chance for a VoNC.  Even after this, there would need to be a debate and a vote on the Queens Speech and Delirium alone knows how long that’ll take.
This has, quite rightly, caused quite a lot of outrage.  For all the talk about taking control back to Parliament, it’s quite simply preposterous that Parliament isn’t going to be allowed to meet and prevent huge damage being done to the country.  It’s outrageous that the voices of the people will not be heard in order to stop something that most did not vote for and do not want to begin with.
This is not democracy, it’s basically just short of a fucking dictatorship.
The Government whip in the House of Lords, a guy who has served in every Tory front bench since John Major was PM has resigned his position over this.  Even worse for the Tories, Ruth Davidson quit as leader of the Scottish Conservative Party.  While she said the reason was to spend time with her family, it’s no secret she’s not a fan of the PM and it’s easy to see he’s also part of the reason.  The timing suggests it’s also about the proroguing.
This is particularly bad for the Tories, because she’s the only reason they have any relevancy in Scotland at all.  It’s all been her.  Now, with the Lib Dems being the obvious pro Union option (their anti Brexit stance will work well in a country where 66% of the EU ref vote went to Remain), losing her will hurt them.
What’s that Chinese curse about interesting times again?

My new backflow incense burner.  Hopefully, I’ll get a pic of it working properly later.
So, my journey home was an… experience.  I was running late to leave for the station, so I decided to get a taxi.  Got to the train station and discovered that I had left my phone at home.  I flew through the underpass, straight into the only taxi there and asked him to get me home and back as soon as possible.  The driver asked what I had forgotten, what time my train was and what train it was (so he knew which platform to drop me off at) and got me home and back in 10 minutes, still giving me plenty of time.
The train to Darlington was fine.  Then I went to get onto the train from Darlo to Aberdeen.  Only to discover that the carriage I had book my seat on was missing.  Completely.  I was told to take my seat in another carriage and it’d be fine, which it was.  Until the person who had reserved that seat from a different station got on board.  Plus the train was delayed, but by one minute short of the cut off for me to be able to claim a partial refund.  Mum and dads car is off the road, so you’d better believe I stopped off for a couple of pints before catching the bus.
Friday, I needed to go to pick up my Cove Rangers top.  Thankfully, I was able to get a bus right round from close to the house.  It was then that I discovered that, if you’re paying through contactless one bus company in Aberdeen cares not for actual fares.  Someone is getting ripped off and that day I suspect it was them.
Found my way to the Cove staduim, only to find the manager casually chilling in reception messing around on his phone.  Wouldn’t get that at Aberdeen or Middlesbrough, I can assure you.
Then I got the bus back into town and went looking to get pictures of Wullies.
No, no, not like that.  Get your mind out of the gutter.  Oor Wullie is a Scottish cartoon character best known for sitting on a bucket.  In five Scottish cities, there are specially decorated statues of Wullie and so I was getting pics of them.  I also got some stuff I was needing.
Saturday was the NuArt walking tour.  NuArt is a festival of street art in the city, now on its third year.  The actual festival was months ago, but they’re still doing the tours.  Lover of street art as I am, I did the tour and was joined by my sister.  She wanted to do the tour and the fact it got her out of taking my nephew to a birthday party was a bonus.  It was interesting, the art is brilliant and the stories were varied.  There was other stuff happening in the city centre that day, so the poor guide was occasionally struggling to be heard above everything else.
Sunday was spending time with my nephew, which is always fun.
Monday I went to Hazlehead Park, which is near my parents house.  There were another couple of Wullies there, along with a wood carving of the Gruffalo and child and cairns about Robert the Bruce, with a wood carving of a spider.
Today was back to Boro.  I finally got the bus into town, then I got on the train (which this time had an extra carriage) and sat in First Class for the first time ever.  I may well splurge on that again.  loads of leg room and free food and drink the whole way.
My train was late getting into Darlo for the single best reason I’ve heard.  The train was stuck behind a freight train between Newcastle and Durham.
Then I got home and picked up the dragon.
Lack of pics in this entry?  Wait a couple of hours, I’m going to post an entry with a lot of pics.  And I do mean a lot.

First of all, thank you all for the notes on my last entry.
My entry pic is what happens when you discover that your blue shirt hasn’t been washed enough not to run.
I have my tablet back!  I got the text and the email telling me it was back at the shop on Friday and I picked it up on Saturday.  The problem is gone!  I did think briefly think it was still there on Sunday, but it turns out it’s the old, old charger I was using.  I’ve had it for years, but it’s time for it to go.
Then I went to Mela.  It’s kind of a big deal here.  They have a big two day thing in one of the parks.  On the way in, I saw this:

I was also playing appropriate sounds.
I had a wander round and there was a phone booth where I could make a piece of art.  Can never resist doing these, so:

I also had a 99, cos it was hot.
Then back home and reinstalling apps on my tablet.  I also got round to installing the Amazon video app.  I found out they have Chromecast support (not that I need it, but it’s nice to have the option.  I also have the ability to download videos to watch offline.  So, I’ve already downloaded the entire second season of Cloak and Dagger for Thursday.
It looks like the red on my new tat is going to turn out pink.  I’ll wait until it fully heals, but I can see me going back to get it sorted.
Yesterday, I watched the first episode of Why Women Kill (enjoyable, but obviously by the creator of Desperate Housewives) and the first two episodes of On Becoming a God in Central Florida (excellent title, excellent show).  Right now, I’m watching the new episode of Succession.
My plans are relax the next couple of days, then up to Aberdeen.  I’m going to be doing the Nuart walking tour with my sister (mum told me last night sis wants to come along, which is cool with me) and go get my Cove Rangers top.
And this seems like as good a place as any to stop.

I’ve just got off the phone with my mum and she gave me bad news.
Her dog Tia died in her sleep on Sunday.
It’s not a huge shock, she’s not been in good health for a while.  She was about 15 years old (no-one is really sure).  She survived cancer, she survived more than a few diets.
I’ll miss her.  I’ll miss her futile attempts to beg food from me.
It’s going to be weird.  Mum and dad have already decided not to get another dog.  Mum doesn’t like small dogs and they are both in their 70’s, so it wouldn’t really be fair.  But it’s going to be weird going back to a dogless house.  The first since before I was born.

The Knife Angel. There was a knife amnesty and all of the knives surrendered (over 100,000) were sent to the British Ironworks Centre who, under the guidance of sculptor Alfie Bradley, turned them into the angel. It’s on display in Middlesbrough at the moment. It’s incredibly made and an absolutely powerful piece of art.
Many thanks for all the answers on my last entry, they were interesting.  If you don’t know what I’m mithering on about, go back, check it and add your opinion if you wish.
My tablet is away to computer hospital :¬( It wasn’t recognising anything plugged into the USB port and it would only charge when the battery was completely and utterly dead and would stop charging if the tablet was switched off. So, off it goes to be fixed. It could take up to two weeks, but I’m hoping it’ll be back sooner because I would like to use it when I head home. So, fingers crossed.
Tattoos healing up nicely. I have had to buy a pair of shorts, though. Haven’t worn shorts in decades, so that’s fun.

Every weekday morning, I listen to James O’Brien.  I always did listen to Mystery Hour (which is also available as a podcast, which I highly recommend you listen to), but I found I was basically listening to most of his shows from being posted other places so just started listening live.
Earlier this week, he had a really interesting topic under discussion.  It’s about a blood test that you can have which could diagnose Altzheimers 20 years before you get it.
So, the question was: bearing in mind that at the moment there is no cure for the disease, would you get the test?  Would you be willing to live your life knowing you will get something that may not be cured?
For my part, the answer is yes.  Even though I may not be cured, they might be able to use me while I’m alive to develop a cure for future generations, which is a good thing to do.
I will say that I don’t think there is a particular right or wrong answer to this question.  I’m not going to judge you if your answer is different to mine because it is something that, at the core, is incredibly personal.
So, what would you do?

So, yeah, got the hair cut.  The recent heatwave just reminded me it needed done.
FSM I wish I could grow long hair, but it defies gravity.
The shades are because I realised I hadn’t shown them to you.
So, I’m trying to decide what to get my mum for her birthday.  Normally, I’d just get as book, but I’m on a kick this year where I’m not going to resort to my backup of getting everyone a book.
I have thought about geeing her a backflow incense burner, because I think she might like it, but I’m not sure if she’ll be offended that I think the house smells (it doesn’t) and I’m not going to be there on her actual birthday, so I’ll have to explain how it works over the phone.
And that’s about it from me, it’s not like I got a new tattoo or anything.
Oh, wait, I did do that, didn’t I?

My Frank Turner tattoo.  By far the biggest I ever got.  I did fuck up one of the numbers.  Whenever anyone says about getting a tattoo with writing, I always say to triple check it’s right.  I’m letting the mistake stand as proof that one should practise that which one preaches…

Got a phone call from the tattoo studio today.  The artist doing my new ink has transport issues and, therefore, can’t get in.
So, I’m not getting it done today.  It’s been postponed til next Saturday.
I swear to Bob, this damn tattoo is cursed.

You see, I had a plan.
I had to go into town yesterday for an appointment.  My plan was to then go to pick up my prescription, fill it then go home.  And subsequently spend Monday in the house.
I had a plan.  It was a good plan, it was a plan that would work.
Except for one thing.
Wednesday and Thursday were intolerably hot.  So hot, in fact, it caused a power cut in the shopping centre where my doctors is both days.  Friday?  They be shut.
Bugger.
Thankfully we had thunder and lightning on Friday which not only broke the heat, it cleared the air and made it less muggy.  Life is now tolerable.
I was thinking about seeing about getting my Frank Turner tattoo when I noticed on FB that an artist at my favourite parlour had a cancellation.  I messaged them to ask about getting booked in, sent across the design and heard nothing.  I had to go into town anyway, so I stopped in to find out what was happening.  Turns out the artist thought what I wanted wasn’t my style, but there was another artist could help me.  I spoke to him, firmed up what worked for us both, paid the deposit.
Thus, I be getting new ink on the morrow.
Then I met up with my best friend and her lad.
So, this all happened last night.  The three of us have had our health issues recently and, as a result, we haven’t seen each other in ages.  I actually think it’s been about a year.
Nikki was moaning to me over text about the temperature last night and I said, semi jokingly, that she could always go down the pub today for a nice cooling pint or two.  She liked the idea, her lad agreed and thus we met.
It was fun.  Nikki gave me a Ravenclaw scarf she made for me, a Ravenclaw keyring and some HP pin badges, one of which says Ravenclaw.  (Bet you can’t guess what house I’m in?)
And we just chatted about shit both important and nonsensical.  I may have waxed lyrical about the show Pandora (seriously, I’m hooked because it’s so fucking awful).
Nikki was off the booze.  Not for medical reasons, just because she is.  Which, for me, is fine.  I wasn’t hassling her to drink.  Sober Nikki is no less fun than drunk Nikki, it’s her choice, she wasn’t lecturing me not to drink.  Kev was for most of the time, but he did have a pint at the end.
I just don’t get these people who think they have no choice but to force others to drink if they don’t want to.  Even if they used to drink.  Why?  Are you that superficial or insecure that you think everyone needs to booze?
Might help that I smoke and most of my friends don’t.  I would never pressure them to smoke, why is alcohol different?
Nikki’s lad did mention alcohol free cider, which we all agreed it would be about the same drinking fizzy apple juice.
So, yeah.  Had fun with my best friend and this time tomorrow I’ll have another leg tattoo.  Impressive for someone who thought he’d have no leg tattoos ever.

More politics on an absurdly hot day.
The new Lib Dem leader was announced yesterday.  This was a bit of a boring election and, as expected, Jo Swinson won.
The more interesting one was announced today.  That being the new leader of the Conservative Party and, therefore, Prime Minister.
The rules, as expected, were changed so the Parliamentary Conservative Party could whittle down to the final two.  There were accusations of gerrymandering.  The theory is that Boris Johnson had so much support that he was able to get people to vote for other candidates to ensure that he faced the person he chose in the final two, when it went to the membership.
The final two were Johnson (as expected) and Jeremy Hunt.  The result was never in doubt, just the margin of victory.
Then, Boris ran into a few, shall we say, public relation issues.  There was the argument with his girlfriend that was so loud the neighbours recorded it.  There was the bizarre admission that he liked to paint wine boxes to be busses.  And there was the kipper incident.
Not that it actually mattered.  Boris Johnson won the election by over 60% of the vote.
So, what does this mean?
Well, he’s said we will be out of the EU by Halloween come what may.  Even if it means no deal.  He had mentioned proroguing Parliament.  Basically, this is a way of suspending the House.  The idea is that he would prorogue in the middle of October, wait until November 1st then announce his intention to hold a General Election.
Fortunately, that’s been blocked.  Sort of.  A bill went through concerning working towards getting the Northern Irish parliament back up and running and the deadline is late October.  There was an amendment added onto the bill calling for both Houses to be given weekly updates, with added debate time.  Even if Parliament is prorogued, they would have to be brought back for this and if they are there regardless, may as well look at ways of preventing No Deal.
(Other amendments to the bill mean that if Stormont is not back in session by the October deadline then same sex marriage is legalised and abortion is decriminalised.)
Our new PM is also determined that he will go back to the EU and renegotiate the Withdrawal Agreement.  But there’s a slight problem.  The EU has been saying ever since December that the WA is the only deal we can possibly get given the red lines we put in place and, indeed, tweeted almost as soon as the announcement was made that this remained the case.
So, what now?
Tomorrow, Theresa May takes part in her last Prime Ministers Questions, after which she will go to meet the Queen and tender her resignation as PM.  After that, Boris will be invited to Buck House and be invited to form a new Government.  Then he puts his Cabinet together.
Boris Johnson gets what he’s always believed he is entitled to.  He will officially be Prime Minister.
After that?
There’s always the threat of a Vote of No Confidence.  If Jeremy Corbyn calls it, it will automatically happen.  If anyone else does, it’s up to the Speaker, though he likely will allow it to go ahead.
Would it pass though?  At the moment, the Tories have a majority of 2.  It’s expected that all of the opposition parties, including the DUP, would vote No Confidence.  But what of the Tories?  There’s quite a few who are not happy about PM Johnson and especially No Deal.  Most of them would not actually vote against the Government, probably choosing instead to abstain.  But then there’s the like of Ken Clarke, who doesn’t have to worry about retribution, or MP’s who don’t care who might vote NC.
Either way, I can see the motion passing.  Which means a mad scramble to try and form a new Government, by any of the parties, that can command the confidence of the house within 2 weeks.  When that doesn’t work, it’s the General Election that was all but inevitable.
Then?  Who knows.
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the latest act of the shitshow.

Yesterday, I went to an art thing at the town hall. We were surrounded by screens that images were projected onto while music (well, more like discordant sounds) was being played. Despite how it sounds, it was actually quite interesting.
There was someone there with a child in a buggy and the kid kept talking and giggling during the piece. I could see that one of the performers was enjoying that and at the end he went and gave the kid a round of applause.
Last night I went to see Midsommar. It’s a good film, but there’s not many out and out scares. It’s more like The Wicker Man then Nightmare on Elm Street.
I’m still utterly obsessed with my new incense burner. I got new cones yesterday, but they’re not very good.
I had a plan. I was rewatching a couple of episodes of Veronica Mars a day, to get through the whole thing before the new season dropped this coming Friday. It was a good plan, it was an achievable plan.
Then Hulu dropped the whole season a week early as a birthday present to Kristen Bell. And me, being me, can’t resist, I’m watching it now. Then I’ll be getting back to what this weekend was supposed to be about, binge watching the new season of Queer Eye.

Last time I saw the bloke from Working Links, he signed me up for voluntary work.  Gardening in a cemetery.  Now, it’s not the cemetery bit I object to, it’s the bit where I’m gardening with mild hayfever.  But, there we are.
I had a training session for it today.  While there, I was encouraged to look at the volunteering website and I saw they were looking for people to work in a library.  There we are, a bit more like it.
So, I’ve emailed and said I want to change over.
I also bought the incense burner in the pic.  Innit awesome?

Me and seeing Frank Turner live has a long and storied history.
The first time I was supposed to see Frank live was when he played the O2 Academy in Newcastle with his sort of side project Mongol Horde.  I had a ticket, I had time off work, I couldn’t arrange a lift home nor a hotel, so I had to miss it.
Then I got a ticket for show number 1989 at The Garage in Aberdeen.  This time, of course, accommodation was not an issue as I would be staying with the parents.  Unfortunately, I bought the tickets without making sure I could get time off work.  So, I had to miss it.
I also got a ticket for show 1993, again in Newcastle, this time at Northumbria Uni.  Again, couldn’t afford accommodation, couldn’t get a lift.  Sadly, I had to miss it.
Then I found out about last night.  Frank Turner headlining an outside show in Newcastle.  I got my ticket, provisionally booked a hotel and eventually found someone to give me a lift.
Wednesday, I got a ticket from the place I bought the tickets.  Due to logistical issues, the event was no longer outside, but at the O2 Academy.  Hey, still going ahead, right?
Thursday, got another email.  The gig was no longer starting at 3pm but 5pm.  Now, there were supposed to be six acts performing and that was apparently still on.  Though, obviously, it was going to be tight.  Now, I’m getting worried that it might be cancelled altogether.
Yesterday, got picked up, went to Newcastle, went for a quick pre gig pint, then to the venue.  I’ll say one thing about the O2 Academy, the lager may be expensive, but at least it’s shite.
The first act was Sean McGowan.  He got the event going with bags of energy.  He also made the first of many references to the change of venue, pointing out that, as it was raining, it was probably a good move.
Next up was hot milk.  Unfortunate name, but they fucking went hard.
Then we had Holy Moly and the Crackers.  These guys rock far, far too hard for a band with an accordion player.  They were by far my favourite of the support acts.  So much so, I bought a t shirt:

(And, no, I will not smile so don’t ask.)
Then there was Beans on Toast.  He regularly supports Frank, so it was no surprise he did so again.  It was my first time hearing him and I’m impressed.  Sings about serious subjects with humour.
The last support act were The Wildhearts.  Frank is a huge fan and came out to sing with them at one point.  I can see why he likes them, they were brilliant.
Then, the man himself.  Absolutely did not disappoint.  He was absolutely outstanding.  I sang my heart out and it was just a great communal feeling the entire set, led by Frank.  one of the best experiences of my recent life.
I stood for the entire thing and I’m not sure my legs have quite forgiven me.  I can grow new legs, right?
Pics!

This weeks theme is: Tell us about a positive influence you had in somebody else’s life.
This is easy for me.  I tend to be the person that others seek out to listen to them and offer advice/hugs/a shoulder to cry on/all of the above.  One of my friends described me as a therapist that cost him just the price of a pint.
Now, this can be a problem for me, because it seems that no-one wants to listen to my problems or think I have it together all the time.  (Which is probably why I started on this site to begin with.)
But it does mean I’ve done a lot to help them.  Whether counselling a friend on his stag night because of a family issue, making a suicidal friend feel better about themselves literally in the time it took to get a pizza delivered or taking my best friend from being in tears because she was overwhelmed to being in fits of laughter, I know I’ve put good out into the world.
And I’m going to use this entry to put out my standing offer: if you have anything you want to get off your chest, feel free to leave a private note.  I am listening.

Today is a lot cooler than the past two days.  This makes Will a happy bunny.
Last night, I went to see Endgame and then go for a couple of pints.  Happily, they had a Brewdog takeover of their guest pumps, so I was able to drink Lost Lager.
The first time I went out for a smoke, a guy who supports Trump latched onto me and decided to debate me about the president.  When he asked about why I hated Trump, I pointed out that I’m from Aberdeen and it’s mostly because of his golf course in Aberdeenshire.  Destroying a Site of Specific Scientific Interest (it’s just been announced that the dunes have officially lost this and the reason is because of the golf course), the promise to use locals in the construction and not doing so, the promise to boost the local economy which has never happened.  I never even got to him cutting off peoples water and electricity.
The guy had no answer.  Absolutely none.
(Incidentally, I’m not sure why the Dems didn’t use this during the last election and hope they have enough sense to do so in the next one.  Just the environmental damage and threatening to sue the Scottish Government over the offshore windfarm, even.)
The second time, I got to talking to a member of staff on a night out.  Turns out, I was the only bugger that ever drank a particular lager they had, which is likely why they don’t anymore.  When I went back to get another drink, he was stood at the bar and used his staff discount for me.
So, there’s that.
Went home, watched Anima again (so, so fucking good) then bed.
Today, I went shopping for supplies with the plan of tidying my kitchen.  Hence this entry.

It’s too fucking hot.  Seriously.  I’m not designed to cope with heat, I’m a creature of cold.  I’m Aberdeen born and raised, for the love of FSM.  Do you know how many days of actual summer weather I got growing up?  One day, if I was lucky.
Anyhoodle, weather rant over…
I’ve booked my tickets to go back home.  I’m going from the Thursday to the Tuesday (because the Monday is a Bank Holiday and fuck getting the train that day).  Coming back, I’m going to be in first class.  Didn’t request it, it must have been the only seat available.  If I want, I can request a meal in advance and pay on the train, which I might do just for the experience.
Mum was saying her and dad bought a smart Tv but, of course, they have no clue what they’re doing to connect it to the interwebs.
Wimbledon starts tomorrow!  The BBC’s coverage of the tournament is second to none.  I just had to retune my TV to get all the channels they are providing.
Finally got round to watching the two Paddington films last night.  they are gloriously brilliant.

(This is the entry I had hoped to write yesterday.)
I went to a special solstice screening of The Wicker man on Friday.  (Original, of course.)  The venue was supposed to be decorated as a forest, but all they really did was scatter some straw on the floor.
Despite that, it was a fun night.  I left with two animal masks and a flower garland.
I’ve still to finish watching the last season of Jessica Jones, but it’s good so far.
Bad news!  Netflix has cancelled Good Omens!  I mean, Good Omens is a Amazon Prime miniseries, but still…
I’m going home in August.  The past few years I’ve gone home August/September time when younger brother and sister in law took the bairns up.  That’s not happening this year, but I figured that doesn’t mean I can’t go up anyway.  I was hoping to be up for mums birthday but I have to sign on the Monday after, so I’m heading up the week before.
And, I’ve discovered that the organisers of the NuArt Festival are still going to be running walking trips to see the art, so I’ma gonna book meself on that.  Cos, I love me some street art.  As you guys probably know.

So, someone tried to break in to my flat last night.
I, miracle of miracles, was actually in bed and asleep at 2:30 this morning when I was awoken by loud noises at my door.  Tired, still slightly drunk, I go into the hall, look down the stairs to my front door…
And there’s part of a fucking crowbar wedged between my door and the frame.
I stood there, stunned, for a minute then I grabbed my phone and called the police.  At this point, they bugger off.
I grabbed a lager from the fridge and lit a cigarette, both to calm my nerves.  The police arrived and I couldn’t get the door opened.  Couldn’t even unlock it.  So, I talked to them through the gap that was now in my door.  I couldn’t really tell them much and they admitted that nothing would likely happen because the only description they got was two men dressed in black.  They did say they would be in the area more last night.
I finished my lager and tried to get back to sleep.
I had to get up early today anyway, so I phoned my landlord and he sent someone round to fix the door.  Soon as I got free, I spoke to the guy running the shop downstairs.  He’s got a security camera trained on my front door, so he’s going to review the footage. 
I’m fine, by the way.  Bit shaken up, but that’s to be expected really.
Two good things, though.  The first is that my UPVC door may look a tad flimsy but it’s a tough little fucker.  The second is that it’s my day to sign on, but it’s being done over the phone.  So, I didn’t have to risk a sanction by cancelling my appointment.

WARNING: THIS IS GOING TO END IN A RANT.  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED, DON’T COMPLAIN AFTERWARDS.
END OF WARNING.
There’s a painter from Boro called Mackenzie Thorpe.  And on of his paintings is called Waiting for Me Dad.  It’s based on him waiting for his dad to cross the Transporter Bridge after work.  Now, a sculpture based on that painting is now, temporarily, just beside the bridge.  (No, the rant isn’t about the fact it’s only temporary, even if I think it’s fucking ridiculous for it not to be permanent).  The main pic is the sculpture looking out to the bridge.  Here’s the other side:

And here’s the original painting:

As it happened, I was up by the Transporter yesterday to get the pics.
Now, here’s where I rave about how good Booksmart is (fucking awesome) or how good Late Night is (not quite good enough to topple Booksmart from my bast film I’ve seen this year list), or talk about getting to see The Italian Job on the big screen.
But I’m going to rant about ikkle brother.
Again.
I bought dad a bottle of Brewdog whisky and a Brewdog whisky glass as a fathers day present.  Dad is, notoriously, hard to buy for.  I actually asked mum if she thought he’d like it as a present (her reaction was, basically, duh obvviously).  And I phoned today to wish him happy fathers day and get a review of my present.  Because I knew he’d have some instantly.  (In case you#re wondering, he likes it.)
Then I spoke to my mum.  And she said that my brother would phone later, if he could be bothered.
I’ll repeat that.
My own mother was unsure if my own brother could be bothered to phone my own father on Fathers Day to wish him Happy Fathers Day.
Now, I haven’s been exactly perfect, but the five days a year I phone home (if I’m not there already) are Mothers Day, Fathers Day, mums birthday, dads birthday and Christmas Day.  It’s just basic fucking decency.
And here I have my mum wondering if my brother will actually bother.
Now, I love my brother.  He’s my brother, do I can’t help but not.
But.
But.
My mum should not be wondering if he’ll phone on Fathers Day.
Yet, it might get excused.
Cos it’s him.

Yes, it’s going to be a political entry.
There’s actually two leadership changes coming up in British politics.  Lets start with the Tories, because there’s a lot more to unpack there.
As discussed in my last political entry, Theresa May is stepping down.  In fact, Friday is her last day as Tory party leader (though she has to continue as PM for the moment).  So far, there are 13, yes, 13 candidates.  Lets have a look at some of them.
Boris Johnson, you all probably know about.  Trump is supporting Boris, which may help or hurt him.  Michael Gove is the guy who previously said he shouldn’t be leader before stabbing Boris in the back after the referendum to run.  Jeremy Hunt pretty much lives up to his rhyming slang.  He’s also the former health minister who went into 10 Downing Street during a cabinet reshuffle where he was going to be sacked and ended up with a bigger portfolio.  Matt Hancock has his own social media app (I am, of course, not making this up).  Esther McVey had to apologise in the commons for misleading them.  Dominic Raab is the former Brexit Secretary who quit the post because he couldn’t vote for the deal he was responsible for negotiating before later voting for the deal.  Sajid Javid is the current Home Secretary.  He’s just said that if he becomes PM he will increase funding for the police.  Which, of course, he can already do.  Andrea Leadsom, the former leader of the House who previously said she should be PM because she’s a mother.
Rory Stewart has come from seemingly nowhere to become one of the favourites.  He’s got quite the CV.  He speaks 10 different languages, tutored Princes William and Harry at Eton, walked across Afghanistan and may possibly have been, or still is, a member of MI6.
What does this mean for Brexit?  Well, depends on who gets in.  Approaches vary from we will leave on Halloween regardless to absolutely ruling out no deal to a single candidate advocating a second referendum with “Remain – May’s Deal – Leave” the options.  There’s also a lot of talk about renegotiation, despite the fact the EU have absolutely ruled that out for months and, indeed, just did so again.
The whole thing is going to take ages.  The Tories don’t put all of the candidate up in one vote.  The MP’s hold a series of votes.  The candidate in last place of each vote is eliminated.  This keeps going until there’s two candidates left then it goes to the membership for a postal vote.  Assuming none of the candidates drop out along the way and one MP vote a day, we’re looking at two weeks before it even goes to the members.
I’m pretty sure this is what Barnier was on about when he urged us not to waste the extension we got.
The other one is the Lib Dems.  Less drama here.  Sir Vince Cable announced a while back he would be stepping down.  Despite the surge of Lib Dem support in the local and EU elections, he’s stuck to his word.  It’s between Jo Swinson and Ed Davey and will likely end with Swinson being leader.
Now to the EU elections.  The results were announced last week.  How did it go?
The Brexit Party won the most seats.  In fact, they are the single biggest party in the new EU Parliament.  This was not unexpected.  But, does it show that the UK wants a hard Brexit?
Eeeh.
The Lib Dems also preformed very, very well.  In fact, if you combine the vote share of the pro hard Brexit parties and the pro Remain parties, the Remainers come out on top.  But it’s close.  Very close.  There’s also Labour and the Tories, which couldn’t be put into either category.
The elections were a nightmare for both the big parties, by the way.  They completely crashed.
Don’t think this’ll give any indicators for the next General Election.  For a start, the Brexit Party will actually need policies.  It’s one thing to shout about wanting a hard Brexit, but people kinda want to know what’ll they’ll do after that.
There are fun things to come out of the election.  As with all British elections, the hashtag on Twitter dogsatpollingstations which is one of the most British things ever.  Steven Yaxley-Lennon (stage name Tommy Robinson) being utterly humiliated and losing his deposit.  Two candidates in the South East, one Brexit, one Green, called Alexandra Philips getting elected.  And, well:

It turns out that the shop I talked about yesterday won’t exchange the top.  Purely because I paid using PayPal.  I need to wait until the top is back at the depot, wait for my refund them buy the thing I actually bloody wanted again.
So, I got new ink.  It’s a bit of a geek triple threat.  The eye is the logo of VFD in A Series of Unfortunate Events.  The number is the registration number of the USS Discovery.  The two combined on my ankle is a reference the The Handmaids Tale.

I had to wait in today.  I had ordered a large Scotland Women’s World Cup home top, because I prefer the collar to the one on the normal top and it was being delivered today.  Having waited in, it was finally delivered.  And they messed up the order.
I don’t mean as in they sent the away top, or the wrong size.  They had decided to send me a medium grey pullover hoodie.  The only things the two have in common are that they both have a bit of white on them and they both cover the top half of my body.
So, now I have to go into the branch in town tomorrow and get it swapped.
I did get the new Stuart MacBride book today.  My mum has a habit of buying them for me.  Before, it was OK, because they would be out around my birthday, so it would just count as a birthday present.  Then, they would come out at Easter, so mum would say it was an Easter gift, seeing as I don’t have kids that she knows.  (Now, she just gives me money.  One year, it paid for the gonk I have tattooed on my thumb.)
This time?  Apparently it’s because my birthday is close to Christmas, my brothers was the beginning of last week and my sisters is the beginning of next week.  She’s always felt sorry for me and this is a present for that.  She’s never bought me such a present before, but there you go.
So, my weekend plans are reading that, the French Open, Good Omens, the Champions League final, NXT Takeover 25 and possibly Booksmart.

I wasn’t planning on writing another political entry just yet, but the last few days have been, well, fucking bananas.
It all started on Wednesday.  This was when Theresa May announced the timeline for the fourth vote on the Working Agreement Bill.  Yup, the one that had been voted down three times before.  This time, there was mention of a possible second referendum.
Now, the idea was that would be enough to get MP’s to support the bill.  That idea kinda failed miserably.  The killing blow was delivered by Andrea Leadsom.  Her position in the cabinet was Leader of the House and part of her responsibilities was to introduce bills.  Well, she resigned Wednesday night, on the basis that she did not want to introduce a bill to the House that she does not support.
Meanwhile, the 1922 committee, the people who kinda really run the Tories, had a couple of votes about changing the process for changing leaders and sealed the results in envelopes.  These would not be opened until today, if needed.
Yesterday was, of course, the EU elections.  Not much to talk about here, the results won’t be announced until Sunday night at the earliest and the count hasn’t happened yet.  The reason for that is that the rest of the EU isn’t voting until Sunday where we vote on Thursdays for tradition reasons (I actually know why Thursday was chosen and it’s fucking ridiculous)and we can’t announce until the rest of the EU votes.
Now, it’s expected that the Brexit Party will win the most seats* of any single party.  Does that show that the people of the UK still want Brexit?  Eeeh.  It’s not about the number of seats, it’s about the vote share.  If, and only if, they get a bigger vote share than the pro-Remain, pro-Peoples Vote parties.
How likely is that?  Eeeh.  There’s three parties we’re talking about here.  The SNP are the single biggest party in the Scottish Parliament and have the biggest number of Scottish MP’s in Westminster.  The problem is if enough union supporting Scots were willing to vote for them.  The green Party are on a surge at the moment.  And the Lib Dems are the biggest Remain party in the UK and are also on a surge.  I really doubt the Brexit Party will get a bigger vote share than all three.
Then, today.  Theresa may had a meeting with the leader of the 1922 committee.  Afterwords, she spoke outside 10 Downing Street where she announced she was standing down as leader of the Tory Party as of June 7 (meaning she doesn’t get out of the State visit by the Dorito Benito for 3 – 5 June) and will remain as PM (as she has to) until her replacement has been found.
Now, there are those who say she had a difficult job to do, and that’s certainly true.  But, she did that difficult job awfully.  Between triggering Article 50 with no actual plan, the very badly timed General Election, the red lines, the refusal to compromise, “no deal is better than a bad deal” and generally messing about, it was bad.  She wasn’t that good elsewhere as well.  It’s telling that the thing that, apparently, almost made her cry in her speech wasn’t the damage that’s been done to the country, but the end of her career.
So, who is next?  To be blunt, no-one good.  The bookies favourite is Boris Johnson.  That would be the worse possible outcome.
Course, the problem for the next PM is that they’ll need to hold a General Election.  There’s no way to get any sort of deal through this Parliament, so it’ll have to be done.
Problem is, that’ll likely to be the end of their Premiership.

Just a heads up, this entry will be video heavy.
So, I’ve got my next appointment with Working Links.  So, we’ll see what happens with that.
The new Thomas Harris arrived on Tuesday.  I’ve read it already.   It’s damn good.
Spoke to my mum today.  My sister is up in Shetland for a week for work.  Whenever my nephew goes to mum and dads, my dad gives him £1 pocket money.  My nephew gave it to my sister so she could buy something for herself.  She’s going to spend it on ice cream.
This weekend is the Radio 1 Big Weekend and it’s in Boro.  Thankfully, nowhere near town centre.  Miley Cyrus is headlining the Saturday.  Not sure how she’ll cope with Boro, to be honest.
I missed the Eurovision semi finals, so went into the final blind.  And I enjoyed it more.  We came last, leading to the usual complaints it’s not about the song, it’s about Brexit.  (Hint, it’s about the song.)
None of the songs I voted for actually won :¬(  So, I’m going to post the videos here anyway.  First of all, my third favourite, the Australian song, which is delightfully odd:

Secondly, if you watch Last Week Tonight, you’ll have heard a bit of this one.  Iceland:
 

And Denmark.  My favourite.  It’s just a delightful, delightful little song, that’ll probably give you a smile:

And here’s where I rant as bit.  The first thing is the geoblocking used by the EBU.  I don’t know why it exists.  If you’re wondering why I’m not using the official videos, but fan cams from the hall.  Secondly, is the staging for some songs.  They include stuff that can be seen by the audience at home, but not the one in the hall.  I think it’s cheating the live audience.  It’s the reason for the screens in the last video, but it also affects the Australia video as part of it was designed to look like she’s floating above Earth.
Rant over.
Here’s the winner, for the Netherlands:

As warned, this is a political entry.
I want to start by talking about the local council elections.  There are the closest we get to mid term elections and, as such, are used as a barometer for how the parties are doing.
Now, traditionally the party in power loses councillors in these elections.  And the Tories did.  They were predicting they would lose up to 1,000 councillors.  This was widely seen as lowering expectations, so that when the figure was lower it could be spun as a win.  It actually lowballed things, they lost about 1,300.  However, it wasn’t good news for Labour as, going against the normal flow, also lost seats.
So, who gained?  Well, the Lib Dems, mostly.  It was their best ever local election results with them gaining over 700 councillors.  The Green party also had their best ever result.  What do the two parties have in common?  Neither wants Brexit and both support a Peoples Vote or revocation of Article 50.
So, what does this mean?  If you ask the Lib Dams or the Greens, it shows that the public want a Peoples Vote.  If you ask the Tories and Labour, it shows that the voters just want Brexit to be done.
In reality, it doesn’t show a lot.  For a start, it wasn’t every council in the country.  Just some in England and Northern Ireland.  So, there’s really no way to say what would happen in a General election.  The other thing is that UKIP are, finally, imploding (on which more later) and Change UK and the Brexit Party (on both, more later) not running any candidates at all.
Next week is the EU elections.  Yes, before you ask, the ones we weren’t supposed to be happening.
The Tories don’t seem to have really bothered with these elections.  Apart from in Scotland, where they seem to think it’s about preventing IndyRef2.
Labour are doing their fence sitting thing.
Lib Dams are running on a platform which is basically “Bollocks to Brexit”.  They’ve also pissed off the other Remain parties by saying they are the only option to send the message that we don’t want to leave.
The Greens are looking to build on the local election results.
And back to the three parties I mentioned earlier.
UKIP, as I mentioned, are in their long awaited meltdown.  They’ve gone full on Alt Right.  One of their candidates in Scotland is a guy who became infamous for teaching his girlfriends dog to give a Nazi salute on hearing the phrase “Gas the Jews”.  Yeah.  He got prosecuted for that one.  One of their candidates in the South East is known for “joking” that he didn’t find a female Labour MP rapeable.  He then doubled down on the statement, saying he would rape her if drunk enough but he didn’t think there was enough beer in the world.  So, yeah.  Meltdown.
Then there’s the Brexit Party.  Nigel Farage’s latest scam, I mean party.  They have no policies.  They will not be announcing any policies until after the election.  They do not like being asked about this, nor about things they have said before.  They are also taking donations to a maximum of £499.  Why?  Because £500 is the threshold at which they have to name names.  Because that’s not dodgy…
Then there’s Change UK.  The party previously known as The Independent Group.  First of all, they revealed their logo.  Here it is:

Yeah, they paid actual money for that.  If you think that’s bad, this is the state of their battle bus:

Where the Brexit Party are a scam, CUK are the scammed.
They also have no policies, except the two on the bus.  They keep losing candidates.  Including one in Scotland who has said he’s supporting the Lib Dems, he’s voting Lib Dems but he’s still on the ballot as it’s too late to remove his name.
Oh, and Theresa May has announced another vote on the Withdrawal Agreement next month, after which May will stand down as Tory Party leader.  Meaning that by the end of the year we will have a new PM.
And it might well be Boris Johnston.  Joy.

I find it pathetic that they need a sign like this.
I have lager.  I have Scotch.  Single malt.  Finally getting round to trying the whisky glass and the whisky stone I got at Christmas.  It’s also the first time I’ve tried sipping whisky instead of necking it.
I have accumulated a lot of whisky over the years.  Hate to say it, but my favourite is probably the English stuff.  But only because I have no Penderyn.
Update on the family stuff: mum didn’t say anything to my brother last time they talked.  Which, to be frank, was fucking predictable.  I never really thought she would, even though I know she absolutely needs to.
The guy from Working Links hasn’t phoned me yet about the thing I talked about in my last entry.  So, there’s that.
Heads up, my next entry might be political.
The new Thomas Harris book should be on its way to me soon.  Can’t wait.  Should be good.
Speaking of books, I cannot recommend This Body’s Not Big Enough for the Both of Us.  Absolutely hilarious.

I have some thinking to do.
I had an appointment with the guy who has set me up with the placement.  He said that’s still going forward and the council will be in touch with me.
But then he told me about something else.  It’s a four day course with a guaranteed interview at the end of it and he very strongly hinted that it would result in a job.
Now, I want a job and ordinarily I’d take this.  But, but, but…
It would, of course, mean giving up the placement.  The placement I really, really want to do.
But, but, but…
The placement isn’t for another five weeks and there’s no guarantee of a job at the end of it.  There basically is with the other one.
So, I’m not sure.  I’m really not sure.
Best solution I can currently think of is to wait for the placement, do that and then see if I can do the other thing afterwards.
What do you guys think?

Three years ago yesterday, I spent some time at an unmanned train station with a chicken.
Went to see Endgame on Saturday.  Wow.  Amazing.  I absolutely loved it.  Monday I watched the latest Game of Thrones.  Also amazing.
As an aside, I’m amazed that people are butthurt about the fact that a show called Game of Thrones will actually, in the end, concentrate on the fight for the titular throne.  Whodathunkit?
On Monday, I had a taster session for something Writers Block North East are doing next year.  Basically, I’ll be given a, iPad and using it make a film about my year.  Edited using iMovie.  It sounds quite interesting, but I’m not sure if I’m going to take part.
The first thing is the iPad.  Apart from the fact I don’t know how to use one (Android fanboy here, I’m not comfortable having something like that for only that use.  I’d probably forget to take it places, forget to use it and be terrified of losing it.
The second thing is iMovie.  It’s alright for what it is, but it’s incredibly basic.  I’d get very frustrated at not having the sheer range of options I’d have on a proper editing machine.
If, if, if I could convince them to let me shoot on my phone or tablet, I’d do it.  Then, I could edit it using a proper editing package and leave them none the wiser…
I don’t have to sign on for another six weeks.  Yay!  Then I’ll have a new work coach.  Boo!  My current coach is moving to a different department.  Shame, I quite like the guy.
Saturday, I’m heading through to Newcastle again.  I’m going to see Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile.  It’s not going straight to Netflix here, and Newcastle is the nearest place I can see it.  I loked to see what other films I can watch afterwards and noticed that the local Cineworld is showing Endgame on a screen that goes from wall to wall and floor to ceiling.  So, naturally, I’m going to that as well.

I wasn’t planning to write again until after I’d watched this weeks Game of Thrones.  But, having just spoken to my mum, I have to rant about my brother, my sister in law and just how fucking furious I am at them.
Now, what you need to know is that my brother has always been my mums favourite.  I’ve always known this.  My brother is mums blue eyed boy, my sister is daddy’s little princess.
Nut sometimes, they way my brother and his wife treats mum royally pisses me off.
So I talked a couple of entries ago about meeting mum and dad in Newcastle.  The reason they were down was to visit my brother, sister in law and the kids, who live in Gateshead, right next to Newcastle.  They deliberately chose to come down for Easter because the kids were on holiday from school and it’d mean getting more time with them.  They saw the kids after leaving me on the Thursday, on the Friday, not on Saturday because the kids were at a barbecue, then on Easter Sunday.  The kids were taking part in an Easter egg hunt in the street where their other grandmother lives on the Monday and mum and dad were invited to watch.
My brother phoned on the Monday to say that they weren’t invited after all.  Seemingly, mum and dad actually invited themselves and therefore they weren’t welcome.  They went round to see the kids on Monday evening, because they were going back up the road on the Tuesday, but they actually spent less time with the kids than they normally do going down during term time.
Brother and sister in law have form for this.  The reason that mum and dad have a caravan to take down to see them is because of this.  They were going to go down to spend New Year in Gateshead one time.  This made me happy, not least because I was going to get driven to Newcastle, saving me money on my rail trip.  The day before we were supposed to leave, brother phoned to say that sister in law had decided the dog couldn’t stay in the house.  It was too late to arrange kennels, so the whole thing was cancelled.
Dad has decided, and told brother and sister in law, that mum and dad are no longer taking the caravan down.  Meaning that they can’t go down until the dog dies, because she’s too old to be put into a kennel.  sister in law does not like Aberdeen.  Hence, brother and sister in law rarely go up with the kids.  Brother has said he might possibly take the kids up himself, but it would likely be once a year at best (he’s already said it’s not likely to be this year).
It fucking sucks.  They way brother and sister in law treats mum and dad is heartbreaking to me.  Up until now, mum has been happy to put all the blame on sister in law (because it could never be brothers fault), but she’s beginning to realise that brother is also at fault.  For no other reason than he lets mum and dad be treated like this, rather than putting his foot down.
Mum thinks it’s a bit catty for her to remind brother that the kids have two other grandparents.  Possibly, but it desperately needs to be said.
GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!

Happy little lava lamp!
The entry title is a quote from the film The Crow. I just picked up the graphic novel, so it’s on my mind.
I’m currently re-watching Infinity War to prepare to go see Endgame. I’m not going to see Endgame until Saturday, but still. I’m also not going to my usual cinema to see it. What? It’s three hours long and the cinema on the edge of town has reclining seats.
Ooooh! New She-Ra tomorrow!
In case you’rte wondering, Great Britain won the Fed Cup tie. All four matches were absolutely exceptional. I’ve also been watching a lot of tennis, between Amazon Prime (I get six months of Prime Video free) having the ATP tournaments and BT Sport having the WTA ones, it’s pretty much tennis all afternoon.
Hey, saves having to hunt for stuff to wear.

Did you know that “Ahoy hoy” is how Alexander Graham Bell thought everyone should answer the phone?  Now, of course, the only person who really does is Mr Burns on The Simpsons.
Thursday was a day of adventure.  I went through to Newcastle and met up with the parents.  It was lovely.  It was nice to do something other than them coming through to Boro, food, the same shops, they go home.
When they left, I went round on my own and bought the coat in the pic.  I did actually buy it to wear the same way I would wear a normal hoodie, but it’s too thick for that.  So, it’s a new coat.  Here’s the full length image:

(Incidentally, anyone got any tips for stopping OD from cropping my pics when I use them as featured images?  It’s only the ones I take myself it happens with and it’s annoying.)
Bit more wondering round, a quick pint them it was time for Life of Brian.  I got a gift pack with an article about the film, a fake cardboard beard, some stickers, a songbook and a mini poster.  The film was, as expected, brilliant.  Still absolutely hilarious to this day.  Everyone joined in on the messiah line and I got complimented on my whistle during Always Look On The Bright Side Of Life.
Then I headed home.
Beyond that, not much has been happening.  Currently watching the British team in the Fed Cup.  All three games thus far have been exceptional.  All of them have gone to three sets and the last one last night and the first one today had a player come back from well down in the last set to win the match.  Absolutely amazing.

Finished watching Wrestlemania on Saturday.  Wasn’t the best, but not bad.
Found out that Metallica have made a craft lager.  Well, they’ve teamed up with a brewery so they can make an official craft lager.  Same difference.  Might have to get my hands on some.

So, something I forgot in my last entry about the insanity that is Brexit.
The length of the delay in leaving the EU means that we have to hold elections for the EU parliament.  This is what May was desperate to avoid.  But, it’s happening.
I’d expect them to get a much bigger turnout than ever.  Now, they are done under proportional representation, which means that the dominance of the two biggest parties matter less.
It’ll definitely go along Leave/Remain.  This is bad for the Tories and Labour, who are both split on the issue.
In the pro-Remain camp, I’d expect the Lib Dems to do well.  They’ve always been pro EU and very quickly rebranded themselves as THE pro-Remain party after the referendum.
The SNP have the advantage that, while the country as a whole went narrowly Leave, Scotland went over 60% Remain.  They’ll do well.
The Independent Group, now an official party called Change UK (that’s right, they’ve gone from being TIGgers to being CUKs) will probably do nothing.  At the moment, they are a handful of MP’s.  I’m not sure they really are actually in a position to compete in the election, but we’ll see.  Can’t see them doing well.
The Greens, as much as I support them, will likely do nothing.
On the pro-Leave side, UKIP are done.  Since Farage was finally allowed to step down as leader, they’ve fallen apart and are now openly of the far right.  Likely wipeout.
Then there’s the Brexit Party.  The latest brainchild of Nigel Farage, they are likely to do well.  But that’s entirely down to the cult of personality around Farage and the decline and fall of UKIP.
It’ll be interesting.
I’ll answer the questions I got now.
@jaythesmartone asked:
Once this all passes and there is no EU for Scotland and London what will happen with the rest of the world like Canada? Will Canada have to make new tariffs for the imports and the exports? And will tourism change? IE Passports and currency?
This all depends on the type of trade deals we get.  At the moment, even if we get a deal with the EU, we will be trading with the rest of the world under WTO rules.  Which means that any tariffs we impose on goods from one country have to be imposed on everyone else (except the EU if we have a trade deal with them).  So we wouldn’t be able to, for example, offer zero tariffs on cars from Japan without offering the same to the US.  Tourism will likely not change immediately.  You’ll still need a visa.
@seablue4u asked:
I thought Brexit is what people wanted? So why don’t they just agree to leave? 
First of all, it’s not exactly what everyone wanted.  Leave won the referendum 52 – 48, which is actually within the margin of error.  Further, only two countries in the UK actually went majority Leave and 3 out of the 5 countries were in favour of Remain.  The “will of the people” line is massively overplayed.
This is why absolutely nothing can get through Parliament.  The whole thing has been ridiculously mismanaged.
Now, we could actually have left quickly after the referendum.  We still could.  All we need to do is revoke the legislation that took us in to begin with.  This is a ridiculous idea.  Not only would it be the hardest of hard Brexits, which will fuck up the economy for years, of not decades, we’d also be screwed when it comes to trade deals.  Who would trust us when we’ve shown we’re willing to ignore what we’ve agreed to and do what we want?

Yup, it’s another Brexit entry.
So, last Thursday, the Cooper – Bowles bill went to the Lords.  There was a lot of filibustering.  This led to a lot of cloture (I.E. shut the fuck up) motions.  Sadly, the filibustering worked and the bill was delayed until Monday.  (For some reason, the Lords do not sit on a Friday.)
Meanwhile, in the Commons, business was suspended for the weekend due to a severe leak in the chamber.  When I say severe, I mean bad enough that it could very clearly be heard on TV.
So, on Monday, the bill finished going through the Lords.  Back to the Commons for votes on the Lords amendments.  One of them passed, which meant that Theresa May no longer had to get the agreement of the Commons to any extension.  There were a few Commons amendments, all of which were shot down.  (One was backed by the Government, which gave them a new record defeat.  For those keeping track, that means the current Government has 4 of the 6 biggest commons defeats in history.  The other two led to the downfall of that Government.)
Now, the Cooper – Bowles bill doesn’t actually really do anything.  But, as proof of concept, it worked.  Assuming that the Lords don’t filibuster, it shows that legislation can get through Parliament and get Royal Assent in just two days.  This may be useful in the future.
Tuesday, May went on her travels to France and Germany to ask for their support.  While all this is going on, talks continued between the Tories and Labour about finding a way to get the WA through Parliament.  If it’s even allowed back for a vote.
Wednesday, the EU council met.  May made her pitch for an extension to the end of June (as dictated by Cooper – Bowles).  Then, she was left in a room by herself for five and a half hours while the rest of the EU talked over dinner.  Eventually a deal emerged.  A deal that, apparently, Emanuel Macron pushed heavily for.
We have an extension until October 31.  And if you don’t think that Halloween related jokes haven;t already been made, you haven’t been paying attention.  But, there’s going to be a check on things at the end of June and we might leave earlier.
So, that’s where things stand at the moment.  We won’t crash out on Friday and May still has to deal with the fact that the EU won’t change the WA and the DUP and ERG don’t like the backstop.
Quick bit about Assange.  First of all, if you have to stay somewhere for asylum reasons, probably not a good idea to piss them off.  As for extradition?  Well, first he may have to serve a jail term on the failure to surrender charge, which he’s been convicted of.  The US has formally asked for his extradition.  As things stand, it won’t happen because we do not extradite if the death penalty is available.  However, if the US promises not to seek the death penalty, it may happen.
Then there’s Sweden.  You may have heard that the dropped the rape charge.  what actually happened is that they dropped the investigation as the next stage involved formally telling him of the charges and they couldn’t do that while he was in the embassy.  Now he’s out of there, they could resume the investigation and the European Arrest Warrant.  He’ll be extradited to there and then the whole US thing is their problem.

Got my new glasses today, so here’s the obligatory pic.  Before anyone say sit, no I will not smile.
Forgot to mention last weekend, but I’ve been put forward for a work experience thing through the council.  It’s in digital media.  So, I might get my hands on a video editing machine again.
Bit of a sports filled weekend for me.  Last night was NXT Takeover (which was good).  Today was the Grand National (had an each way bet on the winner, won £18).  Tomorrow is the boat race and Wrestlemania (though I won’t be watching the latter live this year).  So, yeah.
Beyond that, not much happening.  So, I’ll stop boring you.
Oh, remember, if you have any questions about British politics (and they don’t have to be about Brexit), leave them in a note and I’ll answer them in a later entry.

Monday was the second round of indicative votes. This time, the motions up for debate and vote were customs union, common market, second referendum whatever happens and one guaranteeing parliamentary sovereignty.
As the debate was going on, there was a bit of a commotion in the public gallery. Environmental activists, upset about little being done about climate change, had stripped to their underpants and, well, look at the picture:

Now, I also don’t think enough has been done about climate change, but this was stupid. They should have done it during PMQ’s. As it was, it was a sidebar to the vote.
As quite widely expected, not a single motion got a majority, though one was very, very close. Then we got a mic drop moment. Tory MP Nick Boles, who wrote one of the motions, stood up and spoke. He said that the reason none of the motions passed is because the Tories, his own party, refused to compromise. then, to a pitiful plea of “Oh, no, Nick. Don’t do it”, he announced that he was no longer going to sit with the party. Or, in other words, he resigned from the Tory party. He then left the chamber to applause from the Opposition benches.
Tuesday saw a seven hour Cabinet meeting. After which, Theresa May made a speech inviting Jeremy Corbyn to talks about a compromise. He accepted.
Today was another unprecedented day. It was blocked off for a further round of indicative votes. But that was changed, in order to get another bill, compelling May to ask for a further extension, ready to go to the Lords for their scrutiny and vote. The bill was starting today.
Normally, this takes months. Between the first reading, the second reading, the committee stage, the report stage and the third reading, it takes a while. To my knowledge, the whole process has never, ever been fitted in to a single day.
Some, mostly Tories, kept complaining to the Speaker that it shouldn’t be happening. These complaints fell on deaf ears.
There was an attempt to add an amendment. This would have given Monday over to another round of indicative votes. The vote on the amendment was a tie. This meant that the Speaker had to break the tie, the first time this has happened since 1993. As there is no status quo, he would normally vote in favour of allowing more debate. But, as there would probably still be nothing that would pass and therefore more debate isn’t necessary, he voted Nay and the amendment fell.
After a committee stage that saw the whole house turned into the committee, there was the third reading vote. This was the big one and it passed by a single vote.
Tomorrow the bill goes to the Lords. If they vote for it, it’ll become law.
Oh, here’s a thought. If anyone has any questions about British politics, ask and I’ll answer as best I can.

So, I did try cooking something new last week.  I cooked steak.  T’wasn’t bad, but I needed a bit of tweaking so it’s medium rare, not medium.
I had a look through the slow cooker recipe book I bought last week.  Most of the recipes involve a lot of cooking before I put everything into the slow cooker.  My idea of a slow cooker recipe is that it tells me what quantities of what ingredients to put in the cooker and how long to cook at what settings.  I’ll look for another one.
This week, I’m making a recipe for pineapple chicken.  So, so much soy sauce.
I’m watching wrestling to get caught up before Wrestlemania next weekend.
I found out more about my hidden aunt last week.
I’ve never really talked about this, but I’ve known for a while that I have another aunt.  Decades ago, when I was just a wee slip of a boy (rather than a fat lump of a man), my dad was drunk and going through old photos.  He handed me one and asked me to go ask mum who the woman in the pic was.  Mum told me to tell dad to stop drinking.  It was then that dad told me that my mum has a sister that no-one talks to.
Last week, while on the phone to my mum, she told me about a falling out my gran had with my aunt Joan (though this was before the big rift).  So, I know I have an aunt called Joan, she had three children (including twins) and she once accused my gran of not being a real grandparent for not wanting to babysit one of her grandkids.  (Gran, being gran, replied my aunt isn’t much of a mother if she doesn’t want to take all the kids on holiday.)
I’m not going to really do anything with this information (if I was going to look for and try and contact anyone it’d be Amy), but it’s still interesting to know.
Not entirely sure why I shared it here either.  But, there we are.

We now know what is going to be voted on tomorrow.
There’s a fair bit to explain here.
what is commonly known as the Working Agreement is actually two documents.  There’s the WA itself.  This is the document that dictates our relationship with the EU immediately on leaving.  This is stuff like the Northern Ireland backstop.
Then there is the Political Declaration.  This is the guide for talks about how the discussions of the future will go.
Now, we’ve always been told either both or neither are agreed.  They cannot be separated.
Theresa May, having never met a u turn she didn’t like to take, has now put just the WA up for the vote.  This is a big enough change to what was voted down twice already for it to actually go to a vote.
So, will it pass?  Nope.
Labour are against it.  With Theresa May announcing she’s stepping down for the next phase of Brexit, they do not want the next leader of the Tory party, likely to be a hard Brexiteer, to be negotiating that with absolutely no framework whatsoever.
The European Research Group (kind of a party within the Tory party, very much in favour of hard Brexit) have until now opposed the WA.  May is hoping to win them over with her stepping down.  It has with some (most notably Boris Johnston and Jacob Rees Mogg), but the rest probably will not.
Then there is the DWP.  They will not vote for any WA that has a backstop.  And, indeed, they have announced that they are voting Nay.

Yup, it’s another Brexit entry.
On Monday, Westminster had another Brexit vote.  This one was a neutral motion.  Which means it has no actual impact except to say “This has happened”.
This, however, does not prevent these motions from being amendable.  And this one was.  It was amended to allow the Commons to take control of proceedings for a series of indicative votes for what should happen Brexit wise.  This is extraordinary.  The normal process is that the Government sets the business for each day in the Commons.  As you can imagine, this did not go down well at all.
Today was the day in question.  There were eight options up for the vote.  These ranged from immediate No Deal to Revoke.  The vote was done on paper, each one was a straight yes/no vote.  The voting took place between 7 and 7:30 and the results were announced just before 10pm.
Every single one lost.  Out of the eight options, all went Nay.
So, that did a superb job at clearing this shit up.  (~I’m deliberately ignoring the fact this should have been done 2 years ago at the start of the process, or even before we invoked Article 50, simply because that way lies me setting up a bottle of Scotch as an IV.)
The two options that got the most Yay votes are a) whatever is decided goes to a public vote and b) a customs union.
So, there’s going to be more indicative votes on Monday.  April 1st.  No, that is not an April Fools prank.  Nor is it a joke that we don’t know what is going to happen.
Nor is it an April Fools that it’s also the day when the Revoke A50 petition is going to be debated (currently sitting at just under 6 million votes).
However, the EU Withdrawal Act has been amended to reflect the extension(s) we got from the EU.  This hasn’t pleased some, because they thought that while the EUWA stated we’d be leaving on Friday, that would still be the case (it wasn’t).
Also, Theresa May told Tory MP’s that is the Withdrawal Agreement passed, she’d stand down as leader of the Tory party and Prime Minister.  This is in an attempt to get Tories to vote for it.  First thing to note is that it’s kinda fucked up that she’s blackmailing them with her leaving.  The second thing to note is that it won’t work.  For one, the DUP absolutely will not vote for the WA while the backstop is part of it and the EU will not remove that.  Secondly, the Speaker made it quite clear again today that unless there is a substantive change to the WA and May stepping down is most certainly that.
So, now we wait til Monday.  Possibly.

Quick Brexit update: we’re saved.  Uri Geller (yes, he of spoon bending fame) is going to prevent it from happening telepathically.  And that’s nowhere near the strangest story Brexit has given us this week.
The chicken korma was nice.  Would make again.  This week, I’m giving the experimentation a miss and just making chilli.  It’s been a while.  I also suddenly realised I’ve liked a butchers shop page on FB, so I’m going to message them to see if they do the venison sausages I need to try that casserole.
Enjoyed Captain Marvel.  Unique way to tell an origin story, but it works.
I’m getting my peppers checked tomorrow.  Yes, tis time.  It also means I’ll get to see a pic of the back of my eyes, which is always cool.
Just realised it also means getting the puff test done.  Crap.

when I last talked on this subject, Parliament had decided they did not want the Working Agreement but neither did they want us to leave the EU with no deal.  Theresa May was going to try a third vote on her deal.
Enter the Speaker of the House, Erskine May* and a parliamentary convention dating back to 1604.
On Monday, John Bercow, the Speaker of the House, made a statement.  He announced that he was using the aforementioned convention to kill off MV3.  The convention states that unless there has been a substantive change to a bill that has been voted down by the Commons, that bill cannot be presented for a second vote in the same session of Parliament.
This presented a problem for May, because the EU have said that there is no way they are reopening the WA to make changes to it.  The deal is dead.
How did May react?  Not well.  On Wednesday, she made a speech.  It lasted 5 minutes.  It was the singular most extraordinary speech I have ever heard from a Prime Minister.  She said she was on the side of the people, attacked MP’s and the Speaker and called them traitors.  You can see the speech here:

Now, bear in mind, this is the very Speaker she needs to allow MV3 and the very MPs she needs to vote for the WA.  And she royally pissed them off.  And I mean royally.
She also put them at risk.  Since her speech, MPs have had to be given safety training, one has been attacked outside a supermarket and another is unable to return to her home after a death threat.
So, that went well.
Yesterday, she pitched to the EU council for an extension.  How well did it go?  Well, before she did, the French President said she had a 10% chance of getting the extension, afterwards he said a 5% chance.
But, we have an arrangement.  Not, it must be noted, because of May, but in spite of her.  Apparently, whenever she was asked what she would do if the WA wasn’t approved by Parliament, she just said that was her plan.  So, the EU took over.
So, we have the extension.  We are not leaving the EU next Friday.  When are we leaving?  Well…
If May gets the WA through Parliament, we will be leaving on May 22.  This extension is because we need to pass quite a few laws.  If MV3 goes against May, if it’s even allowed again, then we have an extension until April 12.  This is because that’s the last day before we have to let the EU know if we’re going to be taking part in the next EU elections.
Meanwhile, May has said she might give Parliament an indicative votes on seven different outcomes.  And a petition on the official Government petition website calling for article 50 to be revoked has got nearly 4 million signatures (including mine, I must admit).
And that’s where we are with Brexit this week.

Picture is the latest in my journey to try cooking new stuff.  Beef and tomato casserole.  T’was nice.
At 23:00 on the 29th of March this year, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland will be leaving the European Union.
Last month, the House of Commons had a vote on the withdrawal agreement.  This is the document that sets the terms for us leaving the EU.  This was voted down on the biggest Government defeat in history.
Theresa May tried to renegotiate the deal.  But the EU, as they said would happen, refused to do so as the current deal is the best they can offer given Mays red lines.
And so, it came back to a vote on Tuesday.  But on Monday night, it was revealed that May had got something that might change the outcome of the vote.
Turns out, what she had got was basically a letter that said that the EU promised not to do something they had never threatened to do to begin with.
Hence, the government lost the second meaningful vote, but this time by only the fourth largest majority of any government defeat in history.
Yesterday, there was a vote against leaving the EU with no deal.  Bear in mind, that it’s not a binding vote because no deal is the default setting.  Now, we were told that the Tories would have a free vote, which meant that their MPs could vote with their conscience rather than the way the party wanted them to.
Then the motion was significantly amended.  So, the Tories were whipped.  There were still enough of them that rebelled and the government lost.
Today, there was a vote to ask the EU to extend the Article 50 deadline.  There was an amendment put forward to request an extension so we could hold a second referendum, but it failed.  The main motion, however, did pass.
So, here we are.  Theresa May has a deal that the Commons will not pass.  It’s due to come for a third vote next week, if the Speaker will allow that to happen (which he may not, he may call it disorderly instead).  Our MP’s have said that they don’t want to leave with no deal, but something needs to happen to prevent that happening, as, if not, it’ll happen regardless.  We’re going to ask for an extension, but we need the EU to agree.  Which they’re not going to do without there being an actual purpose to it.  which means renegotiation, which we’re not getting unless May moves on her red lines (hint, she won’t), we have a general election or we have a second referendum.  Or we could just rescind Article 50 and stay in the EU.
Oh, and another ting about the vote on Wednesday.  Theresa May, as it turns out, wasn’t able to defeat her own fucking bill.
Yeah.  And you thought everything up to now was a complete shitshow.

The pic is the Thai green curry I talked about in my last entry.  Not going to make it again, mostly because I don’t, as it turns out, like it.
Got woken up today by an alert on my phone.  It was BBC News, letting me know that Keith Flint from The Prodigy had died.
The Prodigy was a band that I had only heard a couple of songs from and thought they were OK.  Then I heard Firestarter and I was completely blown away.  This was dance music as I’d never heard it before.  It was raw.  It rocked, which was something dance music had never done before.  Then I saw the video:

And this was my first introduction to Keith Flint.  A pierced bundle of energy with weird hair.  (This video, by the way, was banned from Top of The Pops for being too scary.)
I was hooked.  As soon as The Fat of the Land was released, I got a copy and it was rarely out of rotation on my stereo.
Yeah, this one hurt.
Then, at tea time, I got another BBC News notification that Luke Perry had died.  This one hurt less, but it still hurt.  I was a huge 90210 fan growing up.  When it was announced that he had been cast in Riverdale, I thought it was stunt casting.  Wrong.  He was, unequivocally, one of the best things about the show.

BlakKklansman: one of those films that, if you pitched it as a work of fiction you’d be told it’s not realistic.  A brilliant film.
First Reformed: An OK film, vastly elevated by the performance of Ethan Hawke.  In years to come, his lack of nomination for Best Actor will haunt the Academy.
Roma: I’m a Cuaron fan, I wanted to like this.  I had to give up after about half an hour.

So, this is going to be another politics entry.
Now, more or less since the moment Jeremy Corbyn was elected leader of the Labour Party, there’s been rumours of a split.  Either the Blairite centre of the party were going to split and form a new party, or they were going to force Corbyn out of position and the left of the party were going to split and form a new party.
Well, today seven Labour MP’s announced they had resigned.  They weren’t forming a new party though.  It’s just a group, called The Independent Group.  Their chief complaint is that the party has become racist and anti semitic.  Remember this, it’ll come up later.  They were very clear that they are open to people joining the group from all of the political parties.  Their claim is that politics in the UK is broken and they are going to fix it.
To be clear, this isn’t like the Gang of Four in the 80’s.  They were heavyweights of the party.  Of these seven, I’ve only heard of two of them and one is most notable for bottling it when changing their mind about running for leader in 2015.
To describe their launch as a clusterfuck is, to be frank, an insult to the phrase clusterfuck.  There were ridiculous sound issues during the press conference.  The BBC needed to apologise after someone was caught on a live mike saying that they are fucked.  Their website lasted about 1.5 seconds before going down.
Then, on Politics Live, one of them was being interviewed.  During the interview, she said about racism that “It’s not about being black or a funny tinge”.  Yeah.  About that racism they were escaping…
So, now to their claim that politics are broken.  They’re right about that.  And if you doubt that politics in the UK are broken, bear in mind that we have a Government who can’t even pass a meaningless vote, never mind something with substance.  But we can’t get shot of them.
Now, let’s look at this new group.  Their website is registered in Panama.  They aren’t a political party, but they are a private company.  This means that they can take donations and do not have to reveal where the money came from.  Oh, and they’ve decided that, despite being elected on a manifesto they no longer believe in written by a political party they no longer are members of, their constituents won’t be given a say in if they want the seven to represent their constituencies anymore.
So much for fixing what’s broken.
I think what they’re hoping for is that a bunch of MP’s from all parties will follow them in quitting their party and joining the group.  Not likely.  Tories won’t, they don’t want to lose power.  A couple of Labour MP’s might, but probably not as many as they hope.  They seem to be close to the position of the Lib Dems anyway, so why would they.  And the SNP and DUP are pretty much united.
Oh, and when their constituents are given a vote, they’re looking for new jobs.

I won a new telly!  It’s the same size as my old one, but this one is a smart TV.  I was needing a new one, my old one was 5 years old and showing its age.
Capsule reviews of the Oscar nominated films I’ve watched thus far:
A Star is Born: I don’t get the hype.  Is it because it was expected to be a disaster and turned out not to be?  Frankly, I was bored by the film.
Black Panther: it’s not a bad film.  But it wasn’t even the best Marvel film of last year, never mind one of the best overall.
Bohemian Rhapsody: It’s a decent film, but I can’t help thinking that there’s a better warts and all film to be made of Freddie Mercury’s life rather than this hagiography.  Problem is, even if you could get the rest of Queen to sign off on that film, you’re not going to get anyone better to play Mercury than Rami Malek.
Can You Ever Forgive me?: I loved, loved, loved this film.  Melissa McCarthy and Richard E Grant are outstanding in their roles and I really don’t know how the director isn’t nominated as well.

Yesterday was my birthday! I got a card from my parents which contained £10. I had to put it in my bank account, because it was a Clydesdale Bank note and shops look at you strange if you use them in store. Because they look like play money:

My mum also put £20 in my account. I also got one Stuart MacBride book and there’s another I’m getting when it paperback is released this week.
Got the ring for my rook piercing.  Hence there being a pic of a close up of mu lughole.  I thought I might have to pay to get the piercer for her time to replace it, but she just charged me for the ring itself.
Went out last night and got drunk. The great thing about the craft beer revolution is that plenty of bars now sell craft/craft style lager, which is much better than the normal stuff.
Watched the first episode of the new season of Discovery on Friday. It was good. I also watched both the Fyre Festival documentaries. I enjoyed them both, but preferred the Netflix one. It looks at the problems it caused for businesses on the island, rather than focusing on the attendees who got conned.
Have to go, I need to be up early tomorrow to sign on.

If you’ve been reading me for a while, you’ll know that I’m a tennis fan.  My absolute favourite player is Andy Murray.  And not just because he’s a fellow Scot.
So it was with shock that I woke up on Friday that I awoke to the news that he had announced that he was hoping to retire at Wimbledon this year, but he wasn’t sure he could make it that far.
Then I listened this morning as a man who admits he has pain just trying to put his socks on played a four hour, five set match he wasn’t even expected to finish.
My laptop is currently in computer hospital.  I somehow talked the job centre into paying to have it fixed.  It’s a different place to where I went the last time.
I know I really need a new machine, but there’s just no way I can afford it right now.
It’s my birthday on Saturday.  I know I’ll be getting cash from my parents, so that’ll pay for the hoop for my rook piercing.
I’ve now got three books on pre-order this year.  The new Angie Thomas in February, the new Thomas Harris in June and the sequel to The Handmaids Tale in September.

I’m not sure why they repainted this without the pic of Larkin they were using before but it still looks good.
So, I’m back to writing on my tablet.  Dunno what happened, but when I got back to Boro my laptop screen wouldn’t switch on.  At all.  It looks like my birthday cash will be going towards getting my laptop fixed.
I really need a new one, but there’s n way I’ll be able to afford it.
New Year was drunken.  Very, very drunken, which is what I get for drinking craft lager all night with a nip of single malt at the bells.  Was fun though.
Glad to be home.  Watching what I want on TV.  Smoking indoors again!
On the train back I watched the new season of A Series of Unfortunate Events, which I finished when I got back to the flat.  T’was good.
Also had one watch through of Bandersnatch which is fun.
At the time of writing, I’m watching season 2 of Runaways and thoroughly enjoying it.
I will review the Doctor Who New Year special.  Quick tease, not good.

EDIT: I keep telling mum it looks like the penguins are being hanged
I’m currently on my mum and dads computer creating a Windows 10 installation disc and moving stuff from my TV external drive to my music one and thought I’d take advantage of being on a proper computer to write here.
Christmas Day was relaxing.  Went over to see my sister, brother in law and nephew at lunchtime, came home, ate then went for a few drinks in the one place in town that was actually open.
From Santa I got a banana, a tangerine and some shower gel.  From my  mum and dad I got a mystic 8 ball pint glass, £30 and an Oor Wullie annual.  From my sister, brother in law and nephew I got shower gel and a Gryffindor t shirt.  And from my Brother, sister, nephew and niece I got a bar of soap and a 12 pack of Brewdog IPA.
Here’s the problem.  I don’t drink IPA.  I’ve never drank IPA.  I don’t like the taste of IPA.  So, my dad is getting them and buying me lager.  Because I’m not humphing 12 cans of beer I’m not drinking in Aberdeen down to Middlesbrough just so I can not drink them there.
Yesterday I went into town and got myself a replica 1983 Aberdeen Cup Winners Cup top (my present from my mum and dad), an Aberdeen FC pin badge, the two MST3K comics I was missing and Heroes by Stephen Fry.  Which is as good as I thought it would be and as Mythos is.
Can’t wait to get back down the road to watch the Black Mirror choose your own adventure style movie.
Oh, if you can get your hands on it, I highly recommend the BBC4 adaptation of Norse Mythology.

My mums present arrived five minutes before they picked me up.  Which was great timing.  Methinks if I buy her a book next year, I’ll get it in a shop, rather than getting it online.
Mum and dad didn’t get lost this time, thankfully.
I own three chargers for my phone/tablet/headset.  Guess how many I managed to pack?  So, I had to buy one when I got here.
The pic is a view from the caravan park we stayed at.
The journey was uneventful, apart from being subjected to a song about how good Mrs Brown’s Boys are.  Lies.  That show is absolutely crap.
Mostly been watching darts since mum and dad have mostly been watching darts.
Not much else to report, really.  Nephew and niece are cute, dog is a pain as always.

I’m heading to Aberdeen tomorrow.  Well, to a caravan park near Beamish anyway.  My mum and dad are hopefully picking me up from the flat.  Assuming they don’t get lost and end up in the wrong place.  Again.
Anyway, I should be packing and wrapping presents.  So, of course, I’m on my annual watch of It’s a Wonderful Life,

330,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/a-midsummerfest-carol-2-5382714/,2018-12-14,A Midsummerfest Carol,"

On some planets, in some cultures, it’s traditional to celebrate on or near the shortest day of the year. Typical. Celebrating when light is in the shortest supply.


Here, however, we’ve got it right. Celebrate when the day is longest, when there’s maximum light to be able to do so. Much more sensible. Same as in those other cultures, presents, feast, visit from a mysterious visitor leaving gifts.
Poppycock, the whole damn lot of it. I’ve never been a believer that it’s anything other than an ordinary day. Didn’t like getting presents, certainly didn’t like giving them, saw the food as an unnecessary extravagance. It’s still the same. I’m a successful businessman. No one, and I mean no one in my company got the day off. They couldn’t even book it off as a holiday. Business as usual. No bonuses, no gifts. It didn’t make me popular, but I’m not in the business I am to make friends. Just the cash.
All that was true till this year. Then the bloody Electorates did what they did best. Stuck their noses in to other people’s business. Declared that, unless you were employed in an essential service, you had to get the day off, paid. Well, I soon found a way round that. I sacked the bloody lot of them. Every single one. The lucky ones will get their jobs back. The extremely lucky ones will get the same level of pay.
I was enjoying a quiet drink on front of the image box when I got a very mild surprise. My old partner, Joe Cregg, walked through the door. Literally, as it was still shut. That’s not the only thing to surprise me, the fact he was there at all was a tiny shock as he had been dead these six years previously.
‘Jex, Jex, Jex. What is going on? I’ve watched you these six years. I wasn’t that surprised with the direction you took the company, driving costs and wages down while keeping prices high. But sacking everyone just before Midsummerfest. Really? Really? That’s cold, even for you.’
‘Why does that surprise you Joeleph?’ I replied, lighting a cigar. This was deliberately to annoy him. He hated me smoking when he was alive and he couldn’t exactly do anything about it now. ‘You know how I feel about the whole ridiculous thing.’
‘That’s very true. But making them beg to get their jobs back, when you are the only game in town?’
‘If they don’t like it, they can take their chances and go somewhere else instead. You going to try and talk me out of this particular course of action?’
Joe shook his head. ‘I’m not that stupid. I know you, I know there’s no convincing you. I’m more the advance guard. There will be others. Don’t know who they will be, but there will be three of them.’
I grinned. ‘Bring it on. I can take it.’
Joe shrugged his shoulders and walked out the door. I would have been shocked and surprised by what had just happened, if I was capable of being shocked by anything. I finished my drink and went to get another one. I flicked through the channels, getting annoyed by all the bloody Midsummerfest programmes. I gave up and left it on as background noise while I looked over the books finding places to reduce our overheads and therefore make me more money. My favourite pastime.
I heard someone clearing their throat and looked up. There was a strange looking person standing there. Long hair, baggy clothes, I actually had to wait for him to talk before discovering it wasn’t actually a female. There’s no need for anyone to look like that really. Scruffy git. He tilted his head and stared at me like an infinitely patient guru. Or a complete and utter numpty.
‘I suppose you’re one of those folks that Joe warned me about?’
‘Indeed I am. If you would be so considerate as to rise yourself off the chair and proceed in a manner that is following where I lead you, it would be muchly appreciated.’
‘Did you swallow a bloody spellingbook or something?’
He continued to stare at me in a manner that I suppose was supposed to be piercing but merely made me think he had something wrong with his sight. ‘It has been commented before that I tend to communicate in a way that can be described as being ever so slightly on the side of the verbose, that much is in the record as a statement of fact. However, my fine person of the male persuasion, the manner with which I carry out my verbal interactions with other personages is not the matter or mission upon which I am currently standing in this fine room which is part of your place of abode. You, in all actuality, really do need to be following where I precede you to. If you find my style of conducting communications of the conversational variety to be not of your particular taste than the greater velocity with which he hence from this place of dwelling, the sooner I shall no longer be chatting to your good self.’
I got up, sighing. A spellingbook? This guy seems to have swallowed the entire language for dinner then another one for desert. I headed towards the door.
‘Oh, dear me, my fine and upright male type,’ he said. ‘There was a particular and very rational explanation as to why I asked your fine self to follow me. For you shall not be removing yourself from the confines of these four splendidly decorated walls in the manner with which you are quite accustomed. If you would ever so kind as to follow in the direction and general manner of which I shall be leading and proceeding, it would be much and greatly appreciated.’
It usually takes a lot for me to lose my temper but this guy was very close to it. ‘Where are we going?’
‘I would request that, in all humbleness and obsequiousness, that the sooner that we cease and desist tarrying and remaining in this place, the sooner your eyeballs will observe detail and catalogue our ultimate destination.’
‘Do you ever say things simply?’
‘My dear and sweet gentle person of the male persuasion, it is the humble opinion of my good self, your guide, mentor and narrator, that to use one piece of vocalisation when you could use ten is sheer, total and utter laziness. Shall we depart from the ground on which we currently stand and the space we presently occupy with no further delay?’
I gave up and followed him. We walked, not through the door, but through the wall at the rear of the room. Rather than ending up in my dining hall, as I would expect, it being the room through there, I found myself outside. The house we stood outside looked familiar to me, though I couldn’t quite place it. My annoying guide turned to me again.
‘Now I do find that it is my solemn duty to be informing you that in this place, at this time you are as spectral and non-corporal as my own good self, your dear, late and much lamented friend and partner in the world of business and the two personages that shall be paying you the honour and the privilege of a visitation once I have departed from your fine and muchly enjoyable company. Now, my dear sir, if you would once again be so kind as to place your lowest appendages in the steps of my own feet, we shall proceed with the entering of this simple, humble yet very homely abode.’
I followed him through the wall into the house. I got a shock when I saw someone I instantly recognised, sat slumped on the bottom step, crying over a package I again recognised. ‘Soxanna Hamilsmythe,’ I whispered.
‘So, your good self has recognition of this poor, weeping visage that sits before us? And would there be, perchance, any glimmer of familiarity with great concern to the package she is currently blessing and moistening with giant drops of water?’
I looked closer. ‘It is a present that she tried to give me. We must have been in Learning Eight at the time. I remember laughing and shoving it back in her face.’
‘Well, that simple act did give her much reason for the painful act of grievance. The poor, very unfortunate womanly person you see so tortured before myself and yourself spent a lot of time and no small amount of trouble to be absolutely assured that the small but perfectly chosen gift would be much to your liking. The poor dear was completely, totally and utterly head over heels in love with you. That simple but very much of the cruel description act with which you returned the present did break her poor delicate heart. And, may be as bold as to enquire as to the nature and direction of any feelings you may have harboured towards her?’
‘I was in love with her. I did try to approach her after this happened but got short shrift. Now I know why. Is this what you are planning to do, make me visit places like this?’
‘If that was indeed my intention and my plan, it would be very, very easy to do sir. For there is absolutely no doubt or equivocation in my, or anyone else’s, mind that of such personages supply cannot be described in any way, shape or form as being short. Beings of the human variety that may easily be described as friends of yours, familial members, there is indeed a plentiful supply of these types. However, our time together is, by necessity, short and thusly my humble self can only be of a mind to let you view and peek on one such example. This wretched creature was thusly chosen as being the one that you would catch sight and sound of as it may well be the one that made the biggest impression on you. Now, if it would please and pleasure you, I must bid you adieu and the most fairest of wells. You shall be departing of this place by the very means and direction with which you came in.’
With that, he was gone. I walked through the wall I went through to get in and was back in my living space. I went to the drinks cabinet, poured a very healthy measure of alcohol and downed it. What exactly was that supposed to teach me? When I turned back round there was someone else there. Definitely female this time. She pointed at me.
‘You. Follow,’ was all she said. Thank the Gods for that, short on conversation. We left though the front wall this time. We stood outside the house. She pointed to the house opposite mine.’
‘Look.’
The house was festooned with horrible lit decorations. It was really not becoming. Then she turned round and pointed again.
‘Look.’
I did. My house, looking perfectly normal, the way things should be.
‘You not decorate.’
‘It’s cheap, tacky and in celebration of something ridiculous. I really don’t see the point.’
‘But you make.’
‘Of course I do. Low production costs, massive profits. I’d be mad not to.’
She turned again. ‘Follow.’ I did. We walked down the street, turned the corner and followed the next street till she stopped, turned and pointed at a house. ‘Look.’
‘And this is important to me because?’ I asked.
‘Azander MacToro. You know’
‘The name rings a bell,’ I said. ‘Think he works in accounts.’
‘Follow.’
I followed her into the house. Sat there, looking morose amongst the bustle, was Azander.
‘Glad to see he’s not enjoying himself.’
‘First Midsummerfest with family,’ she said. Can’t enjoy. Can’t have fun. Busy worrying if will have job tomorrow.’
‘Good. Anyone having fun at this stupid time of year should be zapped on sight and then zapped again to ensure they are dead.’
She pointed back to the wall. ‘Leave.’ She disappeared and I walked through the hall, back to my place. This time I didn’t move. Sure enough, someone else appeared in my living space. Female again. She looked a bit kinder than the last one, however.
‘Let me guess,’ I said. ‘You want me to follow you.’
‘Dude, you catch on pretty quickly,’ she replied. She walked towards one of the side walls and I followed her. We were in my street, but there was something different about it. The lights looked completely different for a start.
‘Have a look in that bin. There’s something there that might interest you.’
I went over and picked up the box resting on the top. The fact that I could pick it up was a surprise. ‘I didn’t think I’d be able to do that, being non-corporeal and all,’ I said.
‘You shouldn’t be able to, but exceptions can be made if needs be.’
I looked at the box, drinking in all the information on there. ‘I don’t recognise this.’
‘We’re about 20 years in the future. That box used to contain the very latest in cutting edge technology.’
‘It’s not made by me.’
‘Indeed not,’ she agreed. ‘Come on, follow me.’
I put the box back and followed her down the road. She led me into the graveyard. I never liked this place. Far, far too dark and dingy for my tastes. If they sold me the place, like I’d asked, it would have been turned into an amusement fair.
We walked through rows and rows of extravagant monstrosities dedicated to people who can’t actually appreciate them to a bit at the back. This was the area for pauper’s graves. My guide pointed at one. Written on a tiny, badly whitewashed, crudely made cross was “J Washburne.”
‘That my grave?’
‘It is.’
‘What happened?’
‘Your miserly cost cutting measures made your products unusable. You refused to invest in making anything else new. Competitors moved in and stole your staff. The company went bust. You lost a load of money and, due to your attitude, you had no friends. This is what you become. And now we must part ways.’
She disappeared and I walked through the wall from one version of my living space to the other. I got myself a drink and sat back down, flicking through the channels on the image box and thinking.
Now, you may be under the impression that everything I saw had given me food for thought, made me realise that I had to change things. Sorry pal, wrong story. I was actually recalling everything I learned from the box I held. There was a nice project for the development people tomorrow.

So, we can add a series long story arc to the list of things that Chris Chibnall cannot write for Doctor Who.  That was utterly pathetic.  And that’s before we get to the fact that the Stenza in general and Tim Shaw in particular is nowhere near strong enough to work in this way.
This episode also featured a threat to Earth.  It was the first time I can remember where I could not have been less bothered about the danger the Earth was in.
Graham was good, the storyline with him and Ryan went where it was always kinda headed.  But I didn’t really buy his “I’m gonna kill him, LOL I’m not” thing.
I’ll give Yaz about the same amount of attention as the script.
Mark Addy was good.  The character really wasn’t.  He was just there to be a tour guide and remember things.
If your story has the exact same basic plot as another, much better story you might not want to reference that one.  Just saying.
This would have made a semi decent filler episode.  Sadly, it was the series finale.  It just didn’t work.  As with a couple of other Chibnall scribed episodes it had some god ideas that he did nothing with.  Why mention the planet messing with peoples minds and the need for the neural inhibitors if you’re not going to do anything with that?  All the planet seemed to do was slightly confuse the Doctor and give Yaz a headache.  Was it worth bothering with the inhibitors then?
And now for the series review.
It’s been a real mixed series.  One episode is amongst the very best the show has ever done (Rosa).  A couple have been very, very good (Demon in the Punjab, It Takes You Away).  One was just a solid, fun episode (Kerblam!).  One was forgettable (The Witchfinder).  A couple would have been passable if not for their place in the series (The Woman Who Fell to Earth, The Battle of Ranskoor Av Kolos).  One was poor (The Ghost Monument) and the other two are amongst the worst the show has ever been (Arachnids in the UK, The Tsuranga Conundrum).

It’s sadly clear where the shows problem lies.  Look at the last five episodes on that list.  The one uniting factor behind the scenes is that they were all solely written by Chris Chibnall.  Now, I’ve said before that I wasn’t exactly thrilled when it was announced he was taking over from Steven Moffat as I wasn’t a fan of his previous episodes, but I was willing to give him a chance.
Well, the jury is in and he’s just not cutting it.  He’s really not.  If the BBC were to announce tomorrow that the delay in broadcasting the next series (it won’t air until 2020) is because he’s out it wouldn’t bother me at all.
His defenders will tell you that he focussed on characterisation, but that hasn’t been apparent either.  Not even the Doctor has been that well drawn.  Graham is good, but that’s as much to do with Bradley Walsh being a good actor than anything in the script.  Ryan has dyspraxia, until it’s ignored most of the series.  Beyond that, all his characterisation came from Graham.  Yaz can safely be removed from the entire series with only minor changes needed.  Including the two episodes that were supposed to showcase her.
He did do some tings right.  He did, after all, green light the episodes I liked or loved and is credited with co writing Rosa (though it’s obvious that Malorie Blackman did the heavy lifting in that script) and he both chose Segun Akinola to replace Murray Gold as the shows composer and went with the most gorgeous version of the shows theme since it returned.
But none of that is good enough.  If they would let him work behind the scenes and hired a head writer who could, y’know, write the show well, that might work.  But him writing most of the episodes just doesn’t.

Last time I wrote about our big clusterfuck, the five days of debates before the vote on the withdrawal bill.  So, five days of debate, the vote, May loses and then we see what happens.  Right?
Oh, you sweet summer child.  Nothing goes simply with Brexit.
Today, the European Court of Justice ruled on a case, saying that notification of Article 50 can be revoked without the approval of the EU.  Now, this is huge.  The big argument against simply cancelling Brexit was that we could not do so without the EU agreeing and that they would not be willing to let us do so without changing the existing deal with them.
Now, all we need is a bill passing Parliament and it’s done.
So, how did Theresa May react to this?  She’s cancelled the vote in Parliament tomorrow because she can’t win.
Seriously, that’s the reason.  She’s going to lose the vote, so she’s postponing it.  Can you imagine saying “I’m not going to ass he exam tomorrow, so I’m postponing it”?
She’s now going back to the EU to try and renegotiate the deal.  This would be the same deal that was absolutely final, take it r leave it.
Yeah…

This is going to be another political entry.
This whole thing started on November 13th.  That was when the Labour party used an old, recently resurrected motion called the humble address to force the Government to release the full and final legal advice on the proposed withdrawal agreement with the EU.
Last week, they published a version of the legal advice, but it wasn’t the full version.  On Monday a letter, singed by representatives of every party except the Tories asking for a motion holding the Government in contempt of Parliament.  The Government then suggested an amendment to pass the whole thing off to a committee to decide if they are in contempt.  This would push the whole issue back until after the EU deal vote next Tuesday.
The debate and vote on the contempt motion took place yesterday.  It didn’t go well for Theresa May.  At all.  The amendment went down 311 – 307.  Now the big one.  The contempt vote.
311 – 293 in favour.  The Commons found that the Government of the United Kingdom were in contempt of Parliament.
So, what now?  Well, the full legal advice was published today. Beyond that, no-one knows.  Really, no-one knows.  This is the first time ever that an entire Government has been held in contempt of Parliament.  One thing for sure, when the Government loses the EU deal vote, and it’s more than likely they will, the Labour party will initiate a vote of no confidence.  That will likely pass and it’ll be back to the polls.
But it gets worse for May.  Straight after the contempt vote, there was a vote on one of the amendments to the EU deal bill which would give Parliament a say in what happens if/when the deal gets voted down.  The Government lost that one 321 – 299.
So, within the space of an hour, Theresa May lost three votes in Parliament.  It’s hard to see how this is a Government that can actually for any governing.
There then started 5 days of debates on the EU deal, all of them guaranteed to go for 8 hours.  Then the vote.
Interesting times indeed.
Meanwhile, Nigel Farage has quit as a member of UKIP because of the hiring of Stephen Yaxley-Lennon (Tommy Robinson).  And the Scottish Government put this out:

This was a solid episode.  Not great, by any means, but far from horrible as well.
After Ryan and his disappearing dyspraxia, it was refreshing to have a character with a disability where it was more than just referenced and then seemingly vanished thereafter.  I liked the touch of the Doctor writing the instructions for Ryan and then lying to Hanne, and her working out the Doctor lied.
The dad using speakers to gaslight Hanne into believing the monster was there may not be new, but it still worked.
I like the anti-zone.  I like the idea of the anti-zone.  I liked Ribbons hopefully they can find a way of bringing him back.
The addition of the Solitract was a neat idea, as was tying it into the lore of the show.  I know some people were upset that it appeared at the end as a frog, but it was so strange it worked.  Remember, it was trying to attract the Doctors intellect, not her emotions.  Why a frog?  Why not?
Seeing Grace again was a bit of a gut punch.  Nice touch with Graham realising that Grace would never sacrifice Ryan in the way this one was willing to do.
Felt like Ryan calling Graham Grandad could have been a bigger moment.
The episode looked good.  Loved that Eriks t shirt and the Doctor and Grahams parting were reversed in the Solitract.
Next week is the last episode, so I’ll also be doing a series round up.

This is going to be a short review.  The episode was fine.
The writing was fine, the directing was fine, the editing was fine, the cinematography was fine, the music was fine.
I genuinely have absolutely no feelings about this episode one way or the other at all.  I didn’t love it, I didn’t hate it with the burning passion of a thousand suns.  It was a 50 minute episode of TV. chances are, in six months I’ll have forgotten it even exists.

Kerblam! is still one of my favourite DW episode titles of all time.
I really liked this episode.  No, it may not have been talking about important things, like Rosa did, but it was just straight up fun.
There’s been some complaints about the ending of the episode.  Personally, I thought it was a neat twist and didn’t actually detract form the rest of the episode and what it was saying.
Lee Mack was good, if a bit underused.  Julie Hesmondhalgh was, as expected, excellent.
Weaponizing bubble wrap, just before Christmas?  That’s just evil.
The dodgy editing is back.  Particularly in the scene where Yaz is looking for Dan, it looked like she was hunting for herself.
Twirly was absolutely adorable.  I,for one, wouldn’t mind seeing him return in the future.
The fez and the Agatha Christie references are a good example of how to do these things properly.
Next week, Alan Cummings and witches.

William Goldman has died.  I know everyone will talk about The Princess Bride and rightfully so, both book and film are amazing, But his adaptation of Misery was brilliant and All The Presidents Men somehow makes a tense thriller out of a story everyone knows.  If you’re at all into creative writing Adventures in a Screen Trade and What Lie Did I Tell? are essential reading.  RIP.
I’m likely going home for Christmas this year!  The past few years my mum and dad have come down to Gateshead straight after Christmas, but this year they are coming down before.  So, if I go home, they’ll be giving me a lift.  It all depends on if I have to sign on on Christmas Eve.

They say a week is a long time in politics.  Over here, we’re discovering just how true that is.
Tuesday, it was announced that there was a draft of a deal between the EU and the UK concerning our withdrawal from the EU.
Theresa May had individual meetings with each member of the Cabinet to sell the deal to them.  (Slightly ominously for May, the last sitting PM to have such individual meetings with their Cabinet was Maggie Thatcher, who resigned as PM the very next day.)
Yesterday, there was a 5 hour Cabinet meeting, after which May announced that the Cabinet has agreed the deal.
All done, right?  It’ll go to a vote in Parliament, it’ll pass and we move on, right?
Erm, not so fast.
Labour, as was expected, announced that they would not vote for the bill because it fails their six tests.  The Lib Dem, who want the whole thing called off anyway (or, at least, a second referendum with remain on the ballot) have unsurprisingly announced they are voting against the bill.  The SNP have announced they are voting against.
The DUP have announced the same.
The bill is fucked, even if every Tory MP votes for because they simply don’t have the votes anymore.
There’s a very good chance that May is going to face a Vote of No Confidence within the party.  If she wins, her position of leader of the party is safe.  If not, she’s out.
Oh, and it turns out the Cabinet may not be as united as people think.  Three ministers have resigned their position.
One is the Northern Ireland Secretary.  One is the Work and Pension Secretary.
The third is Dominic Raab.  This one is notable, as he was the Brexit Secretary.
He said in his letter of resignation that he could not support the deal.  Part of his role was, guess what, negotiating the deal.
I’ll let that sink in.
The Secretary for Exiting the European Union resigned today because he could not support the deal he was in charge of negotiating.
That sentence sums up Brexit perfectly.

Synopsis: Yaz convinces the Doctor to take the TARDIS back to the day of the Partition of India so she can find out more about her grandmother.  This, as it turns out, may not be the best of ideas…
Warning: here be spoilers.

One of the problems of having multiple companions in the TARDIS is giving each one time to be developed.  Admittedly, both RTD (Rose and Jack, Rose and Mickey) and Moffat (Amy, Rory and River, Bill and Nardole) did this.  They way they did it was to establish one companion before introducing the others.
Chris Chibnall, however, introduced three at the same time and it’s clear he wasn’t able to work it properly.  Graham and Ryan have had plenty of development.  Yaz, however, hasn’t.  Even in Arachnids in the UK, which seems as if it was supposed to be to develop her character, she didn’t.
It’s telling that there was more development for her in the first five minutes of this episode than in the rest of the series combined.  And the writer did that while managing not to neglect Ryan and Graham.
I really enjoyed this episode.  The Thajorians being reformed assassins was a nice touch and the idea that they have rededicated their lives to witnessing the deaths of those whose death may otherwise go unnoted is sweet.  Though, it does make me wonder if they ever encountered Testimony from Twice Upon a Time.
As with Rosa, this was an episode of inaction.  The Doctor had to make sure that what is supposed to happen actually does.  I do think, so close to Rosa, this is a count against the episode.  It’s nice to see, but should be used sparingly.
Partition was messy.  Which is to be expected when you’re forcibly dividing a country.  There has been some criticism of the fact that the episode didn’t show a bigger picture of what was happening, but I thought the writer made the right choice, using what happened to one family to show what was happening as a whole.
That also set up the actual bad guy of the episode.  Not the evil looking aliens, but the radicalised brother.  The scene where Prem is murdered, set up by Mannish, was heartbreaking.
It also allowed for subtle social commentary where Mannish was radicalised by radio programming.  It was well done, unlike Trump (sorry, not Trump) in AitU.
Having the Doctor conduct the wedding ceremony worked and, yes, the speech she gave about love was a bit sappy, but the episode earned it.  Nowt wrong with a bit sappy now and then.
The scene between Graham and Yaz was sweet and it was nice to see them interact just the two of them.  I’m also growing to like Graham calling the Doctor doc as well.
The music was great and I smiled when I realised that it was the theme during the end credits.
This isn’t the best episode of the series (I still think Rosa is just an overall classic episode of the show altogether) but it’s made itself comfortable as the second best.  It’ll take something special to budge it.
Next week?  Kerblam.  Which gets points already just for the title.

My work coach at the job centre is starting to really piss me off.  He wants to send me to an agency who will hopefully help me get into work with my health issues.  Problem is, I’ve got a history with this particular company.  In fact, I threatened to write to my MP about the way they treated me last time.  There’s no way I’m trusting them again.  Not with the amount of stress they put me through.  It’s supposed to be voluntary, but he just won’t accept there’s no way I’m able to trust them.
Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!
I’m currently watching series 2 of Clique.  Series 1 was good so I’m hopeful.
Sunday night I watched They Shall Not Grow Old.  It’s a documentary about WW1 by Peter Jackson.  It used footage from the Imperial War Museum, recordings of soldiers from them and the BBC.  There’s also dialogue added from getting a lip reader to work out what was said and using actors.  It is absolutely remarkable.  The transition from black and white to colourised footage is remarkably well done.  Watch it if you have the opportunity, you will not regret doing so.

OK, so I was wrong last week when I said that this was the first of a run of episodes written by guest writers.  That, is not a good thing.
Remember in my review of The Woman Who Fell to Earth when I complained about Chibnall constantly adding reasons for hating the bad guy and his species?  Substitute hating the bad guy for dangers to the ship.  Life pods gone, alien possibly destroying the ship, head office threatening to blow the ship up, no onboard controls, only pilot has a serious condition and the shortest route to where they’re going is through an asteroid field, it’s less adding to the tension and more that they’re stuck on the Most Unlucky Spaceship In The Galaxy.  Again, pick one or two and trust in your damn audience.
Come to that, weren’t we told that if the alarm was triggered four times then the ship would automatically blow up?  Why did that not happen?  Why bother with introducing that as a plot point and not following through?
The alien destroying the spaceship.  The Pting.  It’s absolutely adorable.  I just want to smoosh it’s cheeks and make baby sounds to it.  That’s it in the entry pic.  That pic is supposed to be it at it’s most frightening.  It’s still cute.  My friends boyfriend, however, found it to be completely hilarious.  How seriously can we then take it as a threat when it’s not in the slightest bit frightening?  Yes, Monty Python had a cute fluffy rabbit that was a killer, but that was done for comedy.
Now for my big bugbear of this episode.  The pacing.  Chibnall has always had pacing issues in his episodes and now I have a clear demonstration of it.  The lecture about the anti-matter drive.  It added nothing to the episode.  It had no relevance to anything whatsoever.  It didn’t figure in the resolution of the episode.  All it really did was grind the episode to a halt at a moment when they’re supposed to be moving fast to do what was needed.  Completely ridiculous.
The pregnant man could have been removed completely.  All it was there for was for the dissonance of a pregnant man and to add to the Ryan father issues storyline.
I like the actress, but Yaz could just not appear in any more episodes and nothing would be lost.
Yet, for all the complaints I have of this episode, it’s still not the worst episode this series thus far.  Which is saying something.

Today is payday, so I got up early to head over to Stockton.  I had a list of things I wanted to get:

the second issue of the MST3K comic (the reason I was heading to Stockton, the only comic shop in Boro that does new releases doesn’t have it,
a new pair of shoes (my Army boots have finally given up the ghost)
cigarette papers and filters
a cheap watch (really don’t need an expensive one)
ingredients to make slow cooked sweet and sour chicken
see if I could get the new Stephen Fry book cheap

The comic shop didn’t have the comic, the only shoe shop where I could afford new shoes didn’t have the only pair I liked in my size, the Poundland there didn’t have the skins or the filters, I couldn’t find the watch I was planning to get and there’s no way I could afford the book from the one shop that actually had it.
I came home, 5 hours later with sore feet, issue 2 of the Stranger Things comic and the cooking ingredients.
I could have saved some time, gone into Boro town centre and got more done that I needed to.
I then decided to look for a book when I got back home.  It’s released (or possible re-released, it’s a mite fuzzy) over here today so i~ was going to see if I could get it online cheap.  Problem is, I can’t remember the fucking name of either book or author.  I know what the cover looks like, I know what the book is about, just none of the info I need to actually find the thing.

Sunday was the League Cup semi final.  We were absolutely battered all game and still somehow managed to win 1-0.  Not quite sure how that happened, but there you go.  Probably because their strikers favourite position was offside.

Sigh.
I’ve finally worked out what my problem with Chris Chibnall’s episodes of the show are.  All they are are a collection of scenes with a lose narrative stringing them together.  There are concepts that sound good in theory but don’t quite work in practice.
This weeks episode was a complete mess.  There was no real ending to the story.  Some of the spiders were lured to the panic room using the power of Stormzy (more on that later) and then, what?  Left to die after all the food is eaten?  The pound store Trump (more on that later) defied the Doctor to shoot the biggest spider (more on that later) and…  Escapes.  Seriously?  There’s no punishment for what he did?  Never mind the spider that was trapped in the flat.
I keep hearing that Chibnall concentrated on characterisation over story but it still feels that he has no real idea about the Doctor.  His Doctor, remember, he created this version of the character.  There was more development in the Graham/Ryan relationship than there was for Yaz and this was an episode with her family.
Stormzy?  Really?  That’s going to date the episode badly.  I get that they needed something that was base heavy, but why not classical music?
The American businessman.  Did you get it?  He’s Trump!  I know, I know, it was very subtle, I wouldn’t be surprised if you missed it.  /s
The Doctors anti-gun morality is getting ridiculous.  ?People were complaining that it was so in The Ghost Monument, but I’m struggling to see why the spider being shot was such a bad idea.  It was suffering, it would have died a much more painful death and what happened it is was merciful, whatever the Doctor thinks.  There’s being anti-gun and there’s being ridiculous about it.
On the upside, the new Time Vortex looks awesome and I love the idea of a sort of central exchange to it.  Plus the next four episodes aren’t written by Chibnall so there should be an improvement.

Wow.  Just wow.  This was an episode I was worried about.  There was so much potential for4 so much to go horribly wrong.  Yet, it got everything absolutely right.
There tends to be a problem when shows, particularly family shows, to play things down when it comes to dealing with racism.  Particularly when it’s historic racism, they will say that most are bad, but there were some good people.
This episode, however, was unflinching.  It pulled no punches.  Montgomery was not a nice place to be black in 1955.  It’s not just the “Whites Only” signs or Ryan being threatened with a lynching.  It’s a police officer saying that a victim of assault actually assaulted an upstanding citizen because of the colour of their respective skin.  It’s a bus driver saying that black people will never get to sit where they want on a bus.
It’s not just overt racism, it’s casual.
The discussion between Yaz and Ryan behind the bins was telling.  The civil rights movement did change things, but it’s not perfect yet.  Getting there?  Yes, but not yet.  The scene when they’re first on the bus, when Yaz is wondering if she’s not coloured enough to be made to sit at the back was also interesting.
This episode was also interesting in that, on a show which is all about change it’s all about inertia.  It’s about making sure things stayed as they are.  This set up the scene at the end where the main characters had to act against their nature in order for the right thing to be done.
Parks herself doesn’t lose her agency.  It’s not an episode where the Doctor has to ensure that she refuses to move.  All the Doctor does is make sure the conditions are correct for Parks to choose to do that herself.
There was humour in the episode, though.  When the Doctor winds brian up about Bansky, for example, or when Ryan says it’s OK that the restaurant doesn’t serve negros because he doesn’t eat them.  And particularly when he realises he’s just excused himself to Martin Luther King because Rosa Parks wants a word.
The villain was a bit one note, but then the villain doesn’t need to be more than that.  I’m glad that he didn’t get a big speech explaining why he’s doing what he is.  He doesn’t deserve it.  You don’t get to explain or try and justify racism.
The acting was superb.  Vinette Robinson was outstanding as Parks.  The cinematography was superb as it has been all series.  The music was good.  I didn’t even really mind the song at the end (though have to agree with one person I read who said it would have been more powerful with a recitation of Still I Rise by Maya Angelou instead).
Malorie Blackman should be proud of what she’s done.  Her first Doctor Who episode and it’s a classic.
I also have to give credit to Chris Chibnall.  I know I’ve had a go at him for the first two episodes (and I still he deserves that) but he was the one who OK’d this episode to begin with, he approved the final script.  It’s incredibly brave, especially considering all the moans about SJW’s taking over the show with identity politics because the Doctor is a woman.  He’s earned praise for this episode.

I was supposed to get a call about a job.  I went to the shop underneath the flat to get baccy (not strictly legal baccy, but a lot cheaper than elsewhere) and the guy behind the till took my number and said I’d get a call.  Watch this, it’ll happen tomorrow when I’m using my phone to cast Netflix.
I really want to get my sodding laptop working again.
Need to get in touch with a friend to get a bunch of kids books she’s giving to me.  Not for me, obviously, by my youngest nephew and niece love reading, so I’m going to give the books to them.
Sunday, joy of joys, one of the few Formula 1 races I’ll get to watch live this season clashes with the new Doctor Who.  So I’ll be watching the race live on delay on the +1 channel.
Makes me smile: Dumb criminals. Like, really dumb criminals

Synopsis: You tell me , we’ll both know.  This is not a good thing.
Let’s start with the good:
The new opening titles and theme tune.  After being completely missing last week (though they did have a version of the theme during the end credits), this week it’s the very first thing on the screen and:

It is a thing of beauty and a joy forever.  The actual theme already gets points for getting rid of the stupid fanfare at the beginning that Gold was weirdly in love with, despite the fact it didn’t work.  I love the dip before the theme proper starts and the main bit of the theme sounds like it’s going right back to the shows start while being utterly it’s own thing.  The graphics might be missing the big floaty head, but it’s gorgeous to look at.
Jodie Whittaker is great as the Doctor.  Bradley Walsh is coming into his own as Graham.
It looked amazing.
The bad:
Where the fuck is the story?  Seriously, where is it?  The episode was six people going from point A to point B with minimal obstacles in the way.  There was no real sense of peril.
Weren’t two of them racing?  Where was the race?  Why were they not doing more to get ahead of each other?
Exposition.  So much bloody exposition.  This is where Chibnall being good at writing crime drama comes through.  It’s OK to have some exposition, but it took up large chunks of the time.
Yet another thing getting implanted to people without their permission.  Don’t have the translators, have it that the TARDIS is translating for people, just the Doctor doesn’t know it yet.  Incidentally, wouldn’t the translators be taken out by the EMP?
More fun?  The Doctor isn’t shown that the Ghost Monument is the TARDIS.  Have her, Yaz, Ryan and Graham follow the other two in the hope of convincing the guy running the race to help them out.  He refuses, the other two teleport, the Doctor doesn’t know what to do then you hear a familiar “Vworp, vworp”.  How much better would that have been?
Dodgy editing again.
The TARDIS.  She’s redecorated.  I really don’t like it.  I saw set photos and was convinced I might like it more lit up.  I don’t.  It looks half finished, as if the designer started working on it at 4:55pm on a Friday and left for the Bank Holiday weekend.  The addition of the actual box doesn’t work and the whole thing looks cramped.  I’m not going to compare it to the immediate previous design, because I believe that to be the single best TARDIS design ever, but it’s worse than any other TARDIS design I’ve seen.
The Stenza got mentioned again.  Oh, joy.  They were barely strong enough to hold up an episode, they’re nowhere near strong enough to hold up being the big bad.
The Timeless Child has potential, but how many names does the Doctor need?  She’s getting as bad as Danerys Tangeryn.
I’m going to say it again, Chris Chibnall is not a good writer for Doctor Who.  On the evidence thus far, he’s not convincing me otherwise.
Oh, joy.  Rosa Parks next week.  On the upside, it’s written by Malorie Blackman (though, sigh, Chibnall is credited as co-writer).  On the downside?  It’s talking about a fundamental moment in the civil rights movement.  I’m sure there’s no way it can go wrong…

Today is Mental Health Awareness Day.  To honour this, our esteemed Prime Minister announced the creation of the position of suicide prevention minister.  So, as is par for the course when May announces something like this, it quickly emerged that the new minister had joked about throwing herself of a notorious suicide spot.
This would be a good point for me to repeat my long standing position.  If anyone reading this ever feels like getting anything off their chest, if there’s something bothering you and you feel you can’t talk to anyone else about it, leave a private note and offload to me.
I’m watching This Is Us.  It’s a bit strange because I’m watching the latest episode from the States which I, ahem, acquire and I’m also watching season 2 as it’s being broadcast over here.  The episode I’m watching now is the latter.
Not sure yet where I’m spending Christmas.  I asked my mum on Sunday if her and dad are coming down to Gateshead between Christmas and New Year and she said she doesn’t know.  Hopefully I find out Sunday.
Spoke to my best friend earlier.  Really need to meet up with her at some point.
I’m now collecting two comics.  The MST3K one and the Stranger Things one.
Things that make me smile.  This in a local newspaper:

And the TV show Old Folks Home for 4 Year Olds.  I didn’t watch the first series, but seeing the kids and the pensioners interact is brilliant.  Some of the stuff the kids come out with is cute as well.  Brilliant show.

So, this is something new I want to do here.  The plan is to review every new episode of Doctor Who.  Naturally, there’ll be spoilers.

Synopsis: A mysterious thing appears in a forrest and another mysterious thing crashes into a train.  Coincidence, or are the two related and how does the woman who crashed through the train roof fit into things?
I’ll start by talking about the good.
 
Jodie Whittaker is outstanding as the Doctor.  I was never one of the people who thought her casting would be thew absolute ruin of the show, there’s no reason why a woman couldn’t play the role and I knew she was a good actress.  But she blew me away with a performance that invoked the previous actors in the role but was wholely her own.  Looking forward to seeing how she develops further.
I may not be keen on the design of the new Sonic Screwdriver, but I did love the scene where it was made.
The new version of the theme tune sounds amazing and is a great throwback to the theme of old while still being updated.  I loved the score as a whole, come to that.  A nice change from Murray Gold who I think probably hung on a bit too long.
The design of the bad guy and the bundle of coils were cool.
The episode in general looked good.
Now for the bad.  Hoo, boy.
The design of the ship used by the bad guy was bad.  I mean, all I could think about was how long it would take me to get through a Hershey’s Kiss that size, which is probably not the desired reaction.
Not sold on Ryan having dispraxia.  After making a big deal about it in the opening, it seemed to basically disappear.
Not sold on the new companions, yet.  Maybe that’ll come.  I hope it does anyway.
Now, Chris Chibnall is not a writer I’m keen on.  His episodes of Life on Mars were good.  Broadchurch series 1 was good.  That’s the extent of the praise I can give him.
In particular, his episodes of Doctor Who have never really impressed me.  The one I liked most was Dinosaurs on a Spaceship, which is about as good as you might expect from an episode of a TV show with that particular title.
Now, before him being mediocre wasn’t that big a deal.  It was one or two episodes from an entire series.  Now, he’s the boss.  He’s not only writing most of the episodes but also in charge of the general direction of it.  When he held that position on Torchwood, the results were not good.
So, he had a pretty big job to convince me he was the right pick for the job.  Convincing me had to start with this episode.
What I got was an average Chibnall episode of Doctor Who.  Nowhere near clear enough.  It had the pacing issues that his episodes tend to have (42, I’m looking directly at you with this).  There was a lot of exposition by the bad guy.
Grace’s death didn’t shock me.  It didn’t make me sad.  As soon as it became obvious that she was more adventurous than Graham, it was also obvious she had to die.
Holy hell, can we please stop with the post-regen Doctor acting strange because of the regen thing already?  We’ve seen it with every regen since the show returned.  It’s getting lazy, as way of not having to bother with the actual character.  Say what you will about the McGann movie, at least it got that much right.
Now, we have to talk about the bad guy.  First of all, the Tim Shaw bit went on far too long.  Secondly, just how badly did Chibnall want to make sure we knew him and his race were evil?  He kept piling things on.  By the time it was revealed he was cheating in the test, I rolled my eyes.  When he revealed that they kept the abducted in stasis just between life and death I thought “Of course they fucking do”.
My problem with this is that it’s a sign that the writer lacks confidence.  Either they are not confident that they have written the character well enough or it’s that they’re not confident that the audience will get the point and have to keep layering things on.  What you end up with is a caricature, almost a parody.  Pick 3 things, stick with them and trust the audience.
(It’s worth noting that I’m a huge JK Rowling fan but she’s guilty of exactly the same thing with Matthew in the Strike novels.)
I’m not at the point of hate watching or even giving up altogether on the show.  But, if this is a sign of how thi9ngs will go, I’m not much looking forward to the Chibnall reign.

This weekend is the Middlesbrough Art Weekender.  It’s not been going long, in fact this was the second time it’s been run.
There was one thing I was interested, something called SONIC Crossing at the Transporter Bridge.  On the way there, I ran into another thing I was interested in doing, but didn’t know where I’d find it.  It’s called Pedlin Presses.  It’s basically a printing press, old fashioned hand cranked, on a bicycle going round town.  I know the guy running it from other stuff.  He asked if I wanted to make a press, I said yes and the result is the picture above.  There’s only going to be 100 of them made and mine is number 25.  Now to see if I can find a nice frame to put it in.
I then went to the Transporter Bridge.  The thing there was underwhelming, to be honest.  It was basically listening to the noise of the bridge crossing the river on an iPad as the bridge is crossing the river.
Yeah.
It turned out that wasn’t the end of me and art this weekend.  I went to the supermarket to pick up a couple of things and found this:

 
Cute, isn’t it?  Written on the bottom were instructions to take a pic, upload it to Instagram with a particular hashtag and hide it someone else.  And, thus, I was actively involved in a second art project.  How could I not follow the instructions.
Something that,s been on my mind.  It’s really makes me smile that so many businesses are starting to run Autism Friendly Hour.  It’s a small thing, it doesn’t affect most of their customers one way or another but it does make life a little easier for people whose lives aren’t easy.  There’s so much shit stuff happening in the world, it’s sometimes hard to remember that nice stuff can happen as well.  Particularly now, I think it’s important to remind people of that.

Now, you may have noticed that my last entry was entirely bereft of mentions of my new piercing. 
That would be because the piercing fell out.
When I went back to point out that this happened and maybe they could help me out, I was basically told “shit happens”.
So, went to somewhere else today and…

got a new, new piercing.
Told the new piercer what happened and she said that a piercing shouldn’t really fall out after less then a fortnight.

Seriously, look up ISO3013.  You can thank me later.
As you can see, I did dye my hair.
I’ve been getting a fair bit of writing done.  I’m writing at least once a day.  It’s going well.
As I write, I actually listen to podcasts.  I’ve got a lot of them that I always planned to listen to but have not yet got round to, so I’m correcting that.  I’m currently listening to Getting Curious with Jonathan Van Ness.  It’s interesting, if only because he’s not afraid to admit ignorance.
(If anyone is thinking of making a podcast, please keep the length down.  I have one that’s dedicated to Norse Mythology, which I’m interested in, but most episodes are 2 hours plus.  That’s ridiculous.)
The Apprentice starts tonight.  The main reason I watch is so i can text my friend and take the piss out of them.
OK, I go now.

Pic is a close up of my ear.  Yup, that be the new piercing.  When I get the bar changed, I’m going to get a closed hoop put in place instead.  It’ll be more noticeable and what’s the point of having a piercing like that if people can’t see it?
The title was the motto of a good friend who died recently and is absolutely true.  It also happens to be true.
At the moment, I’m watching Later… with Jools Holland.  This show is an absolute gem on the schedule.  The amount of singers and bands that have made their TV debut on this show is staggering and you get a great, eclectic mix of music styles.  I’ve discovered some of my favourite bands and singers through this show.
As you can tell from the pic, my hair is currently three toned due to it having grown it out since I dyed it last.  I waqs thinking of cutting it, but I like it this length (apart from when it goes floofy after washing it).  So, my current plan is to buy black hair dye and dye it all one colour.l  I’m not particularly bothered by the grey, it’s the blond I want shot of.
I got my new printer ink.  Eventually.  It was supposed to arrive on Thursday.  Then I got an email saying it wouldn’t arrive then after all.  Then an email saying it would.  Eventually got here on Friday.  Problem now is, my printer thinks there’s a paper jam when there’s not.
Ever seen Office Space?  Yeah, there’s one scene in particular I’ve been tempted to recreate.
Started listening to the new season of Serial.  Thus far, I’m really enjoying it.  I would say that it’s much better than season 2, but that’s not a particularly high bar to clear.

So, something I did while I was away from ODland was make my own pasta sauce.  I tend to make pasta and sauce when I’m really short on cash, simply because it’s cheap.  I decided to try making my own pasta sauce because a) I have a slow cooker and should be able to make it in that, b) I can freeze some of it, c) it might work out cheaper and d) why the fuck not?
Turns out that, for th4e price of a decent jar of the pre-made stuff (does 2 meals) I could make three jars of the home made stuff.
Problem was, that I bookmarked the recipe on my laptop and when I decided to make more today (I’m down to my last jar) I couldn’t find it again.
I found a new recipe and made it today.  The result is in the pic.  It tastes OK.  I followed the recipe exactly (which I always do when cooking something for the first time) and it makes a great base to be going on with.  Probably try adding a red wine stock thing next time, probably in place of the paprika.
Had to shout at the bank yesterday.  I got a text from them last week saying they don’t suspect fraud on my account but, in an abundance of caution, they were replacing my bank card.  Unfortunately, they cancelled my old bank card before I got the new one, meaning that when I bought new printer ink (I finally got my money from YouGov) the payment was refused.  It also stopped me from using the mobile contactless through the mobile app and, when I tried to phone them about this through the app yesterday, I still had to go through the security checks.  Which isn’t supposed to happen, as logging into the app is supposed to pre clear me.  They tried arguing that I should wait 10 days to use both again.  I pointed out that I refused to wait, seeing as I never actually wanted a new card to start with and they sorted it instantly, though the guy was struggling to understand that I couldn’t restart the mobile i was using to call him and stay on the line at the same time.
I also got the ink ordered.
Submitted a story that’s very close to my heart for a competition today (me and this story have a long history that I might write about sometime if anyone is interested).  I should hear next month about another competition I entered.
I also should get my new smart watch this week.  More about that if it actually arrives.

(The caption on that picture is “Larva Lamp”)
So I’ve been thinking about getting a new piercing for a while.  I wasn’t particularly fussed what kind of piercing, except it wouldn’t be a nipple or a Prince Albert.
I was wandering round town yesterday, getting stuff I needed, buying stuff that I probably didn’t but wanted and could get cheap (Codename Villianelle, the books that Killing Eve is based on, for example) and getting frustrated that the only comic book shop in town that does new releases no longer has any copies of issue one of the MST3K comic in stock when I noticed somewhere that was doing rook piercings for a fiver.
I thought about it and thought about it and eventually decided that as I was definitely going to get the piercing at some point before the offer stopped, I may as well just get it done and over with.
Filled out the form, paid the money and five minutes later I had a new bit of metal in my head.  I’ll post a pic just as soon as I resize it so that I can upload it to the site (at the moment, it’s too big).  In the meantime, here it is on my instagram.
I then went, as is normal for me after getting a tat or piercing, for a couple of pints.
I have to go back in ten weeks to get the piercing replaced (probably going to get a ring instead of a bar), I have to clean it using a saline solution and I can’t sleep with that side of my face on the pillow.  I also can’t use my Bluetooth headphones nor wear my wired headphones the way I usually do.
Still worth it, though.

I’m writing this using my TV as a monitor and a keyboard on my lap.
In other words, it’s only gone and bloody worked, hasn’t it?
Had a bit of fun getting the keyboard though.  My original plan was to get it from a shop near the flat for a fiver.  You know how a shop has plenty of something you want until you have the money to get it?  Well, this shop went one better and decided to close before I could get the money I needed.

And thus it was that I spent two sodding hours wandering round town to0 see if I could find anywhere that did sell USB keyboards.  Eventually, after thinking I would need to order one online to pick up tomorrow, I found one for 50p more than I was expecting to pay.
I went to a free advance screening of A Simple Favor tonight.  It’s actually a damn good thriller.  I’ve had a parmo and am now waiting for This Is Us to start.  I’ve already seen all of season 2 but still watching it again.
Almost finished reading the new Cormoran Strike novel.  It’s damn good thus far.
Need to phone my best friend tomorrow and see if she’s up for a visit on Friday.  I’m heading over her way anyway so might as well drop in.
Remember me saying I took pictures of street art while back home?  Well, you can see the pictures hereabouts and morehere.  Fair warning, there’s a lot.

The photo I took of Philip Pullman when I got my copy of The Golden Compass signed.
Killing Eve started on Saturday night over here.  I’ve seen it already but it’s so damn good I’m watching it again.
I had work club today.  It was my day to sign on, but my work coach is on holiday.  So, he booked me on work search.  Basically half an hour on front of a computer using the official DWP job search website.  It’s called Find a Job, which is a lie unless you are a university lecturer or work in the NHS.
Quite why anyone in that position would use their website compared to, say, a specialist website is beyond me.
I’m not in a rush to repeat the experience.  The computers were old and use Internet Explorer.  But I repeat myself.
I get the new Strike novel tomorrow!  That’ll be getting read straight through when I get it home.
I’m permanently knackered at the moment.  Not sure why, it occasionally happens to me.  Not helping with my overall health issues though.

I think I may have a solution to my writing problem.
I now have a cable that lets me connect USB to my tablet.  So, if I get a USB keyboard, connect that to my tablet, I should be able to use that to type instead of pecking away on the keyboard on the tablet screen.
Admittedly, I don’t have a keyboard, but I think there’s a shop near me that sells them for a fiver.
Of course, a Bluetooth keyboard would be better, but there’s no way I could afford a decent one.
I wouldn’t even need to use the screen on the tablet.  I can cast it to my telly and turn it into a 42 inch monitor.

In another installment of “Will Forbes and his technology sucking”, while I was back home my Bluetooth headset decided to join my two laptops on the broken pile.  I’ve got plenty of wired headphones, but I hate wearing them.
Enter Ipsos.  I’ve signed up with them to take surveys and I had aquired enough points to get a £10 Amazon gift card.  I did so and got myself a new set of Bluetooth headphones.  They aren’t quite the style I like, but still.
I had some money left over so, of course, I left it for spending later.  Only kidding, I bought myself the third book in Malcolm Mackay’s Glasgow Trilogy.
I also do surveys for Yougov and am 3 points away from another £50 from them.  That’ll likely pay for new ink for the printer.
I actually went to the cinema on Monday night.  I got a free ticket to see King of Thieves which is based on the Hatton Garden raid.  It’s a decent heist flick, even if I was distracted by Charlie Cox not being Matt Murdock.

At the moment, it’s ten past three in the am.  So, naturally, I’m still awake and re-watching A Very English Scandal.  I’m currently reading the books as well.  It’s utterly fascinating.
I finished watching the second season of Iron Fist today.  It’s much, much better than season 1 and I say that as someone who actually liked season 1.
I can access my TV shows!  I moved them all to my 4tb external drive.  It won’t work when plugged into the telly.  But it did work on my laptop.  I combined that with my Chromecast and with Videostream to watch things.  Course, that worked as long as my laptop did.
I recently got myself a cable to connect USB drives to my phone and tablet and it also allows me to plug in a charger.  The charger gives my external drive enough power for it to work when plugged into my charger.  Woot!
I’m off to the cinema on Monday.  I got free tickets for a film about the Hatton Garden raid.

Hello there!
So, got my laptop fixed, now it’s fucked again.  The main problem with it, to be honest is old age.  At the moment, I have no money to either repair nor replace.  It’s annoying when I’m job hunting. 
It’s even more annoying when I want to write.  I’ve got an idea for a novel, just doing a bit of research for it.  I’ve also entered one writing competition and am entering a second.
With the first one, a friend tagged me on a post on Facebook about it as they had a limited number of free entry places for people on low budgets. I emailed and they gave me a place.  I was given a character, a location and an item to include in the story.  It was just as I was getting ready to write this that my computer broke.  I hand wrote the story, went round to a friends house to type it up (that was an interesting and frustrating experience), sent to to people for feedback, printed it out at my parents to edit, got the edits typed up on the computers at the central library and submitted it on the day of deadline.
I’m mostly pleased with the story.  My main issue is the main characters name, which I could do fuck all about.
The second competition is due in at the end of the month.  Another friend posted it on my FB wall and, again, I’m getting the entry fee waived.  This time, I can submit what I want.  So, I’m using an old, old story of mine that I thought I had lost on an old computer but had, as it turns out, backed up online.  I printed it out at the library today (cost me £2.30, could print it out at home but have run out of black ink in my printer and can’t afford more) and have sent it to people for feedback.  If any of you can give me feedback in the next two weeks, leave a private note with your email address and I’ll send it over.
What else.  Got new Friday 13th ink.  It’s in the entry pic.  Also, went home for the weekend, took a shitload of pics of street art in Aberdeen (will post them here if I ever get the laptop back up and running, or might make an Imgur album and post the link).  Got so e much wanted nephews and niece time and got royally pissed off with my brother and sister in law.
Anyway, gonna finish up.

My laptop is in to be repaired.  I can’t wait until I get it back.  I’ll find out tomorrow when that’ll be, hopefully.
I’m not sure what’s going to happen to my diary.  I had to cancel my subscription until I got my money sorted out and getting my laptop fixed has put the kybosh on renewing it.  And the free month is up soon.
Actually, need to fill out a support ticket, I never did get a refund after cancelling.

Random bits and bobs while watching Arrested Development.
I must admit that I’m bummed about Roseanne getting axed.  Don’t get me wrong, what she said was absolutely reprehensible and I don’t think that ABC made the right choice as much as the only choice they could make.  But, I was a fan of the show back in the day and loved the reboot.
There’s also the fact that there was something kinda inevitable about what happened.
I watched a fascinating documentary about Miranda Barbour earlier on.  I’m not sure what to make of her and the question of if she’s a serial killer or not.  It’s intriguing.  I’m kinda leaning towards liar.
Stayed up last night to watch the Scotland game.  Kinda wish I hadn’t really, but there you go.  Actually, I didn’t so much stay up as I’m usually up at that time anyway.
Anyone keeping up with this thing in Ukraine?  Where they pretended that a Russian journalist had been killed?  Pretty fucked up and I’m guessing that he’s not going home anytime soon.
Holy hell am I ever sick of explaining to people why what Tommy Robinson did was wrong and why he deserves to get banged up for it.

I can explain my title.
I can has broadband!  I can has a working laptop!  Well, mostly anyway.  I can has beer!  I can has Scotland on the telly!
Shit, never explained about the laptop.  Was going to before Yaffa died and I need to write about her.
So, not Sunday but the Sunday before, my laptop died.  It just died.  OK, I spilt Dr Pepper on it.  I was shitting myself, because there was no way I could afford to either repair or replace.  Then, about Wednesday last week, the screen started flashing on and off.  Then on Saturday afternoon, it took me to a screen to set the date and time and kept cycling through to that.  Then, very early Sunday morning, it kicked into life!  One of the USB ports doesn’t work anymore, but I can live with that.
Can’t wait until I can afford a subscription again.  Still waiting on a refund on cancelling my last one, kinda feels like I’ve paid for something I’m not getting.
I decided on Netflix over the WWE Network.  The only thing I’d really watch on the latter are PPVs and NXT and both of them I can get by, how can I put this, less than legal methods.  There’s a lot of things I need to catch up on (3%, iZombie), so, naturally, I went with the first episode of Discovery to check if the Klingon subtitles (it is) and rewatch Mad Men.  Though I did watch The Toys That Made Us.
Saturday night, i went out for a drink or ten with my best friend and watch the football.  I hadn’t seen her since January so it was a much needed catch up.  Her fiancee met up with us for the Champions League final.  I ended the night with a new pint glass.  (Seriously, the majority of glasses I own are “liberated” from pubs).
Oh, i actually have an album on CD.  The new Frank Turner album came out a couple of weeks ago (highly recommended) and, as it’s called Be More Kind, someone on the Frank Turner Army FB page decided to buy a copy for someone.  I messaged them and he decided I would be the lucky recipient.
So, there’s that.

This weekend wasn’t the best for me.  I’ll likely talk more about most of it later.
Because today I found out that Yaffa Phillips died.
(I know that none of you knew Yaffa, but I didn’t want to just refer to her using pronouns.)
I met Yaffa at an event called Boro Tweetup.  I liked her immediately, which, to be honest, wasn’t hard to do.  She was funny, geeky, creative and energetic.
Like me, she was an outsider who fell in love with Teesside.  She was from New York and moved over to marry someone she met on IRC.  And she did love the area, it wasn’t just because she ran the Love Middlesbrough social media accounts.  She genuinely loved the place.
She loved live music.  I’d often get messages telling me about gigs or offering tickets.  I’d also randomly bump into her at events.
We weren’t close friends, but we did keep in touch online.  Last time I saw her was when I volunteered to let her take pictures with me in them to promote the town.  Yaffa was her usual energetic self, running around convincing people tonket her take pictures of their pets and corralling businesses into helping her.  It was a fun afternoon.
Fuck cancer.
Three things I’ll remember her for:
– Her smile.  It would brighten up any room and was never anything but genuine.
– Hats.  Funny hats, to be exact.  Rarely did you meet her on a night out where she didn’t have silly headgear.  When I’m able to post pics here again, I’ll post one of my favourite pics of me.  I’m wearing a white shirt, suit jacket, bow tie and Christmas tree headband.
– Dreidels.  Yaffa was Jewish, so every year at the Christmas Boro Tweetup she would bring her box of dreidels and let us play with them.
RIP Yaffa Phillips.  You were, are and always will be loved and you are and always will be missed.

Thank god for the royal wedding. Not that I actually watched it, I really couldn’t care less, but town wasn’t as busy as it usually is on a Saturday.
I’ve had to change ISP. It’s slightly annoying at the moment. My new router is set up, it’s getting a broadband signal but there’s no internet yet. Grrrrrrrr! So, at the moment I’m tethering my laptop to my tablet and using the 4G on that. Though I’m lucky I can even do that right now. More on that later.
My new ISP is also my mobile phone company, so I’m getting an extra 5 gig of mobile data on my phone. Which I won’t really need as my phone will mostly be connected to the wifi, but whatever. Still cool.
I’ve been surprisingly busy this week. Last Saturday I went to an event run by Middlesbrough Institute of Modern Art. It started with a talk by the people running the event, where the pic in this entry was taken (the salmon fan is used to determine the shade of salmon produced by salmon farms). From there we went to Middlehaven, the Tees Barrage, the beach and RSPB Sandholme. It was an interesting and educational day. I also managed to raise a fair bit for Habitat for Humanity using the Charity Miles app.
Saturday night was, of course, Eurovision night. The British entry involved a stage invasion, the presenters ranged from good to god awful and the results threw up a fair few surprises. My personal favourite song didn’t win, but I like the song that did. It’s not as good as last years winner (which I still absolutely adore), but I do like it. It’s really divided the fans though. The amount of salt from people that didn’t like it is incredible. Here, for your delectation, is this years winning Eurovision song:

Monday was my appointment for claiming JSA. Which went about as I was expecting. The only good news to come out of it is that, as my next signing date is actually bank holiday Monday I don’t need to go back for another month.
Yesterday was interesting. I got a text message telling me that they were going to be paying me a weeks money, on which I have to survive a fortnight. Great. Then my mobile phone company cut my service. And I didn’t have the full amount to give them. Thankfully, they took mercy on me, reconnected my services and put a note on the system saying not to cut me off for another two weeks.
I’ve worked out that I should be able to afford one subscription service for here on. The only question is if I should go with the WWE Network or Netflix. The former would give me access to PPV’s and NXT, but I know I’ll get more use out of the latter.
We’ll see.

This is a sequel of sorts to this entry.
We’re coming up on Mental Health Awareness week.  And there was a big reminder of why this is so important this week with the suicide of Scott Hutchison, lead singer of Frightened Rabbit.
I’ve not actually listened to any of their stuff but the reaction reminds me of when I found out that Kurt Cobain killed himself.
There’s still a stigma around mental health.  It’s changing but slowly.  Far, far too slowly for my taste.
I don’t get it.
I just don’t fucking get it.
You would never, ever, ever say to someone with their arm in a sling or their leg in plaster that their injury is fake.  You would never say to someone with cancer that if they just picked themselves up it would go away.
Yet there are people who think comments like that are fair to make when it comes to mental health issues.  Are they buggery.
So, to reiterate the title of this entry: it’s OK to not be OK.  Anyone who tries to tell you otherwise isn’t someone you want or need in your life.
Finally, I’m going to make an offer.  And this is not just for this entry, it’s completely open ended.  If you need to talk to someone, if there’s anything you need to get off your chest and you feel that there’s no-one you can talk to, you can talk to me.  Leave a private note and unload.  There’ll be no judgement.  There will be advice if needed or asked for and there will be support and love in every case.
I got you.

So, turns out that my body may not like getting things done. I had the absolute worst stomach ache I’ve ever experienced. In fact, it was the worst pain of any kind I’ve ever experienced. That wiped out Friday as well. With it being a bank holiday weekend, I couldn’t do anything until today.
Still, phoned today to go back onto JSA. Thankfully, it’s not actually Universal Credit, which is one of those things that sounds like a good idea until the government manages to completely screw things up.
I’m making my way though Mythos. It’s good thus far. Just got past Prometheus betraying Zeus to give fire to Man, Pandora and her pot and Persephone and the creation of the seasons. If you’re at all interested in Greek mythology, I highly recommend this book.
It’s Eurovision week!

If you’re a long time reader, you’ll know I’m a huge Eurovision geek. I love it. And not ironically, not in a “so bad it’s good” way, I genuinely do love it. Portugal is hosting this year and one of the hosts is Kenzie from NCIS: LA.
The first semi final was tonight and already there’s a contender for the worst lyric I’ve heard this week (Luna, moon me up) and a song that, even by Eurovision standards, is completely bizarre. I was actually able to vote this time (Britain doesn’t actually compete in the semi finals) and the two songs I voted for both qualified for the final on Saturday.
I’ll leave you with last years winner, which is a song of absolute beauty:

(I love Private Eye. I wish I could afford a subscription, it is definitely worth it.)
I’ve got past the “drink heavily and listen to loud angry music” phase and have moved on to doing stuff.
I’ve written to the tribunal service and requested the statement of records and record of proceedings from them. When they come though, I’ll go to Citizens Advice and see if there’s any grounds to appeal further. I’ve let the council know what has happened so my housing benefits won’t be stopped. I need to call Newcastle courts about getting the money they’ve taken from me back and see if I can get a copy of the ticket they supposedly gave me for the court case end of next month as well. And I still need to sign on for Universal Credit, which I’m not looking forward to.
Still, getting things done.
I’ve not had a particularly good few days stomach wise. Probably the stress.
Someone on Twitter was kind enough to buy me Mythos by Stephen Fry to cheer me up. I’ve read a bit of it (I’ll finish reading it when I’ve finished Fahrenheit 451), but I’ve started it. There’s incest. There’s a hell of a lot on incest.
New Frank Turner tomorrow! And, season 4 of Arrested Development remix!

(I know I’ve used that image before, but it’s fitting for this entry.)
I’ve always been a listening post for my friends.  I don’t mind, except when they’re so busy moaning to me to realise I occasionally need to moan at people as well (which once led me to having a meltdown in a pub.  Thankfully, one of my friends now holds the same position for me.  I also use this place for the same purpose).
I’d rather they get things off their chest to me than do something stupid to hurt themselves.  Plus, I’m cheaper than a therapist.  I’ve routinely managed to get my best friend from being in tears to laughing her head off.  I may not have many skills, but this is one I have and it’s one I’m never glad I have to use, but more than willing to use anyway.
So, I got a surprise when one of my friends phoned me last night.  Apart from a Happy New Year text, I’ve not actually talked to her since the end of June.  So it was a bit of a surprise.  She was in bits, saying that she feels like a failure because she never completed either of her degrees and she was feeling suicidal, thinking no-one would miss her.  I pointed out that I never finished my degree either and that she would be missed.  Eventually I got to the bottom of her problems.
It turns out she had an assessment for her ESA and had been rejected.  She’s applied for the mandatory reconsideration and was stressing about if it needs to go to a full appeal.  One of her issues is extreme anxiety and this, naturally, had triggered that.  Having gone through it myself (my hearing is actually tomorrow), I was able to sympathise, talk her through everything and promised that when she has her appeal hearing I’d go along with her (though I won’t be able to actually go into the room with her).  Eventually I manager to calm her down, though I’m going to call her later to make sure she’s OK.
As for me?  I’m fine.  My money for my phone came through end of last week so I went to see Avengers: Infinity Wars.  No spoilers, but it’s a really good film and a stunning achievement.  I also treated myself to two new books.  The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society (which I’ve read, love and really want to go and see the film) and Fahrenheit 451 (in the hope I can re-read it before the HBO movie airs).
I now have a CCTV camera trained on my front door.  The shop downstairs were broken into twice and the burglars got in through the door beside my front door.  So they’ve fitted a camera aimed at that door and, of course, it covers my door as well.  Which is useful.
As mentioned, my appeal hearing is tomorrow.  Keep your fingers crossed for me.

380,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/to-catch-a-killer-5097746/,2018-04-26,To catch a killer,"
Those of you who have been reading my diary for a while will know that I’m obsessed with serial killers, mass murderers, spree killers and religious cults.  I’m not sure why they fascinate me so much, but they do and always have.
So, I got a surprise yesterday when I discovered that the police confirmed that they had caught the Golden State Killer (also known as the East Area Rapist and the Original Night Stalker as well as, it turns out, the Visalia Ransacker.)   The case was in the spotlight recently due to the release of the book I’ll Be Gone In The Dark by the late Michelle McNamara which her husband, Patton Oswalt was publicising.(I was desperate to get my hand on it before, even more now.)
I’ll be perfectly honest, I really thought that it was a case that would never be solved, or only done so when the killer was dead.  The fact he has been caught is amazing.  The widely believed rumour (the police have not confirmed this) is that his daughter found some of his trophies and submitted to a DNA test.
And it turns out he was a police officer, sacked in 1978 for shoplifting a hammer and dog repellent, which was thought to be intended to be used in his next crime.
While we now know who, there is so much still unanswered.  Why did he escalate from voyeurism and burglary to rape and then murder?  Why were there breaks in his crimes?  (That one is likely to be due to marriage and then becoming a father.)  Why did he stop in 1986?  Why did the phone some of his victims?  Was he ever called to the scene of one of his crimes?
Sadly, he won’t be tried for all of his crimes due to the statute of limitations.  But he’s not leaving prison in anything other than a box.

(In this photo is four generations of my family on my dad’s side.  See if you can spot me.)
I had to go to court today to give my declarative statement about this bloody fine.  I got there in plenty of time, as requested, then sat for fucking ages waiting to be seen.  As always, I had a couple of books with me, so I finished rereading The Bricks That Built The Houses by Kate Tempest (highly recommended) and started rereading, for the umpteenth time, To Kill A Mockingbird.  It’s been ages since I read it and I love that book.
Eventually got called in, the statement was signed by me and one of the magistrates and I pled not guilty to the original crime.  So, now I have to go through to Newcastle at the end of June for that.
On the plus side, I now know exactly where I have to go next week for my tribunal.
The programme for the Crossing the Tees lit festival is out.  There’s a few things I’m interested in, including a murder mystery night that I’m definitely planning to go to.  There’s also a short story competition I’m considering entering with a £100 top prize.

I have been waiting for months to hear when my appeal against not getting ESA is going to be.
Getting sick of it (as well as sick in general), I decided to phone them today to find out what was happening.  It’s a good thing I did.
My appeal is set for the 30th at 4pm.  They claim they did write to me to let me know, but it wouldn’t shock me if they hadn’t to be honest.  They’re resending the letter.
If I win, which, to be honest, I should, I’ll be getting just over £3,000 from them.  Hello new TV, portable washing machine and, more than likely a new tattoo.

Now, this is the bit of having a new tattoo I didn’t miss.  The itching that I’m not allowed to scratch.  Thankfully, putting more Bepanthen on it calms it down.
I was supposed to get paid yesterday.  Well, with my bank, it’s actually on a Saturday, but officially it was yesterday.  Which resulted in my doing my favourite thing in the world, phoning the DWP and moaning at them.  What happened is that when my new sick note was scanned over on Thursday, it sat there being completely ignored, resulting in them thinking they didn’t have it.  I would say it’s just them being incompetent, but I genuinely wouldn’t be surprised if it was deliberate.
Thankfully they did get my money through the same day.  So, to cheer myself up, I bought Norse Mythology by Neil Gaiman.  I love myths and legends, I love Neil Gaimans writing so it was a no brainer.  I’m enjoying it thus far.  It’s well written and it’s also funny.
Stephen Fry has written a similar book of Greek myths and legends.  I’ll be getting that as soon as I can afford it as well.
A TV channel over here is showing ER.  They started from the beginning.  Holy hell, who on the production staff had a fetish for people waking up?  Seriously, it seems like every other episode starts with someone waking up.

I’ve gotten past “a new tattoo would be nice”, gone straight through “I want a new tattoo” and “I need a new tattoo” and have long since reached “I really, really, really need new ink, just give me new ink NOW!”  I’m happy to admit to being addicted but, hey, it’s not as bad for me as my nicotine addiction.
My mum and dad came through to Boro today and mum gave me £15 as an Eater gift.  My nephews and niece all got Easter gifts and as I’ve no kids my mum could give a gift to, I just got the money.
On Friday, the tattoo studio I usually go to is having a special Friday 13th event (as they always do), so I’ve decided that my Easter gift from my parents is going to be a new tattoo.  I’ve been looking through the flash sheets and I’ve decided on 4-5 that I might get if I’ve only got the £15 and a few in case my money from Huawei comes through.
And, yes, one of them is indeed the number 13.
I’ll be listening to this song at least once on Friday:

Cool, I can now use Courier New!  It’s my default font for just about everything, including a couple of tats I have.
So, I found out why I’ve been getting money taken off my benefits.  It turns out it’s a court fine for littering outside Newcastle Central station.  In 2013.  Now, I have absolutely no memory of this ever happening to me.  I do change trains in Newcastle whenever I go back home, so it’s not unfeasible, but I’m certain it never happened.  They were very proud of the fact that they sent 14 letters and a bailiff round, so i must know about it.  They were slightly less proud when I pointed out they never sent anything to any address I’ve actually lived at at the time.  They also assured me that I didn’t actually have to do anything as the money was coming straight off my ESA.  They were slightly perturbed when I pointed out that I was not happy about this happening at all.
So, I have to go to my local magistrates court on the 24th to make an official statement saying I have been wrongly convicted and then I’ll get the money back.
My parents are coming down sometime next week.  My brother lives with his family in a town near me, so whenever my parents come down to see the kids they come through to visit me.  They were down at the end of February, a bug swept through the two of them and my brothers family and the Beast From the East hit, so they didn’t get to come through then.  They also had to leave the caravan behind when they went home, so they’re coming back down on Monday and taking it back on Thursday.  So I’ll see them either Tuesday or Wednesday.

Something completely unexpected but delightful happened today.  I was watching a recording of a stage version of Hamlet starring Andrew Scott (Moriarty in Sherlock) when I was struck with the urge to write.  This urge got stronger until I just had to get going.  I kinda wish it hadn’t happened at 4am, particularly when I’m meeting a friend for a drink at 1pm (he’s worried about me after my bad day on Thursday), but there you go.
It’s not the novel.  It was going to be one short and has turned into 2.  The first one needs a hell of a lot of work.  The second one, I think is OK.  (At this stage, that’s a high compliment).  So, the purpose of this entry, aside from my excitement that my writing mojo has returned, is to see if anyone would be willing to read it and give me feedback.  Now, I won’t be sending it out for about a week (this is the very first draft and no-one who is not me gets to read the very first draft), but I thought I’d ask now.
If you’re interested, leave your email address as a note and I’ll send it your way.  There’s no deadline for getting it back to me but, obviously, sooner is better than later.
I’ve just found out that there’s no way to set all notes on this entry to private so, if you are leaving me your email address, don’t forget to tick the relevant box.

I’ve decided to share the recipe I’m using today for slow cook barbecue ribs.  Now, there are some complicated steps, so I’ll be as clear as I possibly can.
Ingredients:
1x rack of ribs
1x bottle of barbecue sauce (my personal preference is Sweet Baby Rays)
Instructions:

cut ribs into chunks big enough to fit in the slow cooker
pour some sauce into the slow cooker, covering the bottom of the cooker
add first lot of ribs
pour on some sauce
repeat steps 2 and 3 until all the ribs are in the cooker
pour in rest of sauce
cook on low for 6-7 hours
enjoy!

Bit of an odd way to send your message.  (Incidentally, whenever I see these, I’m reminded of a certain diarist.  I’m not sure why…)
So, for a while now, I’ve been having £5 a week taken off my ESA.  I knew I owed for a social fund payment from years back, so I just assumed it was for that and let it be.
Yesterday, I got a letter.  Detailing the money they were taking off me to pay off the loan.  Huh?  Yeahbutwhattheactualfuck?
Today, I phoned about it.  I was put from the number on the letter to a different number, to a third number back to a second one.  Turns out, the £5 a week is for a court fine from 2005.
This was a bit of a surprise.  Well, a lot of a surprise.  As far as I know, I don’t have any court fines from 2005.  As far as I know, I don’t have any bloody court fines from any time.
They gave me a reference number and sent me on my merry way.
Googled the number for the local court.  Phoned them.  The reference number isn’t one of theirs.  They gave me a different number.  Phoned them.  Got a third number.  Phoned that one.
Their systems are down, they took my details and are going to call me back.  On Tuesday, which is the earliest they can manage because of the bank holiday weekend.
The same bank holiday, mercifully, means I got paid today so i have lager, I’m going to have a can.  Or five.
It’s not all been bad today though.  I found somewhere that sells racks of ribs.  Which means I’m one ingredient away from being able to make slow cooked barbecue ribs.  I’ve been craving them for ages, so that gives me a happy.

I actually did something last night.  I got myself a free ticket for an advance screening of Ghost Stories.  It’s adapted from the stage play by the original writers and it is brilliant.  It is a horror, but there’s not much in the way of gore.  I highly recommend it.
Hoping to get more work done on the book tonight.  Hoping, remember.
I’m still waiting to hear when my appeal for my ESA is.  I’ve been waiting since October, so hopefully it’ll be soon.  Thinking about phoning up and finding out what’s happening.
I’ve got a load of podcasts I need to listen to, mostly, it must be said, true crime.  Should get on that as well.

The writing’s going well.  Which is to say, it’s going well in my own head.  I’ve got, what, five chapters and the ending plotted out there.
On paper (well, on screen) I’ve only got 2 a bit chapters.  At the moment.
Sweet, sweet procrastination and tiredness.  Neither help, you know.
New phone is still awesome.  And, at the end of the week, I’ll be able to claim my £50.  Hopefully it comes quickly so I can use some to watch Wrestlemania/get a new tattoo/both of the above.
Just decided to download and see exactly what Facebook has about me.  This should be interesting.
Billions is back!  Yay!  Trust, so far, is really good as well.

This is the wee park near the flat on Sunday.  Yes, we had more SNA!  Sadly, it didn’t stick for longer than a day.
Those of you who have read my ramblings for a while will know I’m a wrestling fan.  (And, yes, before you bother asking, I do know it’s pre-determined and no, I don’t much care.)  Yesterday, I had a massive grin on my face when it was announced that one of my favourite wrestlers, Daniel Bryan, was finally cleared to return to being an active wrestler two years after he was forced to retire.  This is great.  It’s going to be great.
Last night, a post on Reddit reminded me of an idea for a novel I came up with a while back.  I’ve been thinking about it all day and got the first chapter laid out in my head, so I’m finally going to get my writing on again.  It’s been far, far too long.
Still having fun discovering what my new phone can do.
My parents are coming back down the end of April to visit my nephew and niece and pick up the caravan after they had to leave it at the beginning of the month.  They swear they’re going to come visit me.  I’m tempted to get my mum a couple of cooking ingredients I can’t get down here.

Ha!  I’ll bet you forgot about the saga of me upgrading my phone, right?
Last time I left this tale, I had left my new phone at the shop for them to send back.  Unfortunately, that was just before the Beast from the East and Storm Emma hit, which delayed things.  Can’t really complain, EE were sensible enough to shut down their warehouse rather than make people go in when there were severe weather warnings.
Midweek I got a text saying my new contract had been cancelled.  So I had a look at the website to see if I could get something better than I was getting.  And I could.  Boy howdy, could I.
Instead of the Alcatel I was going to get, I got the Huawei P Smart.  It’s awesome.  It’s got wifi calling, which’ll come in handy and a fingerprint sensor, which opens up my phone a lot quicker then the pattern I was using before.
I’ve been having fun setting it up.
I’m glad I upgraded in the shop.  The options on the website were for 500mb of data, which is too little, or 8gb which is far too much.  In the shop, they were able to give me a contract with 4gb which is still slightly too much, but better and cheaper than the 8gb.
I did have to pay £20 upfront.  To be honest, I’d have preferred not to have to do that, but there’s an offer giving me £50 Paypal credit so they’ve basically paid me £30 for my new phone.
Hopefully the credit will be through in time for me to get new ink on the 13th of April.

There were three celebrity deaths in the UK this week.  Two people most of you haven’t heard of, one that you definitely would have.
The first one was Sir Ken Dodd.  Inhabitant of Knotty Ash, introduced the world to the Diddymen.  He was working right up to the end and his live shows were legendary.  He cared not for run times.  His shows would keep going as long as he wanted them to.  He did get into trouble with the taxman for not paying his full tax, to which he joked that he shouldn’t have to because they’re called the inland revenue and he lived by the sea.  He was also a successful singer, with his singles in the 60’s only being outsold by The Beatles.
The third was Jim Bowen.  That’s him in the picture for his show Bullseye.  A darts quiz show, famous for showing people who didn’t win the big prize what they could have won (which is kinda cruel really) and the fact the big prize was either a holiday, a car, a caravan or a speedboat.  His jokes were corny, he had a load catchphrases (can’t beat a bit of bully, let’s have a look at what you could have won and, of course, stay out of the black and into the red, nothing in this game for two in a bed).  He had a certain charm which was undeniable.
The one in between was, of course, Professor Stephen Hawking.  The phrase once in a generation mind was made to describe him.  He was absolutely exceptional, not just because of the theories he came up with, but for his writing.  He also, by all accounts, had a wicked sense of humour:

He was also an avid campaigner for the NHS, which was made prominent when a Republican in the states said that if Hawking lived in the UK and had to rely on the NHS he’d be dead, to which Hawking replied that he did live in the UK, he did rely on the NHS and he was very much alive.
They all had a good innings.  Dodd was 90, Bowen 80 and Hawking was 76 (but he was also not expected to live past 24).
To finish with, and to cheer you up after this slightly depressing entry, here’s Sir Ken Dodds best known song Happiness:

This is my latest theme of the week entry.  Because this weeks theme is about food and I love talking about food.
My favourite dish my mum made for me growing up was her spaghetti bolognaise.  To this day, if she asks me if I want a special meal, it’ll be that I ask her to cook for me.  I do actually have the recipe.  When I was in halls of residence, first year of uni, I bought three tins of tomatoes instead of three tins of beans.  Not knowing what else to do with them, I asked mum for a copy of her recipe and she sent it down.  She later admitted it was hard for her to write, because she didn’t actually measure anything.  This is a trait I’ve picked up from her.  Despite having lost the recipe years ago, I’ve memorised it and it forms the base of the one I make to this day.
Another of my favourites growing up was broth.  My mum makes good broth, but it’s not a patch on my grans.  Her broth was proper broth.  So thick you had to force your spoon into it and so, so delicious.  Sadly, I don;t have the recipe for it.  I have a recipe, that I haven’t made in years (might do again soon though).
I haven’t told mum that I preferred grans broth to hers.  My dad was stupid enough to do that the first time my mum made tattie soup for him and she refused to make it ever again.

I’m knackered.  I’m constantly knackered.  I’m getting about 8 hours sleep a night and usually have a nap during the day, but still:

And it’s giving me a headache and it’s annoying me.  I also spend most of my time yawning.  This happens a fair bit.  All I need to do is pick a day that I am not doing anything, get a few cans of lager and that’ll sort it out.

Yeah…
One of the local art galleries was launching their new exhibition today.  I went to have a look.  As I did, I turned round and nudged the stand for one of the sculptures and it kinda fell over.
Ooops.
Thankfully, it wasn’t all in one piece and now it’s in a hundred pieces.  It was broken down to its constituent parts.  The artist was there, so they were summoned to put it back together and they now know to put up a sign warning people.  So they think I helped them out.
Didn’t stop me panicking though.
One of my favourite post pub meals was on MasterChef on Thursday.  One of the contestants was from Gateshead and decided to make a parmo.  For those who are curious: a parmo is a chicken fillet, flattened out, coated in breadcrumbs, deep fried until the crumbs are golden, topped with bechamel sauce and cheese and grilled until the cheese melts.  Serve with chips, salad and garlic and/or chilli sauce if wanted.
And it looks like this:

I know what you’re thinking.  The same thing the judges did.  The same thing I did, before I tried it.  It looks and sounds disgusting.
It does, however, taste absolutely fucking amazing.
And I was quoted in an article about it as well
At the moment, I’m watching Jessica Jones season 2.  Thus far?  As good as season 1 was.  Which, if you’ll recall my last entry, was pretty damn amazing.

I’m currently rewatching Jessica Jones season 1 before bingeing season 2.  I love this show so very much.  I suppose it is kinda obvious I would though.  I’m a huge fan of noir books and films (see picture in earlier entry of my Raymond Chandler collection) and superheroes, swo something that mixes both is right up my street.  But I wasn’t prepared for just how good it was.  I’ve only heard good things about season 2, so I can’t wait.
Though whoever the big bad is has a lot to live up to compared to David Tennant.
I did the survey thing yesterday.  It was painless and only took about half an hour.  They have to do a follow up with me in a years time, but that’ll be by email.
Today I had to get my prescription refilled.  I picked it up from my doctors, took it to the chemist and left them with it as I went for a wander round town.  Went to pick it up and they couldn’t find it.  For some reason, it was filed under E, not F.
I’ve also been enviously looking at new smartwatches.  I miss my Pebble.

The Sun, a paper I haven’t held in any regard since their reporting on the Hillsbrough disaster, tweeted out a link to an article yesterday.  The article in question?
Snowflake students are suggesting that Frankensteins monster is misunderstood
(Note: I linked to a Vice article about the whole thing.  Fuck giving The Sun clicks.)
The problem?  Well, in their rush to be outraged about others outrage, they missed one big thing.  If you’ve read Frankenstein, you’ll have spotted the problem.  (If you haven’t, I recommend you do, it’s an amazing book.)
The whole point of the book is that the monster is misunderstood.  It’s not hidden, it’s not subtext, it’s literally the point of the story.
But some people are so determined to be outraged about things that they don’t bother with the whole meddlesome reality thing.

I’ve recently re-read my old entries and one of the things I’ve learned is that a variation of this question was asked a lot and I always gave variations of the same answer.
So, here we go again.
The thing about us is that we’re not just a bunch of creatures.  A load of Homo Sapiens wandering round this planet.  We are more than a bunch of flesh and bones and sinew and blood and veins and organs.  What makes each of us us is our experiences.  The education we receive, the people we interact with, the media we consume.  And, yes, the choices we make.
So, the question isn’t what choice would I change if I could.  It’s how much do I want to change about who I am?
Well, admittedly, I have a mystery illness that prevents me from working, which sucks.  And the resultant lack of money isn’t much fun either.  But, in general, I like my life.  I have good friends, I generally have good health, I enjoy certain activities.
Instead I’ll be using my new found time travel abilities to watch Aberdeen win the Cup Winners Cup.
(Course, there is also the multiverse theory which suggests that every time we make a decision, a different universe splits off where you made the opposite choice.  If you subscribe to that, all you’re wondering is which of the multiverses you’d prefer to live in)

I did dye my hair on Saturday night.  Here, from left to right, is me normally, me having gone blond and the end result:
  
I think it turned out OK.
I took part in the Reddit Gifts book exchange.  I’ve sent my books to the person I was assigned (I sent The Rule of Four and The Fifth Gospel, both amazing).  Then on Sunday (yes, I was surprised I got a delivery on Sunday as well), I got the books I’d been sent:

The Borges is because I said I wanted something from the country of the sender.  The Lovecraft because I mentioned liking mystery books.  I’ve always wanted to read some Lovecraft and Borges, so I’m very happy about this.  And at least, unlike last year, I haven’t got either of these books yet.
I wasn’t able to watch the Oscars, but I was keeping up on the BBC website.  Out of my predictions, 4 of the 5 I said should win did and 4 of the 5 I said would win did.  And the one I said would win but didn’t lost to the one I said should win.  Overall, very happy.  I might do the same again next year, just starting earlier so I can hit more categories.
Delighted that Roger Deakins finally got a win.
I’m taking part in a survey!  My house has been selected to take part in the Family Resource Survey for the government.  It gives me summat to do and I’ve already spent the tenner they gave me for taking part so I should really.

I’m listening to my beloved Aberdeen put Killie to the sword in the cup.  I’m still not convinced the game should have gone ahead, but there you go.
I really, really need my new phone, damnit!  The battery on my one is completely shot.
Typical me, I decide I’m going to make something new in my slow cooker and end up going with chilli yet again.

Meanwhile, in Geordieland:

I’ve finally watched all the nominees for the Best Picture Oscar this year.  Here’s my capsule review of the films I didn’t review before:
Call Me by Your Name: This is a very lovely, very sweet little film.  It’s also utterly unmemorable.
Darkest Hour: Wasn’t a fan.  It’s really not as good as it thinks it is, and there’s some very odd cinematography choices.
Dunkirk: Every great filmmaker has a war film and this is Nolans.  Fantastic, but the structure can get a bit confusing.
Phantom Thread: Good, but not great.  Being a Paul Thomas Anderson film, that still means it’s better than a lot of other films, but it’s about in the middle of his filmography.
The Post: No.  Just, no.  Not a fan.  I didn’t really know what was happening a lot of the time, the rest of the time I didn’t much care.  Thinks it’s more important that it is.  If it wasn’t Spielberg, it likely wouldn’t be on this list.
I’ll give my predictions about awards later, when I’ve watched the rest of the films nominated for other awards.
I’m thinking of dying my hair again.  If I can find a applicator bottle, I’ll probably go green finally.
Theresa May is prattling on about what she wants for us leaving the EU (which still shouldn’t be happening).  I wonder how long it’ll take the EU to shoot her down this time?
I’m hoping that the Diary Master/the engineering department gets us the ability to sort friends list by latest entry soon.  It’s a bit annoying trying to remember which entries I’ve already read so i can read the new stuff.

Don;t have any.  Really.  If I do buy a CD, it’s ripped to the computer and then passed on to friends
Where is your stereo or radio located in your home?
Don’t have one.  If I want to listen to music, I either use my laptop or connect my phone to my soundbar via bluetooth

Well, I have my spirits in a cabinet

One working, one not

What company do you use for internet access and how much does it cost?
Virgin Media.  Not sure how much it costs, because it comes with the TV package and landline

(You know, I’ll never understand why people on Gilmore Girls made fun of Lorelai for saying she can smell snow.  Not only is it possible to sense snow (I knew we were getting snow at the weekend without the help of weather reports), but she’s always right.)
I love snow.  I always have and always will.  I think snow is beautiful and magical.  I love the way it transforms absolutely everything.  It’s great and if that makes me weird, I don’t want to be normal.
I’m currently holed up at home, watching ER (there’s a channel over here that’s started showing it from the beginning) and drinking blood tea.  It’s not actually blood, I have to point out.  It’s red berry tea, but it looks like blood.
My parents are in Gateshead visiting the nephew and niece.  Normally, this would mean they come down to visit me, but it looks like that’s not happening this time.  Partly because of the weather (not a big surprise to me) but also because there’s something of an epidemic at the moment.  My niece wasn’t well over the weekend and it’s spread to her brother, mum, dad and grandmother.
Ahhh, well.  Never mind.  I just hope everyone is OK.

This phone upgrade is going well.  Depending on your definition of well, that is.
Now, I could either get the phone sent to the flat or to my local EE shop.  I got it sent to the shop.  This is because EE uses DPD to deliver phones and, to be frank DPD sucks.  If I’m getting something delivered by them, it means two days out of my life.  The day I’m supposed to get the item and the day I actually do get it.  It also involves me phoning them to complain that delivery wasn’t attempted, only for them to tell me stuff like they can’t get in touch with the courier after they leave the depot and I didn’t hear the courier knocking because of the polite knocking style designed as to not alarm the people in the house.
It’s at this point I have to say that I’m not actually joking about those things.
So, I got it sent to the store.  Today, I got a text message saying it had arrived.  I went to pick it up.  Only to find I couldn’t because they needed photo ID.  I have no photo ID.  I don’t drive, I don’t plan on ever driving so I don’t even have a provisional drivers license.  I don’t have the money to go abroad, so I don’t have a passport.  I have no need for photo ID.
I also have no new phone.
What’s going to happen is that they’ll send the phone back, I have to phone them about this then, end of next week, I have to go into the store and do the upgrade then.
On the plus side, I found my Punisher logo tongue piercing and put it in, so I’ve got that going for me.

Yes, I can explain my entry title.
A couple of days ago, I decided to watch every film nominated for the Best Picture Oscar before the ceremony.  Last night, I decided to extend that to every film nominated for Best Picture, Director, the Acting categories and Screenwriting.
Thoughts thus far?
Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri: It’s good, but not as great as it’s made out to be.  Frances McDormand and Sam Rockwell are absolutely outstanding though.
The Shape of Water: Absolutely outstanding.  An absolute tour de force of a film and fires on all cylinders in every department.  I love, love, love this film.
Get Out: A rarity, a massively hyped film that actually lives up to hype.  Deeply unsettling.
Lady Bird: Again, good but not great.  The acting is top notch though.
That’s as far as I’ve got thus far.
Tomorrow, I have to head into town to drop off the form for getting a new fit note.  And thus far, that’s my only weekend plans, interesting life that I lead.

My mum phoned me earlier on her mobile phone, which was a surprise.  My mum never uses her mobile phone.  I don’t mean that as in actually hardly ever but does on occasion.  I mean as in doesn’t recognise the ringtone, have to get the thing reactivated every time she tops up due to lack of use never uses it.
Turns out there’s a problem with the landline.  At least it’s not as bad as the last time it happened.  Which was the week of my sisters wedding, when she was expecting calls from a lot of people.
Meanwhile, I’m getting a new phone.  It’s time to upgrade.  Unfortunately, I can’t afford any of the Samsung ones, but the one I’m getting has decent reviews so I’m not bothered.  It’s also got a 90 minute charge, which is great.  I’m getting it delivered to a shop because I really, really don’t trust DPD.  Only once has a delivery from them not involved me shouting down the phone to them.
Letters:
I’m still trawling through old entries and found this, which seemed like fun to do again:

F- Forbes is my surname
G- I am a huge Geek
H- my Health isn’t the best at the moment, with this mystery illness
I- I have moments of Introspection
J- Dr Pepper is my favourite type of Juice
K- The only Kickstarter I’ve ever contributed towards was to help bring back MST3K.  I’ve literally got the t shirt.  Well, 2, they sent a duplicate by mistake
L- Lager is my alcoholic drink of choice, especially craft lager
M- I have diverse taste in Music
N- I need Noise in my life.  I cannot abide silence
O- unless I’ve had enough alcohol, I tend to be Quiet
P- I love a good Police procedural
Q- I have my Quirks
R- I have a strange fascination with serial killers and Religious cults
S- I love my Slow cooker

U- I am Unique, just like everyone else
V- I always tend to be Very sleep deprived
W- yes, I know that Wrestling is pre-determined and guess what?  I don’t care, I still like watching it
X- I’m always kinda disappointed that X-rays don’t actually give me superpowers
Y- I can’t wait for the Y: The Last Man tv series
Z- I haven’t ever actually been to a proper Zoo

I wanted to use one of these as the main picture, but it cut part of each out.  So, you’ve got my Chandler collection instead.
I did manage to get my leather jacket.  Which is a surprise, considering it looks brand new and only cost £5.
Fun and games at the Winter Olympics.  Russia are banned because of questions over their drug testing, but some athletes were allowed to compete under the banner of Olympic Athletes of Russia, as long as they proved they were drug free.  One of them has been dinged on their A sample for drugs.  Thing is though, it’s one of the mixed doubles curling team.  Curling.  Seriously, why the hell do you need to be on drugs to help you play curling?  You ever tried watching curling?  I can understand needing drugs to try and make the sport seem slightly less fucking ridiculous, but not to play it.
I am stunned by what’s happening at Stoneman Douglas High.  Not the shooting, sadly, such a thing in the States no longer surprises.  But the reaction from the children.  At what must be the worst moment of their lives, they’re not upset or grieving.  They’re pissed.  And they’re not shutting up.  I particularly love the fact that, when announcing the March for Our Lives, they called out the people who said it’s too soon to be talking about gun control by saying the march is exactly when it’s not too soon to talk.  I have a feeling this is going to be a genuine movement, and not a moment too soon.

I finally have the money to pay for my subscription, which means I can finally post photos!
The picture above is me outside the TARDIS before one of the advanced screenings of the Doctor Who Christmas special.  I later found out that it’s the actual prop from the episode.
And here’s another picture from the same night:

Don’t worry, I’m not going to overdose you on photos.
I went to see the specialist yesterday.  (Well, Thursday, just remembered it’s Saturday here.)  He has no clue what’s wrong with me and has apparently given up trying to find out.
So, that sucks.
My plans for tomorrow are to go back to a charity shop in the hope they still have the leather jacket they had for a fiver last time I was in and go into town to do some shopping.  Still got to decide if I want the stuff to make spag bol or chilli, but that’s for a later time to decide I suppose.
I’ve been enjoying the Winter Olympics.  particularly the snowboarding events.  Curling is still an absolutely ridiculous sport.
I’ll finish up there.

My diary is now fully restored, with notes, so I’m having fun reading my old entries.  I stumbled across this story I wrote and thought it was too good not to share again.

Sir Henry Fossington-Ponceby-Fletcher-Smythe-Taylor KBE, OBE, MBE, BSC, SSC
1960 – TBD*
Sir Henry Fossington-Ponceby-Fletcher-Smythe-Taylor passed away yesterday morning while in bed with his 19 year old Playboy Playmate of the year bride whilst on honeymoon.
Sir Henry, who was 60 years of age, is noted for being the only person in the history of the British Army for being court marshalled for being absent with leave. Upon his dishonourable discharge he embarked on a variety of careers including, but not limited to, TV news presenter, wine maker, resteraunteur, dairy farmer, professional gambler, poet, novelist and deep sea sponge diver.
However, when asked for his profession Sir Henry would reply, ‘A raconteur and a wit. Though some would say I’m only half way towards the second.’
A man of relentless drive and a fierce burning intellect, Sir Henry claims to have invented the laptop, the iPad, the internet as we know it, the internet in a different form, Big Mouth Billy Bass and Cheesy Granite before anyone else. He said that he didn’t pursue these as he wanted to give someone else a fair go.
Sir Henry is survived by one wife, five ex-wives, seven sons, six daughters, numerous illegitimate children, five grandchildren, a legion of adoring and heartbroken fans and Spot, his beloved pet zebra. His funeral will take place as soon as his blood alcohol level is sufficiently low for a safe cremation.
*Authors note: I always thought it would be amusing to read my own obituary and see it in print. Rumours of my death have, as a result, been greatly exaggerated.

I still can’t find the bulbs I need for my lava lamp.  Looks like I may have to buy them online.
Caught a bit of the opening ceremony of the winter Olympics today.  The Olympic rings made from 1,200 drones was awesome.  Actually, i’ll need the check when the ice hockey is on and hope the BBC shows it.  I haven’t seen ice hockey in far too long.
Bought a couple of books from a charity shop today.  One of them is about Henry Hill post Goodfellas.  Looks good.
Also saw a gorgeous leather jacket for a fiver.  I just hope it’s still there when I have the money to buy it.  Wouldn’t bank on it though.

My mums birthday present arrived yesterday.
My new memory card arrived today.  It was sent by DPD, so I’m very surprised it actually arrived today rather than me having to phone to rearrange delivery.  (I have a long history with those twats, including the most ridiculous argument I’ve ever heard in my life.)  So, at the moment, I’m moving all the stuff that was on my old memory card onto the new one.
I’m nearly finished my read through of all Raymond Chandler novels.  I’m currently on the last one, which I’ve never read before.

My diary has finally been restored!  Well, OK, it’s doing the multiple copies of entries thing and there’s no notes on my old entries, but I’m willing to wait and see if that changes before submitting a support ticket for it.
I’m having a lazy day today.  My dinner is going in the slow cooker.  Sweet and sour chicken.  I usually use the slow cooker to make spaghetti bolognaise or chilli, so I decided top change things up for once.  I just wish there was somewhere round here that sold racks of ribs, fancy making that again.  Oh well.
Watching the GB Davis Cup tie at the moment.  With Andy Murray and Kyle Edmund out injured at the moment, this was supposed to be an easy win for Spain.  Unfortunately for them, no-one told Cameron Norrie this.  He won on Friday in 4 hours, after being close to a 3-0 wipeout and he’s taken the number 1 player in Spain to a fourth set and coming up on 4 hours today.  If he can keep this up, he’ll go very, very far.
Also found out today that my mums Christmas present has been shipped.  I did order it before Christmas, but it’s not released until Thursday, so I didn’t pay for it until this weekend either.  Not sure if I should warn her it’s on the way or leave it as a surprise.  (She does know I’ve bought her the book.)
Still struggling to find a lightbulb for my lava lamp.  I’ll get there.

I’ve had OD back in my life for a week, even if for six of those days it’s been telling me it may take up to 24 hours to restore my diary.

I was able to copy everything on the memory card to my computer, but I cannot delete anything on it, nor can I format the buggering thing.
I’ve checked on the website and it has a five year warranty and I’m well inside that period.  I just hope they don’t want proof of purchase.  I can tell them when I bought it (deducted using text messages and bank statements) and where it was purchased (deducted because it was between two places and one of them doesn’t stock that brand), but I can’t find the bloody receipt.

So, it’s half one in the AM, I probably should be asleep.  Instead, I’m watching The Defiant Ones.  Biggest surprise so far?  Dr Dre is a huge Nirvana fan.
Speaking of music, it may surprise some to discover I’m a fan of Bruno Mars.  But, holy hell, what is up with the Grammy voters?  In what universe is 24k Magic a better album that Damn?  (And I won’t mention the bullshit with Lorde.)
If you haven’t seen K Dots performance last night here it is  I highly recommend it.
New Frank Turner this year!  New album on May 4th and a tour, that I can’t afford to go to.
I’ve got an exciting week planned.  Tomorrow, I have to go get my fit note and hand it in at the job centre, then probably catch up on Discovery and Agents of Shield, then new Inside No 9.  Wednesday, I’m planning to watch the last two NXT Takeovers and the Royal Rumble, Thursday, not sure yet but something to get me through to my Death in Paradise/The Mash Report/something for half an hour/Derry Girls and Friday, Saturday and Sunday will mostly be about the Davis Cup.

It’s a bit annoying seeing the thing saying it’ll take up to 24 hours to restore my diary when I started the process 48 hours ago.  I’ve submitted a support ticket.
I’m currently catching up on McMafia.  It’s the main problem with going back to my parents.  I have to watch what they want to watch on TV, which is rarely what I want to watch.  So I have a lot of catching up to do when I get home.
I’ve got a lot of catching up to do anyway.  I’ve still to watch The Punisher season 1, The Crown season 2, catch up with The Good Doctor, Agents of SHIELD, Happy!, Black Panther, 9-1-1 and finish watching season 1 of The Good Place before even thinking about starting season 2.
Yet, I usually end up rewatching Gilmore Girls or Leverage.

While I wait for my diary to restore, I may as well write a new entry.
So, my life is, well, it is.  At the moment, I’m unemployed.  Not because I can’t find work, but because I’m actually unable to due to health issues.  Today, I was the first person to go through the new system for requesting a new fit note.  Yay, I guess.
Last week I was back home for my birthday.  I turned 40.  Christ, it seems like only 10 years ago I turned 30…
Didn’t do much on my birthday itself.  The day after, I went to the Aberdeen cup game.  I was absolutely frozen, I had to watch three of our goals on TV because they happened at the opposite end of the stadium, but, regardless, I had an absolute blast and have now sat in every stand at Pittodrie to watch a game, even the one that no longer exists.
It might be the last game I ever see at Pittodrie.
Apart from that, my life is quite boring.

First Entry/Bad Week		 09 April 2000
“In the beginning, when we were winning.”
Manic Street Preachers, The Everlasting
OK so last week I had my jacket stolen. My mobile phone was in my jacket. As a student living away from home, this means that if there is am emergency back home no-one can get in touch with me. It was also my favourite jacket that was stolen. Then I got bad news from a friend. Ready to be confused? OK then.
About a year and a half ago, two of my friends started going out with each other (we’ll call them LW and LR). Last week, LW broke up with LR as he was now going out with someone else. LW then got someone who LR does not like to give her her stuff back. She then found out that this friend had known that LW was going to dump her for three days before LW phoned with the bad news. LW and LR work at the same place, which is how I know them. LW’s new girlfriend works there to. The next time that LR was working after the phone call, she started hitting LW and was dragged off by a manager. To make matters even worse, LR is moving to the same department as LW’s new girlfriend. I am going home on Thursday for Easter. Normally I look forward to going home and seeing my family and friends, but this time, for obvious reasons I am not. I should also point out that I am partly responsible for LW and LR getting together in the first place. And I will be expected to take sides which I don’t wanna do.
I’ve been through a lot with them both and don’t want to lose either of them. What do I do? HELP!!
At least my football team are virtually in Europe next season.

Life stuff.  I wasn’t made redundant in the end, I’ve been put on a new, better shift pattern.
Oh, and I’m sleeping rough for charity again.  You can donate here
So, this, as it turns out, will be my last entry.  I’m not sure how many people will even read this, but here it is.
OD is almost dead.
I discovered this site when messing about online in place of actual uni work.  And here I am, 14 years later, going grey (seriously), moving forward in this spinning ball of dirt and water.  Through studies, work, unemployment, developing my creative writing skills, relationships and more.
A few thank you’s.  To people who have read this throughout the years.  In no particular order except that which I remember them in, Vanessa, Danni, Rodger, Brian, Angie, Renee, Jamie, Vanessa (NZ one), Leslie, Sunil, Lou, Krud, Peter, Ori, Sexton, PIXIE, Khaos, quine ahin the lens, Zaphod, shesolovely, Steven and all the ones I’ve inevitably missed.
Thank you for 14 years worth of advice, arguments, feedback and support.
I’m not making the move to prosebox.  It looks boring and there appears no way to personalise it.  It looks like Facebook Diary and I have Facebook.  There’s a couple of other things, one of which is only planned at the moment, that I also don’t like and they are mandatory.  I’m keeping an eye on what EWS has planned here if anyone else is wondering) but it is possible that my online diary days are over.

My mum just phoned.  My gran dies at 4am this morning.  She was 93.
It’s not much of a surprise.  She’d been in hospital since before Christmas and had been on a do not treat list since before New Year.
Still upsetting though.
My gran was awesome.  Whether it was the broth that was so thick you didn’t dunk bread into it as much as force it in (still my all time favourite soup), disappearing after my sisters graduation t go play bingo late into the night or 1001 other stories.
And now she’s gone.  Just hope I can make it up for the funeral with all the nonsense at work.
Here she is on her 90th birthday surrounded by three generations of her family:

Requiescat in Pace

And I won’t make the funeral.  Because of the redundancy the only way I could take the time off is to take unpaid leave.  And, because of the redundancy, I can’t afford it.

This morning, I was called down to HR and informed that I was being made redundant at the end of the month.
Then, when I phoned my mum to tell her, she told me that my gran (who is in hospital and already on a do not treat list) asked yesterday if God was coming for her.
I have a load of booze and no work tomorrow.  Guess what my plans for the night are?

So, here’s the thing folks.  For the last six months the plan has been for my mum and dad to go to Gateshead to see in the New Year with my brother and sister in law.  She’s due to give birth in February, so it was their last chance to spend some time together before that.
Now this was quite convenient for me as I was going to be getting a lift to Newcastle train station and going back to Boro from there.  No muss, no fuss, no spending £50 – 110 on a second train ticket.  We were going to be leaving tomorrow morning.  Me, mum, dad, the dog.
6 months planning.
Today, my brother and sister in law decide to tell mum and dad that the dog can’t come to Gateshead.
No idea why.  It’s not that dogs aren’t allowed in the house because they have a dog.  It’s not that the two dogs might not get on, because they’ve met before.
They may have given mum a reason, I’m not sure.
But, no dog.
My sister and brother in law can’t take her in (nor, at such short notice, should they be expected to) nor can they come round every day to feed and walk her (again, why should they be expected to).  I could have stayed to look after her, but I’m back at work on Friday so, in order for that to work, mum and dad would have to come back up the road on New Tears Day, thus negating the reason for the trip.  And it’s far too much short notice to put her in a kennel, considering all the shots and stuff they needed to get for her before putting her in when they went on holiday in January.
So the trips been cancelled.  I’ve booked my train ticket, which my mum is insisting on paying for (I think she should make them do so), my mums in bits and I am fucking fuming.  My dad wonders why I don’t have much time for the two of them.  It’s shit like this.  (They rarely come up to Aberdeen simply because she doesn’t like it.  From what I can gather, when they do they spend most of their time with my nephew or my brothers friends.)
I think she simply changed her mind about the whole thing and the dog was an excuse.  I think that if mum phoned them back and said that they had found a dog sitter and the trip was back on there would be another excuse.

I’m no longer at risk of redundancy.
Even better: I’m invading Edinburgh for four months.
There’s an opportunity opened up for a pilot project in Edinburgh for four months.  I put my name forward for it, the idea being that if allowed to, I could head up to Aberdeen for the occasional weekend.
And I was chosen.  So instead of possible redundancy I get:
Transport to and from Edinburgh every week,
Accommodation in an executive apartment,
£25 per day expenses (if I decide to stay in Edinburgh for the weekend I get the money for those two days as well) and
a £1,000 bonus at the end of the four months (which’ll pay for my rearranged trip to see Nessa monster).
Will
*EDIT*
And, nevermind.  Work has fucked me over again.
My alarm, for whatever reason, decided not to go off this morning.  Meaning I was late to work.
Because of this, they’ve decided that I can’t be trusted not to be late to work in Edinburgh.  Despite the fact that I’d be sharing an apartment with at least one other person who would be going to the same place.
Did the guy tell me about his decision himself?  Course not.  Did he ask me for an explanation?  Don’t be stupid.
He just made his choice and got someone else to tell me.
(I’m actually off tomorrow, but I’m going in to INSIST he justify himself to me.)
To add to that, they fucked up my wages this month by not paying me for a days holiday I’d booked off.
Posted this on Facebook earlier and it’s absolutely true:
“Fucking work fucking bunch of fucking cunts. Got fuck all respect for a place that blatantly has fuck all for me”

So, what’s been going on in my life?  Well, not much.
Finally have working systems at work and it didn’t take 6 months like the last time!  Course, there’s no actual work at the moment, so it doesn’t actually make much difference.  They reckon that it’ll pick up mid January after the whole shebang is dealt with by the High Court but, in truth, I really cannot see that happening.
However, as I have to make myself look busy, and I’m not allowed to do that by going online, I spend my time writing and have about 14 hand written pages of a new book.
Last weekend I went home.  It was a weekend of aborted plans.  The reason I was heading home was to go see The Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy Radio Series Live.  Then they cancelled the tour.  I went back anyway.  Then, my brother and sister in law were supposed to be up the same weekend but they changed their minds.  Still, it was a fun, relaxing weekend.
And I got me some Jamie time!  I asked my sister ages ago about heading round to hers, mostly to see Jamie, partly to see the new house.  Leaving the transportation to my parents, I didn’t get round till about 1.  Still, I had fun, went to a park with my sister and Jamie and pushed him on a swing and had a good old chin wag with my brother in law.  Then we met up with my parents for a pub meal.
Class is going great.  It’s fantastic to be writing at least weekly.  For the big end of term project we’re rewriting Little Red Riding Hood.  Now, I did this before in class a few years back.  My tutor decided to read out my previous submission and everyone loved it.  So, no pressure…
(There’s one guy in class who’s a singer/songwriter and he’s been talked into writing a song for it, so it could be worse.)
I know exactly what I’m doing for it.  I’m doing an article about a company called Wolf Corp whose CEO is on trial for insider trading, corporate espionage and attempting to ‘devour’ Grandma Catering PLC and the Hooded Rider Courier company.  The two are saved by the Woodcutter investment group.  What do you think?
Nessa monster is doing a courtroom sketch for me and it’s going to be reported in the Aesop Times (suppose I should get to putting together a masthead).
Being a Doctor Who fan, I’m in hog heaven right now.  I watched The Science of Doctor Who (fantastic show) but sadly I’m going to miss An Adventure in Time and Space cos I’m going to see the second Hunger games film.
I’m going to go right ahead and assume all my fellow Whovian readers has seen The Night of the Doctor by now.  I’ll admit, I was like a schoolgirl at a 1 Direction concert during that.
And I’ve got friends coming round for the 50th anniversary episode itself.  Normally I go round to theirs, but seeing as my TV does HD and theirs doesn’t, they are heading here.  Don’t think we’ll be bothering with the after party thing on BBC3 though.
Pics!

The story I mentioned a couple of entries back:
To look at it from the outside, it was just an ordinary house.  Open the front door, however and it was, TARDIS like, much bigger on the inside.  It was plainly decorated in the hallway, but the various rooms differed depending on what the viewer wanted them to be.  If you were hungry, one room would be a fine dining restaurant, serving only your favourite dishes.  Another room could be a fully-fledged fun fair, with all your favourite rides free of charge.  If you were struggling with your homework, the right door would let you speak to just the right person, whether that was Einstein, Pythagoras or Shakespeare.  The rooms contained everything your hearts desires.
Well, almost all the rooms did.  There was one that no-one should ever, ever open the door to.  That room contains your deepest, darkest fear.

437,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/the-result-of-aldi-customer-service-3931175/,2013-10-05,The result of Aldi customer service…,"
Dear Sir/Madam,
I am emailing you to complain about the experience I was put through when visiting your Newport Road, Middlesbrough store yesterday, 05/10/2013.
I went into the store to have a look round.  The only thing I was carrying was a bag from Sainsburys which contained only the pack of ribs I had bought.  After having a look, I left the store and crossed the car park to head home.
As I was doing so, just walking casually, I was stopped when someone threw their arms around me, pinning my arms to my side.  Turns out it was the security guard, who had a member of staff with him.  He demanded to know what was in my bag.  I asked him why he wanted to know, but he wouldnt tell me, demanding again I tell him.  I said it was meat which is when he asked to see inside the bag.  I lifted the bag as far as I could (my arms were still pinned to my side) and the staff member looked and confirmed it was meat bought in Sainsburys.
It was only then that I was released.  At this point, I dont think it unreasonable to suggest that I was expecting an apology for what happened.  Instead, I was informed that I was barred from the store and to not bother returning.  I asked why I was barred to which I was informed yet again that I was.  Still no explanation.
They stood just beside the doors and I decided I wasnt leaving things like that.  I went over, asking again why I was barred from the store.  It was only then that I told that a member of staff had reported that I had stolen some meat (rather convenient that the item I had been accused of shoplifting just happened to be the same thing as was already in the bag) and that, of course, I wasnt barred from the store.
Is this what you consider good customer service?  Physically restraining someone without giving them the opportunity to stop (I wasnt listening to music, if they had called out I would have heard them), searching them without justifying the reason why and then telling them they are barred from the premises when they arent, again without an explanation?
And before you hide behind the fact that the security guard worked for an outside company, the member of staff wasnt and if someone from a third party company is working on your behalf its on you to make sure they know how to act.
To be honest, I dont actually care if I am allowed back into the store or not.  I have no intention of ever entering one of your stores ever again.  I would, however, expect that at least it is explained to the relevant members of staff that this is at the very least unacceptable.
Yours sincerely,
William Forbes

440,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/my-weekend-fun-3-3931165/,2013-09-29,My weekend fun,"
I was supposed to get paid today.  Due to a quirk with my bank, however, I got paid Saturday.  Not that I’m complaining, made it easier to get the things I need to get paid done.
Having been knackered all week, naturally my body clock insisted I get up at 8:30 and not be able to get back to sleep.  I did my shopping online (as getting it delivered is infinitely easier than trudging through town laden down with bags/paying for a taxi), dropped off my washing at the launderette (service wash, saves me having to iron it) and headed into town.
Wandered round, picked up a few things, got another Deathly Hallows necklace then headed of to do some film making.
There was a music festival in town on Saturday, and one of the things they ran in tandem with it was film making.  It’s been too long since I did any filming, it was free, so I went for it.  Originally, I was the only person there.  Someone wandering along asked what was happening and joined in, then we were met by more people.
Sadly, all I was able to do was operate the camera, which served to merely remind me why I never liked operating a camera (I always much preferred writing and editing).  We decided to make a short promo for the festival so, naturally, we completely failed to actually film and bands performing.  We were hunting for a couple of giant pigeons (as in people dressed up as pigeons) which put me in mind of this:
Despite only operating a camera on occasion, it was good fun and I really, really want to get back into it.  Just to work out how…
One thing I did get was my dads birthday present.  My dad is an absolute fucking nightmare to buy for (I usually and up getting him a F1 book of some description) and there was a market in town where someone was selling organic craft beer.  So I got him a four pack of that.
Met up with a couple of friends for a drink then went to the union to get my passport photos done.
This was slightly annoying, not just cos I have having photos taken but because I had to walk about with change.  It costs a fiver from the machine, so why can’t they accept change?
Had a couple of pints while watching the football scores coming in (both Manchester clubs fucked up my acca) then headed home.  Watched Agents of SHIELD (for the third time that week.  I may already be obsessed) then turned over to BBC1 for Atlantis.
I promptly wished I hadn’t bothered.
I din’t know what was worse, the ropy CGI, the bad acting, the piss poor writing (it was fucking ridiculous how often they mentioned Atlantis, despite not really having to) or the complete and utter disregard for Greek Myths and Legends.  I think the only reason Mark Addy was cast as Hercules was because he was in Game of Thrones.  Then they decided to make the character a drunk coward.  Seriously.  12 tasks of Hercules guy?  Him.  And just what the fuck is Pythagoras doing there at all?
The main character is from our time.  Yet he’s so clueless about Greek myth (the only thing he seems to know is that Pythagoras is the triangle guy).  Seriously, why did it take someone else to point out about the using thread to find your way out of the labyrinth trick?
I’m not sure what’s worse.  That it’s going to be on for another 11 weeks or the fact that the money that was wasted on this could have been spent on something good.
I then watched other stuff (can’t remember what exactly, except for a bit of the new Dave Gorman show on Dave) then went to bed.
Now, admittedly, I had to get up early on Sunday for my food delivery but not 9am…
I went to pick up my washing and drop off another bag, came home, watched Sunday Brunch (which I’ve become addicted to on a Sunday) then my food arrived.  Along with, finally, my vodka.
I’ve decided it’s probably a good idea to have alcohol that isn’t lager in Forbes Actual in case someone comes round who doesn’t like lager.  So I decided to start with vodka and whisky, the two spirits I actually do drink.
Last month I ordered a small bottle of both (the whisky is a blend), however it transpired that they forgot to take the security tag off the vodka so I didn’t get it.  Which turned out to be a blessing.  This month you could get 2 bottles of selected spirits for £25.  So instead on a small bottle of vodka, I got a 75cl bottle of Stoli and a small bottle of 10 year old single malt.
However, I was also, as it turns out, an idiot.  I thought I had ordered a tube of tomato paste (which I need for making spag bol) but it turned out I bought garlic paste.  I’ll but some tomorrow and I’ll just use some of the garlic paste as a trial.  (I tend to get the tomato paste with garlic in it so it probably won’t be that different.)
Watched some NCIS (there’s not enough TV shows, books or films with characters called Jethro) then picked up my washing.  Went for a wonder round town (don’t like being cooped up all day) then home for a Game of Thrones marathon.  Watched two episodes on my hard drive so I was caught up for the two shown on Sky Atlantic.  It’s weird watching them on that channel.  HBO doesn’t have commercials, so they’re kind of thrown in anywhere.  It’s the same as watching Doctor Who on Watch or Top Gear on Dave.  (Or Agents of SHIELD on Channel 4 where they stick d breaks wherever they want rather than where they should go).
And that was pretty much my weekend.  I’ve also just remembered why I don’t tend to do these types of entries.  I managed to bore myself, so FSM knows how you got through it.

441,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/my-tattoo-addiction-rant-3931161/,2013-09-26,My Tattoo Addiction rant,"
Now, as regular readers will be aware, I love me some tattoos.  I have me some tattoos.  In fact, I got three more this month:


So, when I found out that Channel 4 were broadcasting a series called My Tattoo Addiction, I was intrigued.  My problem with these types of shows is that they generally are ‘let’s all laugh at the tattooed freaks’.  And to be fair, there was one guy like that.  He had a full face tattoo (they showed him getting the last bit)and wondered why people wouldn’t give him a job.
Then there was the guy who fancied himself as the UK version of Eminem.  They did show him doing Ass Like That on karaoke and he wasn’t actually that bad.  Then they showed him getting ‘Slim’ on one forearm and ‘Shady’ on the other, so that when he crossed his arms it would read Slim Shady.  Kinda like Phil Tayor has with his nickname The Power.  Then he revealed that the way he crosses his arms it reads Shady Slim…  Oh, he’s obsessed with Batman and had a Batman tattoo of variable quality.
But then there was some really nice, heartwarming stuff.  There was a guy who got a tattoo in honour of his dog, which had died and which he loved.  He got the tattoo artist to mix in some of the dogs ashes to the ink.  A bit strange, but in a sweet way.
Then there was a woman who had a double mastectomy.  She was offered new nipples as an operation and a tattoo but, somewhat understandably, didn’t want to go through more surgery.  So she just got them tattooed on.  The results looked really good and just the fact they made her feel better about herself was amazing.
There was also a woman who has a genetic condition which makes her look about 9.  She likes getting tattoos as when she gets them she’s not judged by how young she looks.  And her ink is good.
Then we get to the bit which really, really pissed me off.
They talked about people who get tattoos when they are on holiday.  They get the names of people they went with, they get tattoos of the names of people they meet there, they tend to get tattoos on their arse (including one genius who got a swastika there).
These people all have one thing in common.  They are very drunk at the time they get them.
Which is the bit that really, really pisses me off.  The programme said there were a lot of artists in these places and I know why they are there.  Cos they are willing to tattoo drunk people.
The place where I got most of mine done advise you not to drink for 24 hours before getting a tattoo.  If someone turns up drunk, no tattoo for them.  It’s that simple.
It pisses me off when tattoo artists do shit like this.  There was a thing in the local paper a couple of years back about a girl who got temporary tattoos at 15 (which, admittedly, is legal).  She also had a permanent tattoo but wouldn’t say where she got it.  As that person would rightly be prosecuted.
Here’s my thing: if someone is willing to tattoo someone underage without asking for ID, or when they are drunk, what other short cuts are they making?
I had a hard enough time convincing the artist that did my Amy tattoo that, no, Any was not my girlfriend and I wouldn’t regret getting it when we split up.  Most of these artists must know that these people most likely didn’t travel on holiday together, nor did they know each other to long, so why do that?  At what point do they not say that getting a swastika or the word ginge tattooed on your arse while drunk isn’t the best idea in the world?
And then, right at the end of the episode, came the icing on the cake.  There was an Irish lass, almost falling down drunk, who wanted Wally/Waldo behind her ear cos it would be funny if anyone asked where Wally was she could just point to him.  She should have been sent back to her hotel to sober up.
(Incidentally, one of her friends pointed out that she would end up regretting it.  Why let her get it then?)
Sure enough, she did regret it when she sobered up, not least because her work has a thing about visible tattoos.  (As does mine, nominally.  Most managers don’t give a shit though.)
There are many, many respectable tattoo artists out there.  There are probably some in these places.  Shit like this just fucks me off.
If anyone is thinking about getting a tattoo, I’m happy to give advice.  The main one being, remember, it’s permanent.  Don’t get something you may later regret.
And, for the love of FSM, don’t get one when you are pissed and don’t go to an artist who would give you a tattoo when you are pissed.  Anyone who would do that just can’t really be trusted.
Will

As you lot probably know, I’m moving to a new position at work.  In fact, I’m training for it now.
In this new position, I will be working sifts on a four week rotation.  One of these weeks involves working weekends.
I’m going back to Aberdeen in November for the weekend.  I booked the Friday and Monday off, but didn’t bother with the Saturday and Sunday as, at the time, I didn’t work them unless it was for overtime.
Guess what weekend I’m scheduled to work?

“Were you bullied as a kid? What effect, if any, did it have on your adult life?”
You know how they say that your schooldays are the best days of your life?
They’re not when you are small, smart, nerdy and a bookworm.
I know.  That, unfortunately, was me.
There was a bit of bullying throughout school (most of which, at one point, was by a female) but from Primary 7 onwards, it was constant.
I really don’t know what changed from Primary 6 to 7, but it did escalate.  Then I moved up to academy.  All hell broke loose.
Mainly name calling, but there was a fair bit of physical bullying as well.  I used to dread PE when we had swimming (despite loving swimming itself) because of what I knew was going to happen.  Holding me under water was a particular favourite past time.
Actually, PE in general allowed all manor of things to be done to me.
I remember one particular maths class in second year.  It seemed like everyone had decided it was hunting season and I was the target.  Right on front of the teacher.  How the hell she didn’t see anything is completely beyond me.
The plan was to repeat it the following week, a plan that was thwarted when the note being passed round, on which it was detailed what people were going to do to me, was handed to the teacher by one of my very few friends.
And so on, and so on.  I dreaded going to school in the morning and celebrated the end of each day.
All that really happened was that I tried to hide.  I tried not to draw attention to myself.
Which, paradoxically, made things worse.
And people wonder why I left school as soon as I possibly could.
Since then, it has improved.  I was occasionally bullied at my various jobs, but it hasn’t happened for a long while and, touch wood, it won’t occur again.
As for if it’s affected my life?  Of course it has.  How could it not?
To this day, I’m not particularly good in groups.  I’m happier on my own, listening to music while at work and sitting on my own reading a book down the pub.  Or with one or two friends.
I’m shy.  I’m almost chronically shy.  I am very careful about what I say, so that people won’t take the piss out of me.  I am hyper aware of my surroundings, always keeping my eye out for anything that could lead to problems.
It’s very, very, very hard for me to make friends simply because it’s hard for me to trust people.  It’s telling that most of my friends are a)people I met through mutual friends, b)people I work with or c)people I started talking to online.  It’s literally the only way I meet new people and actually talk to them.
Still, I don’t get upset when someone insults me cos chances are I’ve been called that many, many times before.  So, there’s that.
Will

Remember a few entries back where I said I was moving to Mission if I didn’t get the quality job?
Well, the interview went well, but ultimately I didn’t get the job.  So I’m guaranteed a move to Mission.
Thankfully.
Today, we were all called into a meeting about 3pm.  There, we were told that the contract with Bank of Ireland runs out in November and they will not be extending it.
Which isn’t much of a surprise to me.  To be honest, I’ve felt that they’ve been wanting out of the contract since before it was signed and a lot of the shit they’ve been putting us through has been to try and get us to breach it so they could cancel it.
There are 45 jobs on Mission and they will be taken by us lot.  Which means that about 15 will possibly be out of work.
Thankfully, I won’t be one.  The ten of us who already volunteered to move are safe.
After we were told this news (I swear, my ops manager, who appears scary but is actually very lovely, was visibly upset) I thanked my TL for more or less demanding I move to Mission before finding out about the quality job.
But I’m still looking for something else.  I’m getting sick of these short term contract extensions and this is the second time in a year I’ve been at risk of redundancy.

Particularly when you’re not really expecting it to.
I had yesterday off work.  I was supposed to be going to a Doctor Who convention, but it, sadly, didn’t happen.  But, hey, off work on payday, I’ll take that.
about 10 yesterday morning I got a phone call from work.  Turns out I have an interview for the quality position on Monday.  Woot!  Woot sayeth I and woot it shall remain till the end of time.
I bumped into some folk from work last night and they all seem to think I’d be good at the job.  Just hope HR agree.
Now, I’m going to be wearing my suit for the interview, which poses the question: bow tie or normal tie?  I know that a normal tie would be more professional, but I did as many interview technique courses when I was on the dole that I know that I have to take any chance I can to make myself memorable.  Which the bow tie would certainly do.  Thoughts?
(It’s funny, everyone I’ve pit that question to has immediately said normal tie till I give the memorable thing which they then agree with.  Except Nessa monster, who bought me the bow tie in question so may be biased…)
Knowing my team leader, he’ll have asked someone from the quality team to give me advice.  As long as it’s not Jen, cos she’s a bitca…
What else is happening?
Finally got myself a new lava lamp (I do love me a lava lamp).  sasly the shop had run out of the red ones so it’s green, but still, tis cool.  As I was leaving the shop I noticed they also had Galileo thermometers, so I circled straight back round and got one of those as well.
I also spent today shopping for a MP3 player.  I’m allowed to listen to music at work, but I’m not allowed my phone on the floor.
This is due to the hyper paranoid state of BOI  when it comes to data security.  I may have mentioned before that, when the contract started, they were sending us files by someone flying over from Ireland with a hard drive in a briefcase.  We’re not allowed phones on the floor in case a) we text account numbers to someone, b) we use email on our phone to email account numbers to someone (we have work email but only team leaders can actually send emails) or c) we take pictures on our phones and use them later.
I’m not kidding about c.  It’s the reason that any MP3 player we do use is not allowed to have a camera on it (like an iPod touch).
So, I have a new MP3 player.  It only cost me a fiver, cos I’m buggered if I’m spending more than that on something I’m only using at work.
Have to go.  Need to trim my beard and shave my forearm.

447,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/life-in-flux-edit-3931138/,2013-08-26,Life in flux *EDIT*,"
That’s my situation at work at the moment.
To wit: I’m definitely moving to a different department, I’m just not sure where.
Let me explain.  No.  There is too much.  Let me sum up.
Beginning of last week, an internal email went round stating that there were a couple of jobs going in the quality department for my department.  Quality seem to live by strange and esoteric rules, as do some of the decisions they make.  Hence the reason I tend to be snarky and sarcastic towards them.
Now, I’m trying to move forward at work, hence the reason I apply for just about everything going.  That, combined with the fact that if I’m a member of the quality team they can’t piss me off, led me to apply.  (The extra £2,000 a year doesn’t hurt either)
The closing date for applications was yesterday, but obviously we weren’t in then.  (Who decided to close applications on a fucking bank holiday?  Oh, that’s right, my work, shock.)  So I got my application n on Friday, giving me a convenient excuse for missing the bloody scavenger hunt.
There’s a new department at work called mission which launched today, meaning free food.  They are looking for 10 people to move from my department to there, back office thankfully.  It will mean weekends and some late shifts, but that doesn’t bother me, to be honest.  It scores over the older, more pedestrian work in two important respects.  (First it is slightly cheaper…)  This has been in the planning for just under a year (we first heard of it about redundancy time) so at least it won’t be changing constantly like my department.  Plus, my current contract extension runs out at the end of the year, this one would guarantee me work till March next year.
Except, the quality job.  I explained the situation to my team leader, who explained it to my ops manager.  The agreement is that they’ll keep asking if I’ve been shortlisted for the quality job and, if not, I’ll move to mission.
So it’s pretty much guaranteed that I’ll be moving.  Though, with mission being Barclaycard, hopefully they won’t leave me without systems for ages.
Spent the weekend doing less than I planned to, as a friend is back in town for a few days looking at wedding venues.  They’re not getting married till July 2015 (when there’s no football on) but, still.  I did manage to squeeze in some overtime as well, got quite a lot of cases worked (get paid per case, not per hour) which is a bit of a surprise despite the cases being the easiest type to work.
Also watched Doctor Who at the Proms yesterday.  I downloaded it as an MP3 (which reminds me, need to cut that into individual tracks, rather than one long one) and listened to it at work, so I know what got cut and understand that had to happen.
Nevertheless, it was still disappointing that one of the things cut was Song for Fifty, the gorgeous, epic song written by Murray Gold especially for the 50th anniversary, especially for the Prom.  No idea why they cut it so, if you did watch the programme, here it is.  And if you didn’t, listen anyway, it’s amazing.
Will
*EDIT*
I’m definitely moving to Mission.  And then possibly moving back to BOI in the quality department.
Which I was kinda hoping to avoid, but I see the logic.  It could take HR as long to decide about the quality position that I could lose both.

We had a buffet at work today.  Someone on my team is leaving tomorrow but, as my team leader is off work tomorrow, we had a leaving buffet today.  I supplied Hershey’s Kisses.  My 56oz bag, to be exact.
The conversation got round to the fact that one of the people on my team can’t eat crisps at the moment because of his diet.  Someone suggested that he could have onion rings, leading me to state my title, adding that it would lead to mainlining salt and vinegar Discos under a bridge.  This some how ended with me eating Pringles under the flyover wearing nothing but a sandwich board*.
I love the fact that my team are all, in some way, nuts.
In other work news, the new process for working one type of case, which was introduced yesterday, has since changed.  Sadly, this isn’t the record for this sort of thing changing…
In other news, I’m getting a tattoo!  Well, I’m actually getting 2 soon.  There’s a shop round here that’s doing a Friday the 13th thing where certain small tattoos are £13 each and there’s a couple of designs I like, so I’m getting at least one of them.
There’s also a charity tattoo convention on the 1st which I’m going to.  Can’t really go to the con and not get a tattoo.
I was thinking of getting my infinity band (see my entry here) and quickly threw this together in a free photoshop type program:

But I’m struggling to get in touch with any of the artists that’ll be there and I’m not going up with that.
So, I’m now torn between two Doctor Who designs, the Seal of the Time Lords:

and the Seal of Rassilon:

They’re both quite small designs so hopefully it won’t cost too much.  I’m leaning towards the first one cos I really want this as a tattoo some day:

But I’m not sure.  We’ll see.
Any advice?
Apart from that, not really been up to much.  Went home last weekend for my parents wedding anniversary.  We went for high tea.  The food was good, the service was shit.

Style points for anyone who knows where my title comes from.
I’ve been threatening (sorry, promising) to let you know about the wacky world of my work for a while now.
After todays nonsense, here it is.
My work is… frustrating.  In many, many ways.
First of all, what I’m doing.  I assess files for Bank of Ireland to check for PPI mis-selling.  This was a big thing over here, that people had been sold PPI on loans, credit cards and mortgages that they didn’t need.  In ROI, the Central Bank of Ireland wrote to every household and told people not to complain then ordered banks to investigate to see if it happened.
Bank of Ireland contracted Firstsource to do this for them.  It’s the first time they have outsourced anything and that fact is glaringly obvious.
We do not have the tools we need to do our job.  One of the things we need to do is work out if the customer was in public or private sector employment at POS.  This can be easy if they, for example, worked for McDonalds or for the Department of Defence.  However, if they worked at a school or a nursing home, not so much.  Unfortunately, we don’t have access to Google so to find out we have to either ask our team leader (who does have limited Google access) or request further information.
I can’t send emails which is also something that would be useful.  That’s because they are ultra hyper paranoid about customer information being stolen.  We’re not allowed any electronic devices on the floor (in theory, we have been allowed by the ops manager to listen to music unless BOI are in the building).
In fact, they are so paranoid, that for a while we were getting the cases when someone flew over from Ireland with a hard drive in a case.  Not very useful for us.  I understand the need for some of this stuff, but they are going over the top.
This hard drive thing led to a situation that has continued to this day.  My work is the very definition of the phrase hurry up and wait.  We’ll go without any work at all for 2-3 weeks at a time, during which I generally write or read (ignoring the no books on the floor rule).  Then we’ll get a metric fuckton of work through which, of course, will need to be done ASAFP.  Which is great if you like over time like me (at the moment I’m saving for a trip to see Nessa monster for my birthday) but it is annoying.  We could be getting this stuff earlier, not be sat bored to tears with nothing to do and then not being rushed, but that doesn’t seem to have clicked with them, despite them paying extra for our downtime.
All of this is is when we understand what’s happening.
Now, I did my training for this role back in March.  Since then, I estimate that around 95% of my training has been changed or is ignored completely.  Most of that happened within the first couple of months.  You see, no-one had touched these cases before us.  So, no-one in BOI knows how to work cases.  They mention things we should be looking out for and then decide it doesn’t matter.  They change the way we work saying it’ll make things easier, that it’ll mean we’re actually working cases right through rather than them going to PTEC (the clinic that decides on cases we can’t finish.  More on them later) which makes things more complicated and has the opposite results.  We make jokes about how long it’ll be before it’s reversed.
Take the last couple of days.
There’s a specific type of loan which the team I’m on, and only us, have been trained for.
Now the process for working these cases is broken and always have been.  We got quite a few of these cases through on Friday and proceeded to work them.  Yesterday, the decision was finally made to stop working these cases until the process has been fixed.
Today, we started getting PTEC decisions back on the ones we worked. Now, PTEC decisions are works of art.  If said art is made by a five year old with ADHD and hopped up on more E numbers than you even knew existed.  When they are not bothering to explain why they made the decision they did (which is kinda essential when you have to explain that in your notes on the case) they make a decision on one thing you referred the case to them for but not the rest.
So, we’ve been told to rework the cases in question based on these decisions that may not actually apply once they’ve decided how the cases need to work.  We’ve also been told that under certain conditions we can request further information to discover if the customer(s) were employed at POS.  We had to go through all the cases and see if this was needed and, if so, request the information.
When doing this, there are, of course, quite a few cases that haven’t been touched.  You’d think that we’d be told just to leave them, right?
How much of this entry have you actually read?
What we had to do is find the files, see if they need this information and request it anyway.
For a case we’re not allowed to work.  Where the additional information might soon be superfluous.
Yeah.
I thought I was bitter, jaded and cynical before.  This job has made it much much worse.
And this is before I get into the ridiculousness of the quality department.  Which I’m applying to join.  It’s an extra 2 grand a month and if I’m on that team they can’t piss me off.
So, that’s my work.  There’s a reason we’re all nuts.
Will

As I mentioned in this entry I’m planning to go home to Aberdeen in November for Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy Live
It turns out I didn’t check the website properly, cos it’s also going to be on just up the road from me.
Now, the question is, do i go to both?
Down side is two paying for two tickets.  (If I only go to the one, it’ll be Billingham.  Cheaper.)
Upside is a)I’m a huge H2G2 fan, b) giving my dad his present (his birthday is just before) c)already got the time off work anyway, so may as well and d)it will be different due to different people playing the voice of the Book.
Any thoughts?

452,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/grrrrrrrrrrrr-edit-2-3931118/,2013-07-22,GRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! *EDIT*,"
I have Sky TV.  My first bill is due soon.  In fact, the first direct debit is due out on the 26th.  I don’t get paid till the end of the month.  This, as you may well imagine, may be a problem.
So I phoned them to get it changed.  Only to find out they can’t do that as I need to give them 14 days notice.  Apparently, it’s the law.  Problem is, they didn’t actually give me 14 days notice.  Or did they?
I have paperless billing.  I have this for everything.  They posted my bill online in time for me to change this.  Course, they didn’t bother to let me know this…
I was told they would try to take the money twice then my services would be cut (but no time frame for that happening), basically made to feel as if the whole thing was my fault then advised that if I wanted to avoid bank charges, I would have to cancel the direct debit at my bank.  Which I have done.
And that’s not all…
When I signed up for Sky, I was told because I did so online, I would get a £75 Marks and Spencers voucher.  It arrived on Friday and, surprisingly, it was a £100 voucher.  Now, I need a new suit, so I used it online to get one.
It arrived on Monday, I picked it up and discovered that the jacket didn’t fit.  So I took it back today hoping to swap it.
Turns out because I bought it in an online sale, they don’t have it.  So they gave me a refund.  Well, a credit voucher.  Which, it turns out, I can’t use online.  (Something about a bar code.)  And, it turns out, if the person in the shop had just given me the jacket back, I could have sent it back (freepost, no less) and got a refund to my card.  Which meant I could have got the jacket eventually.
Instead, I have a credit note that I can’t use to get what I need.  No Suit.  A pair of trousers that are essentially useless and can either be swapped for another credit note that will basically be of no use as I still can’t use them for what I need to get (the only suit I can get for the same money in store in black is a dinner suit, a bit too posh for my needs) and a fair amount of grief.
Frustrating day, and it doesn’t include work!
Yes, I am drinking.  No, I’m not drinking as much as I’d like to be.
Will
*EDIT*
After a few emails back and forth, I was told that I could order my replacement jacket in the store.  Which I was emphatically told yesterday I couldn’t
So, after work I came home, got my credit note and the trousers(if I was told I couldn’t get the jacket, I was planning to return them as they’d be useless) and went back to Marks and Sparks…
…and ordered my jacket.
Turns out the person yesterday lied to me.  Which, well, not fucking happy about.
So I’m picking it up on Friday.

I am definitely getting a new tattoo.  If not before, then cdertainly on the 13th of September at a place called Skins and Needles and it’ll cost me £13.  Don’t know what it’ll be yet but…
That’s not what this entry is about.
For ages there’s a particular tattoo I’ve wanted.  It’s a band.  A double infinity symbol (like the one Emily has in Revenge) joined by a Celtic infinity knot.  I love both designs and joining them together just seems to make sense.
Earlier on, I discovered this on Google:

It’s the exact double infinity symbol that I want with the addition of snakes, which I also love.
A bit more searching gave me this:

Which I think fits in with the snakes.  And it looks good.
So, have the parts I need to get the tattoo.
Problem is, I can’t put them together.  I have absolutely no art or photoshop skills.  (Seriously, even my stik men are barely recognisable as being stick men.)
I don’t want to get the artist to do it as I’m A) not sure when I’ll be getting it and B) I’m not 100% certain it’ll look good.
Any advice?  Any volunteers to help?

That’s what my team leader called me today.  The ninja bit is because I tend to sneak up to him (easier at the moment, I have to wear trainers).  And the James Bond bit?

This is how I dressed for work today.  I think everyone in the department asked me why.  My team leaders reaction was completely priceless.
I really want to wear this to work tomorrow…

…but sadly there’s a ban on clothing that might cause offence.  even if it is true for some of the people (mostly from BOI).
What next?  Oh, that’s right.  Trainers!
For about a month, I’d had a pull pain (well, mostly dull pain) in my foot and occasionally shooting up the back of my leg.
Now the way I used to make an appointment was to go in and ask for one.  Now, they have a new system, whereby the doctor will phone you back for the appointment.  I went in on the Monday and left my details.  The doctor phoned and left a message asking me to phone back after 3.  So, I phoned him back when I finished work.
Remember the entry I posted about the bomb scare?  Well, guess where my doctors office is?
So, I phoned the next day on my lunch break.  Only to find out that the switchboard was shut for lunch.  And wouldn’t be open again till after I was back at work.  So, I went in agai, complained about their system and was promised a call after I finished work.
7pm, the doctor called.  So, yeah, slightly after I finished a 3:30.
Swollen tendon in my foot.  So I have to wear my trainers and take ibuprofen.  I also mentioned the fact my arm is sore after I finish work, so he gave me a fit note for a assessment of my desk.  (Actually, need to find out what is happening with that).
Trip to Aberdeen next month.  It’s my parents 40th wedding anniversary and their planning a family meal.  It does also mean that I can has Jamie tiem!
I’ve discovered my flat is a heat trap.  Which, considering how much I don’t like heat, is a frikking nightmare.  I’m pretty sure it’s contributed to my dizziness every morning.
Beyond that, not much happening.  Work, home, eat, talk to Nessa monster, watch TV, bed.  Oh, what an interesting life I lead…
I’ll leave you with this:

It’s too fucking hot!
So, what’s been happening in my life?
I will touch on work here, but that’s going to be a whole other entry.
Apart from that, things are good.
Finally out of the B&B.  I was planning to look for somewhere else anyway, but the owner of the B&B had this flat going spare.  So it’s £10 a week more than before, but it’s much nicer.  It’s quite big.  Well, the living room and bedroom are.  The kitchen is small and doesn’t have enough storage.  But I’ll forgive that cos I can actually cook!
I’m not sure how many of you know this about me, but I like to cook.  And I like to think I’m good at it.  The kitchen in the B&B was fucking grim, so I subsisted on takeout, crisps and pasta salads.
So I’ve had great fun actually making food.  I’ve made spaghetti bolognaise (making the sauce myself) a few times and chilli.  Incidentally, if anyone has a decent chilli recipe that doesn’t involve making the sauce out of a packet, I’d appreciate it.
I’ve also got myself a new laptop and telly.  I worked a shitload (a scientific measurement, slightly less than a metric fuckton) of overtime 
to scrape together a deposit.  But I didn’t need it, so I used the money, well what was left after tax, national insurance and, very surprisingly, student loans got their bit, to get a new laptop.  I also got broadband so, yay!
And I got a telly.  Didn’t really need one before, nor did I have the room for one, but I do kinda need one for the flat.  32″ flat screen, built in DVD player and Freeview, which I don’t need now I have Sky.
So I’ve become oddly addicted to a show called Bitchin’ Kitchen’.  Not really sure how to describe it.
Also seen a few things that made me want to punch the screen.  One thing in particular last night.
What else?
Still going out with Nessa monster, still planning to go over and see her, already booked time off.  Now to get my tickets.  Oh, and a passport.
Also loving this year music wise.  By Hogmanay, we’ll have had new albums by David Bowie, Frank Turner, Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, Daft Punk, The Civil Wars, Nine Inch Nails and James Blake.  Very, very happy.  (The new Bowie and Turner are absolutely brilliant by the way.)
Went to see Mick Foley, one of my all time favourite wrestlers in stand up.  Some of the stories I’d read in his books but overall brilliant.  I’m planning to invade Lincoln end of next month for a Doctor Who convention.  So if you know anyone who lives there, you may want to warn them to get out of town that weekend.  Unless they are the friends I’m staying with.  They have to stay put.
Then in November, I’m heading home for Hitchhikers Guide Live!  Which I’m tempted to get my sister to get my ticket for me cos she’ll get a discount.
Apart from that, all is fine.  Cancer scare with my mums dog, but she’s fine now as far as I know.
Have to go cook now.  I’ll leave you with my new anthem.  Enjoy.
Will

…after suspected bomb scare
9 Jul 2013 09:09
A controlled explosion was carried out after a suspicious package brought Middlesbrough town centre to a standstill
Share on print Share on email
Police incident in Middlesbrough town centre
Hundreds of people were evacuated after a suspicious package was discovered near Middlesbrough town centre shops.
The Cleveland Centre was cleared and shop and office staff were left to bask in the sunshine after having to vacate their workplaces.
Police quickly cordoned off a large area of the town centre as a precautionary measure.
Bomb disposal experts were called in from Catterick and an explosion was later heard after the suspect package was blown up.
Large crowds gathered in the summer sunshine as the drama unfolded.
Cleveland Police were alerted after an unattended rucksack was found shortly before 2pm.
Speaking at the scene yesterday, Sgt Neil Robinson said: There was a report from members of the public that there was a package outside the O2 shop on the precinct.
Officers attended the scene and subsequently identified the location.
Obviously the safety of the public is paramount.
Therefore the precinct was evacuated, which included shops, staff and members of the public going about their day-to-day business.
The whole of the Cleveland Centre was evacuated as a precautionary measure.
All the shops have been evacuated from Grange Road right the way down to Debenhams and Littlewoods.
He said the number of people evacuated would probably be in the hundreds.
Obviously with something like this we take it seriously and we wouldnt want any members of the public to come to any harm.
Much of the town centre was cordoned off, causing major disruption.
About 30 police officers were deployed, with police dogs and mounted officers, along with PCSOs.
The bomb disposal team arrived from Catterick shortly after 3.30pm.
A robot device was sent in to deal with the package and at about 3.50pm a controlled explosion was heard.
Sgt Robinson said as a result they would be carrying out further inquiries to establish the exact nature of the package.
At about 4.15pm he said they were letting staff back into their premises but members of the public were staying behind the cordons for the time being.

This is about 5 minutes from my work.  We weren’t evacuated.
It would probably be cruel and cynical of me to suggest if it had been a bomb, no-one would have noticed the difference…

And, no, I’m not winding you up this time.
About a month ago, I attended a creative writing session at Middlesbrough Institute of Modern Art (MIMA).  We got to see some pieces of modern art and given writing exercises around each one.  We then had some general exercises like describe modern art as a person and the rules for viewing modern art.  We were told some of our stuff may be used in a booklet.  
This came out yesterday:

For one of the pieces I completely ignored the exercise (shock) and wrote something else.  The organizers loved it and basically told me it would be included.  As it is.  Also included are my rules for enjoying modern art.
Want to read my stuff?  Get along to MIMA and pick up a booklet :-p
Oh, ok then.  Apologies for the pic quality:

I know, I know, I owe you guys a massive general update, including the latest nonsense from work.  And there has been a fair amount of that.
However, last night was the Big Tees Sleepout, and I want to write that up.
The event was scheduled to start at 8.  So, about half seven, I got mu stuff together (backpack, sleeping bag, roll mat) and headed up to the college.  I was advised to wear layers, so I wore a NIN long sleeved top under my blood donor t shirt, my Rammestein hoodie (which is the thickest one I have) over that and my coat.  I also took a spare jumper, just in case, but it ended up being added to my coat in my sleeping bag cover to make a pillow.
On the way I listened to the new Bowie album (very, very fucking good BTW) and finally got there.
I followed everyone else to where it was actually happening and signed in.  I then set up my bed for the night:

(Actually, we got moved from there as we were too out of the way to keep an eye on.)
There were all sorts of things there.  People who brought the same as me, people with pillows, people with chairs, someone brought a large cardboard box to sleep under, a surprising number of people in onsies and someone even brought a tnt (which prompted discussion about if they were cheating)
I then settled down and, probably to the surprise of no-one, read the book I was almost finished.  I also drank a surprising amount of tea as tea, coffee and hot chocolate had been provided.  There were also cupcakes someone had made and Marks and Spencers supplied biscuits.
I stayed outside most of the night apart from when I was hiding.  Someone, in their infinite wisdom, had decided we would do a Harlem Shake.  I have no idea what one of them is and have no intention of ever finding out.  The best way to void it was to hide.  This turned out to have an ancillary benefit as I missed the rain.
I eventually went back outside and resumed reading, with regular hot drink and smoke breaks.  Once I finished the book I was reading, I moved onto the next one:

You probably can’t see it properly, (the one problem I have with Sansumg phones is their absolute refusal to incluse a flash), so here it is before I packed it:

It just had to be done, really.
Then, about 12:30 a car pulled up.  People were joking about finding out who ordered pizza.
Turns out, no-one did.
Mighty Bites, a pizza shop in the area, decided to donate pizza, garlic bread and chips to the event.  This was much welcome.
Once the food had been consumed and the chatter and singing died down a bit, I bedded down for the night.  It wasn’t the warmest, most comfortable nights sleep I’ve ever had, but it wasn’t exactly the worst either.
Woke up about 6:15 to this:

Which isn’t something I see every day.
There was a group photo (which I will post here when it’s online), breakfast from McDonalds, wrangling my sleeping bag back into it’s cover and then home.
Which is the point.
I got to go home.  There are plenty of people out there who don’t get to do that.
There have been people making comments online about what the point of this was.  That IS the point.  I experienced it for one night and was greatful that I could go home.  The services that help these people are running out of money and if I could help raise funds for them, if I could raise awareness of the real issue of homelessness and experience, even for a night, what it’s like, it was worth doing.
Speaking of…
The event may be over, but I’m still looking for donations.  As things stand, I am £14 short of reaching £100.  If I could break that, I’d be happy.  If I could get more, even better.  You can make a donation here
Aso, if you live in Aberdeen (I know a couple of my readers do), there is a Big Sleepout Aberdeen event taking place on Friday.  More details here
Now to find a homeless charity to volunteer for.

…to Big Tees Sleepout
by Dave Robson, Evening GazetteMar 11 2013
TWO people with personal experience of homelessness today add their backing to the Big Tees Sleepout. Dave Robson reports.
MORE than 100 hardy souls have already agreed to sleep outside for the night at Middlesbrough College on Saturday, March 16.
But organisers want more people to sign up for Teessides biggest ever sponsored sleepout, with proceeds going to homeless charities.
And among those taking part are two people who know what its like to be homeless.
Middlesbrough councillor Len Junier and Middlesbrough Councils homeless co-ordinator Sharon Caddell have different stories to tell.
Councillor for Middlesbroughs North Ormesby and Brambles Farm ward since 2009, Len, 52, was homeless twice as he grew up on Stocktons Portrack estate. Sharon ended up in a Middlesbrough hostel for two years.
And today, they bravely agree to share their stories in a bid to raise awareness of homelessness – and the Big Sleepout.

On sleeping rough, Len says: Its a very lonely existence. People often have a romantic idea of sleeping out under the stars but those taking part in the sleepout are in for a very uncomfortable, strange night.
Ive been told not to do it because Im diabetic and Ive got a bad hip, but I am going to do it. For me, its about trying to allay some of my ghosts.
Being homeless was part of what made me who I am, so Im not ashamed of what happened to me, though I was for a while.
What I am ashamed of is we have a society that still allows these things to happen. There are literally hundreds of homeless people on Teesside now and I fear well see a lot more of it the longer the current economic climate continues.
Sharon said: People ask why in this age do we have homelessness? I think they imagine that if you need somewhere to live, you just go to the council and theres social housing for you but life isnt as simple as that. Its a complex situation.
The Big Sleepout aims to raise funds for a range of local homeless charities and food banks, while helping raise the profile of homelessness across the Teesside region.
Businesswoman Joanna Wake, owner of Raw Marketing Company as well as running the Mary Portas pilot in Stockton, has joined forces with Middlesbrough and Teesside Philanthropic Foundation to organise the event.
Were grateful to all those who have already committed to join us on March 16, said Joanna. We cant promise them a great nights sleep but we do promise them an experience that will stay with them.
But the challenge is all about raising as much money as possible, so wed urge them to get their friends, family and contacts to sponsor them for as much as they can spare  and we need more people to sign up.
To take part, sign up, raise sponsorship money and turn up at Middlesbrough College at 8pm on Saturday, bringing a sleeping bag and wearing layers of warm clothes. Hot and cold drinks will be provided, as well as toilet facilities.
Participants must be over 16 on the day of the event and register online in advance. Visit http://www.bigteessidesleepout.co.uk.
Len’s story
“I CAME home from school one day when I was 14 to find my house empty.
My mother had left a note for me and my older brother saying shed made a decision to get on with her own life on her own.
My father, an alcoholic, was long gone, so we were on our own, aged 14 and 16. My brother just moved in with his girlfriend, but I didnt have that option.
“I carried on living in our council house on my own and going to school every day. But six days later, I came home and the house was boarded up. I guess news had got out my parents were no longer there.
“I went to a social services office and told them what had happened. They said Thats awful. Come back on Tuesday. It was Thursday.
“I did bit of sofa surfing for a few days. Friends looked after me, but that was never going to work long term. I could have gone and knocked on the door of one of the neighbours and Portrack was the sort of estate back then that Im sure theyd have taken me in, but I was far too proud to do that.

“I hung around with Crows fair for a while. I was well fed and had some money in my pocket but we worked 14-hour days and there was the constant threat of violence.
“I spent eight weeks sleeping in cardboard boxes. I used to go down to the river where there were little huts on the old British Steel site and a derelict hospital. I used to break in and sleep on the floor.
“I convinced myself I wasnt scared but deep down I was. Im still terribly scared now of mice and rats because I got bitten by them so much.
“Im not proud to say I turned to shoplifting. Keeping myself clean was another big issue. Id sneak into the baths when schools were in, mix with the crowd and go for a swim.
“I got to the lowest point when I was 16. I tried to kill myself with tablets but woke up in North Tees Hospital. My mam turned up out of the blue, remorseful about having left me like she did, then dad turned up and I ended up going home with him. I stayed with him for a couple of years but he was still drinking heavily and I eventually made the decision I was probably better off homeless than living with an alcoholic.
“I made arrangements to stay with friends in Primrose Hill for a while, though I was effectively homeless again. I spent 18 months wandering around, staying with friends and family before meeting the woman who would become my first wife and starting to turn my life around.”
Sharon’s story
“WHEN I was 16, I was a typical teenager, I suppose, and wasnt getting on with my mam and dad.
Our relationship was really strained for reasons which, with hindsight, Id put down to me. In a fit of pique, I walked out one day and left home.
“I stayed with friends and family members initially but I wound up in a hostel.
“Fortunately, I had an awful lot of support from my mam and dad when I think back. They didnt want me to leave but I felt I couldnt live under their rules any longer. Youd be surprised how common that attitude is among young people. I was really lucky  Id been taught money skills at a young age. So many I come across now havent got a clue at all about such things. They are very naive and vulnerable, so they fail quite quickly.
“I spent about six weeks sofa surfing, asking friends, family, anybody, if I could stay with them. Its quite a humbling state to be in when you havent got a roof. I felt like I hadnt, for whatever reason, as I didnt think it was an option to go home. After six weeks, I went to a hostel in Middlesbrough and was there for about two years.
“To be honest, it was really lonely and sometimes scary. It wasnt a bad hostel at all and I had a nice room all to myself but it was a lonely experience. It was scary just because I was 16 and I was still getting used to living independently. It was quite scary sharing living space with strangers and Id get easily scared at night if I heard noises. There was an awful lot of fear.

“There was also a real stigma of being homeless. I was still trying to go to college at the time, but no one else was in mysituation, everyone else lived with their parents.
“I was really stubborn about not going home. I just thought Ive made my bed and Ive got to lie in it. Ive got kids myself now and cant imagine them being in that position. My parents must have been really worried when I think back.
“Eventually I moved into a flat of my own and got a job.”

So, this is tonight and I’m taking part.  Got everything I need for it, but still looking for donations.  If you wish to donate (and I sincerely hope you do), you can do so here

I just thought I would write a bit more about the Big Tees Sleepout and why I’m taking part.
Obviously, the bad economy has hit charities hard, as it has everyone.  In addition, it has also seen a rise in homelessness, which stretches things even tighter.
Now, it’s ok for big national charities like Shelter, who can go on advertising blitzes and get celebrities involved.  But for smaller, local charities, it’s a problem.
Hence the sleepout.  The event is being run by the Middlesbrough and Teesside Philanthropic Society and all of the money goes to homeless charities and food banks in Teesside.  You can read more in this article in the local paper
I, thankfully, have never had to sleep rough.  And, touch wood, hopefully the closest I’ll ever come is on March 16th.  But just because I’ve never experienced it, doesn’t mean I can’t, nor should not, do something to help those for whom homelessness isn’t just one night but their actual day to day existence.
I really, really hope that if you have a bit of spare cash, you’ll visit my Justgiving page and contribute (and if you live in the UK, don’t forget to Gift Aid it).
And, whether you can afford to give or not, please do me a favour and spread the word.  If you’re friends with me on Facebook, share one of my posts about this.  If you follow me on Twitter, give me a re-tweet.  Post a link on your diary.  Post about it on forums.  Email people.  Hire a plane to drag a banner if you so wish.
I know this is shameless, but I’m happy to be so for a good cause.

Hope you all had a good one!
At the moment, I’m in Aberdeen.  Saturday was chaos.  As neither me or my brother would be home for Christmas Day, and my sister and brother in law were taking Jamie to the other set of grandparents on the day, my mum decided to delay Christmas dinner til Saturday.
As a result, there was me, mum, dad, Matthew (brother), Alisa (SIL), Tracey, Brian (BIL) and Jamie in the house.  Oh, and my mums dog Tia and Matthew and Alisa’s dog Fleur.
Organised chaos is the best phrase I can use.  The dogs enjoyed playing with Jamie’s toys, which didn’t bother him as he just played with theirs.
But, it was nice getting some uncle time.  There aren’t many photo’s of the two of us, but my sister did manage to get this one:

As for Hogmanay itself, I went into town and watched the fireworks.  They were alright, but I’m wondering how much the local paper paid the people they spoke to that loved them and thought they were brilliant.  One person thought they looked 3D which being, y’know, real and in you actual genuine three dimensions shouldn’t be much of a surprise.
Look, look, I know, shit weather and budget cuts and all that, but, seriously?  A 15 minute firework display that doesn’t even last 15 minutes is the best the city can do?  Can they not ask Twatface Woods or new cooncil mate Trump or Wiggy Milne to chip in and have something a bit more spectacular?
Moan over.
Then, today I went to my favourite place in the world ever to see my gran.  Three of us jammed in the back seat, it felt like being a kid again.  Except only one of us was a kid, as I’m sure Tracey and Jamie would agree…
Before we left, Jamie decided that his gran would make a very comfy bed…

And that’s really about it.
In case you’re wondering, no actual New Years resolutions, just a promise that I will definitely get more writing done.  AKA, the same damn promise I’ve made for months.
Supposed to have a meeting tomorrow to get my months notice from work.  Ah, well.  Fuck ’em.  I booked this time off long before I was told I was being made redundant.
Here, have Charlie Brooker speaking about the single most annoying song of 2012:

So, I’m doing the job hunting thing (which isn’t easy since the DWP fucked up, I mean “improved”, the job centre website) and there’s a job I think I could be good at.
Admittedly, it is less money than I’m on just now, but that doesn’t really bother me.
I googled the place to find out how to apply (the job centre website doesn’t seem to think I need information like that) and it sounds interesting.
The problem is that they are looking for someone to start on Jan 2nd, and I’ll still be in Aberdeen then.
So, the question is: do I apply for the job knowing that I’ll have to ask them to delay my start date?
Getting finished at work before then shouldn’t be a problem cos others have done so.  It’s just if it would affect my chances of getting the job that I’m stressing about.
Advice?  Random abuse?
As for work?  Well, still no systems.  And they decided to move my department into another part of the building to save money on rent.  And have since discovered that, because they are beefing up another department, there is now a lack of space.
Oooops!
Actually, I’ve applied for a job in that department.  Still waiting to hear back, which I thought I would have done by now.
And it turns out that I get paid on Christmas Eve instead of Hogmanay.  Which is useful, seeing as how I won’t be seeing most people I’m getting Christmas gifts for till New Year.
Apart from that, things are going well.  Arguing with T-Mobile about my upgrade, which I was promised I would definitely have this month.  Bloody idiots.
Looking forward to the Scifi Weekender.  If I can find others to come with me.
I’m seeing a hardcore legend in April!  Mick Foley, one of my all time favourite wrestlers, is bringing his stand up show to the Town Hall and I got me a ticket.  Not a meet and greet, unfortunately, but never mind.  I’ll settle for being in the same room as him.
Still uber excited about Nessa Monster visiting.  We won’t have as much time together as I’d have liked, due to lack of holidays at  work, but still.  I get to see her!
I may be plotting evil schemy type things for when she’s here.  But can’t say too much.  Cos she’ll read it.
Remember the dinosaur park I posted pics of here?  Well, it turns out that the land has been put up for sale for the construction of units.  In an area with plenty of unused units…
Don’t forget, previous entry if you want an e-card.

Sort of.  It was announced at work today that the contract for payments, the department I’m in, has been extended till the end of January.  No idea yet if that still includes the gardening leave or if it’ll be my months notice.  Obviously, I’ll be hoping for the latter.
At least it means I have another month for job hunting.  There was a job fair at work yesterday and today.  Well, I say job fair.  It was a few tables in the canteen with various companies.  Two of them outright admitted that there’s no point in me applying cos of transport issues, one is a call centre with, well, odd working hours and the other one I can find no information about the actual job online.
It does mean that I’ll have to book some time off cos NESSA MONSTER WILL BE HERE FOR MY BIRTHDAY!  WOOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
(I may be a bit excited.  Dunno if you noticed.)
In ‘my work may not be the brightest of companies’ news, there’s fun and games with the Christmas meal.  Firstsource are giving us £17.50 each towards the meal, as long as we follow certain rules.  The money is for an event involving food which  has to be approved by our team leader and must be in December.  (Seriously, that’s one of the rules.  Wonder if someone tried claiming for a meal in January or something.)
Another part of this is that we have to spend our own money and then claim it back.  In order to do this, we have to sebmit individual reciepts.  except the place we’re going to doesn’t let anyone in a group pay individually.  So, God knows how that’s going to work out.
In other news, anyone interested in attending the Sci-Fi Weekender?  I’ve won six tickets and am still looking for people to take the extra ones.  It is £80 for accommodation but that includes being able to check in on the Thursday, which is normally another £35.  Have a look at the website and drop me a note if interested.
Here’s one of the songs I want at my funeral:

Writing is finally about one thing: going into a room alone and doing it. Putting words on paper that have never been there in quite that way before. And although you are physically by yourself, the haunting Demon never leaves you, that Demon being the knowledge of your own terrible limitations, your hopeless inadequacy, the impossibility of ever getting it right.

The press were camped outside.
Firstsource sent out a press release about the redundancies.  So, because Massey Road has a big Barclaycard sign outside and Fountain Court has a big Firstsource sign, they came to us.
Well, I say camped out, there was one van (which had to move because it was double parked) and then a ITV Tyne Tees van.
A couple of emails were circulated (or cascaded down, in the latest management business bullshit speak) about the media being there and who to direct them to.  And the usual thing about social media.  Which, come to think about it, includes OD.  (Seriously, that’s the reason the filter at work gives for blocking it.)  Please don’t clipe on me?
Story in the local paper.
I’m not sure how much of that you can trust.  Some of it is consistant with what we’ve been told and some of it isn’t.  And some is blatant bullshit.  At the moment they only have 19 internal vacancies for us to apply for.  I think they’re hoping that something else comes along and helps them.
In non-redundancy news…
I’ve started a crime writing course.  Well, it’s about half way through.  It’s really good.  I’m getting a lot out of it and people seem to like my idea.
Read the new JK Rowling book.  Buy it, it’s brilliant.
Now to just wait for the new Justin Cronin.
Also went to see Looper, opening week.  The second best time travel thing this year.  (See if you can guess the first.)
We’re going to have an election in Middlesbrough soon.  Sir Stuart Bell, who was barely here, had been named the laziest MP in Britain, couldn’t be bothered to turn up to the hustings for the last election and seemes to spend most his time in France) died this morning.  We’re getting the usual platitudes.
I know who will win in the by-election.  Whoever runs for Labour.  These parts, you could stick a Labour rosette on a bacon buttie and it would get elected.  Just hope they actually does more for the town.
Not really much else to say, so I’ll leave you with a rap song from Abeerdeen.  Enjoy!

"
483,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/so-then-19-3930976/,2012-10-06,So then…,"
I know, I know, I have a lot to catch you lot up on.
But, unsurprisingly, there’s only one thing really on my mind right now.
So, more information.  From what the union rep told us on Friday, we’ll find out before the end of the year if we are being kept on or not.  If not, our last day will be the 3rd of January (why then when the 4th is the Friday I do not understand) then we will get gardening leave, whatever the hell that is (one month for me).
Now, this has been rumoured for a while.  Telephony basically found out first.  This is because of CMC’s telling them they’d been told that they would be dealing with people somewhere else.
Oh, and apparently, that place has been phoning to gloat about it.
Classy.
The mood in work on Thursday was, unsurprisingly, stunned disbelief.  Added to that was some humour.
I missed the original meeting and found out when one of my colleagues joked that I might get systems access and work maybe one case before it shut down.
(This, by the way, is my main concern.  I still don’t have systems.  In fact, in the time I’ve been there I’ve only actually done 4 days work.  On telephony.  Which I wasn’t supposed to be on and was assured in my interview I absolutely would not be doing.  When they are deciding who to keep, how can I be sure that they won’t look at my record, not bother to contextualise it, and decide that as I’m lazy I can go?)
People aren’t bothered about hitting targets cos, let’s face it, what’s the worst they can do?
On Friday, it wouldn’t be fair to say that morale was low.  Only cos there was no such bloody thing.
Well, there was anger.
Turns out that there were people from Barclaycard in work end of last week/beginning of this week and someone asked them if they were learning our jobs because we were going to lose them.  They were told no.
Then there’s things like my manager reassuring us a while back that payments would be safe until March at least.  (Though, I don’t blame him.  He was probably told that by Firstsource.)
So, that’s where we are.  I’m adopting an attitude of hope for the best, prepare for the worst.  I’ve updated my CV and am back on the job hunt.
GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!
I’ll finish with this song.  I’ve been hearing it a lot which I don’t mind, cos it’s good.
Will

Yesterday, the email about the Bloody Scotland competition was sent out.  They didn’t announce the overall winner, but did say they had already been contacted.  They did announce the 19 runners up.

Long time readers will be familiar with this, but for the newbies, my reaction to the first draft of a story usually ranges from ‘It’s OK’, to ‘Oh dear God this is fucking appalling and I’m going to use every method I can think of to destroy my computer and, specifically, the hard drive so no-one will ever, ever know that I wrote this shit.’
So, you can imagine how it felt when I finished this and thought ‘It needs a bit of work, and a new title for sure, but apart from that this is really really good.’
Each revision only made it stronger.
And then it turns out it’s not even amongst the top 20 stories in a field of 230.
And I can’t make sense of that.
Which is where I want help.
Would anyone be willing to volunteer to read the submitted piece and give me honest feedback?
It doesn’t matter if you have already read earlier versions.  In fact, it can only help.
I’m putting notes on this entry to private.  If you want to read it, leave me a note with your email address, even if I already have it.

So, last time I wrote about my work was on the 22nd of last month and I didn’t have systems access.
Well, I still don’t have systems access.  Kinda.
Since moving to the Middlesbrough office, I have mostly been reading, dealing with mail and writing.
Not that kind of writing.  They have dividers for our personelle files and the first one also has a thing for saying what each section is actually for.
I’ve been the one writing that information there.
This far, I have done about 420 of the bloody things.  They usually give me 3 boxes at a time and each box contains 30 of the fuckers.
Do you know how much it bloody hurts doing that?  I’m still getting the feeling back in my fingertip.
Oh, and I also open the door for people.  Cos the bloody magnetic bloody lock keeps causing bloody issues.
Still, my team leader got excited today as she had actually been given a user id for me to get onto the system which allows me access to all the other systems.  I still have to use the guest log in for actually getting on the computer (to be fair, so does she) but all i’d need to do is phone IT and get my password.
Simple, right?
Oh, how poorly you know my work…
I phone up, tell them what I need, my manager goes through security checks , they put me on hold and…
It turns out I’m not authorised on the system to have access to Citrix.
I tell my manager what happened.  Turns out, I should have been given a reference number.
So, I phone up, again, go through the whole process, again, get the reference number, give it to my manager and go back to reading The Time Travellers Wife.
And now I’m begining to think that, at work, I am the Milton.
In other news, I didn’t get the Northern Promise thing I entered for.  Ah well.  I’m going to keep writing the novel (work actually helped me with that, it gave me a great idea that really helped unlock things) and the Bloody Scotland results are this month so, still got fingers crossed for that.  Also, came up with another book idea and a couple of things I really want to get into a story.
Going to finally see The Dark Knight Rises on Wednesday, so in preperation I went to a Batman Begins/The Dark Knight double bill.  Two films for the price of one and I already knew they were awesome.  How could I really turn that down?
(Incidentally, am I the only one who finds it amusing that the tumbler has a GPS system?)
Booking my tickets home for Jamies blessing tomorrow.  And the great thing is that because of when it is and when I finish work, I don’t need to book time off work.
Which I couldn’t do anyway, I need system access for that.
Still missing Nessa monster like crazy.

492,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/defence-2-3930943/,2012-07-23,Defence,"
This is a follow up post from my previous entry, but, in all honesty, it’s not one I should actually have to write.
You see, some people took what I wrote and decided this:
ZOMG HE JUST SAID THAT U SHOULDN’T BE ALLOWED 2 DEFEND URSELF AND THAT IF SOMEONE TRIES TO RAPE OR ATTASULT U OR ABUSE UR CHILD U JUST HAVE 2 LET THEM DO IT AND IF YOU DONT YOU SHUD B LOCKED UP 4 A MILLION BILLION GAZILLION YEARS AND UR ATTACKER LET OFF COZ THEY GOOD GUZ!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!ELEVENTYONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
And if you think that’s just me being hyperbolic, here’s some direct quotes.
This first one comes from the following entry, which was a rebuttal to my entry:
Know what I find sickening? People who have more compassion for rapists and murderers than they have for their victims. Sickening is for some pompous nitwit from the UK suggesting that defending yourself is sickening and should be punished. 
Shall we outlaw golf clubs? Scissors? A vase?  
And this is one left on the entry itself:
People being robbed, raped, and murdered will just have to sit there and take it, because fighting back is effectively outlawed. Parents will be forced to watch…as psychotic child-killers do what they do best to their children.
Sound like a world you’d like to live in?
(The ellipsis is because that bit was spread over two notes, not because I left anything out)
So, there you have it.  I’m a sickening pompous nitwit who thinks that people who defend themselves should be punished and that people being robed, raped and murdered should sit back and take it and would force parents to watch their child being abused because I have more sympathy with their attacker than with them.
Oh, and I want to outlaw decorative flower holders, sporting equipment and devices for cutting paper.
Now, there are many, many ways I could misconstrue what they have said, much as they did with me.  But I’m not going to do that, cos I know they didn’t acutually mean what I could say they meant.
Sadly, I do think that their interpretation of my words is actually what I meant.  And the reason that they believe that is because they have become convinced that the only way to protect yourself is by owning a gun.  There is nothing else you can do.
Or, put it another way, I can’t defend myself without breaking the law.
Just so that this entry can’t be misconstrued like the last one, let me make my meaning abundantly clear.
You absolutely have the right to defend yourself.  Of course you do.  Take up martial arts, invest in a decent pair of shitkicker boots, learn to run very, very fast.
Hell, get yourself a security detail to rival that of the President, if you wish.
But the sole purpose of a gun is to kill.  That is what they are made for.  The termination of a life.  And that is all they are made for.  And other stated uses (like maiming) are an offshoot of that, not the other way round.  Forgive me for thinking that access to something designed for that one purpose should be very, very, very, very difficult to get your hands on.
But, I hear you say, that doesn’t matter!  The fact that you might have a gun at all is enough to prevent something like that happening!  You don’t need to use it at all!
Prove it.  Go on.  Show me statistics that prove that states with a conceal carry law have lower crime rates than states that don’t and then show me the evidence this is due to the conceal carry law.
Besides, if someone is determined to carry out a rape/murder/assault, won’t they do it regardless of if the vitcim is armed or not?
So, there is my position.  Yes to defending yourself.  No to needing a firearm to do so.
Any questions?

"
493,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/guns-16-3930941/,2012-07-21,Guns,"
By now, you’ll all be very much aware of the shooting at the Dark Knight Rises midnight screening on Friday.  Having fired guns as a member of the army Cadet Force, I have a deep and abiding respect for them.  I also am of the belief that access to weapons should be severely limited and it is in no way a right, human or otherwise, to possess them.
The arguments for the other side are numerous and in this entry, I hope to de-construct them.
The first argument given is that incidents like this are actually a reason to slacken gun laws as if people in the audience had weapons with them, the guy would have been stopped earlier.  Not in this case, as the perpetrator was wearing full body armour.
I have yet to see any statistical information that proves this to be the case and would very much like to do so.
The next argument is that stricter gun control laws don’t work, will not work and have never worked.  Ever.
The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland would very much like to disagree with that.
In the aftermath of Dunblane, which was carried out by someone with a gun licence and using legally owned weapons, there was an investigation into gun ownership in the UK.  This lead to severe, severe tightening of limits on who could own a gun license, how often it had to be renewed, the circumstances in which it could be revoked, the purchase, storage and registering of firearms and where and when they could be fired (meaning the shooting events at this years Olympics and the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow in 2 years time have to be held at a police shooting range as anywhere else would be illegal).
You tell me, how do you think that’s working out for us?
An additional argument to this is that Switzerland has higher gun ownership than the US and they have fewer incidents like this.  So, that can’t be because of strict gun control laws, right?
The reason gun ownership in Switzerland is so high is because they do not have a standing army as we would recognise it.  There, men get military training at about the age of 20 and are reserve military members till they turn 30 (34 for officers).  Part of this includes keeping their service weapon at home.  After this, they can keep the weapon as long as they return it for a brief period so it can be converted to semi-auto, instead of full automatic, use.
To purchase a gun outside of this, you need a permit, which allows the holder to own 3 guns.  Certain guns and add ons (such as silencers) are illegal.  All guns must be registered and have a serial number.  There are restrictions on the transportation of weapons and on the sale of ammunition (for example, ammunition purchased at a range can only be used there).
So, yeah, exactly like in the States.
The next argument is that these people are going to break the law regardless, so why bother?  The new poster boy for this particular argument is Anders Behring Breivik.  Norway, the argument goes, has strict gun control laws and it didn’t stop him.  The same will happen here so don’t bother.
Really?  That’s your argument?  Of course people bent on breaking the law will do so regardless of whether or not parts of the build up to that act are illegal.  That would be why we call them criminals and spend tax payers money to find, arrest, charge and prosecute these people.
Besides, going by that argument, that means that there is no need for laws against: murder, assault, rape, incest, paedophilia, child pornography, shoplifting, driving under the influence, the purchase, selling, distribution, possession and consuming of illegal narcotics and age restrictions on films, television programming, books, magazines, music, computer games, the purchase and operation of automotive vehicles, tobacco and other smoking related products and alcohol.
In fact, why bother with laws at all?  Save billions in taxes and do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law.
Pretty sure I heard that last bit somewhere.
Besides, ‘they have one so I want one’ is an argument that usually dies out in childhood.
Then we get to the strict constitutionalists.  The ones who argue that the Second Amendment protects the right to bear arms.  Let’s look at that:
A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.
Fair point.  Does the US have a well armed militia?  (For an example of a militia, look at Switzerland.  It’s what they call their army.)
People point out that the Founding Fathers, in their infinite wisdom, didn’t actually define arms.  Which is just as well for the people making this argument, as if they did, Americans would probably have the right to own a musket.
But apparently, you can’t outlaw any weapon as it’s against the Constitution.  In that case, I have a question: can Nessa monster buy and own a nuclear missile?
A nuke is an arm, in fact it is the ultimate armament at the moment. The US is recognised as a nuclear power and she is therefore not a new state gaining this capability, neither, obviously, is she a rogue nation.  (Unless there’s something you’re not telling me honey.)  She is a US citizen, born and raised in Minnesota and lived there all her life, except when she moved away for college, moving back afterwards.
The Constitution, I keep getting told, affords her the right to bear  arms and that there is no definition as to what that entails.  So, I ask again, why can my girlfriend not own a nuclear missile?
Or perhaps it is the case that there are some things that need to be strictly, severely controlled and regulated and perhaps guns, which by design and nature only exist to kill, should be one of them.

I’m going to write soon about Nessa monsters visit and review Frankenstein. 
But first I’ll share more from the wonderful world of work. 
So, I did get moved to payments.  I spent the Thursday and Friday buddying and then we moved to the new office in Middlesbrough. 
Where I spent the week doing nothing.  Well, apart from opening doors.
More on that story later.
The first thing that they did was sort out everyone’s system access.  
Everyone except me.  And one of the floor walkers.  The powers that be didn’t know we were moving this week and therefore we won’t get our access till next week.
He headed back to Stockton as he’s also the guy who assigns people work.  As I’m not trained on payments I had to stay put.  So I spent the week buddying, bored out of my skull. 
Course, it’s a good thing he went back over, as we didn’t have a printer in Middlesbrough.  Payments send a lot of letters, so its kind of important.  The letters were sent to a printer in Stockton to be printed out.  Until Thursday, when the printer ran out of ink. 
We do now have a printer in Middlesbrough, but no headed paper so still no printing.
Oh, the door!  The door into the main office at work has a magnetic lock.  You have to swipe every time you go through the door, even if someone holds it open for you.  Or you can’t get back out.
So I spent a lot of time opening the door either for people who got caught out or the trainees who didn’t have passes.
There’s more I can say, but I’m on my phone.  So I’ll leave it here.

Seeing as I’m probably not going to be on much the next couple of weeks, I may as well do this now.
So, who’s up first?  Why, it’s DoodleKid:
Which writers do you respect the most, and which do you have a very low tolerance of?
Honestly?  I respect writers like Neil Gaiman, Sir Terry Pratchett, Mark Billingham and Philip Pullman who can write for both adults and children.  (Whether or not I’ll be able to add JK Rowling to the list I’ll find out soon enough.)
Low tollerance of people who think that you have to end each chapter on a cliffhanger (Dan Brown, I’m looking at you here) as they obviously have a low estimate of their own writing abilities.
What’s one place you’ve always meant to go and probably could have gone to a bunch of times, but have never got around to it? 
I really, really can’t think of anywhere really.
Next, we have Rodge:
What do you think of the Sanal Edamaruku situation?
Never heard of the bloke, didn’t know there was a situation and my Google Fu is weak with this one.  Sorry.
With something a bit more personal is p.i.x.i.e
what are your intentions with my sister? where do you see things going with her?
I can assure you that my intentions towards your sister are entirely dishonourable :¬p
And finally, the sister in question, tattoosandstilettos:
what do you “listen to” most often, in order – your gut, your head, or your heart?
Head, heart, gut.
what are you currently most happy about? on the other side, most sad about?
Happy about?  Nessa Monster being here soon.  Sad about?  The mess that is work.
what’s been the most difficult “skill set” you’ve learned and/or acquired in your life, so far? interpret as necessary.
Honestly?  I don’t know, actually.
from what you’ve heard from your family, and your own early memories, what were you like as a young child; and how similar are you to that younger self today?
I was pretty much as I am now, a bit quite, a bit shy and a bit nerdy.
which do you find more satisfying, a good film or a good book?
A good book, by a country mile.
if you won a huge cash lottery, what would you do with the prize first?
New laptop, Android tablet, a house/flat.
if a genie granted you three wishes, what would you ask for?
1) Infinite wishes.  Don’t really matter what 2 and 3 are after that…
on a scale of 1 to 10, how happy are you?
About a 7.
why does toilet bowl cleaner only come in the color blue?
This must be an American thing.  Plenty of different colours over here.
what does cheese say when it has its picture taken?
Salami.
why is the nintendo game character’s name “donkey kong” when he is clearly not a donkey?
No-one actually knows…
if you were in hell, where would you tell people to go when you are mad at them?
Suburgatory.
why is there a light in the fridge, but not in the freezer?
Might heat it up?
three swedish switched witches watch three swiss swatch watches switches. which swedish switched witch watch which swiss swatch watch witch?
Huh?  Seriously, I couldn’t follow that.
And now, if you’ll indulge me, for something serious.  Next year is the 25th anniversary of the Piper Alpha disater (I re-posted an article about it a couple of years back).  Some people are trying to raise £1 million to help maintain the gardens.
Coming from Aberdeen, this is obviously something that has great meaning for me (you’d be hard pressed to find anyone from the Deen who was alive at the time for whom that’s not true).  If you would like to donate, the link is here

503,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/hello-1397-3930905/,2012-05-27,Hello,"
I will get round to answering your question.  In the meantime, you’re probably wondering how work is going.  Well…
The first two weeks were training.  We started off by getting to know each other and played two truths, one lie.  I was informed that the reason I was so fgood at it was because I was into creative writing and therefore good at description.
People who have read my writing, especially Leslie and Nessa Monster, feel free to copy my creative writing tutor and burst out laughing.
The rest of the time was mostly ‘this is what happens at level 1.  You’ll never need to do this, but you still need to know it.  This is what happens at level 2.  You’ll never have to do this, but you still need to know it.’
Then we had a day on what we were actually going to be doing.  Which, to be fair, was pretty straightforward.
Then on the last day we had a buffet (traditional) and stuffed our faces.  We also all went to the pub during our lunch break.
Then we actually started.  We were supposed to be on a four day week with every weekend and one day during the week off.  Which gave us a four day weekend every four weeks.
The first day was fine.  Mostly getting stuff finished off from training and system access.
Tuesday lunchtime we were called to the buzz area (yes, it’s actually called that).  Where we were told that we wouldn’t be using the system we were taught, we’d be using a different, simpler system.  As it was our day off on Wednesday, we would be buddying (watching others in action) the rest of the day and starting our training on the new system on the Thursday.
Except when Thursday came round, we got split into two, with half of us going to payments and the other half going on phones.  Guess where I was put?  Despite being told in my interview it wouldn’t happen.
So, for the erest of the day, I was buddying.  The only good thing about it was that I lucked into getting five breaks.  The only good thing about it.  And, it turned out, the buddying was going to be my training.
Friday morning I got moved to payments as one of the folk there wanted to move to the phones.  Friday lunchtime, I was moved back to phones.
Monday, we were all taken back to the buzz area.  Only to be told that those of us on payments who got moved to the phones had been moved because an email was misinterpreted.  Did I get moved back?  Don’t be silly.  That would be the obvious thing to do.  Instead, volunteers were looked for and then, because they were still three short and my name came out the hat, I was back on phones.
I took my first call on the Tuesday at 9am.  By 9:05, I was already wondering how far the window opened so I can jump out of it.  That job is every bit as miserable and soul destroying as I remember from the call centre.  By the end of the day, I was seriously coinsidering giving someone money to beat me up, just so I wouldn’t have to work.
On Wednesday, I went to my manager and said that I really, really, really, really, really, REALLY didn’t want to stay on phones.  The best she could do was if I made it to the end of the week without killing someone, I would get moved back to payments after my holiday.
And that’s where we are.  I’m on holiday, Nessa Monster arrives tomorrow and at least I don’t have to do something I truely detest anymore.

The book giveaway went well yesterday.  I got to the union about midday and all the books were gone by 5.
It was fueled by tea and biccies that another group were giving away free for St Georges Day.  Oddly enough, the question I was asked most (beside what the book was about) was if I had written it or not.
And I might be getting more books.  they emailed me back on Saturday evening (after I emailed them on Thursday, this is their idea of 24 hour response time) saying they logged the books as missing and that they’d send more yesterday.
Then I went to a World Book Night event, listened to music and poetry, got a load more books and was reminded that there are sdome questions that really shouldn’t be asked in a quiz if it’s on paper.
Waterstone’s were giving out goodie bags and one of the contents was a World Book Night quiz.  One of the Questions?  ‘How do you spell Niffenegger?’
Really.
It was a just for fun quiz though.
Finally got my contract for starting work today, along with a bunch of other paperwork.  No real surprises.  The only thing really is that it’s monthly pay rather than weekly.  I’ll survive.  I should still get JSA till I first get paid, as far as I know.
Tonight, I have to go pick up a kettle.  I’ve been after one for a while, ever since one of my friends let me know about some instant noodles that don’t need cooking.  You just boil water in the kettle, stick the noodles and the flavour sachet in ta bowl, add water and leave for 4 minutes.  Which makes it perfect for me to cook in my room.
Tomorrow I’m going to a screening of a programme about the Transporter Bridge called Bringing the Bridge to Life.  I think it’s going to be broadcast on the BBC at some point.  There’s the programme and then live music.  Should be good.
And that’s about all, really.

Today I had to go back to the central library to pick up my World Book Night books.  After my wasted trip on Tuesday, I was kinda hoping they’d be there.
First of all, I was told that I wasn’t supposed to pick them up.  Middlesbrough library is holding an event at MIMA.  Now a) this isn’t supposed to be part of the plan and b) although I will be at said event, I’m not giving my books away there.
So, they had a look.  No sign of my books.  I was given the number of the person who spoke to me at the library so I could phone them back once I’d spoken to someone at World Book Night.  Which I didn’t do, I left a message.
Then I got online on an actual computer and checked out the FAQ’s on the website.  It seems that, for reasons passing understanding, they may have delivered two boxes of Sleepyhead, one for me, one for someone else handing that book out, with the other persons name on it.  Which jibes with something the guy said on Tuesday.  I phoned the person and left a message letting them know what I’d found out.
Course, it’s entirely possible that the person has been by to pick up his box and got both of them.  Which’ll mean no books for me on Monday, likely.  GRRRRRRRRR!
Talking of books, here’s my book review diary
In better news, I got another call about the job today.  I do start on the 30th, it’s £14,000 a year, fixed contract till next March (but may be kept after that), 35 hours a week, business dress Monday – Thursday (boo!), casual dress on Friday and if working Saturday (yay!) and my holidays will be honoured.
The contract is being sent in the post and I won’t be signing off till Thursday at the very latest as that’ll mean I can sign up for my creative writing class (which also starts on the Thursday) for £7 instead of £47.
So, yeah, that was my day.
Will
*EDIT* just got the email saying my Northern Writers Award submission has been recieved and I should hear back begining of July what’s happening.  Fingers crossed.

So, it’s been a couple of weeks since I got the email from Firstsource saying they would be offering me a job.
I hadn’t heard back with any more details however.  All I knew was that I would be starting in June, due to needing holidays for Nessa monsters visit.
Now, it was actually starting to worry me a bit.  I know that this is a big multi-national company, not a local nightclub, but I still remember what happened in November.
I was planning to gib=ve them another week, then I’d get in touch.  But, as it happens, they phoned today.  I start on the 30th of April, which is sooner than I expected, but not entirely unwelcome.
They’re going to phone back in the next couple of days letting me know more and arranging to send me my contract.  Hopefully it won’t mess with my holidays, but I’ll ask when they phone back.  I’m assuming it won’t.
In other news, I was hoping to pick up my World Book Night books today, but they weren’t their.  Either they haven’t arrived yet (which means the email they sent me saying they were ready to lick up lied to me) or the library misfiled them and now can’t find them.  I have to go back Thursday when, hopefully, they’ll have turned up.
Then when they get here, I’ve to open the box.  Partly cos I need to put one book aside, mainly because, yet again, each book has an identifying code and I need to write each and every one into the books manually.  Quite why they’ve got the system like this, I don’t know.  It’s not as if the books are pulled off the shelves of Waterstones, they’re specially printed for World Book Night.  I just don’t understand why they can’t print the names and codes in the book then.
Ah well, at least it’s only 24 books this year, not 48.
Apart from that, not much happening really.  Need to tell you later about the fun and games with money, Cabin in the Woods is fucking amazing, but gory and I nearly won money on the National on Saturday.

510,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/grrrrrrr-73-3930867/,2012-04-10,GRRRRRRR!,"
I am going to a free screening of Cabin in the Woods tonight.  I was always planing to go see it anyway, but free is better!  Unfortunately, it is at the cinema out of town.  It’ll take me about half an hour/45 minutes to walk there.
So, of course, the weather gods decide that today is the idea day have rain in Middlesbrough for the first time in a while.
I’m still going, though.
Also, thought I had everything done for my New Writers North submission.  Then, I decided to check exactly what a synopsis should be like.  Turns out that I have it a little wrong.  As in, I’m going to have to start again when I get home after the film, virtually from scratch.  (And, yes, I know it’s my fault for not checking before.)
Still, only 47 days till Nessa monster gets here.  Incidentally, anyone know what the Forbidden Planet in London is like?  In the absence of any geeky events as my reward for going to the brain exhibit, we might be going there.
Finally, this is kinda long, but worth watching cos it’s also really sweet:

With yesterday being Good Friday, the uni library was shut, so I couldn’t get online.  Well, except my phone.
So, I decided to do my favourite thing in the world ever! /sarcasm and get some editing done.
I worked on All Along the Watchtower (AKA Northern promise entry/novel that people seem to hate without reading) for a bit and got it just about ready.  I also wrote my synopsis and my covering letter as well.  I’ll give the whole thing another look through, possibly Wednesday after the film, before printing out ajnd sending it on Thursday.
(Actually, I’m dreading how much it’s going to cost to send it.  Two copies of an 18 page manuscript, 2 covering letters, 2 copies of the synopsis and the equality form.  I n a large envelope, which automatically costs more.  *GULP*)
Also got some work done on Time and Tide (AKA Bloody Scotland entry/I fucking hate this title but am too shit at titles to think of another one), but this was mostly cutting stuff out in order to get it under the word count.  I have some time for that one, so I’ll return to it later.
I also finally got round to writing a story that I’ve had buzzing round in my head for a while now.  It needs work (possibly a lot), but as it’s not for anything special I’ll work on it another time.
I’m not going to be online here again tomorrow, with it being Easter Sunday, so I’ll either get more writing done then or I’ll just be lazy and watch films.
Got a phone call from someone at Working Links about a refresher day before my Poundland interview.  I didn’t answer (didn’t recognise the number so let it go to voicemail, as usual) but I’m, looking forward to phoning them back and telling them that I have a job and they can shove their Poundland interview, after all the hassle they gave me to get it, up their arses.
I may not use those exact words, however.
Apart from that, not much happening really.  So, I’ll stop boring you now.

Last night I went to bed much, much earlier than usual.  This was because I had to.
I was curled up on my bed watching Raw when all of a sudden the light went out and the screen on my laptop went dim.  I shut down my laptop and went to get the night manager.  He did try to get the power back, but no luck.  So, with no light and no power to my laptop (the battery is fucked and only holds about 10 minutes charge) I went to sleep.
When I left the house this morning, there was someone working up in the loft, so I suspect that’s where the problem lay.
Course, the problem is that without electricity, there’s no heat.  So my room was also fucking freezing.  Had it happened last week, when it was boiling hot, I would have been fine.  But, no, it had to happen when it was freezing.
Still, it did help me catch up with my sleep after WrestleMania.
I’ve got all the feedback for competiton entry that’s due in this month.  Just need to go through it making any and all changes necesary.
Firstsource.  Got my birth certificate, had some fun and games with the job centre, went in to hand everything in on Monday.  They emailed me back to ask if the address for Garlands head office was right.  Problem is, I had no fucking clue.  Rather than email back and say that, I said it was.  They emailed me yesterday saying they were offering me a job but, because I’d asked for the period that Vanessa is over as holidays and that interferes with the accreditaion period after my training, I’m not starting till June, but not yet sure exactly when.
And I know that some of you are stressed at the moment, so this’ll help you relax:

514,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/accessand-pasties-and-fuel-oh-my-3930855/,2012-03-31,"Accessand pasties and fuel, oh my!","
They say a week is a long time in politics, and we’ve had an… interesting week politically over here these past seven days.  Where do we start?  How about at the begining, with…
Cash for Access: this came about when Peter Cruddas, the then Tory party treasurer, was caught, on tape, offering access to David Cameron for a donation of £250,000.  I say then treasurer because he left the job just after this came out.
This, understandably, raised a lot of questions.  What was discussed at these dinner parties?  Were donators given the chance to influence policy?  Who were they?
All sorts of stories started flying round about what went on.  Conservative bloggers started mumbling about trade union support of Labour.  Then it was announced that it would be made public who had dinner with the PM.
Which led to more questions.  How do you define dinner?  Why only people who dined at 10 Downing Street and not those invited to Chequers?  The Tory party must have been praying for something to distract folk.  Who know that would end up being…
The pasty tax: now, this all comes from the budget, where it was announced that they would be enforcing (not implementing, cos it already was law) the VAT on hot food.  George Osbourne was speaking at a commons comittee about the budget where he was asked when the last time he’d eaten at Greggs that bakers last.  Cos there’s not, y’know, important stuff to ask about.  He admitted it had been a while.
It’s the other thing he said that’s important.  That was thet the VAT would only be on hot food.  If you buy something cold, it would be VAT free.  This lead to outrage at the thought of sausage rolls, and the aforementioned pasties, being cheaper for some people than others.  Then you’ve got places where you can buy something cold then heat it up.  Would that be a tax dodge?
David Cameron then chipped in by claiming the last time he’d had a pasty was at Leeds train station, not that long ago.  It then turned out that the place where he said he’d bought said foodstuff closed in 2007, leading a spokesman to admit it may not even have been in Leeds.
Labour, always keen to make complete arses of themselves capitalise on an oppertunity, had their leader Ed Milliband, shadow chancellor Ed Balls and another Labour MP make a stop at a Greggs while visiting somewhere and, just by pure coincidence, there happened to be a news crew.  Seriously, watch this.  It’s one of the most cringworthy things I’ve seen in a long while:
So, the Tories were out of one hole and into another.  What’s needed is a perfect demonstration how to manage a crisis.  And by manage, I mean mis-manage as we then get…
Panic at the pumps: which all started when Unite, the largest trade union in Britain, announced that tanker drivers would be striking over Easter, upset about pay and conditions.
Enter Francis Maude.  Now, the sensible thing to do would be to say that talks are ongoing, the planned strike is over a week away and that would be it.  Instead, Maude decided to say Don’t Panic.
This advice may be good on the cover of the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy in large, friendly lettering but when it comes from a Government minister, it tends to have to opposite effect.  Particularly when followed by a comment that it might be an idea to store fuel in jerry cans in your garage.
The Fire Brigade Union said that mass storing highly flammable liquid may not be the most sensible thing to do.  But, accoding to some Conservative bloggers, ignore their safety advice.  After all, they are a union.  Oh, and storing fuel in jerry cans is actually illegal.
Meanwhile, people start queueing for fuel leading to fights, shortages and rationing.  Then, drivers were told to keep topping up the fuel in their car.  There was even a meeting of COBRA held!
(Which sounds impressive, but COBRA actually stands for Cabinet Operations Meeting Room A.)
In the end, the drivers agreed not to strick over Easter, but there is now a very real petrol shortage.  All in all, a job well done!
And finally: a local councellor in Whitby has announced that his real mother is a 9 foot tall green alien  Apparently, the subject didn’t come up on the doorstep when running.  I wonder why?

515,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/meh-edit-5-3930852/,2012-03-27,Meh *EDIT*,"
Surprise interview went better than I expected, apparently.  Got an email from them saying they want me to fill in a form and return it by Monday.
That’s not all I’ve been asked to suppply.  I also need to prove that I am eligible to work in the UK.
Ah.
What they accept is either my passport or my long form birth certificate.  Neither of which I have.  I don’t own a passport and I don’t have my long form birth certificate.  My mum does have that, but it’s, obviously, in Aberdeen.
I’ve emailed my mum to ask if she can send it down to me.  Not sure if she’s read the email yet, so I’ll phone her tonight.
(Well, I say phone her.  My phone won’t let me make outgoing calls.  So, what I’ll do is reverse charge the call and she’ll phone me back.)
But still.  It went better than I thought.
Maybe that’s the key to getting through interviews.  Spring it on me.
Apart from that, not much is happening.  Got a funny feeling the job centre is telling me porkies in an attempt to get me to write down my job search (they want me to, I don’t want to, there’s nothing in my job seekers agreement that says I must).
The feedback I asked for is starting to trickle through.  (Which reminds me: must email to tutor.)  My story for the Bloody Scotland competition is done but it needs tweaking.  Or a complete page one rewrite.  Not sure which yet.  Haven’t actually looked at it since I finished it.  Which is normal for me.  I find it easier to edit a story once I’ve got some distance from it rather than just after it’s done.  And I’m concentrating on the thing I have to get ready for submission in a couple of weeks time.
The title of my Bloody Scotland entry needs to change.  It’s shit, but I can’t think of a better one at the moment.
Oh, WrestleMania this weekend!  A local pub is showing it live.  Damn right I’m going to be there.  I can’t wait cos, unlike last year, I’ll actually have money!  Woot!
Not long now before Nessa monster gates here!  It’s actually going to be a packed time with borotweetup, bungee jumping, giving blood, a curry (possibly) and going to Edinburgh and London.
Actually, do any of my London based readers know of anything geeky going on on June 7th/8th?  I’m being “dragged” to a brain exhibition and have been promised a geeky trip as well.
And with that, I need a smoke.  Have fun kiddies!

*EDIT*
Mum’s going to send me my long form birth certificate tomorrow.  Yay!

Now, my UK based readers will have heard of Fabrice Muamba.
For those of you outside Britain, Muamba is a 24 football player.  While playing for his club Bolton in a FA Cup quarter final against Spurs he collapsed on the pitch.  No-one was near him at the time.  Both team doctors and (I’m really not making this bit up) a Suprs season ticket holder who happens to be a cardiologist rushed onto the pitch to help him.  He was rushed to hospital and the game was abandoned.
Muamba was clinically dead for 78 minutes.  He’s now recovering but it’s still up in the air as to whether or not he will play fottbal again.
People were being urged to pray for him (this will become important later).
Meanwhile, a Christian group in Bath were stopped by the Advertising Standards Authority from handing out flyers saying that God can heal any illness and saying in general, that all you need to get over any disease is prayer.  The ASA banned the flyers on the, not unreasonable grounds, that it might lead people to believe that they don’t also need to seek medical help.
Three MP’s have written to the ASA the ASA reverse their decision or offer proof that prayer doesn’t heal disease or they will bring the subject up in Parliament.
Yeah.
Now, I’m not suggesting that prayer doesn’t help in the healing process.  In fact, there are studies that prove that remote prayer can actually make a difference in patient recovery times.
But here’s the thing.  That’s in addition to medical procedures, not in place of them.  I don’t blame the ASA for banning the advert as it is misleading and could actually result in death.
But, of course, there’s all the people who prayed for Muamba.  They can’t be wrong, surely?
(Yes, that genuinely is part of the argument from these three.  I would comment more on elected officals (or anyone else) using the near death of a young person for political or relgious reasons.  But I genuinely don’t think there’s enough capital letters or swear words in the world to do it justice.)
But I do want to talk about burden of proof.  It would seem to me that the burden of proof is on the three MP’s, or the Christian group, to back up their claims.
They won’t though.  Because their type never do.  I’m not saying all Christians are like this but it’ll generally go like this:
Christian: I know God exists.
Athiest: Prove it.
Christian: I don’t need to prove it, I have faith and that tells me that God exists.
Athiest: So, you won’t have any problem offering proof for your claim.
Christian: But I don’t need to.  I have faith and that should be enough.
Repeat ad nausium.
This is the way it goes.  If I want to dispute that God exists, or that prayer helps healing the burden of proof is on me.  However, if you try asking someone to prove something they believe in then they don’t have to prove it.  I should just accept their word that they have faith and that is all the proof they, or I, need.
In the meantime, the sky is green and the grass is sky blue pink with a tartan border.  I don’t need to provide you with evidence that this is the case, I have faith that it is so.  You have to prove me wrong.
Which you can’t.  I have faith.

517,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/so-1144-3930846/,2012-03-23,So…,"
..I’m pretty much guessing you’re wondering what happened with Working Links.
Well, they phoned back yesterday.  As they pretty much had to, really.  The person admitted that people had been phoned on Tuesday and Wednesday and that she should have phoned me on Thursday, for which she apologised.  She then told me I had an interview on the 19th.
Then I got my feedback.  Apparently I should definitely mention my experience with Virgin Cinemas Glasgow.  And, to be fair, when I went to a Virgin Cinema in Glasgow to watch Blade I got quite good service.
Pretty sure what she actually meant was my experience working at Virgin Cinames Aberdeen though…
I was also told not to mention the fact that I can’t work Monday nights because of my class.  If asked (cos it’s on my application form that I can’t) I shouldn’t lie, I just shouldn’t mention it.
If you can make any sense of that, let me know, cos I’m slightly confuzzeled.
So, more quality interview advice there.
I also had a surprise job interview on Thursday.  I was told about a recruitment day for a company called First Source so I went along.  I thought it would just be information, but they were interviewing people.  I had an hour wait but the interview went well.
Plus the interviewer was cute whgich helped my nerves and to make up for the wait.
And that’s all the job news from me for now.

"
519,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/letter-to-working-links-3930824/,2012-03-21,Letter to Working Links,"
Dear Sir/Madam,
On the 27th of February, I emailed you about issues I had with a course I was being sent on through yourselves in conjunction with Poundland.
It is with sadness that I must email you again concerning the course.
I have since completed the course.  In fact, my last day was last Friday.  On that day we were assured that, whether or not we were to be offered an interview, we would receive a phone call on Tuesday.
Well, Tuesday came and went with me not having received a call.  However, other people from the course that I am still in touch with commented on Facebook that they had received phone calls and had been offered interviews.  Fair enough, I thought, they might phone me tomorrow with the bad news that I wasnt being offered one.
On Tuesday night, I got a phone call from a friend asking if I wanted to go see a film, so I knew there was no problem with my phone, outside not having any credit.
Wednesday came along and still no call.  I had noticed, again through Facebook, that someone else had got the number you were calling people from and phoned up.  I also got the number.
Meanwhile, my friend phoned me to let me know shed be late for meeting me.  Again, obviously nothing wrong with my phone except the no credit.
So I borrowed my friends phone and called the number I had been given.  The person I spoke to told me that they couldnt tell me what was happening as they didnt have the schedule on front of them, but that final decisions would be made today.
First of all, why would having the schedule on front of them make a difference towards not being able to let me know, if the decision had yet to be made?  More importantly, I have one person telling me that no decisions have been made and therefore everyone would be getting calls the next day and five people saying that they had already been told with four of them having been called?
I dont want to say that the person was telling me a lie, so Ill simply state that it was an attempt to obfuscate the truth.
Fair enough, though.  I waited for the call today.  And waited.  And waited.  According to the clock on my computer it is currently 5:53pm.  Ive pretty much given up on getting the call today.  As I was promised I would.
I have to assume that I havent been given one of the interview slots.  But, really?  I can accept not getting a call back when I have been warned that only successful candidates would be contacted.  Except I was assured that, interview or not, I would get a call.  Something about feedback.  I can accept being messed about like this when, as happened to me at the end of last year, its a local nightclub.  But, you are a national, supposedly respectable company.  So you dont get a free pass.
In case youre wondering, no calls today, but I did receive a text message so my phone is still working.  If you would like to finally make the call to me that I was supposed to receive on Tuesday, feel free.  I never switch my phone off, except when I went to see the film.  If, for some reason you dont have my number, apart from when Triage sent it to you before the course started and the multitude of 
paperwork I had to fill out for the course, its 07904803158.
I said I emailed you before the course.  That was because of Triage.  This one, however, is all on you.
Yours faithfully,
William Forbes


 






 
"
520,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/so-then-18-3930821/,2012-03-14,So then…,"
You’re probably wondering how the course is going?
Well, it’s going.
I’m not really learning anything I didn’t already know.  Hence the reason I’m not sweating the exam I’ve got in just over an hour.  About 99% of it I know from my previous experience and the rest is common sense I know from my previous experience.
I have, however, met some really cool people.  The table I’m on is the picnic table cos we bring in food and share it.  Monday was a cake as it was someones birthday on Sunday.  Tuesday was flapjacks, home made.  Yesterday, however, we finally outdid ourselves.  We had:
A bag of Chicken and Thyme flavoured crisps,
3 mini bags of Minstrels,
8 packs of Chewits and
2 bags of Amercan sweets!
And we basically nommed our way through the lot.
The American sweets were donated by me.  Finally got my latest package from  the States after Customs decided they wanted to keep it safe for a while.  In addition to them, I also got a bunch more sweets (including 2 bags of my beloved Hershey’s Kisses), a Forbes tartan bow tie (taking my bow tie count to three) and three really, really cool Doctor Who t-shirts.  I’ll take photos of the clothing and post them here at some point.
My Nessa monster is amazing, loves spoiling me and I don’t discourage that!
:¬p
Beyond that, not much has been happening.  Finally came up with an idea for the Bloody Scotland crime writing competition I talked about before.  I’ve told one person about it and they think it’s brilliant.  I’m not mentioning it here though…
But I will be asking here for people to read it and give me feedback before submiting it.  Once it’s written, which will be after I’ve written the 3,000 words of my novel that I need to submit for something else, as that’s due in first and this bloody course has thrown my writing schedule for a loop.  Thankfully, I’ll be finished the morn and will be able to get back on track.  (Sorry in advance, honey, that does mean I’ll be a bit distracted when speaking to you.)
I’ll be asking for feedback on that as well, just advance warning.
The awesome boots of awesomness are no more.  The soles in the ball of each boot had basically worn through and the heel on one had basically worn away completely and was no longer connected to the rest of the boot.  This is annoying bacause a) it’s not often I get like this about boots, but they really were awesome and b) I’d only had them about three months.
The problem is, I walk a lot and modern shoes, strange as it may sound, aren’t designed for that amount of walking.  I really need ex-Army boots or Doc Martins, but I can’t afford them :¬(
I have to get going for this exam so I’ll leave you with some pictures:

My Doctor Who baddie collection.  Bob the Cyberman, Thorne the Dalek, a Judoon and an Ood (currently unnamed.)

And, just round the corner:

Hope you have/had a good day.

"
521,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/theme-of-the-week-395-3930817/,2012-03-13,Theme of the week,"
Now, you may or may not have noticed that there is a new theme of the week, that being suggestions for how to improve OD.  The DM also wrote an entry in his diary encouraging people to submit entries.
Now, some people got mightly offended by this and said that the DM should just check back through his notes and find out what people suggested.  Let’s just think about this for a second.  Quick question for you all: how many of you can be bothered to go back and check notes that you were left last week?  Last month?  Last year?
Now consider the fact that the DM gets way, way more notes per entry than any other diarist.  Are people starting to realise the problem here?  Can anyone not see that, rather than doing that, he may actually want the suggestions in one place, not dotted randomly amongst other things that have been said to him?
I do have some suggestions for this site.  In a rather unconventional way.  I’m going to write about them here then post this entry in Theme of the Week.  Hey, it’s almost like that was what we were asked to do!
So, without further ado, my suggestions:
1) Blocking for all  This is a very popular suggestion and for good reason.  It’s ridiculous that, just because I can’t afford a OD+ subscription I can’t block anyone that is harassing me without having to send an email.
2) More admin  The admin staff here do a fantastic job.  Absolutely fantastic.  But, it’s becoming more and more obvious that three are not enough.  I’m not suggesting myself, I have absolutely zero coding skills, but I’m sure that there would be volunteers.  The number of admin staff, IMHO, needs to be at least doubled.
3) Increased note length I don;t think they should be scrapped altogether cos I don’t want to try and read novel sized notes on my entries, but they do need, subscriber or not, to be at least doubled.
4) Update mobile site  It’s an absolute nightmare to use at the moment and I never noticed that more than when my phone was my only internet connection for a while.  While an Android app would be cool, just cleaning up the mobile site would be a huge help.
5) Preview button  This one is last and that’s because it’s something I’ve been calling for for years now.  There is absolutely, positively, no excuse for not having a preview button when writing an entry.  The suggestion to post as a private entry, check it then post it as public causes problems with posting to circles and is incompatable with the anti-spam measures.  Clicking preview, then clicking post to post or edit to make changes is not more problematic than the private entry suggestion.
So, those are my humble suggestions.
Will

The course is going.  Not really learning much I didn’t already know, but that was expected, to be honest
Triage are in shit, though.  I may have caused it and, before you ask, no, I don’t actually care about that. It turns out that Triage have been flat out fibbing to people to get on the course.  Various people have been told:
that the job interviews are guaranteed (this includes me),
that the job interview is for one of two Poundland stores (it’s just for Coulby Newham),
that the job interview is for the new Poundland in Billingham (it’s not)
and some people weren’t even told what company it’s actually for.
So, Working Links took a note of all the problems (or lies as others might call them) that Triage have been giving and filed a complaint.
In further course news, I had my mock interview yesterday.  It went well, the only problem was with some of the feedback.
Y’see the first question I was asked was what I had been doing the past two years.  So i told the truth.  I’ve been unemployed but I keep myself busy looking for work and writing.  They then told me I should mention my experience at the cinema and Buger King.
Except none of that is from the last two years.  So it’ll look like, to me, that I don’t want to answer the question.  That advice is easy to ignore.
Talking of my writing, the short story I subnmitted to the BBC Opening Lines comeptition has been rejected.  Which is a bit of a bummer, but I’ll keep plodding on.
One competition I’m definitely entering is the Bloody Scotland crime short story competition.  It’s part of a new crime writing festival starting in Scotland called, strangely enough, Bloody Scotland.
The prizes are a week long writing retreat, being the main story in an ebook anthology of entries (ten runners up will also be published), a weekend pass for the festival and a besopke crystal decanter filled with 35 year old single malt whisky.
Guess which prize I want the most?
Beyond that, not much is happening.  Plugging away as usual, really.
How are you lot?

So, remember the thing I mentioned a couple of entries back with the guaranteed job interview?  Well…
I got the letter with all the information I needed.  However, it mentioned the fact that this course will give me a greater chance when applying for a job in Poundland.
Now, I may not be the smartest guy on the planet, but greater chance of getting an interview doesn’t quite sound like guaranteed interview to me.
So, I decided to email Working Links, who are running the course, to seek clarification.  The main reason I agreed to go on the course in the first place was because of the guaranteed interview.  It’s hard enough to get a job interview so it seemed like a no brainer.
They phoned me and I asked them right out.  No, attending the course does not guarantee a job interview.  Well it does…
IF I complete the course.
AND I do well on the course (part of this is how I get on with other people, which is a problem for someone who is incredibly shy around other people),
AND I pass a pre-interview,
AND/OR enough people drop off the course that I basically get the interview by default.
Hmmmm.  Now, either this is some new definition of the word guaranteed that I’m not yet familiar with, or the interview isn’t guaranteed.
It turns out that my advisor told me that the interview was guaranteed because he’s convinced that so many people will drop off the course that it practically is.
The thing is, neither Working Links nor my advisor can understand why I’m upset.  Both of them think that I’m getting this amazing opertunity and I should be greatful.  Maybe some of you think that as well.
Except, it turns out that the oppertunity isn’t as amazing as I was first led to believe.
The person from Working Links that I spoke to asked me if I’d feel the same had I applied for the course through an ad on the job centre website and it said possible interview.
Now I understand that she thinks she’s comparing apples to apples, but she’s not even comparing apples to oranges.  She’s comparing apples to the middle eight section of the Doctor Who theme.
Had I seen this on the job centre website, I would have been fully aware that it woulod possibly finish with a job interview.  I was lead to believe that this definitely would, whether 5 people finished the course or 55.
I would have still signed up, but had I not got an interview at the end I wouldn’t have felt like my time was wasted because, well, I knew the risk.  Now, however, unless I do get an interview, well, I’ve done the course and got some sort of qualification (and, admittedly, I doubt I’m actually going to learn anything on this course), but it’s still two weeks out of my life I could have spent looking for work (my interweb access is going to be severely limited) during those two weeks) or writing, trying to get into the career I actually want.
Most annoyingly, because I had the sheer gall to ask questions to find out what the truth is, rather than just bending over and taking it, Working Links are convinced that I have a bad attitude,  Which won’t help things.

As you know, I had to pick up my laptop by Friday.
Except, I didn’t have the money.
A friend very kindly agreed to lend it to me.  Difficulty: they are in the States.  The only way to get the money to me in time was Western Union.
Further difficulty: I need photo ID to collect money from them.  Which I don’t have.  Checking the website, I figured out that I should be fine using something with my name on it and something with my address.
So, about 9am on friday I set out, thinking I would be back home by about 11.
Oh, how fucking wrong I was…
First place I went to absolutely refused to help me unless I could provide a council tax bill.  As I’m on benefits and, therefore, my council tax is zero, I don’t actually get one of these.
The second place would allow me to send money through Western Union but not recieve.
The third place couldn’t help me.  The person who deals with that was off and no-one else could access the computer.
The next place, absolutely not without photo id.  They did rather helpfully suggest that I go somewhere else.  The place they suggested does Moneygram but not Western Union.  Which these people know.
Place number five ignored me for about 15 minutes.  So I gave up and went a couple of doors down the road.  To somewhere else that only did sending money.
The next place?  Absolutely not without photo id.
By this time it was about half past eleven and I felt like punching walls.  So I went for a quick pint.
Then I decided to try at Ramsdens.  The staff there were brilliant.  However, they told me I needed a utility bill.
Great.  All my billing is done online.
Nipped home, dropped off the letters I had with me to use as ID and headed into town.
Went to the T-Mobile shop.  Omnly to discover that they don’;t print out statements in the shop as it has to be requested from the website, for which they charge.
Ahhh, but the website will also allow you to download your bill as a PDF.  So, to the library I go!  I have interweb access but not printing access.  Save the bill to my memory stick, plug that into my printer, Bob’s yer uncle.
Except my printer doesn’t accept memory sticks, just memory card.  And, once I’ve doewnloaded it to the memory card on my phone, I find out that my printer, using this method will only let me print out pictures.
Back into town go I and find a place that does printing.  Get the bill printed out.  Back to Ramsdens, where I discover they need something else on top of the bill.
One of the things they’ll accept is a statement from a financial institution.  One of the letters I was using before was about repaying the budgeting loan.  That’s financial in nature.
Back home I go, to get the thing I need to, basically, turn the DWP into a bank.
Eventually, it goes through and I get the money.  Straight to the shop to get my laptop back.  Straight to the pub for a well earned pint.

Laptop is fixed.  Still not in my grubby little mitts, though, as I don’t have the money to pay for the repair.  I’m hoping my mum will help me out with that, cos the guy needs the money by the end of the week.  Hate to think what’ll happen otherwise.  Thankfully, it’s only costing £60 and not the £90 – 115 others were quoting.
What else?  Supposed to be going to see The Muppets next week with a friend, but won’t be able to 🙁  Triage are sending me on this two week training thingy which is supposed to end with a guaranteed job interview for Poundland.  Sadly, there’s an awareness session next week which, if I don’t attend, I’ll lose my benifits.
Anyone who’s been keeping up with the Workfare debacle will know how much I trust the promise of a guaranteed job interview.
We can’t go and see the film in the evening, cos we’re going to the footie.  In fact, I’m going to two games in the next week.  On Saturday, Teesside Hospice is having a bucket collection outside the ground.  I helped out with the last one and will be doing so again.  In exchange, I get a free ticket.
Then next week, I’m going to the Riverside with some of the other borotweetup lot for the England Under 21’s game.  One of the tweetup organisers works for the council and was able to get tickets for £5.  Plus, she’s paying for mine.
It’ll be the first time I’ve ever been to a match and supported precisely neither team.  Should be fun.
Think that’s abput it.  Original plan for this entry was to do a survey, but there’s not actually any good ones about.
So a couple of pics:

527,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/response-to-linda-kay-3930777/,2012-02-20,Response to Linda Kay,"
I’m writing this here because I don’t want to notebomb you.
I read the note you left on my diary and the recent entry you made.  In said entry, you took pains to point out that you’re not a troublemaker.
And you’re absolutely right.  you’re not a trouble maker.  You’re a panicmonger.  And that is far, far more dangerous.
Because, you see, you’re guilty of exactly what I talked about in my last entry.  You take one or two pieces of information and put your own interpretation on it.
Which is understandable.  Everyone does that.
But when you present your interpretation to other people, you don’t say that this is how you see things, you state that your interpretation is the facts.  And that they are undisputed.
If someone does try to dispute what you’ve said, they are either nieve for not believing the truth (as you see it) or an apologist.
For example, you keep repeating the claim that the DM has stated that the site is not economically viable.  However, reading his entry, what I saw was an admission that, while the site is making enough money to pay for itself, it’s not making enough for it to be his full time job.
Now, it may just be me, but if the site is covering it’s costs, that makes it economically viable.  I’m not saying that’s the truth, just how I see it.
You then state that his attention is elsewhere.  This is kinda true.  It is true that his current job means he isn’t around as much as he would like.  The last part of that is interesting, isn’t it?
As much as he would like.
That, to me, doesn’t suggest that his attention has wondered, merely that there are time constraints.  Again, just my opinion.
you keep mentioning the fantastic job the admin staff do.  and they do a brilliant job.  But you then moan about the way the site is running (not smoothly, says you, which isn’t my experience at all, one outage last month notwithstanding) which isn’t just moaning about the DM but the admin staff as well.
Direct quote from your entry:
However, the “if” in “If Open Diary fails” is becoming more like a “when.”
Direct quote from your note:
Again, I hope you are right and I have to eat my words, but I don’t think you are.
Sadly, your actions betray you again.  I get the feeling (and, again, just my interpretation) that you want the site to fail so you can run round saying “I told you so”.
If you kept your theories (sorry, “the truth”) to an entry on your diary I wouldn;t have a problem.  Your diary, your rules.
But you’re not.  You’re going from diary to diary espousing your theory and presenting it as fact.
And this is where you become a panicmonger rather than a troublemaker.  And it’s this that makes you dangerous.
Because, you’re basing your theory (soory again, “the truth”) directly on the DM’s words.  As am I with my interpretation.  But how long does it take from you saying “this is based on what I read on the DM’s diary” to “this is what the DM actually said”?
I know for a fact, it won’t take long.  And the reason I know this is cos it didn’t take long to go from “the DM changed his LinkedIn reference to OD” to “the DM has given up on OD and no-one is running the store”.
And what’ll kill OD quicker than anything is people leaving in droves because they’ve been told that the site is no longer financially viable, the lights are about to be turned off and the guy in charge is distracted and doesn’t know this is happening”.
As I said, in your diary, you can say what you want.  But when leaving multiple notes all saying the same thing and stating that’s exactly what was said, I consider it to be irresponsible.
Two questions for you:
1) You say that the DM refuses to take the steps needed to make the site more profitable (The business model sucks, and the DM does not have the interest needed to change it.).  Go for it.  What are the steps needed to make the site more money?
2) You keep complaining about the customer service.  If I go somewhere and get what I percieve to be bad customer service, I don’t go back there.  So, if the customer service is so bad, why you still here?
Couple of other things.
To the person who left the anonymous note in my last entry: Huh?  I have no idea what you’re on about.  i would love to see someone argue in a court of law that a lifetime subscription to a website meant anything other than the lifetime of the site.
And finally, could people plase, please stop RCing entries about the OD Lifeboat?  It’s getting to be more than a little spammy.

We are gathered here today to commemorate the fact that some people on this site have lost their fucking minds.
Now, you probably know that every so often, there be drama.
I remember the last lot, censorgate, in which some idiots, not happy that the note filters had been tightened up, actually openly admitted to breaking the rules.
The latest drama, which is still unfolding, is because some things have been slipping.  There’s been a problem with subscription payments and some help desk tickets have been open a while.
So, one of the admin team updated the OD News diary.  Simply put, everything is fine, it’s just that people are busy with meatspace stuff.
Panic over, one might think.
Except you’d be wrong.
Cos , you see, the DiaryMaster is no longer involved in the website.  Has he stated that?  Has there been some post somewhere comfirming this?
No, silly, the people who discovered it did so in the DiaryMasters Linkedin page.  Says right there.
What, did these people get hard confirmation from TVTropes?
Oh, no, wait, sorry, they got confirmation from the guys personal twitter account.  Not the offical OD one, but his personal one, where he no longer links to OD and spends his time talking about stuff other than OD.
So you take the info from Linkedin, add the “evidence” from Twitter and cue Pte Frazer:
Now, I know that only some of the scaremongers are reporting first hand.  The rest are basing their evidence on these first people.  NotKiernan has an excellent entry on the subject.
I’m going to look at the evidence.  Analyse it.  Cos, FSM forbid, I do anything rational like that.
First of all, Linkedin.  This is a social networking site for jobs, basically.  Is it not at all possible that DiaryMaster has, y’know, fibbed a little bit for reasons that we don’t know?  After all, if he had, he’d be the very first person ever to not be honest on a social netwroking site! /sarcasm
Then the Twitter account.  First of all, the tweets themselves.  How very dare he, use his personal Twitter account to talk about whatever he wants!  Doesn’t he know that it should be all OD all the time?
Then the website change.  Strangely enough, I never imagined that OD was the only site that the DiaryMaster has ever worked on.  (In fact, I remember years ago, on his personal diary, pimping another site he was involved in).  Given what he has built here, I can see people wanting his input about things.
Now, it may just be me, but it’s entirely possible that the new link from his Twitter account is a new website he’s involved in that he’s decided might need the traffic more than a site that has been established for years?
Don’t be silly will.  That kinda thinking involves Earth logic.
(And I’m not going into the sort of stalker crazy it takes to look up his personal accounts on Linkedin and Twitter.)
Let’s see who I’ll believe.  The site admin, involved in the running of the site, or information taken from social networking?
People who work behind the scenes, or the gleanings from 140 characters?
Not hard to work that one out.
If I can’t get into OD for a week, then I’ll panic.
Until then, could people please CALM THE FUCK DOWN!

P.S. It takes a special kind of insane to compare owning a diary on a website to systematically being beaten up by your other half

£93.
That’s how much it’s going to cost from that place I went to to replace my laptop screen.
There’s no way, no way I can afford that.  I’m planning to go round more places tomorrow and get more quotes.
In addition, the charger for my phone broke yesterday.  When the battery was dieing.  At about 8:40pm.  Buggeration.  Where the fuck am I supposed to get a new charger at that time, with only £3?
Amazingly, I found somewhere that was open.  furthermore, the guy was willing to let me off with the £3 i was missing till Thursday.  Cos, y’see, I kinda like having a working mobile phone.
Admittedly, the touchscreen doesn’t play well with it, but that’s a small price to pay.  It’ll do till I finally get my computer cable for it.

The screen is broken.  Not sure what the fuck happened.  All I know is that I switched it on on Friday and it’s cracked.
Until I can afford to replace it, I can’t write, can’t watch anything…
Which is fucking annoying.  Good thing I’ve got a pile of books to get through, really.
And that none of of them are stored on my computer waiting to get transferred to my ebook reader.
Remind me again about the advantages of such a device?
I did go to see someone about fixing it on Friday.  I’m just waiting for them to phone back with a quote.  It is going to cost about £40 though.

Supposed to have an appointment today at 2.  Turn up on time, sign in and was told to do jobsearch while I was waiting.
Hour and a half later, I went back to reception to remind them I was supposed to have an appointment at 2.
While I was doing the jobsearch, someone came over to me.  I somehow doubt he could have been any more patronising.  Telling me how to use the job centre website, urging me to apply for jobs that were part time, in the off chance I would actually get full time hours.  Urging me to apply for jobs that I don’t have the experience for.
Seriously, there was one job.  First words in the job description were that photoshop experience was necessary.  He told me to apply for it anyway, based on the fact I could learn photoshop later…
And I’m supposed to trust these guys to look for work for me.  Useless cunts.

I’m in a creative writing class.
I have a creative writing tutor.
She might be willing to edit my ebook for free.
So, I’m going to ask her on Monday
Also, someone from borotweetup has a Kindle and her father in law has a nook.  She’s going to check the book on both devices to make sure it looks OK.
Though I will be asking people here to do the same.  Be nice to get more than one opinion.

I got a new toy for my phone!  Well, a new app anyway.
The built in keyboard for my phone was annoying me, so I got one of the ones where you run your finger across and it does the work for you.  It even does the punctuation as well!  Typing is a hell of a lot faster and it traces a line as I type, so it looks like I’m drawing on the keypad!
(Truth is, my screen needs recalibrating, but I don’t know how to do that yet.)
I’m also getting £350 soon.  I applied for a budgeting loan for the SFX  Weekender, which is this weekend but I can’t afford to go to ( I couldn’t find anyone to go me and knew from last year I’d be on the hook for four peoples accommodation).
So, that’s a Scrivener licence, a portable external hard drive, some clothes, ink for my printer and possibly a bookcase.
Not sure about the rest.  Suppose I should buy a Valentine present as well…
There are some folk being noisy buggers in the park outside my window and is it’s like 3am.
Going to see how you calibrate this screen.  Toodles.

Not much has been happening in my life, really.
Still job hunting.  Still getting pissed off by Triage (who now seem to be under the impression that I dress the way I dress normally for interviews).  Still doing creative writing on a monday night.  Still loving/hating my new phone.
The book is on hold till the cover art is done.
Boring entry is boring.  Sorry.

I’ve decided to go ahead with the book thing.  I’ve installed the Kindle app on my phone, as well as one that lets me read .pub files.
Thankfully Scrivener does the formatting for me so that’s less of a worry.
(I really hope I can scrape together the $40 I need for the full Scrivener license, cos I’ve only got 21 days left on the trial and I don’t wanna go back to using Word for my stories.)
I’m even getting cover art done.  The person in question is extremely talented and has agreed to do it for nowt.
Sadly, I can’t compile from Scrivener quite yet, because I need to install another program first.  This program is currently sitting on my phone memory card.  I don’t have an adaptor to plug it into, have yet to get a cable to connect my phone to the laptop and, because my phone won’t recognise the file type, I can’t bluetooth it.
It also turns out that the official gmail android app will only let me email pics as attachments.  I thought this was because my phone is old but it turns out it’s supposed to be like that.
Also, may have to ditch the pdf idea.  Even with 12 stories, it’ll be about 35 pages long.  Not sure how comfortable I feel about charging even £1 for that.
From what I’ve seen, page count matters less with Kindles and .epub files.
Someone in my last entry made a good point about needing a good editor/proofreader.  Unfortunately, it looks like that’ll be me.  I got lucky with the cover, but not sure I’ll be able to find someone to edit/proofread for just a copy of the finished book.
Incidentally, any of you with a Kindle or a Nook/other device that reads .pub files, I’ll need someone to let me know how it looks on a full grown device, not just my phone.  Again, payment will be a copy of the finished book.
Remind me again, why was I mad enough to try this?

If I were to put a bunch of my short stories together and sell them as an ebook (I’m thinking Kindle, pdf a.d epub)* for about £1-2:
How many stories should I include? 
How many pages should the book be?
Should I make all the stories similar or a mix?
Would you buy it?
I am serious about this.  What do you think?

I know it’s a bit late, but that’s New Year for you.  Let’s get to it.
pierced_poet kicks us off:
Strangest thing that happened to you in 2011.
Bumping into Steven Moffat, who wasn’t even supposed to be there, in the bar at the SFX Weekender.  I refused to speak, in case I made a complete arse of myself.
 Something that happened in 2011 that you don’t want to happen again in 2012.
The non-job bullshit.  Really, really pissed me off that did.
Steven the Rill was next:
What were your best, your worst and your most surprising moments of 2011? 
Worst and most surprising mentioned above.  Best was finding out my sister was pregnant.
We have a newcomer, tattoosandstilettos up next:
what was the craziest thing you’ve done in 2011?
Not really sure.  Probably agreeing to meet up with one stranger for the SFX Weekender and agreeing to stay with another couple of strangers (which, let’s face it Jamie and Leslie, you were) when I went to London for the TTZ writer meetup.
what lesson did you learn in 2011 that you want to carry with you into 2012?
Not really sure.  Well, except that my creative writing tutor really doesn’t like it when I’m urged to write more description…
:¬p
were there any themes of life that defined any part of 2011 for you? 
To be honest?  Randomness.
Next, we have *Moonglow*:
What’s it like being an uncle?
It’s not that much different, really.  Tinged with sadness, though.
What’s been the highlight of the year (can’t say becoming an uncle-that’s obvious :-p) 
Meeting so many cool new people (including the one’s mentioned above).
most disappointing experience? 
See above with the job.
Ken Fitlike has quite an interesting enquiry:
If the ‘dice rolls your way’ how would you like your situation to be in 12 months time? 
Published, working (whether in writing or not) and having met the perfect woman and being by her side.  Admittedly, I’m half way to that one already…
Finally, we have Rodge:
If you were on ‘The Cube’, what games would you excel/fail at?	
Not sure about excel.  Fail would be spacial awareness and memory.  But I’m not mad enough to want to be on that show anyway.
And seeing as you asked (although none of you actually did):
Films of the year:
Tree Of Life
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Pt 2
Source Code.
Worst film of the year:
Sucker Punch
TV series of the year:
Game of Thrones
Doctor Who
Revenge
Castle
Derren Brown: The Experiments

Not the one written on Christmas Day, obviously.  That’d be my last entry.  This is the one about Christmas Day.
I got up about half ten, tried to get back to sleep and found out that the din from my mums hoover wouldn’t let me.  Dressed, went downstairs and opened the one present that was waiting for me under the tree, the one from my folks.
The contents were: a t shirt, a pair of gloves (which I’ll probably never wear due to me having special gloves), a hat, a scarf (haven’t owned a scarf in years) and £50.
Had something to eat, watched telly and kept reading Game of Thrones. Then the dog came though with the cracker she got as a Christmas present (yes, the dog gets Christmas presents, as well as something from Santa) and, after a lot of hassle, I got this picture:

Then my mum decided to put tinsel round her collar:

(Ever present hanging out tongue pictured)
Then my sister and brother in law came round.  Normally, I’d get excited because it means more presents.  This year, it was because of Jamie:

I may be biased, but he’s absolutely adorable.
He was asleep when he first arrived, which meant it was easy to swap presents.  My sister and brother in law got me a book called Help, I’m A Facebookaholic and a £15 gift card for WH Smiths (which’ll probably get spent on books).  I also got a card addressed to ‘Uncle William’!
(He’s two weeks old, he’ll learn that I prefer Will.)
Jamie slept, right up till we were eating our Christmas dinner.  Then he decided that he wanted some attention.  Which he got.

My sister and Jamie.

Dad and Jamie.

Brother in law and Jamie.

Buddha face!  (Being winded after feeding.)

Yes, they trusted me to hold him.  Yes, he survived in one piece.

Mum and Jamie (with dog cameo).
Sister, brother in law and Jamie left, I washed the dishes, watched Doctor Who then decided to head into town and for a few drinks at the bars that were actually open.
On the way in I saw Christmas fireworks!


Had a few pints, went home, came online, chatted to someone who makes me all smiley, then went to sleep.
How was your Christmas Day?
Will
P.S. Don’t forget, still looking for questions about my 2011.

First of all, here’s the boots of awesome:

Worship them.  WORSHIP THEM!

Sunday I went out for the borotweetup Christmas meal.  I decided that as we were going to a posh restaurant, I would get dressed up smart.  I wore a suit, a shirt and my wine bow tie.  Then one person turned up in a jumper and jeans and another in t shirt and jeans, so I didn’t have to dress up after all.
One of the organisers took along a Christmas Tree headband (she has a habit of taking along strange headwear), and…

The meal was gorgeous (though I was less than adventurous with my choice, opting for barbecue ribs and a parmo), then we went to a pub.  A couple of the people got a cocktail pitcher and wondered why they weren’t getting much ice when they poured it.  Then they found out why…

Monday I went round to my friends house for drinks with her and her fiancé.  Ended up staying up all night drinking.  T’was great.
Then the train on Wednesday.  Which was boring as I didn’t have a laptop and the headphones for my phone (also my MP3 player) had broken.  I did try and buy more when I was in Edinburgh as I had a two hour stopover.  But I couldn’t find them :¬(
I did, however, buy a new set yesterday.  Along with a new charger for my laptop :¬D :¬D :¬D
The rest of it has been pretty boring.
The thing I mentioned in my last entry?  Seriously, if anyone from the UK wants one of the tickets (remember, it’s just for the event itself), let me know and I’ll let you know more.
Also, as it’s coming up for New Year, it’s also time for my annual question time entry.  So, ask me anything about my life in 2011.
Anything.
Finally, this is for you.  Yes, you.  You know who you are.

So, someone on facebook posted a link to an article about the big 6 publishers in the States getting togeter to set the prices of ebooks.
Now, long time readers of this diary will know exactly how I feel about ebooks and ebook readers.
Anyway, the article mentioned three “big advantages” that ebooks have over proper books.  None of which is actually an advantage, as it’s all stuff you have with proper books.
I pointed this out to my friend, only to have him say that the one advantage that his Kindle has over a proper book is portability.
I have a serious issue with this argument.  Generally when I leave the house, I have a book with me.  If I don’t, then I wouldn’t have an ebook reader either.
So, here’s my question:
What portability advantages, exactly, does an ebook reader have over a traditional book?
This is a serious question.  I’m looking for someone to persuade me I’m wrong.  What makes a copy of 1984 on an ebook reader more portable than the copy I have?
Will
*NOTE: I am talking purely about portability, not, repeat, NOT about storage.  After all, whether you’ve got one book or 101 on your ebook reader, you and I are reading the same amount at the same time.  One.

Oh, wait, hang on…
The browser I use to check my bank account online and write OD entries has been discontinued.  I can’t do either of these things on Opera Mini.  So I have to use my phones built in browser.  Which is shit.

557,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/a-midsummerfest-carol-3930677/,2011-12-06,A Midsummerfest Carol,"
On some planets, in some cultures, it’s traditional to celebrate on or near the shortest day of the year.  Typical.  Celebrating when light is in the shortest supply.
Here, however, we’ve got it right.  Celebrate when the day is longest, when there’s maximum light to be able to do so.  Much more sensible.  Same as in those other cultures, presents, feast, visit from a mysterious visitor leaving gifts.
Poppycock, the whole damn lot of it.  I’ve never been a believer that it’s anything other than an ordinary day.  Didn’t like getting presents, certainly didn’t like giving them, saw the food as an unnecessary extravagance.  It’s still the same.  I’m a successful businessman.  No one, and I mean no one in my company got the day off.  They couldn’t even book it off as a holiday.  Business as usual.  No bonuses, no gifts.  It didn’t make me popular, but I’m not in the business I am to make friends.  Just the cash.
All that was true till this year.  Then the bloody Electorates did what they did best.  Stuck their noses in to other people’s business.  Declared that, unless you were employed in an essential service, you had to get the day off, paid.  Well, I soon found a way round that.  I sacked the bloody lot of them.  Every single one.  The lucky ones will get their jobs back.  The extremely lucky ones will get the same level of pay.
I was enjoying a quiet drink on front of the image box when I got a very mild surprise.  My old partner, Joe Cregg, walked through the door.  Literally, as it was still shut.  That’s not the only thing to surprise me, the fact he was there at all was a tiny shock as he had been dead these six years previously.
‘Jex, Jex, Jex.  What is going on?  I’ve watched you these six years.  I wasn’t that surprised with the direction you took the company, driving costs and wages down while keeping prices high.  But sacking everyone just before Midsummerfest.  Really?  Really?  That’s cold, even for you.’
‘Why does that surprise you Joeleph?’ I replied, lighting a cigar.  This was deliberately to annoy him.  He hated me smoking when he was alive and he couldn’t exactly do anything about it now.  ‘You know how I feel about the whole ridiculous thing.’
‘That’s very true.  But making them beg to get their jobs back, when you are the only game in town?’
‘If they don’t like it, they can take their chances and go somewhere else instead.  You going to try and talk me out of this particular course of action?’
Joe shook his head.  ‘I’m not that stupid.  I know you, I know there’s no convincing you.  I’m more the advance guard.  There will be others.  Don’t know who they will be, but there will be three of them.’
I grinned.  ‘Bring it on.  I can take it.’
Joe shrugged his shoulders and walked out the door.  I would have been shocked and surprised by what had just happened, if I was capable of being shocked by anything.  I finished my drink and went to get another one.  I flicked through the channels, getting annoyed by all the bloody Midsummerfest programmes.  I gave up and left it on as background noise while I looked over the books finding places to reduce our overheads and therefore make me more money.  My favourite pastime.
I heard someone clearing their throat and looked up.  There was a strange looking person standing there.  Long hair, baggy clothes, I actually had to wait for him to talk before discovering it wasn’t actually a female.  There’s no need for anyone to look like that really.  Scruffy git.  He tilted his head and stared at me like an infinitely patient guru.  Or a complete and utter numpty.
‘I suppose you’re one of those folks that Joe warned me about?’
‘Indeed I am.  If you would be so considerate as to rise yourself off the chair and proceed in a manner that is following where I lead you, it would be muchly appreciated.’
‘Did you swallow a bloody spellingbook or something?’
He continued to stare at me in a manner that I suppose was supposed to be piercing but merely made me think he had something wrong with his sight.  ‘It has been commented before that I tend to communicate in a way that can be described as being ever so slightly on the side of the verbose, that much is in the record as a statement of fact.  However, my fine person of the male persuasion, the manner with which I carry out my verbal interactions with other personages is not the matter or mission upon which I am currently standing in this fine room which is part of your place of abode.  You, in all actuality, really do need to be following where I precede you to.  If you find my style of conducting communications of the conversational variety to be not of your particular taste than the greater velocity with which he hence from this place of dwelling, the sooner I shall no longer be chatting to your good self.’
I got up, sighing.  A spellingbook?  This guy seems to have swallowed the entire language for dinner then another one for desert.  I headed towards the door.
‘Oh, dear me, my fine and upright male type,’ he said.  ‘There was a particular and very rational explanation as to why I asked your fine self to follow me.  For you shall not be removing yourself from the confines of these four splendidly decorated walls in the manner with which you are quite accustomed.  If you would ever so kind as to follow in the direction and general manner of which I shall be leading and proceeding, it would be much and greatly appreciated.’
It usually takes a lot for me to lose my temper but this guy was very close to it.  ‘Where are we going?’
‘I would request that, in all humbleness and obsequiousness, that the sooner that we cease and desist tarrying and remaining in this place, the sooner your eyeballs will observe detail and catalogue our ultimate destination.’
‘Do you ever say things simply?’
‘My dear and sweet gentle person of the male persuasion, it is the humble opinion of my good self, your guide, mentor and narrator, that to use one piece of vocalisation when you could use ten is sheer, total and utter laziness.  Shall we depart from the ground on which we currently stand and the space we presently occupy with no further delay?’
I gave up and followed him.  We walked, not through the door, but through the wall at the rear of the room.  Rather than ending up in my dining hall, as I would expect, it being the room through there, I found myself outside.  The house we stood outside looked familiar to me, though I couldn’t quite place it.  My annoying guide turned to me again.
‘Now I do find that it is my solemn duty to be informing you that in this place, at this time you are as spectral and non-corporal as my own good self, your dear, late and much lamented friend and partner in the world of business and the two personages that shall be paying you the honour and the privilege of a visitation once I have departed from your fine and muchly enjoyable company.  Now, my dear sir, if you would once again be so kind as to place your lowest appendages in the steps of my own feet, we shall proceed with the entering of this simple, humble yet very homely abode.’
I followed him through the wall into the house.  I got a shock when I saw someone I instantly recognised, sat slumped on the bottom step, crying over a package I again recognised.  ‘Soxanna Hamilsmythe,’ I whispered.
‘So, your good self has recognition of this poor, weeping visage that sits before us?  And would there be, perchance, any glimmer of familiarity with great concern to the package she is currently blessing and moistening with giant drops of water?’
I looked closer.  ‘It is a present that she tried to give me.  We must have been in Learning Eight at the time.  I remember laughing and shoving it back in her face.’
‘Well, that simple act did give her much reason for the painful act of grievance.  The poor, very unfortunate womanly person you see so tortured before myself and yourself spent a lot of time and no small amount of trouble to be absolutely assured that the small but perfectly chosen gift would be much to your liking.  The poor dear was completely, totally and utterly head over heels in love with you.  That simple but very much of the cruel description act with which you returned the present did break her poor delicate heart.  And, may be as bold as to enquire as to the nature and direction of any feelings you may have harboured towards her?’
‘I was in love with her.  I did try to approach her after this happened but got short shrift.  Now I know why.  Is this what you are planning to do, make me visit places like this?’
‘If that was indeed my intention and my plan, it would be very, very easy to do sir.  For there is absolutely no doubt or equivocation in my, or anyone else’s, mind that of such personages supply cannot be described in any way, shape or form as being short.  Beings of the human variety that may easily be described as friends of yours, familial members, there is indeed a plentiful supply of these types.  However, our time together is, by necessity, short and thusly my humble self can only be of a mind to let you view and peek on one such example.  This wretched creature was thusly chosen as being the one that you would catch sight and sound of as it may well be the one that made the biggest impression on you.  Now, if it would please and pleasure you, I must bid you adieu and the most fairest of wells.  You shall be departing of this place by the very means and direction with which you came in.’
With that, he was gone.  I walked through the wall I went through to get in and was back in my living space.  I went to the drinks cabinet, poured a very healthy measure of alcohol and downed it.  What exactly was that supposed to teach me?  When I turned back round there was someone else there.  Definitely female this time.  She pointed at me.
‘You.  Follow,’ was all she said.  Thank the Gods for that, short on conversation. We left though the front wall this time.  We stood outside the house.  She pointed to the house opposite mine.’
‘Look.’
The house was festooned with horrible lit decorations.  It was really not becoming.  Then she turned round and pointed again.
‘Look.’
I did.  My house, looking perfectly normal, the way things should be.
‘You not decorate.’
‘It’s cheap, tacky and in celebration of something ridiculous.  I really don’t see the point.’
‘But you make.’
‘Of course I do.  Low production costs, massive profits.  I’d be mad not to.’
She turned again.  ‘Follow.’  I did.  We walked down the street, turned the corner and followed the next street till she stopped, turned and pointed at a house.  ‘Look.’
‘And this is important to me because?’ I asked.
‘Azander MacToro.  You know’
‘The name rings a bell,’ I said.  ‘Think he works in accounts.’
‘Follow.’
I followed her into the house.  Sat there, looking morose amongst the bustle, was Azander.
‘Glad to see he’s not enjoying himself.’
‘First Midsummerfest with family,’ she said.  Can’t enjoy.  Can’t have fun.  Busy worrying if will have job tomorrow.’
‘Good.  Anyone having fun at this stupid time of year should be zapped on sight and then zapped again to ensure they are dead.’
She pointed back to the wall.  ‘Leave.’  She disappeared and I walked through the hall, back to my place.  This time I didn’t move.  Sure enough, someone else appeared in my living space.  Female again.  She looked a bit kinder than the last one, however.
‘Let me guess,’ I said.  ‘You want me to follow you.’
‘Dude, you catch on pretty quickly,’ she replied.  She walked towards one of the side walls and I followed her.  We were in my street, but there was something different about it.  The lights looked completely different for a start.
‘Have a look in that bin.  There’s something there that might interest you.’
I went over and picked up the box resting on the top.  The fact that I could pick it up was a surprise.  ‘I didn’t think I’d be able to do that, being non-corporeal and all,’ I said.
‘You shouldn’t be able to, but exceptions can be made if needs be.’
I looked at the box, drinking in all the information on there.  ‘I don’t recognise this.’
‘We’re about 20 years in the future.  That box used to contain the very latest in cutting edge technology.’
‘It’s not made by me.’
‘Indeed not,’ she agreed.  ‘Come on, follow me.’
I put the box back and followed her down the road.  She led me into the graveyard.  I never liked this place.  Far, far too dark and dingy for my tastes.  If they sold me the place, like I’d asked, it would have been turned into an amusement fair.
We walked through rows and rows of extravagant monstrosities dedicated to people who can’t actually appreciate them to a bit at the back.  This was the area for pauper’s graves.  My guide pointed at one.  Written on a tiny, badly whitewashed, crudely made cross was “J Washburne.”
‘That my grave?’
‘It is.’
‘What happened?’
‘Your miserly cost cutting measures made your products unusable.  You refused to invest in making anything else new.  Competitors moved in and stole your staff.  The company went bust.  You lost a load of money and, due to your attitude, you had no friends.  This is what you become.  And now we must part ways.’
She disappeared and I walked through the wall from one version of my living space to the other.  I got myself a drink and sat back down, flicking through the channels on the image box and thinking.
Now, you may be under the impression that everything I saw had given me food for thought, made me realise that I had to change things.  Sorry pal, wrong story.  I was actually recalling everything I learned from the box I held.  There was a nice project for the development people tomorrow.

My body has decided that I’m going to be nocturnal for a while.
It’s a pain in the arse, cos I basically get bugger all done.  Usually end up sitting at home watching videos.
Plus I’m still permanently knackered.
But at least I’m up for brekkie.  Or, in my case, supper.

As those readers in Britain know, there’s an inquiry into mobile phone hacking by tabloids.

For those who were wondering, here’s the pic I promised in the last entry:

Sadly, it doesn’t even look like that any more.  That approach stopped working…
I was hoping to use the power cable for my external hard drive as a stop gap (based on the attitude that if I have no working laptop, I can’t use the drive anyway).  Unfortunately, the cable is nowhere near powerful enough so, back to the drawing board.
Class on Monday was fun.  had to read out the time travel story I sent out to some folk.  It went down well and my tutor admitted that she could tell just by reading it that I had fun writing it.  Which I really, really did.
This Monday we’re heading to the pub for a meal.  Quite sad, but it’s the first time ever I’ve been to a Christmas meal.
Then in the middle of the month, I’ve got another one through borotweetup.  If I can afford the deposit (I’ve already been told the meal is covered for me).  That one, as it turns out, is at the restaurant is literally about 5 minutes from my house.
Finally found out about smoking in my house on Christmas Day.  When I’m back home, I tend to smoke only in the bedroom I use, as I’m the only smoker in the house.  The sole exception is if we have a guest and they’re smoking in the living room.
My sister and brother in law are coming round for Christmas dinner and they’ll be bringing my new nephew or niece with them.  So I wasn’t sure if I’d be banished outside (which wouldn’t have bothered me).  But I asked my mum when I phoned on Monday and as long as I don’t smoke in the same room as him/her, it’s fine.  Though my dad probably won’t quite agree.
Incidentally, anyone got any ideas what to buy for a 2-3 week old as a present?
Also, if anyone is interested, I’m heading up the road on the 21st.
Cos I’ve got into trouble for not sharing that info before.
I think that’s about it for now.

So, you’re probably all wondering how training went?  Did I have fun learning how to make drinks and sit letting people in?
Well, no.
It didn’t happen.
As far as I know, anyway.
I turned up, just before 1, found the person who interviewed me standing outside the place and said I was there for the training.
At which point, he told me that it had been cancelled and that I should phone back later on to find out what’s happening.
So, phone back a few hours later only to be told by the guy I al;ways speak to on the phone from the place that training was that day.  I pointed out what happened to me and he said that he didn’t know what was happening and he isn’t in charge.
This is the guy the jobcentre website told me to contact.  This is the same guy who is now on the jobcentre website as being the guy that you have to send application forms to (they’ve readvertised the jobs).
This is all begining to sound just a little bit fishy.
He told me to phone back today and he’d let me know what the hell was happening.
I phone baqck at lunchtime.  The guy asks me whether I was chosen to work on Saturday.  The hell?  How the fuck could that have happened when I was told training was cancelled on Friday.  I said no and he said he’d phone me back and let me know what was happening.
I’m getting a feeling here.
The sort of feeling that makes me glad I didn’t actually sign off last week.
The feeling that, to be frank, I’ve been fucked about with for the past week.
The feeling that they’re not going to call me back.
I’m due into Triage tomorrow.  My advisor will ask me what’s going on and I’ll tell him.  If he is serious about what his job is supposed to be, he’ll take over from there.
As for me?  I have to assume I’m back to square 1.  I’ve already phoned about one job (went to voicemail so I’m waiting for the guy to phone back) and I’ve to drop off an application form for another one on my way to class tonight.
I’m pissed off about the lost week jobsearching more than anything.

So, I’m ready to be trained.  Hence the reason I’m here just now.  I’m sat, wearing black t shirt, black fleece jumper, black trousers (I’m not sure if I have to wear black trousers or not, so I’m erring on the side of caution) and black shoes, my long black leather coat on the back of my chair.  People must think I’m a burglar or summat.
I also got some good news last night.  Remember me saying a while back that I had entered a story for a competition about the Transporter Bridge?  Well, I didn’t win (the two prizes went to photo sets) but, they think my story is good and want to include it in an exhibition!  No details where or when yet, but of course I’m going to say yes.
I’m slightly more nervous about that than the training, to be honest.  It’s the first time something like this has happened to me.  It’s good timing though.  I’m submitting as short story to a BBC competition for possible broadcast on Radio 4 and have to include a cover letter.
Back in a moment.
Sorry about that.  Two minute silence.
Where was I?
Oh, right.  Cover letter.  I’ve still to write it (there’s some advice on the BBC Writer Room blog about that) but I can now put that down instead of just saying I have not been published or anything.
Finally, meet my new mascots:

I phoned the guy about the job at lunchtime.
He asked if I had already had my interview, I said yes, he asked me to phone back tomorrow and he would let me know when training starts.
This is the second time I’ve been told to phone back.  The first time, there was something vague about training.  This time, not so much.
So I’m calling it.
I CAN HAS JOB!
Really enjoyed going into Triage today (I was supposed to be doing jobsearch) and telling them where to stick it.
(Although, to be fair, my advisor seemed genuinely excited for me.)
On another note, thanks to everyone for their notes yesterday.  Made me fell all warm and tingly.

Training Friday, 1 o clock, at the club.
I’ve to wear a plain black top.  and as the only plain black top I actually own is my fleece jumper, I’ll have to buy one.

574,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/surprise-job-interview-3930621/,2011-11-06,Surprise job interview!,"
So, this was a shock.
I saw a job for bar staff online on Friday and decided to phone about it.
The guy asked me to phone back on Saturday at 4.
As said in my previous entry, I was going round to a friends house for belated birthday drinks with her and her lad.  I arrainged to get there about 3:30 so I could phone from there.  I phoned, expecting to be told that the interviews would be sometime this week.
Only to be told that the interviews were taking place then at the train station.
Bugger.
I decided to go along anyway.  I borrowed a suit jacket and shirt, but had to wear my combats as her lad is noticably bigger than me.  They also lent me money for the bus.
Got the bus into town, straight to the train station.  There was a bit of a mix up about where the interview was actually taking place, but I found the guy, wrote down my details and we had a chat.  I think it went well, particularly when I said I’d be willing to do cloakroom work as well as bar work.  Didn’t mention heading home for Christmas though.
So, i have to phone tomorrow to find out if I have the job.  The guy did say to phone tomorrow to find out when training starts, so it sounds hopeful, but I’m not getting my hopes up.
Rest of the night involved much alcomahol, Max Payne (the film) and fireworks.

I am so.  Frakking.  TIRED.  this week.  Really don’t know what’s going on.
Finally got my CV to Triage.  It only took five bloofy emails, they kept losing the damn thing.  My advisor said he was going to mess about with it a bit and I haven’t yet seen what he’s done.  He hasn’t deigned to share that with me.  GRRRRRRRRRR.  It’s only my CV, y’know, the thing he’s sending to prospective employers on my behalf.  It’s not like it’s important that I get to see it or anything.
I also had to go in on Monday for a job they were considering me for.  It’s basically a glorified shelf stacker.  Long hours, permanent night shift, not much time for sleep.  Oh, and no holiday pay when I’m actually on holiday.  Think I’ll pass, thanks…
I have to phone someone back about a bar job tomorrow and I’ve also seen another job that I will go for.  As soon as I find out where the place is…
Apart from that, not up to much.  About to get started on my TTZ articles for the next issue (well, once I’ve finished playing the game for one).  Been watching my TV programmes and finally decided to give up on Terra Nova.  Honestly, I stuck in there as much as I could, but it couldn’t decide if it was going to be awesome or extremely boring and shit.  Sometimes in the same episode.  Also, it still bothers me where the fuck they are getting the power for all the hi tech toys thay have.
Revenge is still awesome and I still encourage everyone to watch it.
Tonight is borotweetup, where we’ve been promised cake cos it was a friends birthday yesterday.  Tomorrow I’m going round to said friends house for a mini belated party with her and her lad.
Got my train booked for the trip home for Chrimbo.  I’ll be back for a fortnight.  Can’t wait.  Home cooking and get to see my nephew or niece for the first time!
I still need to go through the Simon and Schuster catalogue to see which books I want review copies of for my book review diary  It’ll probably be mostly crime though.
Can’t think how to end this, so here’s a bloke on a bike:

I’ve been fighting with my bank for the past week.  I’ve been locked out of the online service, which they’ve admitted is there fault and they’ve consistantly lied to me about things connected with that.  So, I’ve had it.  I’ve decided to move banks.  Just waiting to hear back from the one I’ve decided to go to.
It’s not the first time they’ve pissed me about like this, but it’s definately the last.
Cureently addicted to the TV show Revenge.  It’s damned good and everyone, I mean EVERYONE should be watching it.  I will convert people if I have to go door to door in order to do so.
Had quite a boring week.  Job search as usual.  I’m having fun winding them up as I don’t apply for jobs in Boro (not hard to do, there are no jobs in Boro) but applying eslewhere for writing/creative jobs.  You should have seen my advisors face when I said I had applied for a job wiritng radio jingles.
Course, this is the same guy who wants to see me fill out an online application form to make sure I’m answering questions how the employer wants me to rather than, say, being honest I’ll keep winding him up.
Course, he can’t find the CV I’ve emailed to them four, yup that’s FOUR times so I’ll probably have to resend that.
So, fuck ’em.  Their idea seems to be to piss me off so much that I’ll get a job in spite of, instead of with the help of, them and purely so I don’t have to deal with them any more.
I’ve been without a phone for much of the last week.  Entirely my own fault, I let paying my bill slip more than I should have.  But, thankfully, I was able to pay it today so it’s back!
Starting to plan heasding home for the holidays and discovered that I get paid just before Hogmanay!  Brilliant news, cos it means I don’t have to borrow from the folks/see in the New Year at home.  It does mean I’ll have to come to an arrangement with my landlord but that should be simple enough.
Tomorrow, I’m going to the Riverside to watch Boro play.  A local charity is going to be having a collection before the game and in return for volunteering to stand around holding a bucket for three hours I get a free ticket for the game.  I actually can’t wait.  Boro are my second team (the first being Aberdeen) and I’ve wanted to go to a game at the Riverside for ages but never had the money.
Aso, got my picture taken with the Premiership trophy!  There’s a new branch of Barclays in town (actually, they closed the other two so it’s the only branch in the town centre) and it was officially opened today.  Barclays sponsers the Premiership so they brought the trophy up and took pictures of people standing next to it.  (Unlike when the FA Cup I wasn’t even allowed to touch it).  Here’s the pic I got them to take on my phone:

So, that’s the FA Cup and the Premiership trophy.  Still no Scottish trophies but I live in hope.

So, I didn’t get through the BBC thing.  Got the email today.
No feedback, as expected.  Just that they had read the first 10 pages of my script and that was that.
It would also appear that I haven’t been selected in the Writers Block North-East Transporter Bridge thing I also entered.  Not that they bothered to let me know that.
That one was a surprise because they emailed to ask if they could publish my story on Facebook to inspire others, though they never did.
What now?  See the entry title.
I’m still entering the Channel 4 screenwriters thing.  I’ve decided to enter the script I submitted for the BBC thing.  I did start writing a new script for it, but the BBC one is the strongest.  I’m going to take a couple more passes at it, see if I can strengthen it up.  I have till the end of the month, plenty of time.
And I’ll keep my eye out for other competitons I can enter.  Thankfully, I’m back in my creative writing class, so I am actually writing at the moment.
Other stuff.  Remember the situation I mentioned here?  (I posted pictures of the park in question here)
Well, they’ve had the design competition and the finalists can be seen here.  My opinion?  They are all monstrosities and would make me embarrassed to admit I come from a city with them in place.
I’m not just saying this because I love Union Terrace Gardens and think they shouldn’t be doing this at all.  Number 2 is the most tolerable, because they basically keep the gardens as they are.  Except for the bizarre Tellytubbies thing over the rail line.
(Actually, kudos has to go to that team for actually showing what their design will look like when it’s snowing.)
Course, as it turns out, the final decision might rest with the Court of Sessions.
I know I still owe you a picture entry from the question time thing a while back.  Still got to get one picture for it.

So, today I had a group session with Triage.  I didn’t know what that meant, except that it probably didn’t mean therapy.
I still don’t know what it means.
I dragged myself in for midday, as they’d requested, signed in and said I was there for a group session.  They asked me to go on a computer and do a job search (looking at jobs I’d already seen) and someone would speak to me.
So, I go and do the pointless job search.  And keep going.  And keep going.
For an hour and a quarter.
Seriously.
An hour and a fucking quarter, I’m sat at that bloody piece of crap computer.  They know why I’m there.  They know what I’m waiting for.
Eventually, just as I’m getting up to get some bloody answers, someone finally approaches me and asks if I’m OK.
Truth be told I’m fucking livid, but I simple ask what the hell is going on and explain the situation.
I’m asked to do more fucking job search while the person tries to find out.  However, having been all jobsearched out (there’s only so often I can keep staring at a screen at the same bloody stuff before it drives me mad[er]) I decide to read my book instead.
Eventually, someone deigns to actually, y’know, talk to me.  Turns out, the appointment was to meet my new advisor (as my old one, who I’d only actually met once, has changed job in the company [which raises the question as to why I was assigned to her in the first place]) and, as I have an appointment with him already tomorrow, they went ahead and cancelled this one.
Course, they didn’t actually bother their arses to let me know they had cancelled this one.  Well, can’t have been easy getting in touch with me.  Not when they have my postal address, my email address and my mobile phone number.  Very, very difficult.
This is what pisses me off the most.  They piss me about like this and all I get is an apology.  But if I had to cancel an appointment and didn’t give them any warning, I’d be sanctioned.
And it looks like I’m going to have to email them my CV.  For the fourth fucking time.
I’m convinced their way of getting me into work is to piss me off so much I’ll take any job rather than deal with their bullshit.

She sat there, in perfect silence, slowly drawing the knife back and forth across her palm. Not quite enough pressure to break the skin, but so, so close. People claimed to know what she was feeling, but they didn’t of course they didn’t.
No one knows, not really. The feeling that things aren’t really worth bothering with. The feeling that your life would be better lived if you weren’t living it at all. Yes, she knew that she wasn’t the only person to have ever felt like this. But, no one knew what she, personally, was feeling. It was different for everyone.
It hadn’t always felt like this. She used to be quite outgoing, vivacious even. Then, all of a sudden, things changed. She couldn’t even point to one thing that happened to her to cause it. It just happened. The black dog, as Winston Churchill called it. She was moody, lethargic, couldn’t be bothered with anything due to not actually seeing the fucking point. Her friends did notice the change but they chalked it up to problems at work or with her relationships. Convenient excuses, admittedly, but the problems with both were actually caused by, not the causes of, her mood.
The first real signs anyone had noticed was when a friend, not being able to raise her on her phone, came round. The friend let herself in, as was usual, and entered the kitchen. There, the friend saw her, Comfortably Numb playing on repeat on her iPod. With the knife, the same one she had playing across her hand right now, testing to find out exactly how much was too much pressure and how much was not quite enough, edge down being slowly pressed into her thigh.
But what really scared the friend was that she was perfectly calm. Bright eyed, seemingly not noticing what she was doing, continuing to drink her wine with her other hand, smoking a cigarette between sips and chatting away as if nothing strange was going on. There then followed hospitalisation, psych reports and a therapist. A fucking therapist! As if that bitch could actually help her! She usually lied to the therapist, including on the issue of whether or not she was taking her medication. She had no problem with drugs, assuming they were actually needed and could help. Which these really couldn’t. She knew that.
She glanced down to her hand as a line of crimson formed on it. She put down the knife and held up her hand with the fingers pointed upwards. Lighting a cigarette she watched, rapt. Interesting stuff, blood, if you think about it. She wondered about possibly getting more of it to come out and play.

You lot are annoying.
I was planning to answer these on Monday or Tuesday.  Then I got a question that had to be answered today.  Fair enough.  then I got another question that I can’t answer till Tuesday and will have it’s own entry.
Arse.
I would now like to question whether the parents of the two people involved were married at the time these people were born…
DoodleKid is one of said people:
How do you think they are going to get around the Doctor dying on Saturday? There are enough theories, I am interested in which one you subscribe to 🙂
The main one I’ve read is that in the first half of the series it was Flesh!Amy and in this half it’s Flesh!Doctor.
I think it’s simpler and more complicated than that.
I think it goes back to Let’s Kill Hitler.  Specifically, the fact that River became River when she killed the Doctor, which she had been raised to do.  But the people in the robot thingy didn’t know she had, they were talking about a point in the future.  Does Kevorkian and The Silence know about that either?
little_chloella wants me to get out the chrystal ball:
where do you see yourself in 5, 10, 20 years time?
On my own private island, watching Aberdeen win their (insert number here) consecutive Champions Leage while one Playboy Playmate of the year services me orally, another brings me fresh lager and cigars rolled on the thighs of virgin maidens and another two provide other entertainment.  All the women will be naked.
Or not.  I stopped making long term plans because they are far too easily derailed.  I much prefer making short term plans then asking quo vadimus.
Next is Schwulerin.  Or not, as the case may be:
How about a few pictures and brief descriptions of some of your favorite places around town?
Own entry.  Tuesday.  Parents unwed…
Finally (for now) we have Rodge:
What is your favourite board/card/tabletop game?
Board game: mancala (sadly, I don’t have a set at the moment.  If anyone is feeling generous…)  Card game: Solitare.  Table top game: None.
And that’s all the questions I have for now but if anyone does have any more, leave them as a note and I’ll update this entry.

I’m trying to work something out.
If you own a pet and it gets to the point where they no longer have a good quality of life, you are expected to have them put down.
In fact, it’s considered cruel and inhumane not to.
If however, you are a human in the same position, you can’t be put down, even if that’s what you want.
That’s not just cruel and inhumane but illegal.  Put down a human in pain, who has a terminal illness and who’s body and mind is shutting down, it’s murder.
But, in some places, if you have committed a serious enough crime, the state will put you down.
This isn’t murder, as you might expect, but justice.
So, what’s best for dogs and no more than some humans deserve isn’t good enough for those people unfortunate enough to be slowly, painfully dieing.
And these are, by and large, the views held by people who call themselves pro-life.
In fact, they are against abortion because that’s also murder.
The reason they have for this stance is that only God has the right to decide who lives and dies.
Unless you commit a serious crime, in which case God says an eye for an eye.
(We’ll ignore the pesky vengence is mine sayeth the Lord bit).
Or unless you are suffering terminal illness, in which case you should do everything you can to stay alive long after you should have died.
And if you can’t fight for your own life, say because you are in a persistive vegetative state with no hope for recovery, others will go to court on your behalf.
Now, I like to think I’m reasonably intellegent.  I’m not Stephen Fry or Einstein or even the Doctor, but I’m not Homer Simpson either.
Bit I cannot for the life of me make out any kind of logic from what I’ve put above.
Anyone help me?

My confirmation for the BBC thing came today.  So, now all I can do is cross my fingers, hope and pray.  And hope you lot will do the same for me.
Which makes the script thing for the Channel 4 an easier decision.  As the script I already have is in a competition, it would be stupid of me to enter it elsewhere.  So I’ll write something else.  I have a start in mind, then I’ll do what I always do.  See where that takes me.

I had my first proper appointment with my DNA at Triage on Thursday.  Was already in a bad mood (see below) so didn’t really feel up to it.  It didn’t help that there was a backlog of people waiting to be seen.  GRRRRR!
The upshot is that I have to go in for an hour a week for jobsearch.  This means coming off the internet (where I’m job hunting), walking for 5 minutes, going online to hunt for jobs then, after an hour, coming offline to walk for 5 minutes back to where I was before to go online.
Ladies and gentlemen, I think I may have found the dictionary definition of Collosal Waste of Fucking Time.
Had my first job search session today.  Sure enough, found absolutely bugger all I had not already applied for…
Good news!  My creative Writing class started again yesterday.  Bad news: I wasn’t there.  I went to enroll on Thursday.  Now, remember the problems I had with my fees for last term?  That, despite me having given them the right bank account information and the money being there they had a problem getting said money?  Well, they won’t let me re-enroll till I’ve paid that as well.  Which I didn’t have the money for last week.
So I’ll have to go again this week.  Which’ll take about 2 hours just in travelling time.  Cos, despite the fact it’s run by the council, they can’t be bothered having anywhere in town for enrolling.
Still haven’t got the confirmation email about my entry for the BBC thing.  Which is worrying, cos they said they’d be sending them out on the 15th.  If it doesn’t arrive tomorrow, I’ll contact them and pray that Royal Mail didn’t lose it.
Meanwhile, there’s a Channel 4 thing I’m planning to enter.  For this one, again, I have to submit a minimum 30 page script.  (Thankfully, this one is email so no printing.)  Here’s my question.  Should i just submit the script I sent in for the BBC thing or write a new one?
Also waiting to hear back about another competiton I entered.
They’ve just played my song, have to get going.

As I may have mentioned before, I’ve been sent by the jobcentre to a place called Triage as part of a work program.  I had my second appointment with them yesterday.  Thankfully, I didn’t get any homework this time, but they did a check to test my readiness for work and then gave me two options.  I could either go on a program where they would send my on courses for things like interview skills or they could just look for work for me.  I chose the latter.
So, they phoned today and I have to go and see my DNA (stupid fucking titles they give these things, I’ve previously had three career coaches and now a fucking DNA, just call them bloody advisors) tomorrow at 2.  Then a mandatory hour jobsearch.  Which’ll mean coming offline in the library.  Where I do jobsearch.  And their computers are shit.
GRRRRRRRRRRRRR
Still, at least I have the concert to look forward to.  This year is the 100th birthday of the Transporter Bridge and there’s a celebratory concert tomorrow night, complete with the first ever performance of the Middlesbrough Symphony.  As you might expect, the tickets are pricey but I won a couple on facebook yesterday.
Here’s more information: Transporter Bridge Centenary Concert.
Look at me being all classy and shit.  Not dressing up for it though.
Watched the last episode of Torchwood.  If you cry easily, get the tissues handy.  Still need to write my review of that and some reviews for my book review diary, which you can find here
And while I’m linking to things, I’m on facebook here twitter here and Google+ here.
And if you want to join in the Google+ fun, invites can be located here.
That’s all the links for now.
I’m seriously going grey around the temples.  At least I’m not going bald…
That’s about it.  Plans for the night are to watch Ringers, burn the Oh Brother gig I downloaded to DVD (thanks to psychobabble for that one), convert some songs from M4A to mp3 (it’s actually quite sad looking at the One Day soundtrack list cos both the main characters in the books had much, much better taste than that) and wait till midnight when I get paid and can get baccy and food (chicken parmo FTMFW).
So, I’ll go now.  Hope everyone is OK.

So, after the problems of last week, I finally got my script sorted, proofread and posted today.  Not all in one day, only the posting bit was today.
Though that wasn’t without it’s stresses.  Which I don’t particularly want to talk about.
Some time late next week early the week after, assuming it hasn’t got lost, I’ll get the confirmation email.  Untill then, and indeed afterwards, it’s just a case of fingers crossed and pray to whichever deity you believe in (the FSM in my case).
Downloaded the latest episode of NTSF:SD:SUV today.  If you haven’t watched that yet, do so.  It’s fucking hilarious.
Also downloaded something I’ve been looking forward to since I heard it was happening.  Long time followers may know that one of my favourite films is Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?  In fact the only thing I love more than the film is the soundtrack (used to have one of the songs as my ringtone).  Easily, easily my all time favourite soundtrack.  Well, the film is 10 years old this year and to celebrate this they’ve released a deluxe version of the soundtrack.  Disc 1 is a remastered version of the soundtrack, disc 2 is stuff that was recorded for the film but not used and different versions of songs that were used.  Bliss.
Oh, if you’re a writer and have a PC, you really should give Scrivener for Windows.  They already have a version for Macs and this one is beta at the moment.  It really is the canines dangly bits.
Kinda happy that I’ve found a way to put a TARDIS reference into something I’m writing for a competition.  It’s not going to be shoehorned either.  It will work and make sense.
Can’t wait to see the last episode of Torchwood on Monday.  Partly cos I’m reviewing the series for a fanzine (not TTZ).  I have three ideas for the next (well the one after the next) issue of TTZ.  Two of the things I’m definately doing, but the third I’m not sure about as it’ll mostly be me moaning about being disappointed by something.
Plans for the next few days?  Meet friend for drink, crash at theirs till Sunday, Doctor Who, TV quiz shows, F1, sign on and appointment with new place jobcentre has sent me to.  Who thinks I should wear a shirt, bow tie, combat trousers and long leather coat for that one?  If so, should it be the blue or the new wine coloured bow tie?
Finally, people complain about BBC3 only showing crap.  A lot of their stuff is, but then you get stuff like Filthy Rich and Homeless, Young Dumb and Living Off Mum (guilty pleasure), Being Human, Pulse (which should have gone to series).  And The Fades.  Not aired yet, but watch this and tell me it doesn’t look fucking awesome:

So, they’re doing a thing in Boro this month called Heritage Open Days.  (The one I’m really looking forward to is the Town Meal cos, well, free fucking food!)
Today the Town Hall opened it’s doors for all those nosy enough to want a look.
Like me.
Here, have some pics.

Don’t worry, it’s not that Middlesbrough is so skint they can’t afford a new one.  This one was presented to the council at the end of World War 1 and tradition is that once it’s in order, as it is here, it’s left to decay.  So, it’s nearly 93 years old.  I think it looks in decent freaking condition, to be honest.

2nd Leutenant Albert Edward Forbes.  No idea why I took a pic of this :¬p

Clock in the council chambers.

Those black bits in the roof?  Yeah, those used to be the lights…

The door to one of the cells.  Which, TARDIS like, is bigger on the inside.

Date stone.  Don’t ask me to decrypt it.

View of the theatre from the chorus gallery on one side.

Apparently, there are arguments if these decorations are Griffins or Dragons.  Which is ridiculous.  Clearly dragons.

See?  That, at the top, is a griffin head.

The fireplace in the red dressing room.  There is another dressing room that’s just been done up, but that one is green.

View from the choir stalls on the other side.

Attempted close up of a dragon holding the old Middlesbrough coat of arms.  (The new one is the same, but the middle of the three ships has been replaced with a star shaped yellow flower.)

Stained glass window with the names of some of the musicians who had performed there up till the 1930’s.

The organ.  It’s not working at the moment, but the council have been told it’s fixable.  Incidentally, tradition dictates that of all the work in the concert hall, fixing the organ should be the last to be done.
Hope you enjoyed.

So, I got the script and the proposal done for my submission for the competition.
It’s due in on the 15th so I decided to get it sent away ASAP.  This meant printing it out.
I have a printer but it’s running out of ink.  Which is fine, if I’m printing something for class, but obviously not for this.
Thankfully a friend agreed to print it out for me on the condition that I pay the costs.  Was just over £1 so that wasn’t an issue.
After he did so, I decided to read through everything.  I started with the script.  Typo, but I can get away with it.  No, wait, it’s referenced by the end of that page.  Never mind.
There were already a couple of things that I wanted to change round, but they weren’t massively important.
Spotted another typo.  No problem.  Forgot a transition.  I could cope with that.
Read one line.  Blinked.  Read it again.  Shook my head.  It can’t be.  Read it a third time.  Shit.  That’s kind of a big mistake.
Finished reading the script and finished my drink.  This’ll need to be redone.  Problem is, printing it again.  I couldn’t exactly ask the same friend.
Thankfully, another friend is going to help me.  I’ll get the changes done on Sunday, get it printed and posted on Monday.
And I will proofread it before printing this time.
I have to go now, but I leave you with this.  My Doctor reading a bit from The Pandorica Opens:

I may also write about the new place the job centre has sent me to to look for work.  Not sure though.  I will say that I have already been told it’ll involve homework…
This week’s pretty much going to be a writing week for me.  I have the 30 page script I need to do for this competition.  I started last night but only got half way through before I got too knackered.  (This is the reason I’m writing this entry just now.  It’ll give me time to finish it this afternoon.)

600,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/stuff-a-couple-of-rants-3930502/,2011-08-18,Stuff.  A couple of rants…,"
So, the restlessness has gone, thankfully.
Everything is in place for this wedding on Sunday.  Got my suit, shirt, tie, shoes, gift and card.  A friend has already agreed to laptop sit for me and I’m getting picked up tomorrow.
Apart from that, not much is happening.
Those of you who live here wiil know this, but yesterday was A-level and GCSE results day.  This means two things.  One: papaers full of pictures of good looking females getting their results (if you thought that was bad, schools have been using how good looking their female students are as bait to get papers to go there for results day) and Two: people moaning and bitching about how much easier exams are today.
I’m sure I’ve ranted about this before but, here we go again: I would not like to be a schoolkid nowadays.  Before, how well you did in your exams merely reflected how much you studied, unless you are one of those people who just do well in exams.  Nowadays, your fucked if you do and fucked if you don’t.  If you do badly, it’s your own fault, you should have worked harder.  If you do well, don’t bother celebrating, the only reason you did so is because the exams have gotten easier.  Nothing to do with you working your arse off to earn the grade.  You can’t have done that, surely.
The truth is, no-one, except the person themselves knows exactly how much they deserve their grade.  You didn’t spend every single minute of every single day with them.  I’d like to say to these folk: put your money where your mouth is.  Pick a subject, publish on public record your result for that subject then sit this years exam.  Under exam conditions.  If things have got easier, you should get a better mark now than you did before.  Oh, and don’t worry if you got an A, there’s now the A* grade.
Been catching up on some TV as well.  Channel 4 has an urban culture thing going on at the moment, so been watching some of that.  They showed Exit Through the Gift Shop which is a stunningly good film and one I highly recommend, The Antics Roadshow, directed by Bansky which was about pranksters there’s a couple more i’ve just downloaded.
And there is How Hip Hop Changed the World.  Presented by Idris Elba (Stringer from The Wire) I thought it would be an intereseting 2 hours about hip hop and it’s influence.  Instead, we got a top 50 show with some dubious choices.
Let’s start with this: one of the top 25 was Timbalaand and The Neptunes producing for Justin Timberlake and Britnet Spears.  To be sure, that was a big moment.  The first time that hip hop beats had sucessfully been merged with commercial pop.  But somehow, this was above the discovery of the break beat and the creation of G-Funk, which not only defined an entire era of hip hop but also broke the West Coast through as a significant part of hip hop, showing the guys from New York that LA could do this as well.
At number 10 is So Solid Crew.  Now, don’t get me wrong, I loved 21 Seconds when it came out and couldn’t wait to see what else they were capable of doing.  Well, it turns out that WAS what they were capable of doing.  So why the fuck did they make it higher on the list than NWA and Eminem?  NWA, aside from the quality of the music, was a huge influence and broke through an insane number of MC’s.
As for Eminem?  White rappers EVERYWHERE need to bow down and worship the guy.  Till he broke through, white rappers were compared to Vanilla Ice.  He was absolutely the first to be credible and, just when you thought he couldn’t top The Slim Shady LP, he goes and drops The Marshall Mathers LP and does just that.  Yet he was apparently less influential than a group with more emebers than they knew what to do with, one good song and a shitload of legal issues.
Number one was Barak Obama becoming President.  All because he admitted to being a Jay-Z.  Really?  Really?  Pick one of the moments I talked about above.  (Well, except So Solid.)  Or East Coast Vs West Coast.  Run DMC and Aerosmith.  Salt N Peppa.  Missy Elliot.  Rakim.  The creation of scratching.  None of them were more infuential on hip hop than Obama winning the election?  Really?
It’s a shame, because this documentary could and should have been so much more than it turned out to be.
And with that, I must depart.

I’m incredibly restless at the moment.  Have been for the past day, roughly.
I really don’t know what it is.
I can’t concentrate on anything.  I tried watching videos last night.  Didn’t help.  Tried writing.  Ditto.  Tried reading.  Same.
I slept fitfully last night.  Which is to say that I shut my eyes and an hour would pass before they opened again.  Normally, when I have uninterrupted sleep, I have no energy.  Today, I have.  Which would be great, if I could channel it into something.

I’m listening to the debate about the riots that took place recently and I listened to the PM’s statement and subsequent debate.
If you missed them, I’ll sum them up for you:
Police rock, but no need to review budget cuts,
Single parent families, where the single parent is a mother, bad,
Police rock and we need a review of budget cuts,
Firemen rock,
Police rock but no need to review budget cuts,
Schools need to teach respect,
Police rock and we need a review of budget cuts,
Appropriate sentances must be handed out to the rioters,
Police rock but no need to review budget cuts,
We need to investigate the possiblity of removing access to social networking sites when things like this happen,
Wait, what?
When the whole thing broke out, people were quick to blame Twitter and Facebook for enabling it to happen.  Y’know, like they were quick to blame the bombing and shootings in Norway on Muslims.
And, in a case of history repeating, it turned out that the message spread using Blackberry Messenger.
Do you want to know what did start on social networking sites?

The broom army.
Who got loads of praise during the PM’s statement and debate.
This is the entire problem.  I think that Douglas Adams put it best:
“I suppose earlier generations had to sit through all this huffing and puffing with the invention of television, the phone, cinema, radio, the car, the bicycle, printing, the wheel and so on, but you would think we would learn the way these things work, which is this:
1) everything thats already in the world when youre born is just normal;
2) anything that gets invented between then and before you turn thirty is incredibly exciting and creative and with any luck you can make a career out of it;
3) anything that gets invented after youre thirty is against the natural order of things and the beginning of the end of civilisation as we know it until its been around for about ten years when it gradually turns out to be alright really.”
So it proved with social networking today.  Admittedly, someone did bring up in the later debate that police found it useful, but nothing about how it mobilised more people to do good.
While the riots were going on, not only was a riot cleanup hashtag established but the Twitter account @Riotcleanup (who established the awesome hashtag #riotwombles).  When the riots spread to other places, clean up campaign accounts for those places started immediately.  These accounts not only organised help to clear things up the next day, but alerted people to companies willing to provide time and materials to help people rebuild.
Evil, evil social networking sites!  They must be shut down in the future!
Even though the clean up operation is finished (hopefully for good) in London, @Riotcleanup are still going, helping organise supplies for places that have become temporary homless shelters, drop of points, etc.
How despicable!  This shouldn’t be happening!
Twitter and Facebook are at the forefront of fundraising campaigns such as Something for Ashraf.
It must be stopped!
Admittedly, there were people trying to organise riots on facebook.  One person from Glasgow has been arrested and the first thing I knew about it was when I was asked to report it for abuse.  It was also quickly followed by a group saying no riot in Glasgow.  Closer to home (for me anyway), Cleveland Police is investigating a group that was set up to organise a riot in Boro.  That group has been shut down.
So there are people trying to use these sites for evil.  But that’s why it social networking.  It’s like society.  There’s a wide variety of people.  Just as we can’t simply say that it was youths are responsible, or the unemployed, you can’t condemn social networking for the actions of some users.
You want to shut down social networking sites?  Good luck with that.  But, they also used BBM.  Get RIM to shut that down.  OK.  They can still text each other.  So, shut down the mobile networks.  Course, that’ll make it harder for people to call for help.  And the rioters could still be using landlines.  Then, you shut down the phone system.
See where this is going?
Yes, the role of social networking and BBM has to be investigated.  But, for God’s sake, you don’t need to throw the baby out with the bathwater.

*I do have to point out that while I was writing this, someone did mention the role of Twitter in organising the clean up.  The PM’s statement started at 11:30.  This happened at about 6:15pm.

A fun entry today to make up for the seriousness of yesterdays.
Dunno if I’ve mentioned this before, but my brother is getting married later this month.  This is the reason for the haircut I mentioned a couple of entries ago.  My um doesn’t like me having long hair and it’s easier to cut it than to get into an argument.
So, last weekend, armed with a pair of clippers, I went round to a friends house to get them to cut it for me.  The thinking was that it’d be cheaper than going to the hairdressers.
At least, that was the theory.
Sadly, the clippers I bought were worse than pathetically crap.  So, into the bin they went and yesterday I bought another pair and finished the job off:

I’ve still to neaten it up a bit, due to being blessed cursed with a double crown.  I probably won’t be keeping it short either.
So, I have the haircut, the suit the shoes and the tie.  I’m not wearing a kilt, cos you can’t hire a Forbes tartan kilt and they’re fucking expensive to buy.  So instead I’m wearing a Forbes tartan tie:

All I need now is the card and the wedding present.  Not sure what to do about that.
Apart from that, things are going OK.  Same old, same old really.
Quick question: would you lot like to a video entry from me?  Haven’t done one for a while so…
Actually, is there anything you’d like to see me do here?  More political entries, things like that?  Let me know.
I’ll leave it there.  Just one more pic to show you:

A couple of weeks ago, I entered, and won, a Twitter competition to win some Deathly Hallows Pt2 merchandise.
I had no idea what the actual prize was.  On Friday, the box turned up (in good time as I was going to see the film that night).
So, what were the contents?

Special Harry Potter 3D glasses.  Which I’ll never use, as watching films in 3D gives me a headache and besides, IT’S A FUCKING GIMMICK!

Harry potter headphones with 4 cable clips.

The bit of the headphones that makes them Harry Potter headphones.

And one of the clips.

Gringotts coin fridge magnet and the pouch it came in.

Close up of the magnet.

Keyring, with a Gringotts coin and a dragon.

Rubber stamps.  One says Gringotts Bank, one says Avanda Kedavra and one says The Battle of Hogwarts.

The Battle of Hogwarts hat.

And the matching t shirt.

Voldemort t shirt.  With green eyes, for some strange reason.

And the piece de resistance.  My brand new golden snitch clock.

Another shot of it.

The clock open.

What else would it say just above the lip?

The box the clock came in.
In more Potter news to make you jealous, on Monday I was able to get one of the early regestration places for Pottermore and today I found out that I have won a Deathly Hallows Pt2 poster with my picture in it.
One more thing.  Over the weekend, I was round at a friends house so her boyfriend could cut my hair for me.  (In case you’re wondering how that went, bear in mind I usually post pics of my freshly cut hair here and on FB.)
My friend had saved up the free bumpf that comes through the letterbox for catching hair.  We didn’t need it, as I had taken a paper with me, but I did take one of them home to scan in for you.
Can you spot the problem?

Apart from wondering who the hell would get a local takeout to cater a party, I’m not sure that’s how you spell special.  Turn out, neither are they, cos this appears at the top of the same page:

Right.  I said I’d do this today, so let’s get to it.
1) On my right shoulder, I have the Chinese for Serenity as a tattoo.
False.  I do have a tattoo on my right shoulder, but it’s the Chinese for anti – war.
2) Amongst my all time favourite films are Godfather 1 and 2, The Dark Knight, Grease and Demolition Cop.
True.  People are sometimes surprised by that, but it is true.
3) When I was a baby, I had to get skin grafts. The surgeon who did said grafts then gave plastic surgery to victims from Chernobyl.
True.  It’s actually a bit of a funny story.
4) I used to have to wear an eye patch over one eye for at least one hour a day.
true.  I had a squint in one eye, and had to cover up the strong eye to encourage the other one.
5) I have broken precisely 5 bones in my lifetime, none of these required me to wear a cast.
False.  Three bones, no cast.  but a sling a couple of times.
6) Names I have been called (non-insulting, non-swearing list): Virgil, Farmer Broon, Jesus, Silent Bob, Russell Brand, Batman, Blade Trinity.
True.  Most in reaction to my hair/beard/coat.
7) The real reason I don’t shave is because I can’t be bothered with it in the morning.
True.  Yes people, I genuinely am that fucking lazy.
8) I actually know how many people someone has to kill to be classed by the FBI as a serial killer, as well as the difference between a serial killer, spree killer and mass murderer.
True.  Not for research, just cos that sort of thing is interesting to me.  (The answer to the first part, BTW, is 4.)
9) I like all kinds of music but it surprises people to discover I am a fan of hip hop and rap.
True.  I have very eclectic music tastes .
10) The worst job I ever held was in a cinema, the best in a call centre.
Flase.  Flip them round.
11) The one thing that’ll put me off buying a book (apart from the words Dan Brown or Stephanie Mayer) is when the publishers don’t let you know what the book is about.
True.  Mostly because I prefer buying books in an actual shop and would like to know what I’m buying.
12) I also have a habit of going into bookshops and putting books from a particuar series in chronological order.
True.  Probably drives them nuts, but I really don’t understand why they don’t do that themselves.
13) I also have to use cutlery with handles made out of the same material. Anything else makes me uncomfortable.
True.  One of my more OCD habits.
14) I won money on the Grand National as a kid and was forced to share my winnings with my siblings.
True, sadly.  I only won about a tenner as well…
15) I think the last time I paid to see a film in the cinema was The Social Network, but I’m not too sure.
True.  Most films I go to see on the big screen are free screenings.

611,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/bullying-14-3930491/,2011-07-19,Bullying,"
It’s pretty much an open secret that I’m a wrestling fan.  So, last night, I watched Monday Night Raw.  Between Vince getting fired and the tournament to crown a new WWE champion, there was this:
Now, you can argue about why the WWE has decided to start this campaign just now, particularly in light of CM Punk actually naming their bullying campaign as part of their hypocracy a couple of weeks ago (it was the last thing he said before his mic was cut).
But it’s not this I’m on about here.  During that video, you’ll notice that the objective of the Be A STAR campaign is to eradicate bullying completely.
Nice sentiment, but it’ll never happen.  Certainly not in my lifetime.
Now, don’t get me wrong.  I have absolutely no love for bullies and find them abhorrant.  I know what they can do to their victims lives.  The reason I know this so well is this:
I was a victim from bullying.
From about 9 years old right through till I left school and intermittently afterwards.  I get it.  I was one of the youngest in my year, small, not very strong, no good at sports, prefered to read, intellegent and, well, a bit odd.  Apart from the small bit (I, following my dad, shot up at age 16, though I’m still not the tallest bloke in the world) it’s all still true.
But it was hard, when everyone else in my class tormented me during one maths class (it was the year I had 5 different maths teachers and this one was particularly incompetent) or being caught passing a note round the following week in the class before maths on which everyone wrote what they were planning to do to me next period.
Or when someone decided to beat me up outside a church because I wouldn’t give them a cigarette (true, that’s how my nose got broken).
Or deciding that I’d make an excellent target for snowballs, or stones.
But when I heard that bit, it reminded me of a comment from episode 1 of The Wire.  Carver and Hulk are going on about the best way to deal with drug dealers when this exchange takes place:
Shakima Greggs: You rogue motherfuckers kill me. Fighting the war on drugs, one brutality case at a time.
Det. Ellis Carver: You can’t even call this shit a war.
Det. Thomas Hauk: Why not?
Det. Ellis Carver: Wars end.  
Bullying will not be eradicated anytime soon.  It’s far, far too ingraned in society.  Look, I get it.  Survival of the fittest and all that.  It’s why communes in the 70’s didn’t last.  For all the talk, locely as it was, about about true democracy and everyone doing their fair share of work, the stronger one’s started bullying the others.  It’s why there’s so many arguments on The Apprentice: you have a bunch of people who think they are the strongest in one place, it’s going to be bumpy.
What needs to be done, rather than trying to wipe bullying out is two things.  The first is that we have to make bullying uncool.  In my lifetime, we’ve gone from beiong gay being controversial to being homophobic being so.  It’s that sort of change that will make a difference.
The second is to offer support to people who are being bullied.  The scars aren’t just physical but mental.  Bullying can cause low self esteem and confidence (both of which I have) and depression.  It’s known to be a cause of suicide.  Support for people who are being bullied is vital.  This is why, rather than support something which has lofty goals but will not succeed in those for a long, long time, I’d rather support It Gets Better, Childline, Beatbullying and The Samaritans
I don’t mean to piss on the Be A STAR campaign.  I admire the ambition, but I don’t think they are planning to do what’s actually needed.
At to all those who are victims or bullying, I say this: before you opt for the razor blade, knife, bottle of pills with a vodka chaser or tie as improvised noose, talk to someone.  Anyone.  Doesn’t matter if it’s a parent, a sibling, another family member, a neighbour, teacher, friend, someone from your chuch/youth group/sports team (if applicable) or even a complete stranger on the phone.  Speak to someone.
You don’t have to suffer on your own.
It may feel like it at times, but you are not alone.
Will

Friday, met up with a couple of friends for a few drinks, ended up going back to theirs and stayed most of Saturday as well.  T’was good.
The rest of the weekend was spent watching films.
Yesterday, I had to go and sign on.  More than that, I had an interview with them for something called work program.  This, as it turns out, means handing me over to a place called Ingeus.  However, looking at their website, they don’t actually appear to have an office in Middlesbrough.  Furthermore, the only place like that in the building I was told their office was is A4e.  Long time readers may remember me writing about my previous problems with A4e.
So, if I am sent back there, that’ll be fun.  I will, however, show them the complete and utter contempt that they deserve.
Then I had to give blood.  Which was less painful than the job centre interview to be honest.  I got a leaflet about bruises, which was interesting, because the person who put the needle in thought she had caused one.  Which she has, but it’s not that serious.
Spent the rest of the day messing about online.  Well, went home to check for mail and discovered that Talk Mobile, after cancelling my contract and not warning me it was going to happen, now want to charge me a £60 cessation fee.  Yeah.  That’ll happen.
Went home and watched stuff I downloaded.  Phoned my mum, so hopefully I’ll be getting my Forbes tartan tie soon.  Also, got a shock when I checked Twitter to see if the new TTZ had been released yet.  The author of the book I reviewed in my last entry retweeted my review.  Look, I’m not making this up:

Currently listening to Rebekah Brookes testifying at the phone hacking enquiry.  I’ll tell you, between what she’s said and what the Messrs Murdoch earlier on, it seems you can run a newspaper and have no fucking clue about what the hell goes on at said paper on a day to day basis.

Title: The Raw Shark Texts
Author: Steven Hall
Genre: Thriller (well, kinda)
430 pages
Eric Sanderson wakes up one morning not knowing where he is.  Rather helpfully, there is a message from, well, himself.  The first Eric Sanderson.
With the help of this first message, and the subsequent letters from the same person, Eric, along with his cat Ian, sets out to find the person who can help him understand what is going on, and deal with the Ludovician.
There are, in the review snippets accompanying this book, a lot of references.  Daoonie Darko, Memento, Alice in Wonderland, The Matrix.
I’m going to add one more.
The Raw shark Texts is simply nothing more or less than a Charlie Kaufmann film in novel form.
It is a thriller.  And a damn good one at that.  But, with it’s mentions of conceptual sharks, non-divergant loops, unspace and protective mail, it is somewhat of a metaphysical nightmare.
The make up of some of the pages, with seemingly random words and a shark flick book, suggests that the manuscript came, not with a synopsis but rather an instruction manual.
But, for all that, the book works.  Eric is a compelling and sympathetic character which makes the amnesia angle, which rarely, if ever, works in fiction workable.  Ian the cat is a typical cat.
The rest of the characters are good to OK, but it does take some working out, in one particular case, if she is the person she’s presented as being or not.
All in all, a good read, albeit one you will have to think about and possiblyy read again to try and work out all the mysteries.

Having an argument with my local Lloyds bar cos they seem to think it’s OK to short change someone and then tell them they just have to accept it.
Meanwhile, because they are having issues with taking the money out of my account to cover my fees from last term, Middlesbrough Adult Education Centre are threatening me with debt collectors.  For £6.
Seriously.
This meant that the story I wrote for the booklet that is put together for the end of term couldn’t be included.  So I’ve been emailing it to people instead.  (I may post it here as well, if you guys want to read it.)
But Monday night was fun.  Instead of everyone bringing in food, as is usually done, we went to the pub instead.  Good food (well, OK food in my case) and decent (if, at times random) conversation.
Beyond that, not much has happened really.  Got into Alphas and Falling Skies.  And Torchwood, is back as well.
Was thinking about writing something about the phone hacking.  Problem is, the story is moving so fast, whatever I write would quickly become out of date.
I will say this though: I’m not a big fan of the News of the World (my dad read it, therefore it was in the house when I was growing up) but I refuse to celebrate the fact that 200 people were thrown out of their jobs to save the arse of one person.
I’ll go now.  Hopefully I won’t be tired tomorrow.  Probably will though.

So I’ve picked myself up since yesterdays disappointment.  I’ve entered another short story competition.  With this one, there’s a chance that an excerpt of my story will be printed in a magazine, which I’ll get paid £50 for and the first prize is £500.  I’m not too hopeful (due to the rules, I couldn’t enter either of the stories I actually wanted to enter) but, still.
I also have to write a 500 word story tonight for another competition.
I’ve been checking the Weatherspoons website for a while.  There’s a new Weatherspoons opening up in town and they should soon be advertising for staff.  Today, however, I noticed that the Lloyds bar in town were looking for full timers.  Only 25 hours a week but still better than being skint all the frakking time.  Cpurse, on the website, they had that stupid “Why do you want to work here?” question, to which I’m always tempted to answer “Cos I need the money”.
I also applied to be on a new Derren Brown show.  Just cos.
Apart from that, not up to much.  Got an interview with the job centre next time I sign on.  YAY!  /sarcasm  And this might mean me being sent back to somewhere like A4e or Pertemps.  DOUBLE YAY!  /sarcasm
Seriously, those places have done nothing to help me (and have actually tried to fuck things up for me) in the past.  I’ll just have to wait and see what happens.
I’m also fighting with Middlesbrough Adult Education Centre about my creative writing class.  Well, the fees therefore.  I gave them my debit card details to take the fee out of my account and they keep saying that there is a problem.  So, somehow, I have to do something about it.  Even worse, at the end of each term we make a class booklet.  My tutor has been told that if I don’t sort the problem then my story can’t be included.  I’m just going to email them, give them the details again and tell them that if there are any further problems it’s at their end and nothing to do with me.
Speaking of which, it’s the last class on Monday.  Normally we all bring in food and sit and eat and chat, but this time we’re going to the pub we went to after the graveyard visit.  So, it’ll be like normal, only with booze.  Yay!
Not sleeping well at the moment.  Dunno why, this has been going on for a while (with completely sleepless nights being a weekly thing at one point).  Ach well, I’ll survive.
Ooh, just remembered.  Need to get the book finished by December.  the place I’m doing the signs thing with is having a meet the agents event then so, need to be ready for that.
Apart from all that, not much is happening.  What about you guys?

Annoyingly, one of the folk in my creative writing class got some feedback on her story.  Me?  Stock letter.  Sorry you were unsuccessful, more entries than ever, try again next year, no predicting what the judges will like, don’t give up, if you want to pay for feedback, try this place.
They were nice enough to let me know about a writing competition and a short story magazine for women.  Which is nice.  Really makes me feel special that they let me know about things I can’t submit to.
They also let me know about a crime novel competition, with a £1000 prize and a chance to get published.  Which does kind of interest me.  I’m pretty sure I can get the book finished in time, but there is a £20 entry fee.  Which, even if I could afford it, would mean finding someone with a chequebook who’d be willing to write the cheque for me or would actually cost me £22.
So, I’ll just keep on keeping on, I suppose.
Got a few other competitions I’m planning to enter and also planning, at some point (more than likely Sunday) to review everything I’ve written and edit it.
Oh, speaking of my creative writing class, would you like to meet some of them?

Last night was fun.  Met up with my friend Nikki for a couple while watching Andy Murray, then headed to the tweetup.  Where we ate food and got drunk (as usual).  I think I may have put forward my terrorist in drinking water idea…
We then went to a pop up gallery to have a look.  Unfortunately, I didn’t get to see much, cos Nikki had the idea (based on others drinking) that we should head to the shop to get beers.  I needed to go as she was worried about being ID’d.  By the time we got back everyone else was standing outside, so we all (well, nearly all) had a can there.  (I think it’s on all week, so I’ll probably go tomorrow.)  We then went to a burlesque night (second Friday in a row I’ve ended up somewhere I originally said I wasn’t going to) and, of course, as soon as the show actually started we buggered off to the barbeque/smoking area.
Then I went somewhere else for a quick pint with Nikki then home.
Got up early today and headed to Stockton for the Doctor Who day.  Sadly, I got there too late to see the fan made film they were showing, but I did get quite a few photos, my incense cones and a Sylvester McCoy Doctor Who opening titles badge.  The shop is also having a screening of the two Pter Cushing Doctor Who films, so hopefully i’ll be able to go to that.  I really want to see them, but they’re hard to find to download.
Decided to go to one of my favourite pubs in Stockton for a pint and on the way there I passed a shop called Books for Free.  Which it is.  Not the greatest selection in the world, but did manage to get a new copy of one of my favourite Mark Billingham novels.  Next time I go out to Stockton (which’ll probably be on Thursday to get more incense), I’m going to donate some spare books I have.
Pics!

Even Daleks agree that bow ties are cool.

These two Daleks moved and talked.  Leading to a funny situation.  A member of staff was saying that they had not expected as many people to turn up as had and the black Dalek siad “That is an understatement!”  They then carried out a conversation untill being asked to shut up so that the staff member could continue.  The black Dalek then said “I obey!”

The TARDIS they had there.  They also had someone dressed as the 11th doctor and the Raggedy Doctor.

There were enough people there to stop it moving…

Just because I had to quote this…
Cyberman: Our species are similar, though your design is inelegant.
Dalek Thay: Daleks have no concept of elegance!
Cyberman: This is obvious. But consider, our technologies are 
compatible. Cybermen plus Daleks; together, we could upgrade the universe.
Dalek Thay: You propose an alliance?
Cyberman: This is correct.
Dalek Thay: Request denied!
Cyberman: Hostile elements will be deleted. [they shoot at the Dalek, but it is unaffected]
Dalek Thay: Exterminate! [exterminates both Cybermen]
Cyber Leader: [to another Cybermen] Open visual link!
Cyber Leader: Daleks, be warned. You have declared war upon the Cybermen.
Dalek Sec: This is not war. This is pest control!
Cyber Leader: We have five million Cybermen. How many are you?
Dalek Sec: Four.
Cyber Leader: You would destroy the Cybermen with four Daleks?
Dalek Sec: We would destroy the Cybermen with one Dalek! You are superior in only one respect.
Cyber Leader: What is that?
Dalek Sec: You are better at dying. 

Convinced some nice person to take this for me.

Tonight, I’m heading out wioth a friend who’s back in town for the weekend.  Tomorrow, got a bit of writing to do (but not much) and just generally chilling and Monday I have signing on, class and starting to stress as I should be hearing this week if I’m getting money/mentoring help for New Writers North.  Fingers crossed.

Well, kinda.
In Middlesbrough, there are these signs telling you where things are.  Problem is, they’re kinda unnoticable, so much so that I only realised today that I walk past one every day (I may post a pic of one of them), and horribly out of date.
So, the council have decided to get new ones.  Inbetween, Writers Block North East hyave been given permission to turn them into works of art.
This, to me, sounded interesting, so I went to the workshop yesterday.  Which was fun.  We went to have a look at one of the signs and then did some writing exercises to get us warmed up.  Then we got to designing.  We’re not allowed to use swearwords, or anything that resembles actual road signs (though we are, as I discovered when I put forward my sci-fi places idea, allowed to direct people to fictional places) but, apart from that, anything goes.
This was the fun bit.  Creating these things that might actually (depending on the council agreeing to them) be appearing all over town.
Everyone was shown everyone else’s and then we left.  I have been told that I can email them stuff (so I’m going to go through my ODathon stuff from last year) and when they are printed and ready to go, we’ll be going around town putting them up.  I will be takihng pictures of the ones based on my stuff.
I think it’s cool.  Shame they can’t be permanent, but still a fun way to make use of something and hopefully remind people that the signs are there before they become proper signs again.
I’ve actually been quite busy this week.  I had my writing class on Monday, the Tory Boy film on Tuesday, this thing last night, tonight nothing, Boro Tweet Up tomorrow night and on Saturday I’m going to a shop, wonderfully named Who-Ray, for their first birthday Doctor Who celebration with Graeme Harper and some Daleks (amongst others).  There’s something wrong, I’m never usually this sociable.
Incidentally, Who-Ray, for some strange reason, sells insence cones.  So I’ll pick some of them up, alongalong with a pack of the chocolate scented sticks they have.
I’ll stop boring you now.
Will
*EDIT*
Here’s one of the signs in question (actually, the one I pass every day).  The new ones are going to be red, but inbetween, we’re going to have a little fun…

The Tory candidate for Middlesbrough in last years General Election is a documentary film maker.  Turns out, he made a film about the election, called Tory Boy: The Movie.
He had a free screening, followed by a Q&A, last night.  I decided to go along.
Part of the film was about the hustings I attended that Stuart Bell missed out on.
I got a bit of a shock when, during a montage sequence, about 2 seconds of me asking my question was shown.  Particuarly as I had no idea they were filming the hustings.
As for the film itself?
Meh.
We were promised that there was something in the film that may lead to a by-election.  All we really got was the same old, same old about Bell (he’s never here, doesn’t hold surgeries, no-one knows what he looks like…).  The ‘smoking gun’ turned out to be a rehash of the ‘Postergate’ incident (a Labour poster was stuck on the window of another candidate and Bell is supposedly shown walking past).
There’s just something off about the film.  At times, it seems more like Walsh is not actually a big fan of the party he is representing and a lot of the comments about the other party leaders seem to be simply rehashing things others have said.  I have read that the whole project was planned as an expose of the Tory party and that seems to fit the narriative better than the ‘disillusioned Labour supporter switches sides’ argument put forward.
All in all, it’s an entertaining film, but not very enlightening, with some bits appearing to be mean for the sake of being mean.

Written for Year of Creativity
Prompt: Halfway between the darkness and the light.
Halfway between the darkness and the light.  This phrase is used by some people to describe midwinter, as it’s the shortest day of the year, the point when it only gets lighter.  But, if you think about it, the term should be used to describe either equinox, when it’s equal day and night.
I’m not using the phrase to describe either though.  It pretty much describes me.  I really don’t know what’s going on with me at the moment.  Some days, I’m happy and carefree.  The life and soul of the party, if I were ever invited to any.
Which I’m not.  And I get it, I get why.  There’s no predicting my mood, which kind of drunk I’m going to be.  More often than not, I end up morose, slumped in the corner nursing my drink, refusing to talk to anyone, scaring my friends.
Sorry about the noises you might here as I’m narrating this.  It’s going to serve as my note and I have to be prepared.  I can’t continue with this, I really can’t.  It’s far, far too draining on me personally.  I’ve decided I need to end it.  Then, I decided, if I’m going out, why not make an impact?  I’ve picked my spot and my time.  I’ll take a dozen or so people with me

Title: The Second Coming
Author: John Niven
Genre: Humour
376 pages
You ever look at things that are going on in the world and wonder where God has gotten to?  Well, turns out that he was on holiday.  He was only gone for a week but, time being a relative thing; He was gone from the height of the Renaissance in Earth time.
When He returns He is not too happy about the way things are down here.  Genocide, famine and, worse of all, Christians all over the place.  Turns out that God doesn’t much like Christians.  He decides He needs to do something about this.  Rather than wiping out mankind and starting again, He chooses to send His son back to us.
And thus, Jesus returns.  A musician living in New York with a ragtag bunch of other musicians, reformed junkies and alcoholics, Jesus is persuaded to enter American Pop Star, the biggest show in the States.  When he meets the creator of that show, Jesus realises that he may have his work cut out for him
This is not a book to be read in public.  Not because it is embarrassing, but because of the looks you may get when you burst out laughing.  The humour is razor sharp and sometimes dark, but it never gets in the way of the overall narrative, which essentially boils down God’s message to two words: Be Nice.  (The rest of the Commandments were added by Moses, annoyed that he was sent up a mountain for two words.)
Niven is a bit heavy handed at times in pointing things out.  However, some things are nicely observed and some of the punishments in Hell are quite imaginative.  No doubt some Christians will be less than pleased with some of the ideas put forward and will no doubt complain about the “attack” on their beliefs.  Which is a shame, because if they got past this prejudice and actually read the book, they’d see it’s only certain aspects of their religion that Niven has issues with.  Another thing this book is not is an attack on Christianity.  It’s more of a meditation (albeit a humorous one) and a book with some good ideas stuck in with the insults to Budweiser and Carling.

I’ve always wanted to do a bungee jump.  Which is a bit strange, considering I’m shit scared of heights.
Anyhoo, turns out that the Transporter Bridge, right here in town, is the only place in Britain you can do a bridge jump.  I decided that if I was going to do something like this, I may as well raise money for charity as well.  So, I found someone that was organising a charity jump and contacted them for more info.
Turns out that in order to do the jump, I’ll need to pay a £60 non-refundable deposit by the end of the month.  There’s no way I’ll manage that.
Bugger.
Ah well, maybe next time.
Apart from that, not much news.  Not been sleeping too well recently for some reason.  Meh, it happens.  I’ve also been watching a lot of films, from films I hadn’t seen in a while and fell in love with again (The Crow, Magnolia) to filoms I’ve never seen before (Catfish).
The Crime Fact Vs Crime Fiction thing on Monday wasn’t quite what I had expected, but it was still well worth the fiver I spent going along.  Fun, informative and I got me a forensics bodysuit!
Tuesday I went to the launch of a book of poems, art and prose about Temenos, which was done to celebrate it’s first birthday.  Now, I’ve seen it up close and think what I thought when I saw the designs, when I saw pictures and when I saw it from a distance.  It is completely and utterly ridiculous looking.  (I’ll post pics later.)  But one of the folk from my creative writing class has a poem in the book, was reading it out at the event, it was free and what the fuck else was I supposed to do at that time?  So I went along.  And was thoroughly entertained.  There’s another launch a week on Friday and I’m going to that one.  It’s longer, but there will be the ability to buy beer :¬).
I’m also planning to take part in a demonstration.  Well, a counter demonstration.  The EDL (for non Brits who may not know, the EDL are the English Defense League a group of “patriots” who are aligned with football hooligans and the BNP) are holding a demonstration in Boro in July and a bunch of us are planning to counter them.  I will say this about the organisers from the EDL, they aren’t exactly bright.  They had to change their promotional video and facebook page because they had spelt Middlesbrough wrong!
I’ve heard about what has happened at other EDL marches and demo’s.  There are those who say we should just let them carry on, but I don’t think so.  They have the right to do this, no doubt about that and I wouldn’t take any steps to stop them, but we have the right to let people know that the EDL views are not the views of the majority of Boro.
I’ll stop ranting now, before I end up in a lengthy bit about assisted death (though I may write that one as a seperate entry.  Don’t forget you have till Saturday to ask me questions about absolutely anything you want.  I have something special to answer them and it’s not really worth it for the two I have so far.

Not much to report here.  Same old, same old.
Creative writing is going well.  I have to write a 2,500 word story about midsummer for this terms booklet.  I was completely stuck, but have decided to do something a bit… well, a big strange.  No idea if it’ll work, fingers crossed.
I’m actually going to miss class this week.  It’s Middlesbrough Literary Festival at the moment (missing a sci-fi event at the moment cos I’m skint) and on Monday there is to be a crime writing panel involving crime writers and forensics lecturers about the differences between the fiction and the reality of these things.  So, I’m heading to that instead.

(As you can see, Middlesbrough Central Library takes a very dim view on theft…)
Definately going to class the following week though.  We’re going on a trip to a graveyard and, well, it’s a fucking trip to a graveyard!
Apart from that things are as normal.  Still job hunting.  Job centre still being useless.  Still arguing with Talk Mobile.  Thought I had that sorted but, not so much.
I have nothing to do tomorrow (during the summer, the library is shut on a Sunday) so may get cracking on the midsummer thing.  Oh, and write my reviews for the next TTZ, seeing as how the deadline is coming up.
Y’know what?  Screw it.  I’m open for questions on anything at all.  Just make it nothing that’ll have to be explained using videos or pictures.  You’ll understand why.
Answers will be posted a week on Monday, so you have till next Saturday at the latest.

That describes my night last night.  I was sat at home, having just eaten a parmo and watching The West Wing when a friend texted and asked if I wanted to meet up for a drink.
Seeing as it was between that or watching more West Wing and eating Pear Drops, I met up with him.  We had a pint and chatted about football, TV and other assorted bollocks then went somewhere else.  Where we met up with another friend and some of his friends.
And we had a laugh.  A phone wass being passed round to people who were talking with different accents (all while pretending to be the same person), I told one of my friends about the Mailwatch forums (basically a whole forum dedicated to taking the piss out of the Daily Mail) and chatted to a very cute girl about tattoos and the amount that Scots and Irish can drink.
Then I went home, watched more West Wing and ate Pear Drops.
Didn’t make the shortlist for the Alkibi thing, which isn’t much of a surprise.  (Should stop entering that, no idea how to write a short crime story.)  The other thing, turns out I won’t hear from them till the begining of next month.  So, still stressed about that.
Finally got my Twitter t-shirt today, just in time to wear it for the Boro tweet up tomorrow.  I’ve been waiting about a month and a half for it.
And I think that’s about it.  Need to get in touch with my friend, see if I’m invited round on Saturday for Doctor Who (I really hope the answer is yes).

Went into a bookshop yesterday.  Only meant to browse, but ended up buying three books.  And they only cost me a fiver!  One is a Stuart MacBride book that I read when back home for Christmas but did not have, one is a book about spree killers (even if it insists it’s actually about mass murderers) and one is about familicide.
I guess I’m now addressing those of you not freaked out by my strange obsessions.
Getting kinda frustrated.  One: I have an incense tower.  Using this, I can burn four incense sticks and an incense cone simultaniously.  I’m running out of sticks, but they can be easily replaced.
The cones, however, are proving to be somewhat of a fucking nightmare.  I’ve only found one place that sells them in Boro.  They cost £3, come with a burner I don’t need and are jumbled up so I have no idea what kind of cones I am getting.  Nor do I know exactly how many I’m getting (though it looks to be about 20).  They are wrapped in a lavender netting type fabric as well, so would need somewhere to store them.  (ooh!  Just thought, excellent use for my old baccy tin.)
In addition, I decided today to look into getting a new mancala set.  Holy shit, didn’t quite realise how fucking expensive they are online!  Cheapest I’ve seen is about £7 for a folding set similat to the ones I’ve seen in shops (though not recently, sadly) for £1.  Looks like I’ll have to wait.
Good weekend coming up though.  Go home after getting kicked out of here, watch videos then a friends leaving do.  Tomorrow I’m going round to a friends to drink beer and watch Doctor Who (seriously, how fucking good has this series been?) and Man U get humiliated in the Champions League final.  Sunday, can’t come online except on my phoen as the library will be shut so will rpobably stay at my friends and watch the Monaco GP.  Monday, again no online except on my phone so it’ll either be a film or Adam Curtis documentary day.  Or I might get some writing done.
5 days till the shortlist for the Alibi New Crime Writers Awards are announced.
And that’s about all for now.  If you could see your way clear to not updating much on Sunday and Monday, I’d appreciate it :¬p

Happy Towel Day!  And happy Wear the Lilac Day!  And happy Geek Pride Day!
I realised that, apart from Talk Mobile shenanigans, I haven’t really given you a general update in ages.
Mind you, that’s because I haven’t really been up to much.
My creative writing class has started again.  There’s a few newbies (a couple new to the course, a couple who did the now definct morning class and changed over) and I actually have smoking buddies now.  Which is cool.
I’m still getting nagged by my tutor to add more description to my stuff.  Not sure how long that’ll continue since the last homework I handed in was a very graphic description of a crime scene.
Sadly, I didn’t make it class this week.  I couldn’t sleep on Sunday night and when I left the house on Monday to sign on, I felt rough.  My lags were like jelly, my head was pounding and I was struggling to stop myself throwing up.  I did hope the walk to the job centre would help me shake it off, but no luck.  Thankfully it seemed to be just a 24 hour thing.
On Tuesday, I had to go to hospital for more x-rays on my collarbone.  It’s healing fine and, because I don’t have any pain and can move my arm freely, I don’t have to go back about the problem.  Yay!
The next 2-3 weeks are going to be big for me.  First off, I should find out about the crime writing competition I entered.  I basically know I have no chance, seeing as how I literally finished the first draft of the story on the day I had to submit it, but still.  Then I find out about the New Writers North award I entered.  Hopefully that’ll come with money and mentoring to get my book finished.  Fingers crossed.
Have to look back a few entries to see what competitions I mentioned there and see what’s happening with them.  Thank FSM quite a few shops round here have 2 litre bottles of Dr Pepper on sale for a quid, may need quite a few of them.
Thinking of doing a video entry cos I haven’t done one of them in a while.  Quite a while actually.  I’ll see.
And I’ll stop boring you now.

I got a response from Talk Mobile.  Which, I suppose, is something.  It quotes the terms and conditions to me to answer why my account had been closed (despite me saying I didn’t need to know that), failed to answer any of my questions, prefering instead to go with a blanket ‘We did try and contact you’ and then explained that in able to get my PAC code (used for taking your phone number from one company to another) I would need to, amongst other things, give them £200 which would be returned as soon as it had been used.
Here is my reply:
Dear Ms McEwan,
Well, congratulations.  You have kept up Talk Mobiles fantastic, astounding streak of not actually answering the questions I want answered, replacing that difficult task (I’ve worked in a call centre, so I know how terribly complicated the entire procedure is) with the much easier task of answering the ones that I don’t want answered.
I’m pretty sure I explicitly stated that I don’t want, or need to be, told why my account was closed.  Let me just double check.  Ah, yes, here it is:
I don’t want to hear exactly why my account was closed, I’ve already been told that (though, going on what I’ve written about above, I’m not entirely sure I can believe it).
However, thank you for the information.  Perchance you were hoping that it would cause my eyes to glaze over and I’d give up?  Sorry, not that simple.
Oh, wait, my apologies, you did answer my question about the PAC code.  Thank you for that.  I have to ask, though.  A £200 deposit?  What’s that for?  Can you justify asking for such a high amount?  Is Talk Mobile concerned that I’m going to sell the code on Ebay and try and make a few quid from it?
So, here it is again: why did I recieve absolutely no warning that my account was in danger of being cancelled?  Why were there no phone calls?  You may well keep arguing that you did try and phone me, but unfortunately, if someone says that have sent something and the reciever states catagorically that they did not recieve it (as is the case here) the onus is on the person sending it.  I know you have the phone number in question, it was linked to my accont (strange how that works).  And I recieved no phone calls, no voicemail messages.  I told you about the size of the missed call/voicemail message icon that would have appeared on my phone, so it’s not possible I wouldn’t have known.
Same for emails.  And again, I ask this: why did I recieve no emails untill a week after my accont had been closed?  Why, when I phoned to ask about this, was I informed that any such email had been sent to an account that I did not know had existed and which I suspect still doesn’t?  In your reply to me, you completely ignore that part altogether.
I’ll give you a hint about the idea behind customer service: what you are supposed to do is actually answer the questions that the customer is asking you to answer.  Not answer ones that they have told you they don’t need answering and hide the rest in a very thinly veilled suggestion that the customer is lieing to cover something.  Seeing as you guys seem to have little to no idea what customer service entails, I thought I could help you out.
The clock is reset.  You have another week before I go to the CEO (with all email communication between us attached).
Yours sincerely,
William Forbes

One brand of baccy I buy (not my favourite, but the cheapest) gives you a free pack of skins.  These skins used to have quotes and stuff like that on them, but now they have games.  There’s a football one and a golf one, neither of which I’ve ever played, due to part of the game beeing to scrunch skins into a ball and flick them.  Erm, thanks, but I have better uses for my cigarette skins).
And one was this.  Actually, two were, so I gave the other one to a friend.  The idea is that you press down on the back and they jump along.  It does work, but for this reason, I think it would be better as a frog.

This may explain why not:
Dear Sir/Madam,
So, here we are.  Back to me arguing with Talk Mobile customer service.  Sorry, “customer service” as what I’ve received can barely qualify for that description.
Here’s the story: on Friday 6th May, I received an email from a friend.  Said friend had been trying to phone ma and wondered what was wrong with my phone.  Did I have it switched off?  As I only ever switch my phone off in a cinema, the answer to that was a resounding no.  I checked my phone and saw it had limited service, in an area where I usually got a strong signal.
I checked my account online and discovered that it had been closed.  Which came as a bit of a shock to me, as I had no warning about this.  I tried emailing and left it the four working days recommended for a response.  Nothing.  So I phoned up and was told a quite unbelievable story.
Seems that you did try to phone me and left a voicemail message.  Now, I’m not entirely sure how I missed that one.  You see, when there is a voicemail message left for me, there’s a huge icon that appears on my phone telling me this and giving me the potion to call voicemail and retrieve the message.  Another part of this also tells me I have a missed call and gives me the option of phoning back.  Seriously, its massive.  Takes up most of the screen, it’s just about impossible to do anything else while it’s there.  So, where did this mysterious voicemail message go to, exactly?
I do know where the email you sent me went to.  Apparently, it would not have been sent to the email address you have for me, the one that I’m using here, but to a different email account that Talk Mobile had set up for me when I became a customer.  Now, we’ll put aside the fact that that had not been my experience to date.  I’m just wondering, how exactly do I log into this email account you were kind enough to provide for me yet did not tell me about?
I know that you can send emails to my normal account because the following day I got an email from Talk Mobile informing me that my account was in danger of being cancelled.  Oops.  You think that may have been sent just a tad too late?
I know you have my postal address as well, because just today I got a letter from Talk Mobile.  It was concerning you closing my account.  Sorry.  My bad.  It started with Talk Mobile regretting to see from their records that I had closed the account.  Which, of course, I didn’t.  Though, at the moment, I deeply regret ever opening an account with Talk Mobile and will be recommending to all and sundry that they don’t even bother.
Onto what I want.  I don’t want to hear exactly why my account was closed, I’ve already been told that (though, going on what I’ve written about above, I’m not entirely sure I can believe it).  All I want to know is why I wasn’t warned that my account was in danger of being closed before it happened.  I don’t want to hear about disappearing voicemail messages or unexplained email accounts that may or may not exist.  All I want is the truth.  Hopefully you will actually be able to provide that this time.
I’ll be kind.  Seeing as my last email to Talk Mobile concerning this went completely and utterly unanswered, I’ll give you one week.  Till the 25th.  If I don’t have a satisfactory response by that time, I will take this up with your CEO.  Check your records.  You will discover that I have absolutely no conscience or shame when it comes to doing something like that.
Oh, and I would also like my PAC code.  I took that number to Talk Mobile and now I’d like to take it with me.  It’s been my number for years and I have no patience with learning a new one.  It’s the number on my CV, that I’ve put on job applications and on stories I have submitted for publication so it’s kind of important I keep it.  It’s the number the job centre has for me.  If I miss a call from them, especially if it concerns an appointment, I could lose my benefits.  If I lose the appeal in that case, you’d better believe that I’ll be coming after you.  Not for answers, but for money.
Yours faithfully,
William Forbes

Title: The Lock Artist
Author: Steve Hamilton
Genre: Crime
304 pages
Michael is the Lock Artist.  He has the skill to get into almost any lock or safe imaginable.  He’s also a good guy to have on your team because if he gets picked up by the cops, it’s not like he’ll tell them your name.  Or anything else, come to that.
You see, a traumatic incident in his childhood has left Michael unable to speak.  This gave him his first nickname, the Miracle Boy.  If he needs to communicate he uses sign language, notes or pictures.  And now he has to do what is needed to save the girl he loves.
Hamilton has given us an enthralling and gripping book.  The story alternates between two different periods in Michael’s history, both being the ones that are central to the overall story (that being why he ended up in jail and why he did what he did).  Thankfully, like The Time Travellers Wife before it, each chapter starts by telling you when and where that chapter takes place.  Without this, it would have been easy to get lost.
Michael himself is a singular character.  I’ve never seen anyone like him before in literature.  Despite the inability to speak, he has a fair amount to actually say.  The art is a nice touch and leads to more than one tender moment between him and Amelia, the object of his affections.
You do find out what happened to him to make him stop speaking and it is equal parts brutal and heartbreaking.  I was fine with this, but the strength of the story is such that it could have been left to the readers imagination and the book would still have worked.
The pacing in the book is brilliant with virtually nothing there that isn’t strictly necessary.  Be warned, this is not a book to be read in short bursts, but rather one you will not want to put down.

Those of you who live in Britain will know that this week sees the referendum on changing the political system in the UK.  This is only the second national referendum in our history though, the first one being before I was born.  Strangely however, it’s also the second referendum I’ve taken part in.
This one is to decide if First Past the Post or Alternative Vote will be used for future elections.
A quick breakdown of both systems:
First Past the Post or FPTP is the system used just now.  Each person votes for one candidate standing in their constituency.  Once voting is over, the votes are counted and the person with the most votes wins.
Alternative Vote or AV is the possible replacement.  Under this system, you rank the candidates in order of preference.  You do not need to rank them all and you can vote for just one person.  After the first round of counting, if no candidate has more than 50% of the vote, the person with the least votes is eliminated and their second preferences are shared out.  This process continues till we have a winner.
Now, the No to AV campaign has decided that the best way to make their point is by using sports analogies.  Cos, everyone understands them.  Well, except for the No to AV campaign themselves…
Here is an example (pic yoinked from Sexton Merryweather):

And here’s the televisual equivalent:
Semms simple enough.  The person who wins may not be the winner.  Right?
Until a winner has been announced, THERE IS NO WINNER!
What No to AV are doing is transposing the way that FPTP works onto the AV model.  The argument is that the person who is in the lead after the first round of counting may not win.
Which is true.  Just ask David Cameron and Ed Milliband*.
But whoever is in the lead after the first round of counting, unless they actually get over 50%.  The winner would be announced after all the rounds of counting necessary.
No to AV like their sports metaphors, so here’s an obvious one: Had the English Premiership been decided after each team had played one game, the English teams in the Champions League this season would be:
Chelsea (automatically through to the league stage).
Blackpool (automatically through to the league stage),
Aston Villa (through to qualifiers) and
Manchester United (through to qualifiers)
Blackburn Rovers would be in the Europa League.
And that’s why all sports leagues don’t decide things that way.  The FA Cup is FPTP.  The Premiership, which is to try and decide the best team in the country, makes each team play each other twice to make sure the decision is the right one**.  Only after that has happened are the winners announced.

Not after the first week.
Will
*Both the Tories and Labour use AV for their leadership contests.  If they used FTPT, David Davies and David Milliband would have won the election.
**Your mileage may vary on whether or not this is accurate.
*EDIT*
I’ve just had it pointed out to me that the Tories use Exhaustive Ballot, not AV, for their leadership elections.  Which is a good point.  Course, the difference is that under EB, if no-one gets over the amount needed in the first vote, the person with the least votes is eliminated and the vote is taken again.  The difference?  AV you don’t need to vote again.
Oh, and you can change who you vote for in each round.

So, I’ve got a contact for the police part of the research for my crime novel.  Which is good.  (It’s not actually anyone in Cleveland Police though, interestingly enough.)  She’s read the synopsis and already flagged up one problem I genuinely hadn’t actually thought of.  I’m emailing her a list of questions later.
I’ve also submitted the first 3000 words of the novel for the New Writers North Northern Promise award.  They offer support and possible financial help.  I know they got my submission in time, so I will hear if they are going to help me at the begining of July.  So, it’s time to cross those fingers and pray to the deity of your choice.
Also, if I am sucessful with this, I have to attend two launch nights in Newcastle and one in London, where, as far as I can remember, I will be reading.  So, not so much with the looking forward to that.  I hate reading stuff out on front of a large crowd.  Might have to see if I can get some friendly faces for those ones.
I’m also entering a competition that I entered last year and just found out about two weeks ago.  I was thinking of leaving it, but I came up with what I thought was a really strong idea for it, so I’m hoping to get that finished today, edited tomorrow so I can submit it before the deadline midday Sunday.
There’s also a competition being run in a local newspaper for a story about an iconic person, place or building.  After asking some friends for their ideas about where I should write about, I have a couple of good ideas for that one.  I have to admit though, seeing as the winner gets and iPad and the runner up will win either vouchers or a cash prize, not sure I actually want to win.  Depends on where the vouchers are for, I suppose.
And there is the one I found on facebook today.  It’s for something called Machine of Death and the starting point for all the stories is that there is a machine that can tell you how you’re going to die by testing your blood.  You know I love the idea of that.  If accepted, I’ll get $200, which is cool but not as much as actually getting published.  I’m starting to form ideas for that one but have some time before it has to go in.
So, between all that, Year of Creativity, my creative writing class and my stuff for The Terrible Zodin I’m writing a lot at the moment (but possibly not as much as I should be).  I’ve decided it’s time to stop pissing about and actually get proactive about my writing.
Wish me luck.
Will
*EDIT*
Just found out that the newspaper that’s going to be printing parts of one of my book reviews is going to start printing short stories on a Saturday.  Great thing is because it’s an ongoing thing, there’s no deadline.  Bad news is that I’ll have to watch the language.
Thing is, I’m not sure if I should email and ask if I can submit more than one story at a time or if I should wait to hear about one story and then submit another.
Fuck it.  I have something else I need to ask them anyway, so I’ll ask now.

*EDIT*
Cos dumbarse here forgot to answer a question…
Right, let’s get this done.
little_chloella  and *Moonglow* both wanted to know the same thing:
doctor who and ?
Treme.  The second season started in the States on Sunday and I have now seen it.  every bit as good as the first.  And the music still kicks ass.
pierced_poet had a few as well:
If you could live in one TV universe which one would it be and why?
The firefly universe.  I’d love to explore and visit all the planets.
Worst TV series ever?
Oh, God.  There have been quite a few that have absolutely sucked.  Just for sheer pointlessness and tedium, Lost.
If you had to (on pain of death) pick only one TV series to watch for the rest of your life, which one would it be?!
Easy.  Doctor Who.  Not just because I love the show, but because it’s been going for so fucking long, it’d take a while before I got bored.
Rodge chipped in with a couple:
What sort of tv do you do most of your watching on?
My 15.6 inch laptop screen.  I don’t actually own a TV, so if there’s anything I’m desperate to watch when it’s broadcast, I’ll go round to a friends house (as I did with Doctor Who on Saturday and will be doing next week as well).
An oldie but a goodie – what happened to Tony Soprano?
I have absolutely no interest in what happend to any of the characters on one of the most absurdly overhyped and overpraised shows in my lifetime.
Now it’s the turn of Bitter__angel:
Also, did you catch the premiere of ‘game of thrones’? 
Yup.  Have now watched the first two episodes, and really, really enjoying it.  Also, the opening titles are one of the best designed title sequences (for TV) I’ve seen in quite a long time.
what do you think happens to Tamara in caprice after being abandoned in V world??
I assume you meant Caprica?  Not sure, cos I’ve still to watch the second half of the series.  (I will get round to it sometime, I promise.)
Steven the Rill enquired:
How many episodes of a new show do you watch before you know whether or not you like it?
Honestly?  I tend to give it 5-7.  Why?  Because there are a lot of shows where, had I judged based on episode one, I would have stopped watching.  But turned out awesome.  (The Wire and Treme are good examples).
And finally, Schwulerin had a few:
I remember on an old episode of the “Young Ones” Rik said something about a TV tax. Do you know what was he talking about?
Yup.  That would be the TV license.  Over here, if you watch or record television programmes as they’re being shown on TV you have to pay for a TV license which costs £145 (for a colour license, for a black and white license it’s £49.)  You can get a discount if you are regestered blind or severely sight impared and if you are over 75, it’s free.  This money funds the BBC, which is why they have no commercials (except for their own programmes and services) and why they are constantly kind of screwed.  If you ever hear about the BBC being state funded, this would be why.
It’s mandatory to have a TV license (unless you meet the criteria for being exempt [as I do]).  If you do not have a license and you are caught, you face a fine of up to £1000.  They use detector vans (I’m not making this up) to try and catch people out and are notorious for sending them out when they expect a lot of people to be watching TV (like this coming Friday, for example).  (Rather hilariously, when I was in halls of residence, they actually warned the university when they would be checking.  We got plenty of notice to hide our tellies that week.)
Do you guys have subscriber service channels like HBO or Cinemax?
The best way to answer this one, in all honesty, is to simnply explain how TV is set up over here.
The basic level is terrestrial TV.  In the old days, this was BBC1, BBC2, ITV, Channel 4 and five.  Nowadays it also includes all digital services available through a set to digibox, or a TV with a built in digital tuner.  This is the level that you get as soon as you buy a TV and set it up.
Next, you have cable or satellite TV.  This is subscription and either means having a dish on the side of the house (if you are going through Sky) or is done using fiber optics (if it’s Virgin Media).  With this option, you get even more channels (including BBC channels for other countries in the UK).
You can add subsctiption channels to your cable/satellite subscription as well.  These are things like the Sky film channels and Sky Sports/ESPN.  Some of these are availabe if you are a terrestrial digital viewer for a monthly fee, if your box/TV has the facilities for it.
Finally, there is sports pay per view/films on demand which are a one off payment.  They tend to only be for cable/satellite viewers.
Everyone clear now?
Are there m/any foreign languages channels where you are?
There may be on Sky/Virgin Media, not really sure.
Someone once told me that European channels don’t interrupt shows with commercials. The ads are only played at the beginning and at the end. Is that true?
I’m not sure about other counrties, but not here in Britain.  I’m fairly certain that the law calls for at least 15 minutes worth of ads every hour (except the BBC, of course).  This has the effect of splitting shows up (half hour shows are halfed, hour long shows are quartered, etc) but there are exemptions.  Sporting events are one such exemption, though they can find ways round it (football matches on commercial TV generally have an ad break just before the match, just after half time, just before the start of the second half and straight after the match).  It also turns out that state occasions are completely exempt with ads being banned.  Which must have really pissed off ITV when they found out that their coverage of Friday must be commercial free.
When you were growing up, how many TVs did you have in your house?
Generally, just the one in the living room.  When my dad was home for the weekend, or when he was working close enough to live at home, we had his black and white TV in the dining room.
And that’s all.  I return you to my normal nonsense in my next entry.
Will

Title: Broken Silence
Author: Danielle Ramsay
Genre: Crime
388 pages
DI Jack Brady has been called back from sick leave early.  The murder he has to investigate is particularly upsetting and things aren’t helped by the mess the previous DI assigned to the case made of the scene.
This is the first novel by Danielle Ramsay and hopefully it won’t be the last.  Set in Whitley Bay, Ramsay makes no bones about what has happened to that particular place.  There is much talk about ‘regeneration’ for the town, the type that can be heard in towns and cities all over the country.  But Ramsay doesn’t shy away from pointing out that a lot of this talk is purely empty rhetoric, a soundbite to help local councillors (and mayors) become electable.
Brady is your typical cop in these things, slightly jaded and cynical.  I do query the use of a big trauma in both his personal and work life in the past.  One of these things on its own is, for me, an overused and slightly annoying cliché in crime fiction at this point and to have the main character go through both seems to be overkill.  I did like the dislike of career cops, the types who join the force straight out of university and have nothing more on their mind than promotion through the ranks at any cost even when, as is pointed out, it’s not always necessary.  The feeling of the old guard versus the young whippersnappers is a nice touch as well.
Of course, Jack has another reason for wanting this case to be solved quickly.  The DI who got kicked off the investigation also happens to be his best friend.  There are a lot of crime books that try and fail to make the case personal to the main character.  This is not one of those books.  Jacks attempt to solve the case and keep Jimmy out of things as much as possible is well done.
Slightly less well done is Jacks personal life.  Between the woman he slept with and can’t remember anything about, the woman he’s attracted to, his ex-wife and the woman he lost to his best friend, it does seem as if Ramsay is simply dumping things on him.  Which is a shame, because at times in the book, the whole thing is done quite well.  Dumping problems on people is something that Ramsay seems to like doing.  I do think she slightly overdid what happened to the victim in her life as well.
The pacing is excellent, keeping up a good tempo.  And the twist at the end, concerning the killer, is the good type of twist.  The type where all the pieces are there, it’s just putting them together.  Overall, I enjoyed this book and look forward to reading more from DI Brady.

I post a picture in here of me doing my best 11th Doctor impression, show how cool I look in a bow tie, and what do people concentrate on?
The bloody sling.
So, yes, at the moment I wear a sling.   I am slingle.
What happened?  Well, it turns out that if you fall over sideways and use your shoulder to break the fall, you will also break your collar bone.
I still maintain that it was an important medical experiment and in absolutely no way caused by me being a drunken idiot.
I’ve got a hospital appointment on the twelfth to get more x-rays done to assess things and, in the meantime, I have to keep wearing it.  Which I do, except when in my house (cos there’s no real need to there).  Which means I’ll be wearing it on the long train ride to London next weekend.
It also makes writing/typing hard (my last few entries have all been written with one hand) so, of course, the muses have decided this is the ideal time to visit me to work on my book.  Which is going great, excet I need to contact some people for fact checking and have no idea how to go about getting hold of the people I need.  And, of course, the pain writing causes.
On the upside, I’m going to have a cool lump on my shoulder for the rest of my life!
This week is kinda busy for me.  Tonight I have the second Boro tweet up, Sunday, phone my mum for Mothers Day followed by Wrestlemania and next Saturday, London for a meetup of writers/supporters of The Terrible Zodin.  I’ll likely have not much money, and I’m still not sure if I’ll be coming back on the red eye bus that night or the next day, but I’m looking forward to it.  Truth be told, I wouldn’t miss it.  And it’ll take the number of OD folk I’ve met in real life up to 6.
And that’s about it, I think.  Actually, wait, there is one other thing.
I’m going to be published in a newspaper!  Kinda.
New Writers North are gearing up for this years Regional Reads, celebrating literature from the North-East.  They put up an appeal on facebook to find people to read the books and so, loving getting books for nowt, I volunteered.  As the first person to respond, I got to choose from all the books and chose Broken Silence by Danielle Ramsey (which’ll also be the next book I review for Twelve in 12).  I have to send them a one page review by the 16th, and bits of said review (will probably be the positive stuff) will not only go on the Regional Reads website but also in local newspaper The Journal!
So, yeah.
Apopeal for help a couple of entries back, if you can do so.
And that really is all.
Will

Title: The Business of Dying
Author: Simon Kendrick
Genre: Crime
446 pages
This is the third of three books I will be reviewing for The Great Transworld Crime Caper
Meet Dennis Milne.  He’s a cop who sometimes crosses the line.
By being a hitman.
Unfortunately, his latest job goes somewhat wrong leaving him with people chasing him from both sides of his life, he’s going to have to work hard to stay in the land of the living.
I have to admit, out of the three books I’ve reviewed for this challenge, this is by far the best of the bunch.  Milne is a cracking character, though a bit cynical and jaded, he does still somewhat believe in justice and good and evil.  It’s how he justifies his sideline.  Which is why he freaks out when he thinks he’s been duped.
The more I read this book, the more I realised that Milne is simply Dexter Morgan, just slightly reversed.  This isn’t a problem as long as it’s done well and Kendrick does this very, very, very well indeed.
The book moves at a cracking pace and never seems to flag.  This is especially true in the last third when Milne is struggling to keep it together in the face of stunning revelations as well as tyring to stay at least one step ahead of his pursuers, whichever side of the law they happen to be on.  You’ll wonder how Milne can stop for breath and you certainly won’t be able to put it down.
Kendricks attention to detail is amazing and the whole thing is shot through with a kind of humour, even if, at times, it is bordering on pitch black.  There are a few twists, but they are the kind that take the characters by surprise as well as the reader which, if you are going to indulge in that kinda thing, is the way it should be.
I cannot, cannot, cannot recommend this book highly enough and I cannot, cannot, cannot wait to read more from Kendrick.
Will

Written for Year of Creativity
Prompt: It was a dark and stormy night

It was a dark and stormy night.  What a fucked up way to start a story.  Course it was fucking dark.  That’s kind of the definition of night.
Reminds me of the joke about the Irishman who declares he’s built a spaceship and is going to the Sun.  When the heat thing is pointed out he simply replies “We’ve thought about that.  That’s why we’re going at night!”
But it really was stormy.  The rain was pelting down heavily and the wind was unbelievable.  In short, only a complete fuckwit would be anywhere but inside, wrapped up warm.
Which, of course, would explain why I was wandering around outside.
It wasn’t my choice.  Really.  My idiot boss decided that he really, really needed pictures of what was happening, he really, really needed them taken of certain places and he really, really needed me to be the one taking them.
And you wonder why I’m convinved the cunt hates me.
I used the camera on my phone.  There was no way, absolutely no way, I was taking my ultra expensive gear out in that.  I strolled around (well, as much as I could considering I was getting blown around like I was a damn pinball ball) taking pictures left right and centre.
And what I saw surprised me.
I saw people who previously hated each other helping each other out.
I saw people in a van driving round rescuing those who were in most need.
I saw yuong and middle aged men team up to move a huge uprooted tree that was blocking the disabled occupant from leaving their house.
I saw the best of humanity and the worst of nature.
I’m still gonna kill my fucking boss though.

Title: The Surgeon
Author: Tess Gerritsen
Genre: Crime
416 pages
This is the second of three books I will be reviewing for The Great Transworld Crime Caper
Quick note before I start: I apologise in advance for any typos, I’m currently writing one handed.
Boston Mass.: there is a killer running around murderingb victims of rape and conducting surgery on them.  And for one doctor, it’s all just a little bit of history repeating…
Gerritsen has created a tight, powerfull crime thriller with this one.  The information about exactly what the killer does to his victims is gruesome, but not too much if you get queasy about these things.  There are a few clues about how the victims are chosen but it’s mostly following the cops as they piece everything together.
Gerreitsen is also a fully qualified doctor.  This shows not only in the medical explanations given by the cops but the scenes about complicated medical procedures.
The two main characters are Rizzoli and Moore.  Rizzoli is my favourite: whether at work or with her family, she is the only female and works hard to make her impact.  Moore is…
I’m just gonna come right out and say it now.  Can we please, please, for the love of the Flying Spaghetti Monster, STOP WITH THE BROKEN COPS THING IN THESE BOOKS?  It’s getting really, really annoying.  I can understand it when it’s the result of something from an earlier book.  I even understood it in the last book I reviewed for this, as it was the reasonfor the character being where he was and for trying to resist being sucked into his past life.  I know it can make for tension and drama and all that good stuff, but it is also getting really, really boring and cliched.
Another time worn crime genre cliche is the lead cop going too far and being removed from/shunted sideways on the case.  So why Gerritsen desides to do this to both the main characters I’ll never understand.
Despite these quibbles, I really enjoyed this book and look forward to reading more by Gerritsen.  Recommended.
Will

ACCESSORIES: Incudes earrings, bracelets, beads, baubiles, hand bags, and navel and clitoral piercings.
ACTIVE WINDOW: This term is used to discribe an open window, thus allowing the regular flow of fresh air to circulate round the office. 
BAUD RATE: The time it takes to nod off when the IT expert person is attempting to impart their wisom (which in my office usually involves being told why Buffy the Vampire Slayer would kick the shit out of Superman in a bare knuckle fight). 
BIOS: Fuck knows – something to do with chemical warfare?
BIT: You end up like this when you try and stroke a squirrel in Regents Park. Those little fuckers look cute but have got the mentality and voracity of a fucking rotweiler on PCP. 
BOOT: An item of footware or the act of kicking something very hard. 
BUG: A sort of insect. 
BYTE: To eat something, as in “to have a”. If you pig out in a Rick Waller kind of way, this is called a Megabyte.

CARD: Something you get your mum on mother’s day. 
CASCADING MENU: When you go to one of those dead fancy restaurants (the sort where they don?t have the list of food on the wall), they give you one of these. Takes a degree in geometry to figure out how to unfold the fucker; worse than tackling an AA road map. 
CLIENT: What prostitutes have, usually members of parliment, the clergy, or my Uncle Gino. 
CLONE: Never to be mentioned, as in “Attack of the”, a shameful, terrible period in everyone’s life that needs to be purged from the soul, possibly by means of exorcism.

FREEWARE: Items of clothing you steal or have given to you, such as hand-me-downs (doesn’t work too well when you’ve got an older sister, that one). Routing through bags left outside charity shops also technically counts as freeware (but if you find some grundies I recommend you wash the crusty gussetmarks out first before slipping them on). 
HARDWARE: What happens when you put too much starch in your wash, you need to pannel beat your pants with a hammer before you can put them on in the morning. 
ICON: Usually gay, like George Michael or that fella on that Dr Who spin off thing who’s always getting arrested in Cardiff for being pissed off his tits.

658,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/the-gospel-according-to-jesus-mate-dave-3930444/,2011-03-13,The Gospel according to Jesus’  mate Dave,"
Northumbria University scholars are preparing to rewrite the Bible by incorporating revelations contained in ancient scrolls discovered beside the South Shields Ferry jetty, it emerged yesterday. 
A team of theologians and historians will gather in Italy later this month to start the potentially explosive task of inserting new details about the life and times of Jesus Christ. 
The influence of radical Jewish groups who wanted to overthrow Roman rule is likely to feature in the new Bible, bolstering those who interpret Christ as a revolutionary who fought political oppression.
An account of the teenage years of Jesus has also been included in the Bible (2nd Edition). It is believed that this new Biblical book, the Gospel according to Jesus’ mate Dave, will detail the life of Jesus from age 13 to 19. Certain early miracles are alluded to such as Jesus turning the water into cheap strong dry cider and the miracle of the Removal of the Hangover.
We have read some of the early drafts of the manuscripts and can confirm that, if included, the texts promise to revamp the Bible and it’s image. We have acquired an exclusive copy of Chapters 3 and 4 of this new Gospel, which runs as follows;
Jesus’ mate Dave, Chapter 3, verse 1.
1. “And the 6th day did come to pass, and lo, being as it was a Friday, the Lord did decide to cane it most heavily. 
2.Yet we, his followers were doubtful. “Lord,” we said unto him “We have no sheckles with which to buy cider from the local emporium. How can it be that we can go on the lash this day? All avenues of cash are closed to us, insomuch as we have spent our pocket money on these new robes which mark us out as one of your gang.” 
3.And Jesus did grin as he spake unto us. “Fear not my friend Dave, for I have seen the way and I will provide for thee. After supper, let us all meet at the prearranged place. Let all of you bring unto me 3 amphorae of water.”
4.”And most of all my friends, let us ensure that we wear our trendiest threads for it is foretold that Mary Magdalene will be there this very eve. And most assuredly, I would love to give her one.” Thus spake the lord.
5. So it was that we, his friends, gathered at the place that we were commanded to go and each of us did carry with us 3 amphorae of water
6. For our parents, being suspicious that we would be getting pissed and causing trouble round town, had foresaken us from nicking the sherry from their drinks cabinets and so this eve we were above suspicion insomuch as we were carrying only water.
7. And we did meet with the Lord. And lo, Jesus’ mate Kev was full of wrath ere he arrived. “Lord, I will be a fucking laughing stock because of you!” called he. And we did observe how the water had spilled from his amphorae.
8. And lo, the Lord spake “Kev, you look just like you’ve pissed yourself”. And the lord did point and laugh, and being his friends, we did the same. So it came to pass that Kev stormed off in a huff whilst we did, in accordance with the lords command, call after him with names such as “Pissy Pants”.
9. So it was that we 11 found ourselves alone with the Lord in a back alley with amphorae of water numbering 1 score and 13. And the Lord’s mate Tommy spake thus;
10 “So what the fuck are we meant to do with 33 litres of water oh Lord? Indeed, I would have more chance of getting pissed in the temple of our Lord whose name I may not speak.”
11. The Lord did receive this most grievously phrased question in silence. At length he spake thus “Drink of thy amphorae Tommy, and tell me what thy chances of getting good and hammered are this very night.” And Tommy did take a mighty draft of his amphorae. And he did lower it from his lips in surprise and spake thus;
12 “Fuck me Lord! This stuff is the strongest cider I have yet tasted!” The Lord smiled at him and bade us follow the example provided by Tommy.
13. And there was much rejoicing.
14. And so it came to pass that after we had downed one amphorae each, we were three sheets to the wind with 2 amphorae remaining for each of us. And as we drank, the Lord (who seemed in quite a state) spake unto each of us
15. Saying “Drink of me, for this is my pish. Whenever you drink of this holy liquid, remember me and honour my name and that of my father”.
16. And lo, the Lord did find this exceedingly amusing insomuch as he kept breaking into fits of giggles as he spoke.
17. By this time a crowd had gathered near to us. Yea, it was comprised of women, blondes and brunettes both, betwixt the ages of 16 and 18. And they spake unto the Lord thus;
18. “Here, give us some of thy cider O Lord. For we have a great and grievous thirst and would be most grateful” And the Lord did say “Just how grateful would you be?” and did waggle his eybrows in a most conspiratorial manner.
19. And Mary Magdalene did push her way forward to the Lord. And she was wearing naught but a tight fitting low cut robe. She did say unto the Lord “How grateful would you like us to be?”. And she did wink in a most lewd manner.
20. And so the Lord did agree to give the women cider. And in exchange they did lay with us all night.
21. And there was much rejoicing.
Jesus’ mate Dave Chapter 4 Verse 1
1. And yea, it came to pass that after we had shot our lot within the good woman who shared the cider with us and after the aforementioned cider had ran dry, the ladies did take their leave from us.
2. Yet we were troubled, for the Lord was no-where to be seen.
3. And neither was Mary Magdalene.
4. And so it was that after a few minutes the Lord did emerge from a darkened doorway. And Mary Magdalene did follow him, and was seen to be wiping something sticky from the corner of her mouth.
5. And we did join the Lord in laughter, knowing well what had came to pass in the doorway. And Mary did eye us with contempt and spake thus unto us “Cease thy boyish laughter. If any of thou were half the man that the Lord is, then perhaps you too would know the joys of my flesh. Indeed, he is the only one whom I would do such things for and even then, I do so in the name of his cider.”
6. And the Lord did speak once more, saying “I suppose a shunt up your Cadbury’s alley is out of the question then?” And there was much laughter, though not from Mary Magdalene.
7. And she did raise her knee in a most violent and passionate manner.
8. And the Lord did crumple in a heap.
9. Once Mary Magdalene had gone from this place, we did help the Lord to his feet as his loyal friends and did escort him to his home having agreed that we should all meet the following morning at his place.
10. And so we all returned to the places from whence we had came so that we may sleep. And the morning did come, and lo, my head did feel as though a Roman legion did march throughout, banging their metal shields as they did go.
11. And there was much sorrow.
12. So it was that we all gathered in the house of the Lord’s mum and dad. And the Lord’s mum did laugh mightily upon seeing our sorry state, and did offer us all a cooked breakfast. And with much heaving of stomachs we did refuse to a man.
13. The Lord did emerge looking fresh and untroubled by our exertions of the previous night.And he spake thus;
14. “Whew! We really did cane it big time last night, eh lads? Lads? What’s up?”
15. For there was a weeping and a wailing and a gnashing of teeth from us, such was the depth of our hangover.
16. And the Lord did smile knowingly and did wave his hand in the air speaking thus;
17. “Abrakebabra! I cast out the demons of thy hangover in the name of my Father, of me, and of the Holy Ghost”
18. And lo, our heads did clear and our stomachs did cease their burbling.
19. And there was much rejoicing.

The Bible is based mostly on manuscripts written centuries after Christ lived, but the so-called Dead Sea scrolls, found at Qumran by shepherds in 1947, have been dated to the decades before and after his crucifixion. 
The 800 documents, written by the Essenes, a Jewish sect, date from 170 BC to AD 68, and chronicle the turbulence of the Roman occupation of Judea as well as the lives of the teenagers who lived there.
Gianluigi Boschi, a Dominican priest and Vatican biblical scholar, told yesterday’s La Stampa, a Turin daily newspaper, that an international commission of scholars had been given the green light to update the Bible by culling material from the scrolls. 
The initiative will be officially announced at a conference at the University of Northumbria on September 26 2006. The team is expected to include Etienne Nodet, author of The Origins of Christianity; Paolo Garuti, a biblical scholar; and Garcia Martinez, president of the international movement for Qumranic studies. 
Jolum Wristmeyer, a canon doctor at Oxford University, welcomed the initiative but suggested the results may be less than dramatic. “There has never been a settled, definitive version of the Bible, it has been an evolving book which has gone through many translations depending on what the Pope, or whoever happened to be in charge of any particular band of Godbotherers, wanted people to do. Only fundamentalists think it came in a fax from heaven. And frankly, anyone who tries to bring out a definitive version to end all arguments may as well try spanking their monkey in the Vatican Square?.

Just realised it’s been a while since I wrote a general life update type entry.  So, here it is.
Last week I had an apointment with someone at the job centre.  This is the appointment I was supposed to have after I finished with A4e, which just goes to show you how up to date the job centre here actually is (I finished with A4e at the begining of the year).
The person I spoke to was, to be blunt, a complete bitch.  She asked me, as I am looking for retail work, why I’m only applying for full time jobs.  Erm, cos if I don’t I’m no longer entitled to JSA and will lose my benefits?  May be a motivating factor.  I simply said cos I need full time work to cover rent and bills and still be able to survive.
She then asked me why I didn’t apply for a job at Poundland.  I pointed out that I had absolutely no idea that they were looking for anyone at the moment.  She had a go at me for the fact that I claimed to use the job centre website to look for work (this is the same website that thinks Bristol is in the local area for Middlesbrough BTW) and then pointed out that the job in question HADN’T been advertised there…
So, I have to go back to see her on Monday.  She’s going to do a calculation to prove to me that I’d be better off in work than unemployed.  Well, DUH!  I think she’s going to prove to me that I can survive on a part time wage with my current expenditure, but she’ll be giving me a false reading.  As she well knows.  I told her, explicitly, that if I got a job I would be moving out of where I am right now.  So, my rent withh significantly increase (especially if I go through with my plan to get a flat instead of a room in a shared house) as will my bills.  So, basing any calculations on my current expendature is completely pointless.
World Book Night went OK.  I may write a ranty entry later about the organisation, but for the moment I’ll just say this: DO NOT ENCOURAGE ME TO SIGN UP TO THE WEBSITE WHEN IT’S DONW 9 TIMES OUT OF 10!
Tried giving away books in the town centre.  Gave some away, but got suspicious looks from a lot of people.  There was an event at the reference library in town that I was told I could give books away at.  So, went along only to find the person hosting the event was a giver herself and had the same book as me.  So, went to an event at MIMA (if you watch Top Gear, it’s the place where they had their art exhibition) to give some away there.  Some other givers turned up and guess what?
I went home that night with about half my books left.  Thankfully, I’ve managed to find homes for most of them, but I’m still going to have about 10 left over.  There’s a place in Boro that I might approach and see if they can help shift the remainder.
Apart from that, not much has happened.  Went to a tweetup in Middlesbrough over the weekend, which was fun.  It’s also where I was told about this piece of awesomness: Replace the N word with Robot in Huck Finn.  And much (delicious, home made) cake was had by all.  Looking forward to the next one.
Much writing to be done.  There’s stuff for TTZ (which is due in this weekend, so I’ll have to get cracking), my Angry Robot submission (is a wizard PI story sci-fi or fantasy?) and my submission for a local thing for new writers (which I still need to start and will cost a fortune to get to them).
I’ll leave you with a couple of videos.  The first proves that there really are no untalented sbilings in the Whedon family:
And this is just awesomely geeky.  Or geekily awesome.  You decide:
Don’t forget, you can find me on facebook here and on twitter here.
Have a good one!
Will

Title: The Chemistry Of Death
Author: Simon Beckett
Genre: Crime
448 pages
This is the first of three books I will be reviewing for The Great Transworld Crime Caper
Dr David Hunter was a forensic anthropologist.  After a personal tragedy, he moves to Manham in Norfolkshire and becomes a GP.  Despite living in the village for three years, he is still considered to be an outsider.
His past career catches up with him when the body of a woman is found in the forest and the police insist he helps out.  Then a second woman goes missing, later turning up dead.  Then a third, one that hits a bit too close to Dr Hunter for comfort.
The first thing I will tell you is that there are a lot of quite graphic descriptions of what happens to a body once it’s dead.  So this is definitely not a book for the squeamish.
Thankfully, I’m not squeamish and so actually found that stuff quite fascinating.  As for the rest of the book, I quite enjoyed it.  The pacing was good and there was a claustrophobic feel from the whole thing being set in one small village that reminded of me of The Wicker Man (in a good way).
However, quite enjoyed it isn’t the same as really enjoyed it.  I did have some problems with the book, which were:
1) The resolution of the main plot seemed to come out of left field.  I get why someone may want to do that, it’s an attempt to show the reader how clever said character actually is.  However, the result (certainly in this case for me) is that it left me feeling more than a little cheated.  There were minor clues, but these were very, very minor.
2) There was far, far too much made out of villagers attitudes towards people moving in from elsewhere.  I know it happens.  My dad is from a similarly small village.  But it seemed to be part of Beckett’s agenda to stress how much this attitude goes on.  To have one character fall victim to it is fine, to have it happen with three different characters is overkill.
3) There is a strange motif about dreams running through the entire books for which, bugger an adequate explanation, there is no attempt to explain it at all.  It’s just there.  It’s almost as if the writer needed an excuse for one thing to happen and decided that would do.
Despite the faults mentioned above, I probably would read the book again.  Would I recommend it?  Yes, but in a ‘if you have nothing else to read’ kind of way.
Will

Title: One Day
Author: David Nicholls
Genre: Romance
This is the book I’m giving away for World Book Night so I figured it was probably a good time to re-read it myself.
The story follows Emma and Dexter through 20 years of their friendship.  It doesn’t take a genius to work out that they’ll get together.  So far, so-so.
But there are two things that make this so much more than your average rom-com.  The first is the central conceit of the book.  We follow their friendship by looking in on them on the same day every year.  (St Swithins Day, to be precise.)  It sounds like it shouldn’t work and, to be honest, it shouldn’t really work.  Except Nicholls is a skilled writer and he makes it work.
The other thing that makes this different from the average rom-com is the main Characters.  Emma and Dexter, Dex and Em.  These are two characters that you really get to like and know.  That itself is a skill, but combined with the format of the book it is exceptional.  Nicholls really cares about these two and makes sure you will as well.
Overall, I cannot recommend this book highly enough.

Seriously, how fucking hard can it be to hand out 48 fucking books for free in the town fucking centre?
Well, if you think the answer is ‘not that hard’ you don’t live in Middlesbrough.
Fucking cultural backwater.
Here’s the thing: you may remember me mentioning the fact that I had submitted and application to be a World Book Night giver.  Well, said application was accepted and I’m getting 48 copies One Day by David Nicholls to give away.
After some fun and games with getting the books, I needed to find somewhere to actually distribute them.
Now, despite it being called World Book Night, I can actually give away the books during the day.  So, I decided to contact the council to find out if I could give away the books in the town centre.  I’m not planning to force anyone to take the book if they don’t want to.
Turns out that in order to do so, because it’s printed material which is not charitable, political or religious, I would have to pay £103 for a permit.
Yeah.  All I want to do is give away a few books.  And they want to charge me £103.
If I claimed that me religion is Jedi and wanted to give away my ‘holy text’ (the Star Wars:Episode 4:A New Hope script) it would cost me nothing.  If I wanted to give away Chairman Mao’s Little Red Book, I could do so as it’s political.
But I want to give away a book with containing nothing more subversive that the idea that it’s possible to climb Arthurs Seat on little sleep and in normal shoes and for that I’m looking at a £103 charge.
I can’t blame the guy from the council.  I really can’t.  He’s admitted to me that he realises this is to the benefit of the people of Middlesbrough and is trying to find a way out.
You may think that I’m overrreacting, and you’d be entitled to that opinion.  I don’t.  Sorry, it’s less that 50 books.  In the town centre.  On a Saturday.  How fucking long do they think it’s going to take?  Really?
If I start at 10, I’d probably still be in the pub for the 3pm football kick offs.  And for that, for bringing a few books to the people of this town, they want to charge me slightly less than my JSA for a fortnight.
There is one possible get out clause, will keep you posted.
Will
*EDIT*
Success!
Not the get out clause I was thinking of.  (That was to argue that as World Book Night is a regestered charity and, as the books I’m handing out are special World Book Night editions, they should count as charitible material.)
HOWEVER:
The Facilities and Events manager for Middlesbrough Council is a supporter of World Book Day and a fan of the book I’m giving away.  She has agreed to let me give the books away under her concent.  For free.
Woot!
Will

Title: Shatter the Bones
Author: Stuart MacBride
Genre: Crime
There’s a certain routine when it comes to kidnappings.  A definate amount for ransom, no involving the police, that sort of thing.
This time, however, the kidnappers haven’t specified an amount, just a date.  The police have been insisted on, as has making it very public.  This is because the victims are Alison and Jenny McGregor, the mother/daughter singers that have made a name for themselves on Britain’s Next Big Star.
And when the investigation involved a SOCA officer who seems intent on rubbing everyone up the wrong way, life isn’t easy for DS Logan McRae.
Shatter the Bones is the seventh MacBride book to feature McRae, and it may be the best so far.  MacBride does his usual trick of having McRae juggle multiple investigations throughout the book, but unusuallly doesn’t tie them together with the resolution.
The whole book is shot through with the coal black humour that MacBride also traditionally uses.  Unlike some who do this, however, MacBride is sensible enough to know exactly when to switch it off as it would be pointless or even tasteless.  There are a few key moments in the book, which really shakes up the world of the series, which would have been ruined had there been any humour of any kind.
There is the usual disorientation for me as I recognise locations (the books are set in my home town) but I knew that would happen going in.
There is a naming convention in the book that I cottoned onto quickly.  But, given what is used for that, you’d kind of expect me to really.
All in all, I heartily recommend this book, but with one caveat: if you haven’t read any of these books before, start with the first one.  There are things that’ll make more sense if you do so.

…This Years RAZZIE® Nominations
2010 was a year when those obnoxious surcharges for 3-D glasses boosted movie studios bottom lines, while actual attendance dropped once again. It was a year when most of what Hollywood released was either a remake, a reboot a re-imagining…or an outright rip-off. In other words, it was a banner year for only one of Tinsel Towns best-known award shows…the one that dis-honors Worst Achievements in Film. Voting members of The Golden Raspberry Award Foundation have sifted through the cinematic rubble of last year and selected nominees for The 31st Annual RAZZIE® Awards, with winners set to be announced in ceremonies at Hollywoods Barnsdall Gallery Theatre at 7:30pm/PST on Saturday, February 26  the now traditional Night Before the Oscars.
Leading the pack among this years RAZZIE® contenders are the third installment of an enormously successful franchise (with a berry opinionated fan-base) and one of 2010s biggest critical disasters, with 9 nods each. RAZZIE® Repeat Offender M. Night Shyamalan re-imagined the faux-anime TV series The Last Airbender into a jumbled, jump-cut mess of a movie that fans of the TV show hated even more than critics did (if thats even possible!). In addition to Worst Director and Worst Picture, the film is up for Worst Remake, Worst Screenplay, Worst Screen Couple/Ensemble (the entire cast) and a brand-new RAZZIE® category for 2010, Worst Eye-Gouging Mis-Use of 3-D. Neck-and-neck with Airbender in the RAZZIE® race (while taking a decidedly bigger bite it at the box office) is last years 4th biggest money-maker, Twilight Saga: Eclipse, also with 9 shots at taking home spray-painted gold. All three of the principal characters of Eclipse are individually nominated for their acting, and the entire cast is also up for Worst Screen Ensemble. Rounding out the Worst Picture list are the aptly titled Twilight parody Vampires Suck, the bling-obsessed superslick chick flick Sex & The City #2 and the decidedly un-romantic rom-com/revenge fantasy The Bounty Hunter.
Other notable nominees include a trio of long established divas, Cher, Liza Minnelli and Barbra Streisand all vying to be named Worst Supporting Actress, tween bong enthusiast Miley Cyrus nominated for Worst Actress, and Jack Black, Gerard Butler and Ashton Kutcher up against Twilights Taylor Lautner and Robert Pattinson for Worst Actor. Links to a complete list of nominees are on the right.
The RAZZIES® were created in 1980 as a logical antidote to Tinsel Towns annual glut of self-congratulatory awards by John Wilson, author of The Official Razzie Movie Guide and Everything I Know I Learned at the Movies. Nominees were determined by mailing ballots to 637 voters in 46 U.S. states and 17 foreign countries. Electronic voting and certification of this years Final RAZZIE® Ballots will be handled by Vote-Now.com. The Barnsdall Gallery Theatre is a facility of the City of Los Angeles Department of Cultural Affairs.
For more info on the awards history, please visit the official RAZZIE web site, follow the RAZZIES on Twitter, or tune in to the just-launched RAZZIE® Channel on YouTube.

670,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/its-that-time-again-107-3930432/,2011-01-18,It’s that time again…,"
Today is Tuesday, Jan. 19, the 19th day of 2010. There are 346 days left in the year.
Today’s Highlight in History:
On Jan. 19, 1960, the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between Japan and the United States of America was signed by both countries in Washington, D.C. (Domestic opposition to the treaty led to the resignation of Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi (nah-boo-soo-keh kee-shee)).
On this date:
In 1807, Confederate general Robert E. Lee was born in Westmoreland County, Va.
In 1809, author, poet and critic Edgar Allan Poe was born in Boston.
In 1853, Giuseppe Verdi’s opera “Il Trovatore” premiered in Rome.
In 1861, Georgia seceded from the Union.
In 1937, millionaire Howard Hughes set a transcontinental air record by flying his monoplane from Los Angeles to Newark, N.J., in seven hours, 28 minutes and 25 seconds.
In 1955, a presidential news conference was filmed for television for the first time, with the permission of President Dwight D. Eisenhower.
In 1966, Indira Gandhi was elected prime minister of India.
In 1970, President Richard M. Nixon nominated G. Harrold Carswell to the Supreme Court; however, the nomination was defeated because of controversy over Carswell’s past racial views.
In 1980, retired Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas died in Washington, D.C. at age 81.
In 1990, Arthur J. Goldberg, former Supreme Court justice, labor secretary and U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, was found dead in his Washington apartment at age 81.
Ten years ago: Michael Skakel (SKAY’-kul), a nephew of Robert F. Kennedy, was charged with bludgeoning to death 15-year-old Martha Moxley in Greenwich (GREH’-nich), Conn. in 1975, when he was also 15. (Skakel was later convicted, and is appealing.) A dormitory fire at Seton Hall University in New Jersey killed three people and injured 62. Former Italian Prime Minister Bettino Craxi died in Tunisia at age 65. Actress Hedy Lamarr was found dead in her Orlando, Fla. home; she was 85.
Five years ago: Previewing his second inauguration, President George W. Bush pledged to seek unity in a nation divided by political differences, saying, “I am eager and ready for the work ahead.” Condoleezza Rice won strong but not unanimous endorsement as secretary of state from a Senate panel. The American Cancer Society reported that cancer had passed heart disease as the top killer of Americans age 85 and younger. Former chairman and chief executive of Citicorp Walter B. Wriston died in New York at age 85.
One year ago: Russia and Ukraine signed a deal restoring natural gas shipments to Ukraine and paving the way for an end to the nearly two-week cutoff of most Russian gas to a freezing Europe.

I walk to/from my creative writing class on a Monday night.  As it’s a long walk (takes about half an hour/45 mins, depending on starting point), I listen to music while doing so.
Yesterday, the first song to come up on my MP3 player was The Beginning Is The End Is The Beginning by The Smashing Pumpkins:
The last song to play before I got into the house?  The Beginning Is The End Is The Beginning by The Smashing Pumpkins:

I love it when stuff like that happens.

Well, Tooco Lite in my case.
Rules: Put your iPod on random. Quote lyrics from the songs that come up in the rotation. See who can guess what those songs are (and, as with every quiz, no Googling!)
Just a warning, I have a lot of cover versions…
1) With my kid on my shoulders I try
Not to hurt anybody I like
But I don’t have the drugs to sort,
2) Instead of kneeling in the sand
Catching teardrops in my hand
3) I walk through her hills cause she knows who I am
She sees my good deeds and she kisses me windy
4) And my momma swore that
She would never let herself forget
5) Sweet 16 aint that peachy keen
Now that aint so neat to admit defeat
6) I’m living in the past
You’re making history
7)I heard telephones, opera house, favourite melodies
Saw boys, toys, electric irons and TVs
8) Have you ever been alone in a crowded room when I’m here with you
I said the world could be burning down
9) And Ive been keeping all the letters that I wrote to you
Each one a line or two
Im fine baby, how are you?
10) I’m tired of magazines
Saying flat butts are the thing
11) Baby I was stupid for telling you goodbye
Maybe I was wrong for tryin’ to pick a fight 
12) The worms will live in every host
It’s hard to pick which one they eat most
13) Let’s make the best of the situation
Before I finally go insane. 
14) Internalised all my thoughts of death
I want to block out what was really said
15) Someday I’ll wish upon a star,
Wake up where the clouds are far behind me
16) Put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now he’s dead
17) I know that Ive been a dirty little bastard
I like to kill, I like to maim, It sounds insane
18) But as soon as they were settled as the richest of the rich,
They kicked away the ladder, told the rest of us that life’s a bitch.
19) what a life indeed when that ancient seed
is a berry watered and plowed
20) You’d better hope and pray
That you make it safe
Back to your own world 

Will
*EDIT*
Cos I believe that it’s easier asking you to guess the answers if the answers aren’t already there…

No, wait, that’s wrong.
I answer your questions.
Happy New Year!  Will have a full write up about the past couple of weeks soon.

Now to answer your questions.  The first was from little_chloella:
what were was the best thing and the worst thing that happened to you in 2010?
The best thing was the Rage Against The Machine gig.  It was amazing, a true celebration.
The worst was definately going to the vets with my mum to have Kari put down.
Next we have pierced_poet:
weirdest thing you saw/heard in 2010?
Weirdest thing I saw this year was, possibly, quite a few adverts I’ve seen on telly (for example, there’s one at the moment with a giant nose on a broomstick) which makes me glad I no longer own a telly.  Weirdest thing I’ve heard is some of the stuff that’s read out in creative writing.
what was something new you did this year that you haven’t done before? 
Can’t really think of anything major.  I travelled on Megabus for the first (and, given my discomfort, last) time.  Oh, and contacting my MP.
Favourite book of 2010?
I want to say One Day by David Nichols, but as far as I can remember, I actually read that in 2009.  So, I’ll say The Passage by Justin Cronin.  A rare case of a huge, huge book which left me thinking it was actually too short.
favourite film of 2010?
The film I was most looking forward to was Inception.  And, while it lived up to my expectations, the answer is actually The Social Network.  If there is any justice, this’ll clean up at the Oscars.
Anything you are looking forward to in 2011?
I’m going to guess she meant book/film wise.  Bookwise, I’m not sure when the next Passage book is out.  I’m looking forward to the new Stuart MacBride book, which I’m getting for my birthday.  Filmwise, looking forward to Never Let Me Go (incidentally, you really read the book, tis fucking amazing) and Paul.
oobi wanted to know stuff as well:
What did you learn in 2010?
I learnt that it’s not a good idea to attend job interviews dressed the way I usually do.  Course, I knew that anyway…
What I actually learned in 2010 was a lot of stuff from my creative writing class.
What did you gain?
I gained an extra year, possibly a few grey hairs and some good friends.  I also gained a very small amount of confidence in my writing.
And finally, we have Shesolovely:
What was your most enjoyable moment?
Singing Killing In The Name Of in Finsbury Park.  The atmosphere, the crowd, just everything about it was amazing:
 title=”YouTube video player” class=”youtube-player” type=”text/html” width=”1280″ height=”750″ src=”http://www.youtube.com/embed/CNjR4KLdcu0?rel=0&hd=1&#8243; frameborder=”0″>
Had any life altering moments/revelations?
Not particularly, no.  to be honest.  Nothing that sticks out, and if it was life altering or a revelation, it would have stuck out.
And there we are.
Before I go, quick favour: I’ve written the first five chapters of a book which I need to have done for March for submission.  Anyone fancy reading some, or all, of them and giving me feedback, make sure I’m heading in the right direction?

So, yesterday I got a phone call.
Not that surprising, considering.  I let it go to voicemail (as is my usual practice with call from numbers I don’t recognise) and it turns out it was someone about a competition I entered.
I tried phoning back, but got voicemail, but they’ve said they will call back tonight.
So, fingers crossed, I’ve won tickets for the SFX Weekender convention.
Also, I’ve decided to try and write something for this.  So far, the best idea I’ve had is to try and write a hard boiled noir thriller (think Raymond Chandler) where the main character is a jaded, cynical, run down wizard PI.  What do you guys think?
Also, don’t forget, I’m still looking for your questions about my 2010.

Confirmed.  I’ve won 4 weekend passes for the SFX Weekender.  Now to find 3 people to come with me.  And the money for travel/accommodation.

679,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/questions-answered-and-requested-edit-3930423/,2010-12-21,Questions answered and requested *EDIT*,"
I’ll get to the requested part later.  For now, here are the answers to the questions posed to me a while back.
pierced_poet started us off:
What is your favourite, and least favourite things about Christmas?
Favourite thing is actually turkey sandwiches (which I won’t be getting this year :¬().  Least favourite is trying to decide what to get people as gifts (especially my dad).
What did you want to be when you were a kid?
I really don’t remember, actually.  Which is a sign of how crap my memory is.
If you could be a character in Buffy which one would you be and why?
Probably Zander.  He’s the one that’s most like me, plus he managed to pull Cordelia, Willow, Faith and Anya.
If you could have a dinner party with 5 OD favourites, which ones would you invite? 😉
Now you’re inviting trouble.  If you are not on the list, apologies.
pierced_poet because the whole thing was her idea to begin with,
NotKieran to help stave off the diarists that didn’t get invited :¬p,
Shesolovely to take pictures of the night,
Zaphod cos he’s a hoopy frood who really knows where his towel is (and cos I’ve invited his better half so I should really),
Rodge, cos he’s been reading my nonsense for years now and probably deserves it.
If you could give ‘things’ on the ’12 days of christmas’ (like the song) what 12 things would they be?(they can be ANYTHING!!)
Booze,
Food,
Booze,
Rowies,
Booze,
Free internet access for life,
Booze,
A smartphone,
Booze,
A signed copy of my first book (this is a world where I have actually been published),
Booze and
Booze.
Next we have Steven the Rill:
What’s the most annoying word in the English language – and why?
Coffee.  you have no idea how many times I keep forgetting that it has two e’s at the end.
And last, but by no means least, *Sprog*:
What’s your favourite David Bowie song?
Now you’ve got me stumped.  Either Five Years, Starman, Rock N Roll Suicide, Life On Mars, Ashes To Ashes or the Trent Reznor remix of I’m Afraid Of Americans.
Have you ever gone skinny dipping?
Nope.  If you knew what the weather was like most of the time in Aberdeen and Middlesbrough, you’d understand why.
What colour are your socks?
Black.  I only wear either black or dark blue socks.
What is the point in Oreos when Bourbons exist?
No idea.
And that’s it for these questions.  Now to the request.
It has become tradition that, rather than filling out a survey about the year about to end, I’ve answered your questions about my life in that year.  And I see no reason to break with tradition this year.  So, ask me anything about my life in 2010 and I shall answer.  Probably on New Years Day, assuming I’m not too hungover.
Don’t forget, if you’re interested in taking part in YoC 2011, you can sign up here

*EDIT*
I’m not sure how much/if I’m going to get online between now and then, so Merrry Christmas and enjoy my present to you all.

About a year ago, I put forwarsd an idea for a Year of Creativity.  This was to be a challenge to create something once a month based on a prompt I gave.
Well, having thought about it, I’ve decided to bring the idea back for 2011.  I have made slight tweaks to the way things work.  Iff you are interested in taking part, the sign up entry is here if you are interested.
Also this year, I will be taking part in 12 in Twelve.  I did this in 2009 and it kinda died a death last year, but it’s back.  This is to encourage poeple to read (as if I actually need that) and review one book a month (though I’l probably do more than that).  You can find out more information here.
As you were.

681,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/yoc-hic-suc-dracones-3930421/,2010-12-16,YOC: Hic Suc Dracones,"
Written for Year of Creativity
Prompt: Here be dragons
And you think dragons dont exist?  You know, Im going to have to have words with that teacher of yours.  Imagine telling you an outrageous lie like that.  Next youll be telling me you dont believe in unicorns either.
Of course dragons exist.  What do you think keeps the inside of volcanoes so hot?  Back when the Norse, Celtic, Greek and Roman gods were around there were no such things as matches and lighters.  Who do you think it was that lit their cigars and ceremonial fires?  Dragons, of course.  Special dragons that they kept for just such an occasion.  The use of animals for household use wasnt invented for The Flintstones, you know.
I recognise that look on your face.  But dad, you are wondering, if dragons do actually exist, where do they live?  They dont live in Britain.  Well, as far as you know.
You know that weve explored most of the world.  Well, there are some places that you think are uninhabitable, but thats just for humans.  Other creatures can live in these places.  Lets see.  Pixies and faeries live on a group of islands in the Federated States of Micronesia.  I believe that unicorns, seeing as I mentioned them before, are from somewhere near Papua New Guinea.
And dragons?
Well, they live on an island, shaped like a claw, just off the coast of Greenland.  That may surprise you, given that they breathe fire, but its because of that.  The fire they breathe lives inside them and they get kind of hot.  So they need to live somewhere cold to compensate for that.  The fire acts as central heating for their bodies.
Forget what youve read about dragons.  Some of it is true, such as the fire breathing, and the descriptions are generally right, but they are not the evil creatures you may well imagine them to be.  They are actually nice and helpful.  Of course, you get some that are bad natured, as with any creature, but on the most part they like humans.  Some of them power the furnaces in Santas workshop.
Sadly, they can be destructive.  Its not deliberate, just because of the fire thing.  The great fire of London is rumoured to have been started by a dragon that was flying overhead at the time and sneezed at the wrong moment.  Volcano eruptions are supposed to be the result of a dragon dying.  I happen to know thats what causes forest fires, but even they can be useful.  It can help keep the forest from spreading too much without needing to cut down the trees.  They are only a problem if they threaten human habitats.
Humans can see them.  Humans have.  Looking out the window of a plane, usually late at night.  Glimpsing up to the sky.  The reason its not more widely reported is because of people like your teacher.  They cant believe they actually saw it so they pretend its something else.
There you have it.  I will ask you not to reveal this conversation to your teacher, because Im not sure shell actually be too happy with me.  Just as long as you know the truth.
Will

I got into my placement today, after trudging through the snow, only to find that the manager had decided it wasn’t worth opening due to the weather.
(Oh, and the fact that I was supposed to start tomorrow, not today.)
So, here I am in the uni library, which shuts in about 45 minutes because of the weather.  And I don’t have class tonight because of the weather.
Not sure what I’m going to do with my free night off.  Might actually do some writing.  Or I’ll sit and continue making my way through The West Wing (I’m just about up the end of season 3).

Yeah, it can best be summed up by the following letter:
Dear Sir/Madam,
I am what is referred to as long term unemployed.  As such, I have been sent by the job centre to a place called A4e.  You may have heard of it, the person who does the television series The Fairy Jobmother used to work for them.
As part of my placement there, I have to do something called work boost.  This is a four week work placement, the idea being that I get relevant recent experience in an industry I wish to work in and it, in return, gives me something recent to put on my CV.  It, in short, is designed to help me get back into the work market.  Its not too dissimilar to what Iain Duncan Smith is proposing for long term unemployed.
Every time I have spoken to my Personal Careers Coach about my work boost, I have said the same thing.  I want to do retail work.  If you looked at my CV, it would show that I have plenty of retail experience and all I would need is basic training and Im good to go.
I am at A4e for a period of one year which started on the 7th of January 2010.  This means that they have to get me on my work boost so that I finish before 7th January 2011, when I finish with A4e.  Now, it is true that they did try and sort out my work boost at the beginning of November but I was unable to do this for various reasons.
I am due to start my work boost on the 29th of November.  What have they got me doing?
Construction.
After months of me saying that I would like to do retail, or office work (which Im not wild about but would be willing to do) they have decided that the best thing for me to do is.
Construction.
I have nothing against construction workers.  My father is a heavy plant operator.  Construction is a noble form of employment.  Its just not for me.  The way I know this is that if it were, I would have years ago asked my father to help me get into the industry.
Im not really sure which was more embarrassing.  It was either being sat in that room, after being told it was construction I was doing, thinking theyve put me on this because they need to get my placement done and there was no retail placements available at that time, only to discover that other people in the room were on a retail placement or when I asked someone about it later and they informed me that there were no retail placements left when I was put forward for it only for me to reply that I had been asking for retail for months only to get this.
It may actually have been having to explain to my mother that I would not be home for Christmas in order to do a work placement that would have absolutely no impact on my search for work.
Its not as if I can refuse to do the placement.  Such a refusal will result in me losing my benefits and therefore having absolutely no money to live on.  As much as I dont want to do this, I have to.
I dont blame my current PCC for this situation, as the first time I spoke to him as my PCC was to complain about what was happening.  But, if anyone wants a reason why its so hard for long term unemployed to find work you can blame it on two things as far as this experience has taught me.  The current economic climate is the first.  The other?  Situations like my one.  Whereby people are forced to do placements supposedly designed to help them get back into work but really just for the sake of doing the placement.
Yours faithfully,
William Forbes
Middlesbrough

I dropped a copy of this off at A4e along with the following note:
To whom it may concern,
You will find stapled to this something which is obviously a letter.  If you read this, you will see it details my experience thus far with yourselves concerning my work boost.
Why did I write this letter?  Simple.  I want the situation changed.  Its not much to ask for, to do my work boost in an area that actually interests me, yet it seems like Im asking you to give me the Holy 
Grail.
If I do not hear back from yourselves by 3pm this afternoon concerning this, a copy of the attached letter will be emailed to every single national newspaper from the Daily Star to the Financial Times.  It will also be sent to A4e head office and Sir Stuart Bell in his capacity as MP for my constituency.
If/when you wish to contact me about this, you can either phone me on the number you have for me or you can email me at williamcforbes@gmail.com
Yours,
William Forbes.

I’m culling the email addresses I need at the moment.
Will
*EDIT*
They’ve just phoned.  Their solution?  I find myself a work placement.  They fucked things up for me and I’ve to sort it for them.
Bugger that.
I’m going to phone them back about 3 and if they haven’t sorted anything I’ll be sending the letter with an amendment to the effect they wanted me to sort it for them, despite the fact that finding me a placement that I want is their job.
Will
*SECOND EDIT*
About 1pm, I got a call from someone at A4e.  They had just discovered that I would prefer to do a retail based placement (which I had been asking for for months) rather than a construction course and it just so happens that someone from a local charity asked about getting someone for one of their shops (gee, what a coinkidink!).  So I’ve filled out the paperwork and it’s on.
Yay!
And I don’t have to go back to A4e until Jan 4th so I’ll definately be back up the road for New Year.
Woot!

About the news in my last entry.
Went to the meeting today to find out what I’m going to be doing for my work boost and fill out the necessary paperwork.
Said meeting never happened.  It had to be rescheduled.  But I did find out that I would be going to somewhere called VOX in Stockton and that I would be doing labouring.
Labouring.
Fucking LABOURING?
Really?  I mean, really?  Are they taking the fucking piss?  I’ve no problem with the job, it’s just not for me.  Anyone who’s seen me kinda knows I’m not built for it.
Besides, every time I’ve spoken to my employment coach (still a fucking stupid job title BTW) about this subject I stated that I would like to do retail work (for which I have experience) or office work.
So what kind of time warp did I fall through where office or retail suddenly becomes labouring work?  How does that even make sense?
And it’s not as if I can just get through it and look forward to going back home for the holidays, as I thought I would be able to.  Turns out that I don’t start till a week on Monday.  Which means that I don’t finish till Christmas Day.
Not attending is something I would desperately love to do.  Sadly, that would mean losing my benefits.
Still, at least I might get a new pair of boots out of it.
And I can’t wait till January.  The feedback they will inevitably ask me to leave about my time at the place will make for very, very uncomfortable reading.

Well, kind of.  Through A4E (who I believe I’ve bitched about before) I have to do a 4 week work placement.  Quite why it’s taken them this bloody long to sort it out when I’ve been there since the 7th of January is a rant for another thime, but there you go.
Don’t bother asking what I’m going to be doing cos the truth is, I don’t bloody know.  May well be in a charity shop.
Two good things though.  It does mean that I don’t need to sign on and it means that I will actually be able to go home for Christmas.
And I won’t have to pay for the train home.  It turns out that my dad has a job in Middlesbrough so he’s said he’d be willing to give me a lift home.  He’s also been told that the job has to finish on the 31st of March, simply because the people funding is cease to exist then.
Creative writing was interesting yesterday.  I read out my dragons do exist story and have been told that between that and my brownie story I may have found my voice.  Dunno how that balanced with the dark stuff I tend to do…
Find me on facebook here and twitter here.
Anyway, I’ll stop boring you lot now.  But, I’ve decided to open myself up to questions.  It’s been a while since I’ve done this (and, yes, I know I owe you lot answers to the political questions from a while back) and I’ve got a few new readers recently.  So, go for it.  Ask me anything.

So, it seems that my computer isn’t as dead as I thought it was.  Yesterday, I tried to get online using the free wifi at the pub I was in, thinking that there was no way it would connect.  To my surprise, it did.  It seems that the problem is just in the uni library for some reason.
I’ll have to work on that.
On Wednesday there was a protest in London against the raising of student tuition fees.  I would have gone but a) I’m not a student and b) I couldn’t afford it even if I was.  During the protest, some students broke away and laid siege to the Conservative Party HQ.  I’m torn on this subject.  Attacking the Tories is the best thing to do (the NUS is obsessed with targeting the Lib Dems when this is clearly a Tory Party policy).  I’m gutted that it did happen because it’s become the focus of the protests and not what the protests were actually about.  On the other hand, it was the Tory party HQ that got trashed and, as someone who grew up in the 80’s and remembers what they did to the country then, that’s never not fun to watch.
My creative writing tutor is either going to love me or kill me on Monday.  For homework last week, she gave us a list of prompts and we had to use one.  The idea is that the finished story will be our contribution for the booklet at the end of term.  Problem is, I’ve already written something for two of the prompts and I’m planning something for the third.  I’m also going to hand in all three and get feedback on them.  Maybe I should email her and warn her.
Incidentally, if anyone feels like giving me feedback on either of the stories I’ve written already, the translation of the all Doric story I mentioned before, all three or any combination of the above, let me know.  I don’t need the feedback for the translation one in a hurry but will need quick heedback on the other two.
Yesterday I finally got to go and see The Social Network.  It’s now a toss up between that and Inception for my favourite film of the year, though I will say that the opening scene will be used in screenwriting classes in the future as a perfect example of how to establish a character.
Tonight I’m heading to Stockton to see Mr. Nice (I won the tickets for that one) and Sunday I’ve got another free ticket, this time to see the Grease singalong!  (Shut up!)  And with that one, I get a free Diet Coke.  So, quite the cinematic weekend.
I’ll shut up now, but I do want to share this video.  I agree with the sentiments, but watch it for the classiest rendition of the word douchebag ever:

I tried everything that I’ve seen suggested online and I’ve even tried a factory reset, but no joy.  I have probably tried about 15 competitions to win a new laptop (cos I really need to have a laptop) and I’ve also decided to try a wireless dongle to see if that’ll help.

I was hoping to post pics from my Grans birthday party.  But, unfortunately, they’re all on my laptop and I can’t get online with that at the moment…
So, I’ll do the Theme for this week:
What’s your favorite way to get around? Do you have a car, or do you prefer other transportation? 
Really?  I mean, really?  You just had to stick the bit about the fucking car there, didn’t you?
Can someone please, for the love of FSM, explain to me what the obsession wirth driving, or wanting to drive, is?  Please?
If you drive, more power to you.  I personally think it’s a bit wierd, but I have nothing against you.
So why is it that I’m made to feel like less of a human because I don’t drive and have absolutely no desire to ever ever do so?  Why is that seen as being strange?
Take that question.  You don’t need that last bit.  If the theme question was this:
What’s your favorite way to get around?
It would not make a difference.  People could answer the question no problem.
But no.  There is the second part of it.  The part that, to me, says:
EVERYONE ON THIS SITE SHOULD EITHER BE ABLE TO DRIVE OR WANT TO BE ABLE TO DRIVE.  YOUR CAR MUST BE YOUR FAVOURITE FORM OF TRANSPORTATION AND IF IT’S NOT, YOU’D BETTER HAVE A DAMNED GOOD REASON AS TO WHY, YOU GIANT FUCKING FREAKAZIOD!
So, I’ve decided not to answer after all.  Suffice to say that my answer is not a car and I really don’t see why I should have to justify that to anyone.  If I wasn’t asked to do that, I would answer.

I should be writing this entry from Aberdeen.  As I mentioned in my last entry, today is my grans 90th birthday and there’s a party for her on Saturday.  The plan was this:
Sign on on Monday
Get train home on Tuesday
Into town on Thursday when paid
Through to the Broch on Saturday
Back to Aberdeen Sunday.
Back to Boro Monday, go to creative writing
Profit(?)
But, sadly, it didn’t quite work like that.
Y’see, A4e (the place that the job centre has sent me to which is supposed to help me look for work and has lined up precisely 1 thing for me (call centre, cold calling at which I have precisely 0 experience) since I was sent there in January) decided that yesterday and today I had to attend a course about how to look presentable for interviews.  So at 2pm yesterday I made my way to the place and signed in.  Soon we were called through to the room that was being used.
Where the person running the sessions seemed to alternate between asking us obvious questions, completely ignoring our points of view, insulting us (and getting other members of staff to do the same) and stating the bloody obvious.  [sarcasm]I mean, I really had absolutely no idea that it was a bad idea to rock up to a job interview stinking of BO and dressed in my usual manner.[/sarcasm]
Oh, and she was so obsessed with the fact that we simply had to be depressed about not having a job (because she got quite depressed when she was unemployed) that I was starting to get depressed about the fact that I wasn’t depressed.
So, after being insulted and patronised, we were given goodie bags, had our pictures taken (yay! *raises hand half heartedly), at which point I was told I look like a Shakespearian actor (double yay!) and told to wear our interview clothes today.  I checked the bag and it contained:
Shower gel,
Soap,
Shampoo,
Face cloth,
Sponge,
Shaving cream,
Razors,
Comb,
Nail brush,
Toothbrush,
Toothpaste,
Socks.
So I kept what I actually needed and dumped the rest.
This morning, bright and early, I went back dressed in dress trousers and shirt (didn’t bother with the tie, I hate wearing a fucking tie).  When we finally started, we were asked if we felt better and more confident about the way we were dressed.  I simply told the truth, that I was uncomfortable.  Then we had to say two good things and two bad things (if there were any bad things to mention) about someone else in the room.  Someone did comment about me (mostly that my hair could have been a bit more under control) I was asked to do it.  I refused because I don’t judge people based purely on how they look.  I learned a long time ago that to do so is stupid as it could lead you to miss out on a great friendship or befriending someone who is a complete cunt.
I then pointed out that I generally don’t do compliments*, either giving or receiving (the later is because I dress for my own comfort and not to impress (interviews and other such situations excluded) and really don’t give a shit if anyone else likes what I’m wearing.  I’m not wearing it for your sake) and reiterated my point about not judging people based on looks.
This is the moment in which she decided to point out something to me.  Apparently, she wasn’t asking me to judge people based purely on their looks.
I’ll restate that for you.
Apparently, ASKING ME TO SAY TWO GOOD THINGS AND TWO BAD THINGS ABOUT A PERSON BASED SOLELY ON HOW THEY LOOK ISN’T THE SAME AS ASKING ME TO JUDGE SAID PERSON BASED ON THEIR LOOKS!
I did want desperately to turn round and ask if she was fucking insane, but that would probably get me kicked out and I’d lose my benefits.  Instead, I calmly made my point in a way even she would understand.  That was when she decided to point out to me that although I may not judge based on appearance, other people, including potential employers do.
Thanks for that.  I needed to have the fact that not everyone acts the same way I do having arrived in Middlesbrough having been born yesterday on a fish trawler from Fittie.
Then we got our pictures taken (supposedly so we can be shown later the difference between the two days and make us feel better about the ‘new’ us), filled out evaluation forms for the course (I bit my tongue, mostly cos if they keep that particular course going with her in charge she’s going to piss off the wrong person) and then were sent out the room for one on one interviews.  In which she talked mostly about my lack of confidence and the reasons for that.  So, in two days she insulted me, patronised me tried to claim that an exercise we were supposed to do wasn’t something that I am fundamentally opposed to when it was in fact the very fucking definition of that act and now she’s making me dredge up painful memories from the past.
I felt like asking her if she also wanted to cut the tattoos off my arms 
and pour salt water on the wounds just to cap things off.
Crazily enough, she asked me to speak to my coach about getting one on one counselling sessions with her for my confidence issues.  I think I’ll not bother as I’m certainly not talking about stuff like that to someone who A) is convinced that the way she experienced things is the same for everybody else, B) likely has absolutely no formal training or experience in any kind of therapy and C) isn’t clearly completely batshit insane.
I have a feeling that she might just ask my coach* to go ahead and book them anyway.  I’ll refuse to go.  And if they do stop my benefits for it, it’d make a cracking story for the local papers, won’t it?
Thank fuck I’m out of here tomorrow.  Even if it is at 5:45am.
Will
* After I said this, when waiting for the one to ones, the guy who commented on me actually apologised for what he said.  Which me look like a complete twat.

That’s the question I’m asking myself as I prepare to start playing a BSG online game.  What do you guys think?
Got a surprise visit from my dad yesterday.  He was in the area looking for work and decided to meet up with me.  I was panicking, thinking he would want to stay at mine (I’m not allowed overnight guests), moan about me not having a job, moan about my hair and trying to convince me to move back to Aberdeen.
Actually it went OK.  He was late to meet me (cos he was misdirected to the pub), bought me food and a pint and we chatted.  Job hunting problems (sounds as if Aberdeen job centre is almost as useless as James Cook House), the pointlessness of the course I’m being sent on (the only mention of my hair), Aberdeen FC, Middlesbrough FC, Liverpool FC, and the funeral (my sisters pet budgie, Kylie, died a couple of weeks back and my brother in law [who didn’t even want a pet to begin with] decided he wanted her buried in my parents back garden.  At 7pm.  Under the tree where the dog likes to dig.  I think I may have a picture of her, I’ll have a look.).
Busy week next week.  It looks a little like this:
Today: meet my friend for a drink and get some money she owes me.  Probably go round to hers to help her install her new bluetooth dongle for her computer so will likely be there till Sunday.
Monday: Sign on in the morning, appointment with A4e in the afternoon, quiz at the union at night as there’s no creative writing (half term).
Tuesday: First two hours of a course about how to make myself look presentable for job interviews which completely overlooks the fact that my problems with job interviews is not what I wear.
Wednesday: Last two hours of aforementioned course.  No sleep that night cos at 5:45 on…
Thursday: morning have a train to Aberdeen.  Get washing done.
Friday: go into the town centre, do some shopping including new trousers as both the pairs I currently have are literally falling apart on me.
Saturday: head through to the Brough for my Grans birthday meal (she’s going to be 90 on Wednesday).
Sunday: back through to Aberdeen after the meal.
Monday: train back to Boro, class that night.
So, yeah, kinda busy.
Bit of advice needed.  For class over the summer, I wrote a short story based on Scottish myths and legends.  It’s all in Doric.  I have submitted it somewhere but do you guys think, as my tutor does, that I should translate it?  Anyone wanting to read either version, let me know.
And if anyone feels like giving me feedback on the story i mentioned in my last entry, let me know.

Prompt: Celebration
Sir Henry Fossington-Ponceby-Fletcher-Smythe-Taylor KBE, OBE, MBE, BSC, SSC
1960  TBD*
Sir Henry Fossington-Ponceby-Fletcher-Smythe-Taylor passed away yesterday morning while in bed with his 19 year old Playboy Playmate of the year bride whilst on honeymoon.
Sir Henry, who was 60 years of age, is noted for being the only person in the history of the British Army for being court marshalled for being absent with leave.  Upon his dishonourable discharge he embarked on a variety of careers including, but not limited to, TV news presenter, wine maker, resteraunteur, dairy farmer, professional gambler, poet, novelist and deep sea sponge diver.
However, when asked for his profession Sir Henry would reply, ‘A raconteur and a wit.  Though some would say I’m only half way towards the second.’
A man of relentless drive and a fierce burning intellect, Sir Henry claims to have invented the laptop, the iPad, the internet as we know it, the internet in a different form, Big Mouth Billy Bass and Cheesy Granite before anyone else.  He said that he didn’t pursue these as he wanted to give someone else a fair go.
Sir Henry is survived by one wife, five ex-wives, seven sons, six daughters, numerous illegitimate children, five grandchildren, a legion of adoring and heartbroken fans and Spot, his beloved pet zebra.  His funeral will take place as soon as his blood alcohol level is sufficiently low for a safe cremation.
*Authors note: I always thought it would be amusing to read my own obituary and see it in print.  Rumours of my death have, as a result, been greatly exaggerated.

I’m also currently looking for feedback on a story what I wrote.  If interested, drop me a note.

Fair play to Fox (and it’s not often you’ll hear me say that) for actually broadcasting this.
Banksy takes Simpsons into sweatshop
Street artist Banksy storyboards Simpsons titles that show workers churning out merchandise  and takes swipe at Fox TV
Celebrated street artist Banksy has turned his talents to The Simpsons, creating an opening sequence featuring an Asian sweatshop.
The minute-long opening sequence begins almost as usual, but with Banksy’s tag being sprayed across Springfield monuments, and a masked Bart writing “I must not write all over the walls” over the walls of his schoolroom.
It then pans to a dark, dilapidated factory where dozens of workers animate sketches of the family. Cats are shown being thrown into a wood chipper to create stuffing for merchandise such as Bart Simpson dolls. A unicorn, chained to the factory wall, is used to punch holes in DVDs.
The titles end with a grim image of the logo of the show’s owner, 20th Century Fox, guarded by searchlights, a watchtower and a barbed wire fence.
It is not the first time the show has taken a swipe at Fox: the cartoon has parodied Fox News, while the network’s owner, Rupert Murdoch, has appeared in the show as a “billionaire tyrant”.
It is the first time an artist has been involved in the opening credits of the show, credited with being the most successful television brand of all time. Al Jean, The Simpsons executive producer, joked: “This is what you get when you outsource.”
Banksy is said to have been inspired by reports that Simpsons characters are animated in Seoul, South Korea.
The sequence is said to have been one of the most closely guarded secrets in US television  comparable to the concealment of Banksy’s own identity.
The episode, MoneyBart, made its US debut last night and will be shown in the UK on 21 October.
The story follows Lisa as she coaches Bart’s little league baseball team to a surprise record winning streak.

This is where I greet the reader and apologise to my regular readers for the lack of proper updates.  I may also encourage you to read the entry before this one.
In this paragraph I tell you about something amusing that happened while I was wondering around town.  I also rack my brains unsure if I have posted this story before until deciding it doesn’t really matter.
Next I will post a link to something i saw online that I found amusing.
Here is where I tell you about nights out I’ve had and any amusing stories from said nights out.  ‘I will then let you know,’ I will say that someone said, ‘about quotes that I found funny.’
In this bit, I will rant about something that is annoying me.  This will usually be about friends, the job centre, the agency the job centre has sent me to, something online or a local bar.
And this is where I write about an experience I’ve recently had.  If it’s good, I’m writing about it to boast/share my excitement.  If it was bad, I’m writing to try and elicit some sympathy.
This will be where I write about something I got a picture of that is interesting.  It could be a sign, an interesting view or something you don’t see every day.
Here I tell you I’m about to post the picture:

Sometimes I’ll end the entry there.  Occasionally, thought, I’ll use this bit for things I may have forgotten, questions about a specific topic or about me in general, or requests for people to read a story I’ve written and give me feedback.
And then I’ll leave my name.
*EDIT*
This is an edit to the original entry.  This may be an update concerning something in the entry itself, an amusing video, picture or link or just something I wanted to mention that doesn’t warrant it’s own entry.
This is where I put my name again.

I posted about this on Twitter and Facebook*, but it’s too good not to share here.
I was wondering round charity shops today, looking to see what books they had.  (Admittedly, I was looking for The Catcher in the Rye in particular.  The opening was used for an exercise in my creative writing class on Monday and it reminded me how damn good it is and made me want to re-read it.)
Anyhoodle, while looking through the books in one, someone came in and walked up to the counter.  The following took place:
Bloke: Do you have any free umbrellas?
Assistant: Sorry, we don’t.
Bloke: This is a charity shop, you’re supposed to do that sort of thing.
He then left.  The assistant burst out laughing and, after being assured that the incident actually dud happen, said she should have pointed out that it’s a charity shop and he’s supposed to give them stuff.

THE ABERDEENSHIRE FARMER
A man owned a small farm in Aberdeenshire. The Department of Employment & Pensions claimed he was not paying proper wages to his staff and sent an representative out to interview him.
‘I need a list of your employees and how much you pay them,’ demanded the rep.
‘Well,’ replied the farmer, ‘there’s my farm hand who’s been with me for 3 years. I pay him £200 a week plus free room and board. The cook/housekeeper has been here for 18 months, and I pay her £150 per week plus free room and board. Then there’s the half-wit. He works about 18 hours every day and does about 90% of all the work around here. He makes about £10 per week, pays his own room and board, and I buy him a bottle of whisky every Saturday night. He also sleeps with my wife occasionally.’
‘That’s the guy I want to talk to…the half-wit,’ says the agent.
‘That would be me,’ replied the farmer.
At an auction in Glasgow a wealthy American announced that he had lost his wallet containing £10,000 and would give a reward of £100 to the person who found it.
From the back of the hall a Scottish voice shouted, “I’ll give £150!”
“Once more with feeling” said the nun to the bishop.

So I couldn’t sleep this morning.  (You read that right.  My current sleep pattern is I go to sleep about 4:30 – 5am and wake up about 12 – 1pm.  So it was this morning.)
I tried to decide what I was going to do.  I could keep watching Skins series 3.  Or possibly This Is England 86 episode 1.  I’ve also still got the last episode of Last of the Summer Wine to watch.  But I decided to get my writing on.
Between about 7am and now I’ve written:
¬ a 555 word review of Blood of the Cybermen for The Terrible Zodin (I replayed the game between 5:30 and 6)
¬ a 668 word review of TARDIS for The Terrible Zodin (as well as having replayed that game)
¬ The Tweet Vortex 2: Electric Boogaloo, which I had almost as much fun writing as I did the first one*.  That, again, was for The Terrible Zodin.  (493 words)
Just a small point.  Those may be the last things I ever write for TTZ.  They may not be, but they might be.  Just have to wait and see.
¬ and a 1,227 word short story for my creative writing class.  Which, as it turns out, starts back on Monday, not the following week as I originally thought.
I thought that I’d tortured my spellcheck enough with the TTV article (because of all the usernames and hashtags I’d used).  Then I got to this.  It’s in Doric.  (The idea was that I had to take some myths and legends and write a story round them.  So I chose a couple from Scotland that I could write a story around and set it in the North East.)  It went ballistic.  I actually had to completely switch off auto complete.
Incidentally, if anyone wants to read it and give me feedback, with the caveat that it is in Doric, drop me a note and let me know.
Now, I’m off into town to post a form I have to return and wander round the continental market in town.  My next entry will probably be about the blood donation from hell (don’t worry, it’s not going to bee too gruesome).

I have been reading (not that there’s actually been a hell of a lot of choice) about Pastor Terry Jones* and his plans for tomorrow.
When I first heard about his plan to turn September 11th into ‘International Burn a Koran Day’ I thought to myself, this sounds strangely familiar.  When the press started frothing at the mouth about the whole thing, dragging President Obama, William Hague and General Patreus into the mix, the feeling grew.  When he finally announced that he had decided against it (now changed to it being merely ‘on hold’) I knew where I’d heard of something like this before.
In Jon Ronson’s excellent book Them: Adventures With Extremists, he writes about the time he spent with Omar Bakri Mohammed, a London based Islamic extremist.  He quickly became hated in Britain for the things he was saying.
During the time he was was following Omar, the guy had a grand plan.  He was going to hire out the 14,000 seater London Arena and hold the worlds biggest Islamic rally.  Once word about this got out, media chaos ensued.  There was a lot of frothing at the mouth about how this was evil and shouldn’t be allowed.  There were calls for the Government to put a stop to the event.
Ronson tells about how Omar had a 4 stage plan for the event.  The fourth stage?  Cancellation.  Blaming the Government and the owners of the London Arena, he called the whole thing off and went instead to Speakers Corner at Hyde Park.
But this is the point.  As Ronson says, there was no way that Omar could afford the event unless it sold out.  Which it wouldn’t.  So, what was the point of the whole thing?  To get publicity for Omar, to get people talking about him.
I suspect that was the whole point of the pastor of a little, 50 strong church in Florida, doing this.  It’s not going ahead.  It was never meant to.
Or so I thought.  Then, when the event was cancelled, Pastor Jones stated that it was because the imam behind the community centre near 51 Park Place had agreed to move the centre.  Instead of burning books (an entirely pointless, though legal act that I personally disagree with**) he and another person would make a trip to New York.
Only problem is that the person responsible for the community centre hasn’t the foggiest idea what Pastor Jones is on about.  So the burning may be back on.
So it seems that I was wrong.  Well, partially.  I still believe that it was partly about publicity, it also appears to be some insane game of chicken with the imam planning 51 Park Place.  But here’s where Pastor Jones has messed up.  He thinks that if community centre isn’t moved then people will blame them for his actions.  Sadly, he overstepped by having announced that the centre would be moved.  Now, he has to go ahead with the burning (cos I don’t think the centre will be moved, nor should it be or his reputation will be even more ruined than it is now.
Oh, to all those Christians who are now at pains to point out that Jones doesn’t represent all Christians, can we now agree that not all Islamic extremists represent all Muslims.  No?  Ah well, nice try.

Have some Belle and Sebastian:
Take Your Carriage Clock And Shove It Lyrics:
In the board room the quiet man takes a
Second to think what to do
He’s out of his seat and he’s starting to speak
And he hears his own voice
For years and years he’s done nothin but bow down and put up with all their 
demands
She sits like a viper and offers the clock 
Without giving a damn 
He takes it 
Honour forbids me but honour be damned 
You have whined till you got what you want
I did the work and when things would go badly 
You left us to rot 
He locked the door of the boardroom
And turned like the scene from the old country song
Towering over the table he’s lost
He is drunk with it all
You only
Came back to us when we’d turned it around
When we’d rescued your arse from fire
Your contribution to all that we did was to say
It was dire
Night after day after night I’ve been working
Despite of you fucking us all
Now I’m gonna die I don’t care if you cry
Just please leave me alone
And spare those tears for yourself
We’ve had those till we’re sick
You should leave while you still have the chance
The others were shocked at this shameful disgrace
At the end of an honoured career
He paused in the silence to pull down his tie
And observe the melee

I’ve just made an appointment to give blood.  Still waiting on hearing exactly what time I have to go.  Why am I mentioning this?  It’ll be my first appointment using my shiny new silver card!
(Not that I’ll actually get to use it, cos they sent me the health check form so they’ll just use that instead.)
Thinking about getting a new badge for my rucksack.
Also need to see about getting a cork board for my room.  Getting sick of having to hunt around for important documents.
Also really wish I could afford OD+.  I miss the longer notes and I really, really miss not being able to search my diary.
Went to see Scott Pilgrim last weekend.  If you haven’t seen it yet, why the fuck not.  Go.  Now!  (I don’t care if the cinema is actually shut.  Wait outside till it opens then go see it.)
Got some writing done yesterday.  I finally got my article for 9:06 written (and was surprised to discover that I’d written about something I hadn’t thought I had) and a couple of articles for TTZ including one which references both World Wars (and a fictional third one), The Time Travellers Wife, Donnie Darko and Watchmen.  To be honest, I think that one is the strongest article I’ve written yet.  Two morw to write including, for those of you who read the zine (and if you don’t, you should, cos it’s awesome, download it from the link above) another Tweet Vortex, which I’m looking forward to writing greatly.
Had a couple of fun afternoons this week.  Wednesday, met up with the folk from my creative writing class.  I did think I’d have to pull out due to a lack of fundage, but someone kindly offered to pay for me.  We were in the restaurant for about 4 hours just talking random nonsense, just like we do in class.  It was great meeting up with everyone again.
Though I think I may have been talked into a night out with two of them.  Both of whom smoke on nights out.  Looks like I’ll need a big pouch of baccy then…
Yeaterday, met up with a couple of friends for a pint or five.  Again, we talked random bollocks (mostly football).  Annoyingly, we went to one place that had selected drinks for £1.  When we tried ordering these drinks, we were charged full price.  Until the manager came along and I pointed out the mistake to him.  Then it got corrected.  The person serving us claimed that there was nothing she could do despite the offer starting at 6 and us getting there about 6:15.  GRRRRRR!
Still not heard back from SFX.  Keeping those fingers crossed.
Currently having fun with the priority inbox in Gmail.  Tis a good idea, wish they’d done it before.
Have a fun pic of me, taken at a friends house with her hat:

Also heard back about the writing comp.  Didn’t win.  Bugger.
I may have an entry in a day or two about the drama llama’s and OD being down recently.  Possibly.
My night?

Lager, champagne and footie.  Try telling me I have no class.
(Incidentally, the Chrome spellcheck suggestions for footie included cooties.  Hee!)

So, I have one of those mobile dongle thingys from 3 mobile (hence the reason I was actually able to do blogathon [well, alternathon] this year.
Now, I was having a problem with my modem getting disconnected whenever it got nudged even slightly.  I phoned 3 and they arranged to send a replacement modem along with an envelope so I could return the broken one for repair.
Now, please bear in mind when you see the following picture, which shows the envelope that they gave me to return the broken modem, that it was a like for like replacement:

In other words, they sent that bag to return that modem.
Seems like overkill to me…
Oh, and for those of you keeping up, I got my falsies yesterday.  Here they are:

And here they are in my mouth:

Downside?  I have to take them out to eat and I basically have to relearn how to talk (I sound a bit like Sean Connery, speech impediment et al.).
Upside?  I can still smoke and I can still mess about with my tongue piercing (which I tend to do when I’m bored/concentrating).  In fact, I have new things in my mouth to bounce it off!

719,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/hmmmm-editx2-3930358/,2010-08-15,Hmmmm… *EDITX2*,"
So, I had my second to last dentist appointment today.  This one was to try on wax versions of my false teeth to make sure they would fit ok and that I wouldn’t have any problems biting.  Everything went fine so next week I actually get my teeth.  Then I never have to visit that torture chamber ever again.
To be honest, I’l probably just use my falsies for things like job interviews and other such important events.  I’ve got used to the way things are so I don’t consider them to be essential.  We’ll see though.
Today was the deadline for applying for the SFX job.  So it’s probably a bit unrealistic expecting them to respond already.  Today is also supposed to be the day that the winner of the Perfectly Formed short story competition is to be announced so I don’t think it’s too unrealistic to be getting annoyed that hasn’t happened yet.  I’m fairly sure I’d know by now if I was the winner but I live in hope.
Or denial.
Turns out I didn’t have as much to talk about as I thought.  My fight with Talkmobile is finally over (yay!) and I’m just waiting for 3 mobile to get in touch regarding a problem with my broadband dongle.  Not that I’m actually going to tell them how the problem started to begin with (basically, I dropped my laptop on the floor one night and it landed on the side the dongle is on, meaning the connector is at an odd angle.  It’s just recently decided to disconnect whenever I move the laptop, which is quite a bit, or even nudge the dongle slightly.  Which, as you can probably imagine, is ever so slightly fucking annoying.  Except for ‘ever so slightly’ read extremely).
And that, ladies and gentlefolk, is how one pads out an otherwise short and crap entry.  Now, it’s long and crap.
I’m also waiting for the latest episode of Mad Men to download so that when I go home I can have my now weekly Mad Men triple bill.
Which is always good.
Fun fact: did you know that the song that people regularly call Another Brick in the Wall (the one that got to Christmas number one over here) is, in fact called Another Brick in the Wall Pt 2?
Don’t say you never learn anything from me.
Will
*EDIT* Just found out, from a reply to someone from Books Quarterly’s Twitter account that they need an extra 10 days to choose a winner due to number/quality of entries.
While I understand why the need for the extra time, and actually appreciate the fact they don’t want to rush things, a courtesy email explaining the situation, or even updating the competition website to let people know what had happened would have been fucking nice.
I have contacted them through Twitter to let them know my feelings (without the swearing).  Doubt I’ll hear back though…
Will
*EDIT X 2*
So, they finally emailed today (a day to late) and the winner will be contacted on the 27th.  Wish me luck.
Will

722,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/yay-i-can-has-phone-back-3930355/,2010-08-09,Yay!  I can has phone back!,"
So, here’s the thing.
Towards the end of last month, I discovered that the bluetooth on my phone had decided not to work.  Now, this was a problem due to the fact that I regularly used the bluetooth on my phone.  Mostly the headset for making/receiving calls but also to move pictures from my phone to my laptop.
So, this was a bit of an embuggerance.
I contacted Samsung about the problem and they said I could either send it in for repair or I could go to an authorised centre to get fixed.  Nearest one to me is in Newcastle, the next nearest is York.  So that’d be a no then.
I arranged with a friend to borrow his phone for a couple of weeks while mine was away and sent it in for repair.  Each day I checked on the Samsung website for an update.  Last Monday I got a shock when it said on the site that the repair had been cancelled.  I emailed Samsung to find out what was happening and they told me it was out of their hands and gave me the number of the company I needed to contact.  I called them only to discover that Samsung were a bunch of lying liars who lie.  They hadn’t looked at my phone yet but it would be back with me shortly.
Well, it arrived today.  I has my phone back!  I can’t tell you how excited I am.  Being able to text without deleting half a million times!  Internet on my phone!  Being able to listen to music!  A decent camera!
And, because I have installed a new bluetooth stack on my computer (so I can use my bluetooth headset with Skype (not that anyone actually speaks to me on Skype though)), apparently I can now link my phone up to my computer and use my computer microphone and speakers to make calls!  I’m going to test this one out later.
Ah, the joys of geeking out to strange things.
Will

724,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/whee-102-3930353/,2010-08-05,Whee!,"
Wow, thanks for the notes on my previous entry.  I’m always worried when I write an entry like that, that people will think I’m being a bit of an arse and just advise me to shut up.
Also thanks to the person who nominated it for readers choice.
Had a fun night last night.  Yesterday was payday so me and three friends hit the pub for a random night out and cheap pints.  Despite the fact that it was ridiculously cheap, still managed to spend more than I was planning to.  Also, had about £2 in 20p pieces in my pocket when I woke up this morning.  When you end up with a load of change in your pocket, it’s always the sign of a good night.
Just about recovered from the alternathon, I think.  Thus far, I’ve raised £45 (one person couldn’t get to my justgiving page so donated straight to Shelter through their website).  It may be more cos someone else said they had problems donating through justgiving and said they’d donate straight to them as well, but I have no idea if they did or not, never mind how much it was.
But £45 isn’t a bad amount of money.  I’d have preferred more but never mind.  My justgiving page is still active if anyone does want to donate but I’ll probably close it out the beginning of next week.
I also found the ideal job for me today.  Editorial assistant for SFX magazine.  Get paid to write about sci-fi and fantasy?  Where do I sign up?  I’d pay them to let me do this job.  As part of the application, I have to submit a 400 word review of a TV programme or comic book.  I was hoping to use my review of The Beast Below from the last issue of TTZ (available here folks!) but sadly it’s about 200 words too long.  I do have my as yet unpublished review of K9 and Company that is within the word count but, seeing as how I recommend that people DON’T watch the show, I’m not sure that would be appropriate.
Which means that I’m going to have to watch a sci-fi TV show and write a review.  Which I’m absolutely gutted about. [/sarcasm]
Pics!
I went out on Wednesday and got a load of pics of two different things.  Here’s the first one.
I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again.  One of the great things about living in Boro is the completely random things you may see.  Like this in one of the shopping centres:












It was to promote the Billingham International Folklore Festival.  And tomorrow, if you’re all good little boys and girls, I’ll let you see some dinosaurs.
Hope everyone’s having a good day.

"
725,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/gay-marriage-34-3930352/,2010-08-03,Gay marriage,"
This wasn’t the entry that I was planning to write, but it’s just broken and I think it’s great news.  A judge has just ruled that proposition 8, which banned gay marriage in California is unconstitutional and has overturned it.  This will, of course, be appealed and the issue will likely end up in the Supreme Court.
My attitude?  Like I said before, it’s good news.  Now, I know what the objections will be so let me work through them as best I can.
It’s unnatural!  Well, let’s start with the point that one does not chose to be gay or straight.  I certainly can’t remember a time when i sat down and decided ‘Y’know what?  For the rest of my life I’m going to be interested sexually only in females.’  With that said, it’s probably gay marriage they say is unnatural.  My response?  It used to be unnatural for people of two different races to marry.  Times change.
But if you allow the gays to marry then before long people will be wanting to marry their horse/cat/dog/dolphin/toaster/bedroom wall/(insert other insane scaremongering thing here!  Oh, please, do make with the fucking off right now.  Really?  Really?  You think THAT’S actually a valid argument?
But it’ll ruin the sanctity of marriage!  This, by the way, goes hand in hand with the ‘gays can’t keep their hands to themselves and are insanely promiscuous’ argument.  That argument is also used to argue in favour of keeping gays out the military.  It’s also not true.  Gays ruining the sanctity of marriage?  Yeah, cos I’ve never heard of straight people cheating on their spouses, getting divorced or committing bigamy.  That never happen.  Hell, some of the things that have been done by straight people in marriages it may well be that that needs banning.
But the Bible says Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve!  You know what else is in the bible?  There was Adam, Eve and their two SONS.  And from them came everyone else in the world.  I’ve got a feeling there may have been a wee bit of incest going on there.  Either that or Adam and Eve had more children, in which case, the Bible probably isn’t as accurate as we’re led to believe.
It’ll ruin the country!  Over here, we’ve had gay marriage (well, OK, civil partnerships) for quite a while now.  It was the banking industry that nearly destroyed the country.
My personal opinion?  Ban marriage.  I’m serious.  I’m against any and all types of discrimination.  So, ban marriage.  Civil partnerships for all, gay or straight.  Then, if it’s really important to you and you can find someone willing to do it, have the union blessed in the church, cathedral, mosque or synagogue of your choice.
That, to me, seems like the most sensible way to do things.
Will

Everyone thought of him as being mild mannered.  In keeping with his job as a dentist.  Or oral hygienist as some would insist on calling him.  He didnt go much with that.  He trained as a dentist and, above all, was somewhat of a traditionalist.
He did seem to fit the profile though.  Didnt drink much, didnt smoke, never cheated on his wife, loving father, etc, etc.  Which is why what happened surprised some people.
There were a few things about him that caused some surprise.  The fact that he was a pro-wrestling fan.  Not even he could explain exactly why he liked that strange pseudo-sport.  There was just something about it that appealed.  Maybe it was the fact that even though the results were pre-determined (a fact which people never tired of pointing out to him) the was a skill to getting to that point.  Maybe it was, in some sick way, the fact that the wrestlers could improvise if something went wrong and they needed to.
Being Canadian, his love for ice hockey was slightly more understandable, if still not in keeping with the image others had of him.  He simply couldnt remember a time when he didnt like it.  He had tried watching baseball, football and basketball but found them all to be a bit too slow.  Only soccer had come close to matching the speed and end to end excitement of pro hockey.
The one thing hockey and wrestling had in common was the violence.  Ice hockey was the only sport he could think of where violence was in the rules.  He knew well of the long since rescinded rule that a fight could only be broken up once both of the original fighters were on the ice.  And the players were tough.  He personally had carried out emergency root canal surgery on a player during the second period only to watch the guy take the ice at the start of the third.  (This gained him a small amount of notoriety when the player in questioned publicly thanked him during a post game interview.)
As a kid he had even entertained thoughts of playing in the NHL himself.  Unfortunately, while a not bad player, he wasnt quite good enough, unusual name aside.  But he still played in a local league on a weekend.  Turned out to be good for business as most of the players in the league were on his books at work.
He would never forget that day, coming home early and catching them at it in the spare room.  His wife and someone he had thought of as a friend.  Someone he knew from another team.  His wife had begged for a second chance but was currently staying at her sisters with the divorce proceedings having started.  And the following weekend he looked across the ice at him.  The guy who had helped rip his family apart.  As usual, during the game a fight had broken out.  A true bench clearer.  He saw the guy lying on the ice.  He would never be able to say what went through his mind as he skated over, nor if the incident was pre-planned.
The dentist smiled as he cleaned the blood off his ice skating boots.

Time travel is a bitch.  Seriously.  Unless you can do it, I don’t think you actually know how many problems it actually presents.
Age for example.  To look at me, you’d think that I was early to mid 30’s.  But I’ve spent that much time going back and forth between different time zones I really don’t know how old I am.
The other thing is the nakedness.  As you may expect, I can’t take anything that’s not actually a part of my body.  I even tried the trick of putting things actually inside my body but with absolutely no luck.
There are cool things about it though.  Getting to see historic events, for example.  I’ve been to Woodstock, the very first Glastonbury, the assassination of JFK, Abraham Lincon, the 1966 World Cup and seen the footage of the first man landing on Mars.
I am, however, slightly worried that I may in fact be my own father…

Nope, that seems to be the lot.
What was in the wallet?
Lets see.  25 in cash, my old student cards, my union lifetime membership, couple of condoms, my bank card, my blood donor card, my organ donor card, my mobile top up card and some cinema tickets.
You write down you pin at all?
Nope.  Im not that stupid.  Hello again doctor.
Hello Mr Danielson.  Sorry officer, I can wait if you need me to.
Come right in, its fine.
OK.  Ive had a look at the x ray and nothing seems to be broken, so you can leave.  Dont do anything too strenuous tonight and if you do get too much pain just take some ibuprofen.
How are you getting home Mister Danielson?
Probably walk.
Come on, Ill give you a lift.
Cheers.  Hopefully, I wont see you soon doc.
Hopefully not.
Dont suppose you smoke, do you?
Sorry, no such luck.  Where you headed?

Fucking hell mate, you look a right state.
Yeah, even more so than usual.
Oh, cheers.
What the fuck happened?
Someone wanted all my money and my smokes.  Then I ran into his fist.  And feet.
So we can see.  Bit surprised to get the text from you now Ive seen that.
Guy was a bit of a stupid twat to be honest.  Took my money and my smokes but ignored my phone and laptop.
Well, one thing Ive learnt in my time in Boro, the people that do these things are a bit thick.  Seems to be the done thing.
I would be offended by that, but its true.  So, no money?  What do you want to drink?
Pint.
Hang on, should he be drinking?
What would you do in this situation?
Besides, the doctor told me to take painkillers.  Cant think of a better one.
So, a pint and a double vodka and coke.
Just the pint please.
I think this calls for a spirit.  They dont serve whisky so a pint and the vodka it is.  Back in a sec.
Here you go.  Think you could do with this as well.
Cheers.  Ill just nip outside, smoke this and take this call.

777,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/heres-yer-answers-3930300/,2010-07-29,Here’s yer answers,"
This’ll be quick, there weren’t many questions.
Steven the Rill asked:
OK, my 1st question is what were your “must not miss” TV shows when you were a kid?
Oh, God.  Let’s see.  Doctor Who (natch), Pob, Number 73, 8:15 to Manchester, Wide Awake Club/WACaday, He Man, She Ra, Going Live, Transformers, Button Moon, Knightmare, The Whingin’ Pom (I think that’s what it was called), Round the Twist, Terrahawks, Captain Scarlet, Rainbow, Thunderbirds and many, many more…
My 2nd question is what was the first film you ever saw at the cinema?
As far as I can remember it was either Masters of the Universe or All Dogs go to Heaven.  Apparently my parents took the entire family to see ET but I fell asleep (never actually watched that film).
toile_de_jouy wanted to know:
Is there anything worth watching on (British) TV now? I haven’t watched anything since A2A & DW finished.
This is a tough one, since TV goes on a sort of hiatus during summer.  Not to say there aren’t good things on.  The Silence (of which I’ve still to see the end so no spoilers) was good as was Dive.  Sherlock I’ve heard nothing but good things about (do have it downloaded but still to watch) but that’s not much of a surprise since the Vast Toffee is behind it.  If you’re downloading stuff, the new season of the ridiculously sublime Mad Men has started Stateside.  Apart from that, basically Top Gear is good fun even if, like me, you’re not a petrolhead, Dragons Den is always interesting and Young, Dumb and Living  Off Mum is always a good laugh.
And finally, we have oobi:
What is your all-time favourite movie?
Don’t have one all time favourite film, sorry.  And if I were to list my favourite films we’d be here a while.
What is your all-time favourite TV show?
Again, not really one all time favourite.  I will say, however, that the new version of Battlestar Galactica is the best TV show of all time.
Who is your favourite comedian in TV or film?
The Monty Python crew.
What is the best movie solely based on special effects?
Terminator 2.  A lot of the stuff is commonplace nowadays but, at the time, it was groundbreaking.
Who is your favourite Buffy character and why?
Anya.  I always love a character who says the most inappropriate things at the worse possible time.  Though her fruit cups speech in The Body is absolutely heart breaking.
Who do you think River Song is?
From twitter: My theory is that River Song is the Face of Boe, Ace, Ramona Flowers, The Editor, Daisy Steiner, Colin Mathews and Sandra Dee
I don’t have an opinion.  I’m not stressing about it too much.  I like the fact that there’s this big mystery and I’m going to wait to let it unfold.
Inception: Rating? review?
Review in 5 words: Christopher Nolan, you magnificent bastard.
Longer review:  Christopher Nolan is seemingly on a mission to prove that big action blockbuster films can have imagination as well.  This started with The Dark Knight and continues in spectacular fashion with Inception.  This isn’t a movie that you can watch for the first time with your brain switched off.  It’s cleverly constructed, has brilliant set pieces, great acting (with Tom Hardy stealing the show) and a final shot that’s not entirely unexpected (well, to me anyway) but will leave you thinking when you leave the cinema.
What is your favourite american/US based TV show?
The Wire.  Without a shadow of a doubt, The Wire.  If you’ve seen it, you’ll know what I’m talking about.  If you haven’t, ignore how good you’ve been told it is.  It’s much, much better.
Do you watch Neighbours or Home & Away?
Used to, years ago.  Back in the Scott and Charlene days, when the shows had just started out.  Don’t really bother nowadays though.  Actually, I can’t remember the last time I watched them.
And that’s your lot.  My next entry will be the first ODAHQ entry so, read as much as you can during the 24 hours, give me encouragement (not sure how much OD/note I’ll be doing but I will appreciate it nonetheless) and also consider donating as my one current donation is getting a bit lonely.

As you lot are probably aware, I was planning to take part in this years blogathon.
Then they decided, 5 days after we were supposed to be able to sign up to take part, not to run it.
Bugger.
Thankfully, some lovely people here in OD land managed to get an alternathon up and running extremely quickly.  You can find out more about that here
So, I’m going to be doing that instead.
I decided that seeing as how I’m not able to write an entry at the best of times, never mind 48 in one day, I’m going to try and write a story.  In 48 chapters.  In a day.  I must be mad…
I’m going to be raising money for Shelter, a homeless charity over here.  It was started in the wake of the Ken Loach directed TV programme Cathy Come Home which examines homelessness and how easy it is to slip into.  It had a huge impact at the time and, although the world has moved on from 1966, homelessness is still a huge issue.  If you can get hold of a copy of the show, I highly recommend it, though it’s not easy viewing.
You can find out more about Shelter here and if you want to sponsor me you can do so here

So, I’m all ready to head up the road on Monday.  Well, still got packing to do but that’ll get done on Sunday night.
Although, annoyingly, they’ve decided that my mums kitchen is going to get done on the Thursday.  Which means that I could have headed up to Aberdeen on Tuesday and not missed the goodies at creative writing this week.  And I wouldn’t mind not having to rush round like a blue arsed fly on Monday morning either.  Not only that, but Thursday is pay day.  So I’m going to have to wait until mum gets home from work before I can head into town to get money out the bank.
Apparently, I’m getting a new employment coach at A4e.  Don’t know what that’s about, just got woken up by a phone call this morning saying I’m getting a new employment coach so I don’t need to go in for job search on Monday.  Not that I was planning to anyway.
Tumble dryer is broken.  Unable to hand washing out in back yard.  Too bloody hot to have radiators switched on.  So I’m drying my washing by hanging it out my bedroom window.
You know my plan for writing for at least 2 hours a day?  Yeah…  But the plan is to get over not being able to smoke between Newcastle and Aberdeen by writing.
Am just about ready for Blogathon.  If only they’d let me sign up…
And that’s about it.  Away to the launch of Writer Block North east and then to a mates house to watch the footie.  Hopefully, they’ll have the other telly on with the Murray – Nadal match.
Have a good Friday y’all.

‘If you could get one gift, just one gift, for the rest of your life, what would it be?’
‘Hmmm, that’s a hard choice.  Would I go for the unlimited free internet, the everlasting bottle of Dr Pepper, the everlasting pint of lager, Aberdeen to win the league each season…  I dunno, really.  You?’
‘Not sure.  I’m torn between the everlasting peace, the everlasting bank account…’
‘I know what I’d get you.’

Front

Now, this is cool.  The band Orbital are huge Doctor Who fans.  A staple of their live sets for years has been their version of the Doctor Who theme, which they’ve refused to put on an album, leaving it as something for their gigs.
Like at Glastonbury this year.  With a rather special guest…
(Incidentally, who do I have to kill to get this to replace the current, and very, very crap, theme?)

790,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/answer-time-edit-3930287/,2010-06-25,Answer time *EDIT*,"
You had the questions, I have the answers.  First up is Search Results:
1. Why HAVEN’T you eaten haggis? Next thing you’ll tell me is that you don’t know how to play bagpipes. Then I’ll be pissed.
Why?  Not really had the opportunity to, to be honest.  My mum doesn’t like it and with my dad working away from home most the time she never made it.  I’m not really that bothered to be honest.  If it happens it happens.
And, no, I can’t play the pipes.  I don’t play any instrument.
2. If you had to read a book about a period in history, what period of history would it be?
I’m not that big on historical fiction.  I do like reading about the 60’s though.
3. What are the last good book you read and last good movie you’ve seen?
Book: The Passage by Justin Cronin.  It was released yesterday so I’m looking forward to finally having people to talk about it with.
Film: The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo.  Hollywood should just give up now.  No way their version will be better.
One more. If you had to eat human flesh, what body part would you eat and how would you prepare it? 
Oh God.  Really have no idea, sorry.
ONE MORE. Well, three. Rage Against The Machine advocates on behalf of death row inmate Mumia Abu Jamal.
Is Mumia innocent of the charges against him?
Have to read more into the case, but it does appear dodgy.
Is Mumia the best cause celebre to rally around in order to protest the inherent cruelty of the US death penalty?
Well, and I really hate to put it like this, someone has to be.  If it wasn’t him then it would have been someone else.
Is it okay to divorce the artist from their actions, or do their actions color their art? 
I’m a huge Michael Jackson and Chris Benoit fan.  I think you can work out where I stand from that.
Next up, we have SHARPSkinkid:
Have you ever listened to Frightened Rabbit? They’re a Scottish indie band and are getting pretty good reception in the States.
Never heard of them till you mentioned them in the question.  (I’m shit with new music in general.)  Found some of their stuff online and they’re not bad.
I capture the castle showed up next:
Questions: if you could be character in a book, who would you be/why?
That’s a tough one.  On balance, I’d have to say Richard from The Beach.  Cos I’ve got an unrequited dream of travelling someday.
 what book can you simply not get through/have given up with trying to read it?
Twilight.  What’s wrong with it? Well, nothing if you don’t count the appalling writing, the cliché storm and incredibly uneven pacing. Oh, and the fact that the main character is a complete Mary Sue who can do absolutely no wrong (I counted at least one crash she was in that was partly her fault only to be told it wasn’t) who is so super special (despite being kind of a bitch) that us poor blokes have no choice except to fall desperately in love with her upon the merest glimpse of her.
I didn’t even get to the sparkly vampires bit, which is just as well cos I’d have probably broken my laptop.
 & thirdly, what about an aberdeen meet-up? I know there are a few more that live around here
I wouldn’t mind meeting up with some of you in meatspace.
Steven the Rill has a time and space question:
What’s your favourite episode, so far, from this present season of Doctor Who?
Well, depending on what happens tonight, this might change (I think in terms of stories not individual episodes) but so far, the answer has to be Amy’s Choice.  I just thought it was incredibly well done and the Dream Lord was fantastic.  Worse is the Silurian two parter.  But I’m not surprised considering it was written by the guy who previously wrote a real time episode which was notable for not being in real time…
*EDIT* I caved and watched tonights Doctor Who online.  I’m going to change this one.  The Pandorica Opens/The Big Bang is my favourite.  Best series finale since the show comes back.
The Silurian episodes are still the worse though.
Another musical one, this time from *JenJen*:
Imogen Heap? For or against? Or any opinion at all, if you don’t know who she is x x x x 
She has a good voice, but it’s not my cup of tea.
And finally, we have pierced_poet:
question – i’m in your neck of the woods for 24 hours and you’ve decided to play tour guide of your city. Where would we go? and what would we do? 🙂 
To be honest, I’d rather be answering this about Aberdeen, cos there’s not much to do in Boro.  Lets see.  Well, the Transporter bridge is a must.  Hopefully it’d be working so we could have a trip on it.  I suppose while we’re there I could show you Temenos even if I do still think it looks like a giant wind sock.  We’d definitely have to visit MIMA and see what art is there.  On our way to Albert Park, we could make a quick trip to the Dorman museum.  Probably find the time to visit a few local hostelry’s and try and get you to try a parmo before you have to go.
what are the 6 geek tattoo ideas? [pierced_poet]
I didn’t actually say 6 geek tattoos I said about 6 tattoos most of which were geeky.  They are: dragon tattoo adapted from the cover of Runaways issue 7, the number 42 in binary using a computer font and in dark green, either a TARDIS or a sonic screwdriver, another Doctor Who tattoo and a Subtle Knife from the His Dark Materials.
And that’s your lot.  Thanks to all who asked questions.
Will

I think I’m about ready to go with the time travel story thing.  Just about got enough worked out in my head to make a go of it, I think.  My plan with my writing is going to be to do at least two hours per day.  depending on other things.  Thursday, for example, I’ve got the dentist so after that I’ll probably mooch off to Lloyds to borrow their internet connection and download stuff so not sure how much I’ll get done then.
Also thinking about taking part in Blogathon this year.  I’ve wanted to before but have always been hindered by a lack of 24 hour internet access.  However, I now have one of those mobile dongle things so I should be able to do it this year.  More or less decided what charity I’ll be raising money for but I’m still not sure if I’ll be trying to write normal entries.  Kind of like the idea of writing a story for it, to be honest.
(In case your wondering, the dongle has a 15 gig a month download limit.  Hence why I still mooch off the pub wi-fi.  For example, on Thursday I’ll be downloading Doctor Who and Confidential, Treme, Party Down, stuff from the iPlayer and the new Eminem album.  That’ll take a hefty chunk out of things.)
Speaking of the good Doctor, I won’t be watching this weeks episode till Sunday at the earliest.  Let this be fair warning that anyone noting me with any sort of spoiler before then will be invited to take as trip through the Time Vortex without the aid of a Vortex Manipulator.
I need to get myself a new printer.  Problem is, nowhere round here has any that are cheap.  I’ll keep looking in charity shops and may possibly post something on freecycle, see if that gets any response.
Had quite a relaxing weekend.  I went round to a friends house to watch the England game on Friday and ended up staying till Sunday.  I had a laugh, much beer was consumed (I think i still have a photo on my phone of all my cans), got to watch doctor Who as broadcast and just generally chilled out.
Though, I do have to say that the Sony 3D TV advert gave me a headache.
Got my tickets for going home.  Also got a ticket for a free screening of Breakfast At Tiffany’s which is on the Tuesday.  Well, got my holding ticket, which I have to print out and  swap for my ticket.  Which I won’t be able to do until the day of.  Actually, just before the film starts.  Unless I can sweet talk my mum into printing it out and taking it in for me.
Don’t forget, I’m still looking for questions.  I’ll answer them probably Friday or Saturday.
Will
 


 






 
"
792,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/few-things-8-3930285/,2010-06-16,Few things,"
First of all, thank you for your feedback on my last entry.  Very useful.  If you have no idea what I’m on about and would like to, click back an entry.  After you’ve read this one, obviously.
Secondly, you’ll be glad to know that the interview went well.  Well, OK, I was slightly late due to the bloody bus, but apart from that, it went fine.  Although I did manage to make one of the interviewers jealous as she had tickets for the Rage gig but didn’t go.
Thirdly, I’ve decided to do a survey thing.  I got it from I capture the castle, but think it started with LJ:
Five things I am sick of being asked (and their respective answers) in no particular order:
Do you support Rangers or Celtic?
Cos Scotland only has the two clubs!  Ho, ho, ho, my sides are fucking splitting!  Where you from?  Newcastle?  So, do you support Man U, Chelsea, Arsenal or Liverpool?  Everyone from England supports one of them.

I’ve got a mate who lives in Glasgow.  Do you know them?
Why, yes, I do.  He says hi.  Cos, y’see, Scotland is such a phenomenally small place that I know each and every one of the 5 million inhabitants personally.  Seriously, you should see how many weddings I get invited to a week.
Does it hurt to get a tattoo?
Tell you what, I’ll pin you down and jab a needle into you multiple times very, very rapidly and let’s see how many yucks you have.
We don’t have any (insert lager brand name here) glasses, will another one do?
This is a recent one.  I don’t mind the branded glasses in general.  It makes it easier if you’re getting different types of beer.  But, here’s a tip for you.  What are you putting into the glass?  Is it what I ordered?  Then why the fuck should I give a damn what is on the side of the thing I’m drinking it out of?  ‘Well, I thought I ordered Carling but this glass says Fosters so they must have screwed up.’  Don’t think like that.  Sorry to disappoint.
Have you ever worn a kilt/drunk whisky/eaten haggis/eaten a deep fry Mars Bar?
In order: yes/yes (but my favourite is actually Welsh)/no/no.  Sorry if I disappointed you by not living up tom your stereotyped ideas.  It’s your own fucking fault.  You should be wearing a pin stripe suit and a bowler hat and carrying a briefcase and an umbrella.
Four things you probably don’t know about me:
I’m not keen on Blade Runner  Seen it, appreciate that, technically, it’s a marvel, couldn’t buy into it.
I have plans for for about 6 other tattoos  Most of which are geek related.
I have incredible trouble coming up with titles for things  This may not be a surprise to those who have read stuff for me but, yeah, titles and ending give me real difficulty.
I like to snack on picked onions  As in, I’ll happily buy a jar and just munch my way through till their gone.  I generally peel off a layer at a time.
Three things I believe:
Even if man made climate change does not exist, it’s still worth making changes  I do think it’s real, but even if it’s not, isn’t it worth it to make the planet nicer for future generations?
I may be a good enough writer to get published some day  I, as always, am dubious about my talent.  But people seem to like my stuff.  Until I do get published, I’m going to keep writing and honing my skills.
I’d like a beer  But, alas, I’m skint so I’ll just have to wait till tomorrow.
Two things I wish I could change about me:
My lack of money  It’s annoying.
My lack of confidence
One thing I can’t live without:
 
Nicotine
And finally, cos I haven’t done this in a while:
Ask me a question.  Will answer them sometime in the next week.
Will

793,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/quick-writing-type-question-3930284/,2010-06-15,Quick writing type question,"
So, I’ve got an idea for a time travel book.  Even got a title, which is rare for me.
The time traveller in question is the main character.  Do you think it’s important for him to be seen visiting some important historical events or would it be OK to mention that he did and leave it at that?
The plan at the moment is the later as I worry that it might take you out of the story to stop and say, for example, ‘And here’s the details of me at the crucifixion)’.  But maybe I’m wrong and not doing so would annoy readers.
What do you think?  Don’t worry, there’s no right or wrong answer.

So, here it is.  Finally.  The entry about the Rage Factor.
Last week, I woke up ridiculously early and couldn’t get back to sleep.  So I took the time to write my homework for my creative writing class, get it over and done with.
Then I decided to head to the LRC to go online briefly before I had to catch the bus.  Got there only to discover that the network was down and there was no internet.  Hmmm.
Went for a wonder round town and decided to go for a wander round MIMA, as it had been a while since I was last there (I believe it was the Top Gear thing).  They had an exhibition in connection with the AV festival on the ground floor.  Some of the stuff was interesting.  I also got to steal something.
One of the exhibits is called The Stacks.  It’s two stacks of paper, each stack with something written on each sheet.  On one stack it says Somewhere better than this place and on the other it says Nowhere better than this place.  And here’s the rub.  The artist gave them an ideal stack height.  Visitors were invited to take a piece of the paper if they wanted.  So I did:


So, basically, I stole a piece of art with permission :¬)
Came home and watched The Cut and the last episode of the last series of 
Mad Men.  Then I headed back to the LRC to give my laptop to a friend to look after.   (Obviously, I didn’t want to take it to the gig with me, but I didn’t want to leave it at home when I wasn’t there either.)  I then headed to the bus station to catch the bus to Manchester.
The bus driver was a bit strange.  He snapped at someone who wanted to get off briefly at the bus station for having delayed us, but then (due to the toilet on the bus being out of order) made a comfort stop for us.  I finished reading one book and started re-reading another one only to discover that I didn’t have a bookmark.  Then I realised that I had my hair bands with me and thus was discovered impromptu uses for a hair band #1: bookmark.  Got into Manchester about 20 minutes late and met up with Jemma.  We wondered round Mancherster for a bit then she took me for a drink in one of her favourite bars.  It’s a tiny, tiny underground place that’s actually really cool.  Unfortunately, a bunch of drunk idiots followed us in but we didn’t have to sit anywhere near them.  Jemma knows the bar staff and got us permission to sit behind the bar.
Couple of pints there and we headed back to hers.  We watched I’m In A Rock And Roll Band Live, which annoyed me because Led Zeppelin won the vote for best band, beating The Beatles and Queen.  Now Don’t get me wrong, I do like Led Zep, but I’m trying to work out in which universe they are actually better than the Beatles.  It was while watching this and messing about I discovered impromptu uses for a hair band #2: device to hold your can of beer without having to, y’know, grip it.
(I also believe that you can use them to keep your hair in place.)
After 8 cans of lager, Jerry Maguire and South Park, we finally went to sleep about 3.  Only to be woken up at 7:30 so I could go and catch the bus.  Got the tram back into town and then went to the pick up point.  We stood around for about half an hour then the bus turned up.  I gave Jemma a goodbye hug and boarded.  I settled into my seat and started reading.  Then the bus driver (who was really cool) said that he’d hang about a bit longer to make sure there were no stragglers and if anyone smoked we should get out and have a smoke as he wasn’t planning on stopping.  He also pointed out that by law we were supposed to wear our seat belts and could face a £60 on the spot fine if stopped by the police and we weren’t.
I got off the bus, had another smoke, spoke to Jemma briefly (she hung around to wave me off) gave her another goodbye hug and got back on board.  Then we set off.
The trip there was fairly uneventful except for two things.  It turned out that we did have to stop due to the fact that it was either stop at the Watford Gap (after which I joked that it was fine that we were in the south as I’d had my inoculations) and then, when we started off again, someone came to speak to me and I discovered that we were born in the same hospital.
When we got there, the directions to the gig were simple.  Follow this road to get there, reverse to get back to the bus.  So I set off.  After about a 15 minute walk, I found the entrance to the gig and, more importantly, the ticket office (as my ticket hadn’t turned up).  I waited in the queue and took out the pieces of ID I needed.  Finally, finally, after months of waiting and a week of stress, god-awful hold music, I had my ticket in my hand.  Instead if going straight in, I went for a wander round the park as I’m not sure if I’ll be back there again.  Then I went in, after a security check that was quite funny.  (Top tip: never ask me to empty my pockets due to the amount of crap I usually carry with me.)
I looked round the fun fair, the food stands and wished I had the money to buy myself a t shirt (I’ve since bought one online.  I’ll post pics when I get it).  Found a piece of grass to sit on and listened to the music they were playing while I waited for it to start.  I did think it was going to rain, and it did start spitting a couple of times, but the weather held out, thankfully.  Then the first band came on.  The reviews:
Gallows: I’d never heard of them before they were announced as one of the support acts.  I got hold of their album Grey Britain and found it to be really good.  Well, live, these guys fucking rock.  Plenty of fan interaction (for example, getting us to boo Justin Bieber as he was playing a gig at Wembley that night).  They even got us to start a huge Dio chant.  They came out to the National Anthem (making it the first time I’d ever seen people throwing devils horns to that particular song) and from their opening cover of God Save the Queen to the final song on the set they never gave less than 100%.  Fucking awesome.
Roots Manuva: I must admit I was a bit disappointed with these guys.  I am a fan of their music but it just didn’t work for some reason.  Don’t get me wrong, they were good, but I just felt there was something missing.  It’s possibly because they were the wrong type of act for this event, I’m not sure.
Gogol Bordello: Again, I listened to some of their stuff online when they were announced.  I wasn’t massively impressed.  In fact I thought they were crap and wondered if there was something I was missing.  Turns out that thing was seeing them live.  They were brilliant.  I still wouldn’t buy their music, but if they were on the line up at a gig I was going to, I wouldn’t be too disappointed.  How often is it you get to see someone singing while stood on a bass drum being held up by the audience?
Rage Against The Machine: Now for the reason we were there.Interestingly, they were introduced by Simon Colwell.  Well, a crudely animated version:
Then an air raid siren went off as a huge banner with a giant red star on it was raised in the background.  Then the band hit the stage and the madness began.  It’s actually easier than you think to enjoy music while pressed up against a metal barrier.  Water was being freely distributed by the security guards (when they weren’t hauling people out).  After the first song, Zac De La Rocha stated that they never saw us coming at Christmas, which is true enough.  It was also gratifying that one of the biggest cheers of the night went to the Mortons, the couple who started the whole thing, when they came onto the stage to accept a cheque from the band on behalf of Shelter.  (Inspired by the Mortons asking people to donate money to the charity as well as/instead of buying the song, Rage donated every penny they made from the sales of the song to Shelter.  The total is over £100,000.)
After the last song the band left, but ~I had a sneaky feeling that wasn’t the end of the gig.  There was one song they hadn’t played that I was sure they would.  Sure enough, on the screens, accompanied by The Climb (the X-Factor song last year), various quotes from the whole thing flashed up.  It then informed us how many singles the X-Factor single sold.  Then there was the sound of a record scratching as up on the screen, in red, came the word Rage followed by their sales.  That was replaced by this:

It stayed like that for a couple of minutes before the guitars came crashing in the band came back out to play Killing in the Name.  Afterwards, the gig was over and I headed back to the bus then back to Boro.
I do have pics of the whole thing here
Oh, and I’m on fb here and twitter here
As I said in my previous entry, the whole day was brilliant and well worth the hassle I went through to get the ticket.  Amazing day and memories that will last me a lifetime.
Couple of other things.  Because I got into trouble for not letting people know this at Christmas, I’m heading back to Aberdeen.  I’ll be home between 5 – 12 July.
Oh, and I have a job interview on Thursday.  It should be easy enough, I have plenty of experience, but still.  Wish me luck.

I was hoping to write about my weekend today.  It would have had pics and everything.
Sadly, I don’t have interweb access at the moment.  (I’m writing this on my phone, which is fine for short entries but not for longer ones.)  Hopefully I’ll be back soon.
In the meantime the gig was excellent, Rage fucking rocked and it was well worth the stress I went through to get the ticket.

I’ve posted the pics on my facebook page

So, as you lot know, I’m supposed to be going to see Rage Against The Machine on Sunday.  Except my bloody ticket hasn’t turned up yet.  I know it’s been sent out, it’s just that I don’t have it.
Starting to freak out a bit, I’ve been trying to contact them over the past couple of days.  Earlier on, after two unanswered emails and constantly engaged phone lines, and with the help of someone on twitter with an alternative phone number, I finally spoke to someone.  The result?
If the ticket hasn’t arrived on Saturday, I’ve to phone back and they’ll arrange for me to pick one up on the day.  As long as I provide photo ID and proof of address.
So, at least I’ll be able to go to the gig.  Got everything else arranged.  My accommodation on Saturday night, someone to laptop sit for me (this’ll actually be the longest I’ve been without it *blub*), the lot.  Now just to hope I can actually get through on Saturday if I need to.  I have three different numbers for them so hopefully at least one of them will work.
I also didn’t get short listed in the crime writing competition I entered.  Which is annoying because I thought my story was particularly strong.  I have entered another competition and am submitting something for a third next time I get paid.  I’m also redoubling my efforts to send stuff to magazines and journals.  I’ve decided it’s time to stop pissing about.  I’ve got three or four stories that are good enough now, or very close to it, to be sent out.  If anyone wants to read them and give feedback/advice/abuse, let me know.
And I have to get used to adverts on OD again.  My OD+ subscription has run out and I can’t afford it till next month at the earliest.
Apart from that, I’m OK.  Well, apart from the sore back, sore neck, sore hand and the fact that I have to go back to the dentist.  Hope everyone else is fine.
Will
*EDIT* Finally got an email back from See Tickets today.  They’re going to have a duplicate ticket waiting for me at the box office at Finsbury Park on Sunday.  So, that’s that sorted.  But it still shouldn’t have taken 2 emails and god knows how long on the phone to sort it out.
Simply put?  If you’re planning to go to a gig or event and you have the choice between using See Tickets or using someone else, go through the someone else.  See Tickets, right from the beginning when trying to book the ticket, haven’t done a particularly good job.
Oh, and if you’re in the UK, don’t forget you can download the the first Doctor Who Adventure game.  I finished it last night.  One of the missions is to formulate a plan.

798,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/i-love-winning-an-argument-with-my-bank-3930279/,2010-06-01,I love winning an argument with my bank…,"
Got a surprise today.  Checked my bank account on my mobile phone and discovered that it was massively overdrawn.  Went to check the statement and discovered that the bank had taken off a charge.
Now, I knew that I had a charge for a returned overpayment due, but the bank had said that they would give me 14 days notice of when this was to happen.  This isn’t, as it turns out, the bank doing something nice but the law.  Well, I hadn’t received this notice.
I headed down to the bank to have it out with them.
I took the latest letter they had sent me and even took the time to highlight where it said that they would give me the notice.  After a short period of queueing I spoke to the person and argued with them.
You see, I don’t get paper statements (I think they are more hassle than their worth) and the printout of my statement they had stated that they had warned me.  I contended that it didn’t say that on the online statement and therefore it didn’t count as a warning.  Eventually I took the printout and left.
I went straight to the LRC and checked online.  sure enough, the exact same page that the guy had printed out didn’t have the notification on it.  Smiling, I logged onto one of the library computers (can’t send anything to the printer from my laptop) and printed the same out.  I then headed back to the bank.
Upon speaking to the bloke again he noticed that I was right all along.  He then said that he didn’t see what the online statement said so he didn’t know it was different to the one he printed off.  (Which, of course, would be why he took great pains to explain to me that they were indeed one and the same thing when I was in before.)  He then had to get someone else to go through things with me.
I sat down with that person and explained, yet again, what the situation was and the person finally agreed that I hadn’t received the necessary notification.  I was told that the money would be refunded (which I’m still waiting on going through my account) but in return I had to agree that if this situation happened again I would not be entitled to a refund.
So I’m going to hunt around online later (probably tomorrow) and find out if that’s legal.  Cos it seems to me that if that is the case my bank can remove money from my account whenever they want, call it a charge and I won’t see it again, which doesn’t seem fair.
Now, if only my fucking Rage ticket would hurry up and arrive.
Couple of fun things for you.  On Friday, my lighter stopped working.  Both of them.  (I had one that was just about dead but still worked that I used as a backup.)  So I bought a new one.  Now, I love cute ladybugs as much as the next person, but I don’t think this is a good idea:

(As one friend said on fb: ‘Look! Kids! Play with me!’)
And Lego+felt tip pen+Mac=WIN!:

I’ve got five weeks left of my creative writing class.  It’s not on next Monday (due to the bank holiday) and then five weeks left.  The class will be running again after summer, so I’m trying to decide if I’m going to go back.  I probably will.  It’s quite a good laugh, I’m writing regularly and I get good, constant feedback on my stuff.
Speaking of which, each week we get homework and the following week we read out what we wrote for the previous week in class.  Everyone loved the piece I read out, to the point where I thought I was not going to be able to leave the class due to my new head size.  Which was a surprise to me, cos I thought it was OK but not spectacular.
It also got a fair few laughs, which is always a surprise for me.  I don’t think I can write comedy, or at least I know I can’t write comedy comedy (y’know here’s the set up, here’s the punchline, here’s the set up, here’s the punchline…) so that was a nice surprise.
(If anyone wants to read it BTW drop me a note and I’ll send it to you.)
I just can’t wait to go back and find out what my tutor thought about the Red Riding Hood story I wrote (it was for homework, but for one of the weeks I missed.  I just felt like writing it) that you lot can see <—thataway<—
What else?  Still writing for TTZ.  Need to get my review of The Beast Below written and I believe I also said I would write a review of K9 and Company for the next issue as well.  Which means I have to watch it.  Last time I tried to, I was slightly drunk and still could not make it past 15 minutes, so FSM alone knows what I’ll make of it sober.  I also have to write my long in gestation piece about time travel, causality and the Doctor (which will get very interesting based on some stuff the Doctor has said in the new series) as well as another one about people reading too much into the slightest little things that appear.
And I’m currently re-watching Life on Mars as preparation to write an article for the as-yet unnamed Ashes to Ashes fanzine (still like the name Luigi’s Arms, especially after the last A2A episode).  That one, in light of events at the end of both shows, will be slightly amended but it’ll still work.
Should hear back in the next few days about the crime writing comp I entered, so keep your fingers crossed for me with that one.  I’ve just submitted something for another competition that I was planning to enter.  And this morning, while waiting for the post (my Rage Factor ticket was sent out yesterday so I was waiting to see if it would arrive) I wrote something for yet another competition I’m entering.  If anyone would like to read that and give me feedback, let me know.
Finally, I’m thinking about applying for a job reviewing films for a new world film website.  Might have to get in touch to see if they are paying anything.  Or I may just go for it.
And that’s about it, I think.
Well, apart from writing in here as well.  And possibly actually remembering to write notes (I’ve been shit at that lately, sorry).

Written for Year of Creativity
Prompt: Read between the lines…
I’m sure by now youve read in the papers about my current predicament.  I’m not looking for any sympathy; just want to use this opportunity to put my case across.  In all this, in all the acres of newsprint that has been dedicated to this story, no-one has thought about giving me the chance to do this.
So, you know who I am.  The Big Bad wolf.  Im the person who terrified a young girl and devoured her grandmother.  If the press is to be believed, Im just short of being Osama Bin Laden.  The new public enemy number one.
My family has lived in those woods for about five generations now.  And, to begin with, it was a peaceful place.  OK, we did have to put up with a few ramblers every now and then, the occasional hunting party, but we were able to cope.  Then they arrived on mass.
The humans.  The village.
When they started building the village, there wasnt too much concern.  The forest was getting a bit big and could have done with trimming back.  Then the population exploded.  Mass deforestation.  This was combined with overhunting the livestock that lived there quite happily to create a situation whereby we were running out of places to live and of our regular diet.  Some of us did try going vegetarian, but were just not designed for that.
So we started moving.  Everyone except me.  Ive always been a bit stubborn and I was damned if I was going to let a few humans chase me from my ancestral home.  So I stayed.  This is when they started hunting me.  I hadnt done anything to them.  OK, I may have killed some of their animals for food but it was always the ones that werent going to live much longer.  Besides, after what they did to my food supply its simply me getting a bit of payback.
The youths were the worst.  If they spotted me, they thought nothing of pulling my tail or threatening to set fire to me.  They even disturbed my sleep.  I became nocturnal through necessity.  Loud parties lasting most of the night.  Theres about five or six places where fires have been started.  Leaving their empty beer cans and vodka bottles lying round.  Its actually pretty much unsafe for any cubs that might be here, which is why Im glad there arent any.
Look, I know Ive got an image problem.  What with me being, well, a wolf.  Im not photogenic.  I could be pictured rescuing a newborn from a house fire and still not being hailed as a hero.  I get it.  Dont have to like it, but I get it.  So, I know Im at a disadvantage, especially compared to her.
Red Riding Hood.
You’ve seen the pictures of her.  With her long (bottle) blonde hair and innocent face, theres no chance Im going to win the PR battle against her.  Anyone would struggle.
(Incidentally, Red Riding Hood isnt actually a nickname.  Her parents are hippy, back to nature types.  Hence the reason they live so far in the forest.  Red Riding Hood is her actual name.  If you think thats bad, you should feel sorry for her brother, Black Hangmans.
Not sure where the Little comes from.  She hasnt been described as little since she reached puberty.)
She looks so sweet.  Talking about how she was on her way to see her poorly grandmother.  How she made the trip every week.  Poppycock.  Dont believe me?  Check out her Twitter feed.  The only reason she was making the trip that day was because her parents threatened to confiscate her laptop if she didnt.  She was looking to see her grandmother and spend as little time there as possible.
Shes so pure.  Shes so innocent.  Shes neither.  You want to know what was really in the basket?  It wasnt goodies for her gran.  It was booze.  It was enough booze to anesthetize a medium size elephant.  Oh, and I believe there may have been some pot and LSD in there as well.  Remember those parties I told you about?  She was at every single one.
Shes busy telling anyone thatll listen that the incident has scarred her mentally for life.  And her, having not even as much as held hands with a boy before.  Really?  Really?  And here was me wondering how she explained to her parents where her underwear kept disappearing to.
Did I speak to her that night?  Yes.  It wasnt because I approached her.  It wasnt because I wanted to eat her.  She spoke to me first.  Didn’t know how to get to Grandmas.  Could I give her directions?  So I did.
(This is the same house that she religiously visited every week, remember.)
Now for the big thing.  Did I eat her grandmother?  OK, Ill admit it.  I did.  There, you happy now?  But its not what you think.  Really.  I got on with the old dear.  Helped her out a bit, especially with her being as ill as she was.  Wed sit, chat, she even taught me how to play mancala.  She never begrudged me any of the animals she kept to eat, saying she understood what they had done to the forest and this was her way of paying back.
She was seriously ill and didnt want to be a burden to her family, living long past the time when she had a good quality of life.  She also hated the thought of being buried or cremated.  This was her solution.  She called it her final gift to me.  To be honest, I felt a bit uncomfortable with the thought of eating a friend.  But, in the end I was proud to do it.  All she wanted was to see her granddaughter one last time, which is why I ate her that night.
So, why is Red saying what she is about me?  Dunno.  Personally, I think something went horribly wrong at the party she went to that night, hence the injuries and the torn clothing.  Wouldnt surprise me to be honest.  Knowing what she did about the arrangement between me and her gran, she concocted this story.
As I said, Im not looking for sympathy.  But I do think its important to get both sides of the story out there.

801,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/fuck-the-fucking-fucks-full-rant-edit-3930276/,2010-05-18,Fuck the fucking FUCKS! *full rant edit*,"
Union Terrace Gardens.  A little piece of tranquillity and greenery in the middle of Aberdeen.  Right in the middle of the city centre.
It’s sunken down from the main roads.  This has the impact that, despite being right beside one of the busiest roads in the city centre, you can’t actually hear the noise of the traffic that much.  It’s serene, a good place to unwind a bit.
The flower displays were stunning.  They had the traditional flower clock, planted in such a way that different flowers bloomed at different times of the year so, rather than being colourful for part of the year it was constantly changing.  Right beside that was this:

The Aberdeen crest.  Planted in much the same way.
The toilets were Victorian and, while I can’t speak for the ladies, the gents were truly a thing of beauty (as much as that can be said for public toilets, anyway).  They used to have huge checker boards on the ground in the gardens.  I remember seeing on more than one occasion people playing draughts during the summer, on the rare days that the weather was good enough.
I’ve been to gigs there.  I’ve been to fun days there.  I love the place.
Sadly, it’s a bit run down nowadays.  Everyone agrees that something needed to be done to encourage people to return to the gardens.  But, as this picture I took in December proves, it’s still gorgeous, even under thick snow:

Now, someone did have a plan for them.  The Peacock Visual Arts Centre is also in need of help.  They need a new base as their current one (or actually two, either side of a lane) will be unsuitable for the purpose in the next two years.  So, they hired an architect, drew up plans that would help them and UTG and came up with the Northern Lights Centre for Contemporary Arts.  This would blend in with the gardens as they are just now and solve all the problems (real or perceived) that they have just now.  It would cost £13 million and 75% of the funding had been sourced.  They had planning permission and were all set to break ground on the scheme.
Enter Sir Ian Wood (feel free to boo now).
He is the second highest Scot on the Sunday Times rich list, having made his money in oil.  And he’s proud of his home city of Aberdeen.  So much so, he donated £50 million of his wealth to the city for them to renovate part of Aberdeen.  The city could use the money for anything they want, no strings.
No, sorry, what the fuck am I saying?  Course there is fucking strings attached.  There are always strings attached.  Anyone who genuinely believed me when I made the no strings comment, get in touch.  I have a loch for sale.  Apparently, it even has it’s own monster.
The catch was this: the money could only be used to raise Union Terrace Gardens to street level, giving us a city square bigger than Red Square in Moscow.  What the fuck does Aberdeen need a city square bigger than Moscow for?  But that’s his vision and he started to try and sell it to the public.
Then the flaws became obvious.  For a start, the city has to match Sir Ian’s donation pound for pound.  So, we have a plan that would cost the city next to nothing or a plan that would cost at least £50 million.
Why at least?  You honestly think that raising a sunken garden to street level and creating a space that big will cost a mere £100 million?  Again, I’ve got a loch…  Try £140 million.  Minimum.  Some estimates have it up to £300 million.  Of which, there have been donations totalling £55 million to date.  (Let’s not forget, the bulk of that has to be matched by the council or the deal is off.)
I’d love to show you a picture of the plans, but I can’t.  They have pictures of what it might look like, but nothing concrete (and, given the amount of that that will be used, the pun is completely intentional).  It’s going to go to an international design competition.  Where the prize may actually be less than the cost of designing and submitting something.
We were also told that it’s to secure the economic future of the city.  And this is something that is much needed.  As I sit here in Boro, watching the decline of the steel industry, I’ve often commented to friends that if Aberdeen doesn’t pull it’s finger out and do something now, it’ll go the same way when the oil runs out, which is very, very likely to be in my lifetime.
Now, this economic boost will apparently come in two ways.  The first is that by virtue of having the square itself businesses will flock to invest in Aberdeen.  Which businesses?  Fucked if I know.  Fucked if anyone actually knows.  They haven’t said, simply because they cannot say.  They’re making huge, huge assumptions based on complete and utter fucking guesswork.  I have yet to hear of a single business saying that the lack of this city square is keeping them out the city.
The other way is through the square it’s own self.  How?  Again, fucked if anyone actually knows.  Remember, there’s no fucking plan for how it’s actually going to look so how do they know what it’ll contain?  We do know this:
It may or may not contain a shopping centre.  Cos that area of Aberdeen desperately needs one with only five within a 10 minute walk.
It may or may not contain a multi story car park.  Cos, again, the five that are within a 10 minute walk are simply not enough!  (Admittedly, they are talking about closing the nearest one down if that happens.  But fuck knows what they’ll do with it, they can’t demolish it as there’s a health centre on top.)
It may or may not include an area for outdoor concerts.  Y’know, like the Peacock plans would also have.
It may or may not include plenty of green space.  Y’know, like the Peacock plans would have.
It may or may not include a contemporary arts centre.  Y’know like…  Fuck it, you know the drill by now.  (Incidentally, they were hoping that this would be a source for funding, transferring the money donated for the Peacock scheme over to the city square project.  Until the funding body announced rather publicly that that would only happen if it included the current Peacock design.  Which it wouldn’t [the two are seen as mutually incompatible].)
It may or may not include a family area.  Y’know…  Actually, I’m fucking sick of typing this.  You know what I was going to say.
It would increase access to Union Terr…  Actually, it wouldn’t.  You can’t increase access to something that’s no longer fucking there you ignorant fucking cunts!
It may or may not include an art gallery (different to the contemporary one).  Yeah, I can see the council being very fucking amused at that being less than a 5 minute walk from the existing one.
It may or may not contain a railwaystation.  [sarcasm]Cos it’s so fucking hard to get from Aberdeen rail station to the city centre![/sarcasm]
It may or may not contain street café’s.  Which is a great idea in a city where you can literally have four seasons in one day and where people are only semi joking when they say you know it’s a bank holiday because the snow melts before it hits the ground.
The only thing they can guarantee is that it’ll contain concrete.  Lots and lots and lots of concrete.  It has to.  And, of course, this’ll have an impact on the environment.  Not to mention the part UTC played in keeping the pollution in the city centre down.  And the destruction of around 80 perfectly healthy mature trees.
Network rail are dubious.  Part of the plan would cover the railway tracks and they have had no assurances that this part would be removable for maintenance/upgrade work.  (Course, they have no such assurance.  There are no set plans at the moment.)
A public consultation was held with Sir Ian saying he would pull out if the public didn’t back his plan.  The consultation didn’t include the Peacock plans as, seeing as they already had the planning permission, it was deemed to be unfair.  The results of the consultation would suggest why.  Out of the people who took part, 55% were against the city square proposal with 44% in favour.  The top three things that people wanted to see were formal gardens, a contemporary arts centre and a cultural centre for visual and performing arts.  Number four was a meeting place.  All of which were included in the Peacock design.
So, it seems simple.  The public had spoken and Sir Ian would slink away with his tail between his legs.  Or possibly donate his money to something else that needs it.
Again, if you believe that then, in addition to the loch, I’ll sell you a bridge.  Blue coloured, only working bridge of it’s type, you may have seen it on Auf Wiedersein, Pet.
He suddenly decided that it was no longer up to the public and that the council should have the last say.  Now, the people who elected the councillors have said they were against it.  So, the vote was yesterday.  The result?
 The fucking useless bunch of complete and utter tosspot twattish wankers voted 20 – 7 in Sir Ian’s favour.  12 decided to abstain.  3 of those had to due to a conflict of interests but the other 9 are complete cowardly cunts.
Well done.  Seriously, well done.  *slow hand clap*  You’ve voted to destroy a beautiful and serene piece of Aberdeen heritage, costing people their businesses (as the buildings will have to be compulsorily purchased) and bury it under concrete to satisfy the small minded ego driven insanity of a cunt who claims to love his city but decided to prove that he does by destroying part of it.
Congratulations you bunch of complete and utter cuntbags.  Hope you enjoy your positions cos I really can’t see you being in place much longer.
Sir Ian?  Want to improve Aberdeen?  Invest in Duthie Park, which needs it.  Create your ‘much needed’ city square where James Dunn house is when the council have moved out of their monstrosity of a current home.  Buy the Dons.  A strong football team is always good for the local economy and for attracting business to the area.
Or stick with your current plan.  If that’s the option you choose then I gladly invite you to go fuck yourself up the arse with a heroin filled dildo made from rusty needles and nails.
Will

I have to go visit my old house.  My mum sent me a present and put the wrong bloody address on it.  I tried earlier on today but got no answer.  Despite the fact I’m pretty sure I can see it through the window beside the door.
Tough times in Middlesbrough.  One of the biggest employers in the area (and a place that an ex tried to emotionally manipulate me into going back to work at) went bust yesterday.  As if it wasn’t hard enough finding a job in this place.  Just have to hope the writing thing works out…
Am heading back up home.  Not right now, and not for good.  My mum is getting her kitchen done up the beginning of July but does not want to take time off to stay in the house while it is happening.  (She has been told that she can just leave them in the house on their own, but that’s obviously not happening).  So, I’ve volunteered to head home and stay in the house for her.  She’s paying my transportation and I quite fancy getting out of Boro anyway.
Current TV obsessions?  Glee, Doctor Who, Treme (if you’re not watching that show in particular I want to know why not), Luther and, erm, The Cut (I know, I know).
They’re having a literary festival in Boro next month.  I’ve had a quick look on the website to see what I may be interested in going to and one thing is definitely the talk by Graeme Harper.  Listen to someone who has directed both old and NuWho?  Yes, please.  (Though it’s quite amusing to see that they’ve spelt Steel wrong in him biography.)
Pics!  As you lot know, I’m taking part in a creative writing class on a Monday night.  Last week, I was massively early for class (not by choice I might add, more a case of the best laid plans) and so I wondered round the surrounding area.  I found a pond and managed to get some pictures of ducks:













And then there’s this one:

An ordinary scene in a bar?  A normal quiz night?  Maybe.  Well, until you realise that it’s not music that’s playing but the fire alarm.  And it had been for about 10 minutes.  Furthest anyone moved was either to the terrace for a smoke or to the toilet.
(It turns out that the smoke machine for the gig upstairs activated the smoke detectors.)

You may recall me mentioning a competition I was planning to enter through Waterstone’s.  I wasn’t sure if I was going to write something completely new or refine something I’ve already done.
Well, I’ve looked through the stuff I have and found a story that, with a wee bit of editing, would be brilliant to enter.  Problem is, after having written my homework for my class this week, a bit of editing on that and it’d be good to go.  (Most of the editing would be to reduce the length as it’s currently slightly over the word limit.)
I can’t decide between the two of them.  To make matters worse, having checked on the website, I can only enter one story.  So I have to.
All of this is a roundabout way of asking if anyone would be willing to read both, give me feedback and advice.  The deadline for entering is the first of June so it would need to be quick if I’m to get the editing done.
Leave me a note if you are interested in helping out.

P.S. I submitted my entry for the crime writing competition today.  Wish me luck.

804,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/two-letters-5-3934023/,2010-05-10,Two letters,"
Dear Mum and Dad,
I know that you will be a bit surprised to receive this.  Ever since I set the two of you up with an email address I havent even sent a birthday card through the post.  But I felt that for something of this importance, a letter was the way to go.
As you know, Im coming up to my last semester in university and Im on course to get a first.  However, something has come up and I have decided to leave.  I do hope you will understand.
I recently took part in a series of tests and exams for an outside agency.  At first I thought it was for the Government or the NSA over in America.  Then I got the offer and I discovered it was more exciting than that.
The job offer was from Sebastian Slasher who is at the cutting edge of new technology.  I know, I know he does have a reputation for being a bit on the, well, evil side of the good/evil scale.
But this is an opportunity I feel I simply cannot turn down.  The technology he has access to, the technology he has created, is something I will not get to even see at any other job.  The wages are insane and the benefits package is unrivalled in any other line of work.  It is, quite simply, the job of a lifetime.  Even my personal tutor has said that he may not like who Id be working for but that Id be an idiot to turn it down.
There is a lot of talk about the eventual fates of his hired goons but you need not worry.  Im not going to be a mere henchman.  When situations like the failed attempt to rob Fort Knox go down I will be nowhere nearby.  R&D, thats my sole job in the organisation, working from his top secret lair.
I understand that you may not like what I am going to be doing but, I implore you, please understand why I need to do this.  Just remember that I love you and give Stephen a hug for me.
Your ever loving son,
Nathanial Cook.
Dear Nate,
It was a bit of a surprise to receive your letter.  At first your mother and I were wondering who it could be from, not knowing anyone else in Aberdeen, then we recognised the handwriting on the envelope.  I am writing the response as your mother, after I read the letter to her, needed a lie down and I thought it necessary to respond right away.
Son, you cannot be seriously thinking about taking this job.  When your friend John dropped out of university you spent the best part of a day talking about what an idiot he was making of himself, quitting before getting his degree.  And now you are thinking of doing the same.  For what?
To work for a complete madman.  Did you see the news today?  Your future boss has tried to destroy New York, Washington DC and London.  Yet again.  Thankfully Corporal Lynx was able to stop him.  I know how good you are at building things but why do you want a job building things designed to destroy?  Is that really a good use of your skills?
I understand your explanation that you will not face the same risks as the mooks but are you aware of the legal peril you will find yourself in?  Ignorance about the use your inventions will be put to will not be a defence.  You face a lengthy jail term, if not a death sentence.  Nothing me, your mother or your brother can say or do will be able to change that.
You will also likely be asked to cease all communication with your friends and family.  Do you think that Mr Slasher will risk you revealing the location of his lair to us?  It will be like when your uncle was forced by the Church of Scientology into cutting us out of his life.
Stephen has just found out that he is a finalist in the Young Musician of the Year competition.  Wouldnt you like to join your mother and me in supporting him at that event?
Please son, dont leave university yet.  Come home for the holidays, talk things over with us, its the least you can do.
With all my love,
Omar Cook.

So, as some of you may know, I got myself a ticket to the free Rage Against The Machine gig in London next month.  (Actually, just under a month to go!)
I’ve finally got things sorted out about going.
First of all, I needed to let the ticket company know that I’ve changed address.  (Long story short, landlord moved me from one of his houses to another one.)  Problem is, I didn’t actually book the ticket.  Despite the fact it’s a free gig, the person booking the ticket needed to provide credit/debit card details.  And to change my address, I needed to provide the last four digits of said card number.
Which I don’t have and I’m not exactly going to ask a complete stranger for their information.
Problem.
Finally a link appeared on their website for a contact form.  So I filled that out, told them the situation (saying it was a friend and not a complete random stranger) and giving both addresses.
Got an email back saying it had been changed and the ticket will be sent to my new address.
So, now I know I’ll definitely get my ticket, just to worry about transport and accommodation.
Looked everywhere I could, it seemed that my only option was about £30 on a return bus ticket.  From Middlesbrough to London.  No stops.  Hmmmm.
Then I went to the official The Rage Factor website as they announced the support act today.  And discovered that See Tickets are running buses to/from the event.  Now, the nearest departure to me is Leeds.  So, bus there, from there to Finsbury Park, gig, bus back to Leeds then back to Boro.  It will cost me more (about £60), but when you factor in the fact that I won’t have to worry about accommodation (which would have had to have been two nights) it works out pretty much even.
So, that’s everything sorted.
Yay!
Yeah, the support acts were announced today.  First on the stage will be Gallows.  Never heard of them before but I’ve since listened to some of their stuff and they’re actually really good.  Go here to hear some of their stuff.  Next it’s Roots Manuva, who I like then, befre Rage themselves is Gogol Bordello.  Ahhh.  Never mind, three good acts out of four at a free gig.  Can’t really complain.
Roll on June 6th!

807,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/election-round-up-kinda-3930270/,2010-05-07,Election round up.  Kinda.,"
So, we have the results through.  Some things…
Middlesbrough has once again returned Sir Stuart Bell as MP, for the seventh time.  This is a guy that only comes to Middlesbrough when there’s a photo op in it for him and hasn’t held a surgery for 15 years.  Just goes to prove that my friend is right.  You could stick a labour rosette on a cheese sandwich in Boro and it’d get elected.  Thankfully, he was returned with a smaller majority than last time (in fact, the majority of voters didn’t vote for him).
The green party has their first ever MP with party leader Caroline Lucas winning Brighton Pavilion.  This is in addition to their MSP’s and MEP’s (not sure if they are represented in the Welsh or Irish assemblies).  Congratulations to them, here’s hoping they can move on from this.
Nigel Farage, former leader of UKIP, hit the headlines on election day, but for all the wrong reasons when the plane he was in, carrying a vote UKIP banner, crashed.  I could joke that it summed up the guy’s campaign (he broke protocol by standing against the speaker of the house) or the UKIP campaign as a whole but in all seriousness I hope he gets better soon.
There was chaos at some of the polling stations as people were turned away at 10pm without having voted.  Some polling stations let people who were inside vote after this time, others didn’t.  There was talks of sit in’s, police being called, all sorts.  One of the areas involved was Nick Cleggs constituancy and he actually took the time to go speak to them.  Couple of things here:
First of all, it’s obvious that the rules need some clarification and I understand that the Electoral Commission are planning a full investigation.  It seems that if you were inside the station and had your voting paper you should have been able to vote.
In Sheffield it was blamed on students turning up to vote without polling cards, causing delays.  What delays?  I didn’t have my polling card (never got one) and it took, at best, an extra minute while they looked me up by my address.  This smacks, to me, of stretching for an excuse.
The most shocking one for me was the polling station that ran out of voting papers.  How is that possible?  You have a list of every one registered to vote at your polling station, bring one voting paper per person and a few extra in case there is a spoiled paper.  How hard is it to work that out?
But the voters themselves aren’t entirely blameless.  The stations were open from 7am – 10pm.  That’s FIFTEEN HOURS people.  Are these folk honestly expecting us to believe that they have jobs where they work 7am – 9:30pm, with no breaks and their bosses wouldn’t let them leave to vote, necessitating voting at the last minute?  If you believe them I have a nice pond in Scotland to sell you, complete with it’s own monster.  One person on the news went to vote, and turned away because of the queue, at 6pm, 7pm, 8pm before deciding they had to stay at 9:15pm.  You were there before!  Just fucking queue (it’s what us Brits are actually good at) the first time!
And now to the result.  Unless you’ve been living in a volcano in Iceland for the past two days, you’ll know that we have a hung parliament for the first time since 1974 (so much for FPTP always returning a decisive result).  The Lib Dem’s are now in the position of kingmakers.  True to what he’s said during the campaign, Nick Clegg is talking first to the Tories, who do have a majority.  Can’t see a Con-Lib coalition to be honest.  There are too many points of difference.  The main one being electoral reform.  The Lib Dems have long campaigned on changing the voting system from FPTP to PR and have said all along that a referendum on the issue is a deal breaker in any coalition negotiations.  All the Tories are currently offering is an all party committee to look into the issue, which won’t be enough.  Incidentally, one of the reasons I vote Lib Dem is electoral reform and this graph says more than I possibly can about why it’s actually needed:

So, what do I think is going to happen?  Well, one of two things.  Either Labour will form a coalition with the Lib Dems, the SNP and Plaid Cymru (all of whom support electoral reform), possibly temporarily until the referendum is held.  It’s kind of out there at the moment, but it is  possible.  It’s also (apparently) the option that most of the public want (two trending topics on twitter are #dontdoitnick and Lib-Lab.  The other option is that the Tories will form a minority government, teaming with different parties on a bill-by-bill basis.  I can actually see Cameron doing this and, if this happens, I’d easily expect another election within a year.  The SNP are a minority government in the Scottish Parliament and that’s barely working.  I really can’t see it working at all in Westminster. Either way, I really hope they don’t rush into this for the sake of the news.  Something this important should take a bit of time.
And whatever happens, there is real momentum for electoral change that’s desperately needed and it will happen.

AKA Who does your vote belong to?
So, tomorrow is the general election.  And there’s been a lot that has pissed me off about the campaign.
First of all was the Tories suggesting that if you vote Lib Dem, it’s time to come home to the Conservative Party, as well as their suggestion that if the Lib Dem’s didn’t exist then my vote would belong to them.
In the past 24 hours, Gordon Brown has suggested that any floating voters should come home to Labour.
And the one that really gets me, as a Lib Dem supporter and voter.  The suggestion that if I vote for anyone other than the Tories or Labour then my vote will be at worst wasted and at best actually a vote for the Tories/Labour (delete according to which party the person I’m speaking to supports).
BULLSHIT!
Pure, unmitigated, grade A bullshit.
Ladies and gentlemen, I’ll let you into a little secret.  It’s one that Labourservatives don’t want you to hear, but this is it:
The only wasted vote tomorrow is one that is not cast at all.  Your vote does not belong to any one particular party.  It belongs to you.  You and you alone.  Your vote is not the automatic right of any one particular party.  It is a gift, a privilege that the parties have to convince you to grant them.  And, no, if you vote for anyone else that Labour/Tories, it does not mean you want the other one of those two parties to get in.  It means that you want the person you voted for to represent you in parliament.
So, have a look online.  Check out the candidates.  Find out how they feel about matters that are important to you then cast your vote.
In The West Wing there’s a phrase that shows up a couple of times.  ‘Decisions are made by those who show up.’  Get informed, if you’re not already, then decide.

811,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/local-election-hustings-edit-3930266/,2010-04-29,Local election hustings *EDIT*,"
So, last night Friends of the Earth held hustings for the candidates for Middlesbrough.  Well, some of them anyway.
There are six candidates running for election in Middlesbrough.  However, it turns out that the candidate from UKIP (Robert Parker) wasn’t invited because of his party’s stance on climate change (they don’t believe in it).  As for the BNP candidate (Michael Ferguson) there appeared to be a bit of confusion.  The person hosting the event claimed that he was invited but hadn’t turned up.  However, there was only room on the stage for four candidates, not five as I’d have expected if that were the case.  I’ve since heard that he wasn’t invited but turned up anyway.  (It’s a shame he wasn’t there because the guy is so batshit insane that it could have been glorious.)
(Side note: I disagree with the policy.  FOTE were running the event, so I suppose they can set the rules, but my attitude is that ALL the PPC’s for Middlesbrough should have been invited.  The BNP is a difficult case, however.  The event was being held at a church and I know they have been barred from churches before.)
Also not in attendance was Sir Stuart Bell, the Labour candidate and current MP for Middlesbrough.  He said (though this was later attacked as false) that he had another event that day for the church commission and left it so late letting the organisers know they couldn’t rearrange the event, which they would have been happy to do.
I met up with my friend Nikki and we headed to the church in question.  I have fond memories of this place, having literally left my blood in the place but I hadn’t been there for a while.  We went in, Nikki got herself a cuppa, we found seats and I wrote down a question to be read out.  The whole thing wasn’t that well organised TBH, but more on that later.
Then the candidates were called to the stage.  When they were sat down, we were introduced to them.  From left to right the order was Chris Foote-Wood from the Liberal Democrats, John Walsh from the Conservatives, Joan McTigue running as an independent (who kept being introduced as being from the independent party) and from Labour…
Yes, you are reading that right.  Despite the fact that Stuart Bell was a no show, the Labour party sent Barry Coppinger, a local councillor, in his place.  This was a bad move from Labour.  He didn’t get an opening speech, as those were about the persons history in politics and why they wanted to represent Middlesbrough.  He was hopelessly lost with most of the questions as they were about what the candidate would do if elected, which he won’t be.  And someone did have a go at him for claiming to be speaking for Bell.  They would have been better not bothering and sending a statement or something.
As for the rest?  Chris Foote-Wood was quite good but a bit long winded, usually taking up all of his allotted 3 minutes and quite often going over it.  John Walsh seemed a bit lost.  He’s only been a member of the Tory party for 6 months and it shows.  It’s a classic case of a potential party star being parachuted into a seat so they can get some election experience without having the pressure of winning and without the loss affecting him.  (Cos, let’s face it, when the Tories win Middlesbrough I’ll be able to ice skate to New York.)  His one big idea is to start an animated film festival in the area.  Because, y’know, we haven’t had one of them in the last 10 years.  Joan McTigue seemed a little bit, well, mad.  She did keep her answers short, but constantly asked to be allowed to speak again arguing that she didn’t use up her allotted time.  The fact that she ended the debate having a screaming match with someone who lives in her ward didn’t look too impressive either.
The actual event, as I’ve said before, could have been better organised.  No-one seemed sure if the questions needed to be submitted to someone before they were asked (it turned out they didn’t), they hadn’t worked out a speaking order before hand, which they really should have, and they should have enforced a rule that once you stop speaking on a question, that’s it.
There were some good questions asked (both Nikki and myself got to ask our ones) and there was a level of debate but it was pretty much sticking to the party lines.
As for me?  I’d already decided to vote Lib Dem anyway and last night did noting to change my mind.  I’m not sure if it would have made much of a difference to floating voters.  I did feel sorry for Coppinger being in that situation but feeel it would have been a different event had Bell turned up.
Hopefully someone will have the guts to do something like this for the next election.  And if that does happen, I’d hope that all the PPC’s for Middlesbrough are invited and actually attend.

OK, it was my fault.  I completely forgot that some people may have issues with watching an entry with 40 videos in it.  So, moving on…
21) On the floors of Tokyo, A-down in London town’s a go go
No wonder Billy Idol is Dancing With Myself, no one knew the song:
22) Looking out, Across the night-time
Human Nature by Michael Jackson, another song with no takers:
23) Well, I feel pretty good, and I guess that I could
Sorry pheric, I don’t have the MC5 version of this song so you’ll have to put up with the Rage Against The Machine version:
24) They made a statue of us, and put it on a mountaintop
findingsunshine got that it was Regina Spektor, bit not that the song is called Us.  Don’t blame her, it’s not actually that good:
25) I’m infected, By your genetics
Obviously I’m the only one Infected by Repo! The Genetic Opera:
26) Something has changed within me, Something is not the same
Oribeth, findingsunshine and A Rather Shady Mogwi all got that it was Defying Gravity.  I was glad to be able to use this particular video with two (yup, two) Glee cast members in it:
27) Counting all different ideas driftin away, Past and present they don’t matter
Well, 1901 was a pretty uneventful year, so I’m not surprised no-one knew this Phoenix song:
28) Been there, done that, messed around, I’m having fun, don’t put me down
findingsunshine got that it is indeed Bulletproof by La Roux:
29) Tha spirit of Jackson, Now screams through tha ruins
Another Rage song, another two points to pheric.  This time it was New Millennium House:
30) We are not your sinners, Our voices are for real
No love for the Manic Street Preachers with You Love Us:
31) Inflammation of the foreskin reminds me of your smile, I’ve had ballanital shancroids for quite a little while
This one confused Oribeth but no guesses.  Medical Love Song by those Monty Python guys:
<object width=""980"" height=”765″>
32) At least you know, you were taken by a pro
Another one with no takers.  Aimee Mann with Driving Sideways:
33) I was following the pack, all swallowed in their coats
I’m actually kinda upset that no-one got this one.  My favourite musical find in years, White Winter Hymnal by Fleet Foxes:

(seriously folks, get hold of their album.  It’s fucking AMAZING.
34) Don’t tell me not to live, just sit and putter, Life’s candy and the sun’s a ball of butter
findingsunshine knew that it was Don’t Rain On My Parade while Oribeth and Tender Lumpling both knew it was the Barbara Streisand version:
35) Joan was quizzical; Studied pataphysical, Science in the home
Both pheric and edna million got this.  Maxwell’s Silver Hammer by The Beatles:
36) I like big butts and I can not lie, You other brothers can’t deny
Oh boy.  Here we go.  Expecting some hatred for this one.  Oribeth, The Darkness Daisy, pheric, pierced_poet, findingsunshine, Tender Lumpling  and A Rather Shady Mogwi all got the song but NOT the artist.  It is indeed Baby Got Back but it’s NOT the original by Sir Mix-A-Lot (AFAIK I don’t even own that version).  Rather, and I’m so glad this came up on winamp, it is Baby Got Back Gilbert And Sullivan Style by Michael Hightower:
(And if you want to download the song, you can find it here
37) I died, So many years ago
The last one with any guesses.  Oribeth and pierced_poet both knew this is Rest In Peace from Once More With Feelings:
38) Blake says no one ever really loved him, They just faked it to get money from the government
This is Blake Says by Amanda Fucking Palmer:
39) It’s not, What you thought – Aimee Mann, Wise Up
Obviously no Aimee Mann fans out there, this is Wise Up:
40) Last night I got served a little bit too much of that poison, baby, Last night I did things I’m not proud of and I got a little crazy
And finishing with Last Name, the version in Glee performed by the crazy talented Kristin Chenowith:

The advice first:
I’m thinking of entering this writing competition.  The advice I’m after is this: should I write something completely from scratch or should I look at stuff I’ve already written and polish one of those?
Now for the answers to the music quiz.  Remember, one point for the song and one for the artist:
1) I have a tale to tell, Sometimes it gets so hard to hide it well
findingsunshine was the only person to guess this one and she got both right.  It was Live To Tell by Madonna:
2) Hey there, here I am, I’m the man on the scene
I had two people take a guess at this one.  Oribeth correctly guessed that it was The Commitments while pheric got that it was Too Hard To Handle:
3) I have sailed the world, beheld its wonders
Three guesses for this one, all of them getting two points.  Tender Lumpling, pierced_poet and A Rather Shady Mogwi got that it was No Place Like london from Sweeney Todd:
4) Barbarisms by Barbaras, With pointed heels, Victorious, victorieas, kneel.
No one got BYOB by System Of A Down:
5) The last that ever she saw him, Carried away by a moonlight shadow
Again, no takers for Moonlight Shadow by Mike Oldfield:
6) I get high when I see you go by, My oh my.
Another one with no guesses, It’s Only Love by The Beatles:
7) Ready Or Not, Here I Come, You Can’t Hide, Gonna Find You and Take it Slowly
I capture the castle, for some strange reason, was embarrassed to know that this was Ready Or Not by The Fugees:
8) Helping the kids out of their coats, But wait the babies haven’t been born oh
Another no guesses one, Mushaboom by Feist:
9) Brian, the babe they called Brian, he grew, he grew, and grew,
Tender Lumpling gets two points,  Oribeth only one for Brian’s Song from Life Of Brian:
10) Sun, Take some time, get away
It’s kind of fitting that findingsunshine gets full points for It’s The Sun by the Polyphonic Spree:

11) I wonder why, I don’t know what you see
No-one got Plastic by Portishead:
12) All day I’ve faced the barren waste, Without the taste of water
edna million got that it was Cool Water but was correct that it was a different artist than they thought.  The version I have is by Johnny Cash, from American 6: Ain’t No Grave:
13) Well, he was the Sax Man from the state of Tennessee, First set in with the band at the ripe old age of three, weeks old
Sax Man by This Lonely Island goes guess-less:
14) This here’s a tale for all the fellas, Try to do what those ladies tell us
Well, pheric was able to tell me that this was Bust A Move by Young MC:
15) Here I am, I’m the master of your destiny, I am the one the only one, I am the god of kingdom come
No prizes for Gimme The Prize by Queen:
16) I love you, but I gotta stay true
findingsunshine and pheric both show me Mercy by Duffy:
17) All I want to be is washed out by the sea, No death star over me
No-one wanted Blur to deliver Strange News from Another Star:
18) On my own, Pretending he’s beside me
Oribeth, The Darkness Daisy, pheric and findingsunshine all got that it was indeed On My Own.  However, the version that came up wasn’t from Les Mis but rather the version in Glee:
19) These mist covered mountains, Are a home now for me
Only edna million recognised the song that played over one of the most powerful moments in The West Wing, Brothers in Arms by Dire Straits:
20) All this feels strange and untrue, And I won’t waste a minute without you
If you Open Your Eyes, like The Darkness Daisy and findingsunshine did, you’d have recognised the Snow Patrol song:

Theme of the week:
If a fairy or an angel came to you and said you were allowed to go back to the past, what things would you change to make it a better future for you? If you change nothing, why?
*YAWN*  Why is it that people are obsessed with this question?
Now, I’ve already answered it here and here but I’ll bite again.
Nothing.
Why?  I refuse to believe that anyone genuinely hates themselves and everyone else in their life by wishing that things were different.
As I said before, humans are more than skin and bone.  Every single one of us is also a collection of our experiences, memories and relationships.  To change one thing, no matter how small, would be to change you.
You may have heard of this, it’s usually called the butterfly effect.
I like where I am now.  I like who I am now.  Are there things in past that I’m not proud of or that I’m not happy about the outcome?.  Course there is.
The fact is that if I did change any of these things then I wouldn’t be here.  I wouldn’t be me.  And I’m not willing to risk that on a load of what if, shoulda, coulda, woulda bullshit.  In fact, IMHO, trying to indulge in that sort of behaviour is nothing short of self hatred.  Which is a waste of time.
The past has happened.  It’s over.  Learn from the lessons it gives you and look forward.
Will

Politics entry <–<–thataway<–<–
Just for the sake of, y’know, whatever, I’ve decided to do a lyrics quiz.
I stuck every song on my laptop into Winamp, put it on shuffle, pressed play and have posted the first line of the first 40 tracks it played.
(Well, kinda.  Some of them were instrumentals and some had nothing but the title in the first two lines so they didn’t count.)
Now you need to guess which song the lines are from.  Some of them are covers so there are bonus points for the right version.  Unless you just put down every singer of the song in question.  Cos that’s cheating.
Have fun!
1) I have a tale to tell, Sometimes it gets so hard to hide it well 
2) Hey there, here I am, I’m the man on the scene
3) I have sailed the world, beheld its wonders
4) Barbarisms by Barbaras, With pointed heels, Victorious, victorieas, kneel.
5) The last that ever she saw him, Carried away by a moonlight shadow
6) I get high when I see you go by, My oh my.
7) Ready Or Not, Here I Come, You Can’t Hide, Gonna Find You and Take it Slowly
8) Helping the kids out of their coats, But wait the babies haven’t been born oh
9) Brian, the babe they called Brian, he grew, he grew, and grew,
10) Sun, Take some time, get away
11) I wonder why, I don’t know what you see
12) All day I’ve faced the barren waste, Without the taste of water
13) Well, he was the Sax Man from the state of Tennessee, First set in with the band at the ripe old age of three, weeks old
14) This here’s a tale for all the fellas, Try to do what those ladies tell us
15) Here I am, I’m the master of your destiny, I am the one the only one, I am the god of kingdom come
16) I love you, but I gotta stay true
17) All I want to be is washed out by the sea, No death star over me
18) On my own, Pretending he’s beside me
19) These mist covered mountains, Are a home now for me
20) All this feels strange and untrue, And I won’t waste a minute without you
21) On the floors of Tokyo, A-down in London town’s a go go
22) Looking out, Across the night-time
23) Well, I feel pretty good, and I guess that I could
24) They made a statue of us, and put it on a mountaintop
25) I’m infected, By your genetics
26) Something has changed within me, Something is not the same
27) Counting all different ideas driftin away, Past and present they don’t matter
28) Been there, done that, messed around, I’m having fun, don’t put me down
29) Tha spirit of Jackson, Now screams through tha ruins
30) We are not your sinners, Our voices are for real
31) Inflammation of the foreskin reminds me of your smile, I’ve had ballanital shancroids for quite a little while
32) At least you know, you were taken by a pro
33) I was following the pack, all swallowed in their coats
34) Don’t tell me not to live, just sit and putter, Life’s candy and the sun’s a ball of butter
35) Joan was quizzical; Studied pataphysical, Science in the home
36) I like big butts and I can not lie, You other brothers can’t deny
37) I died, So many years ago
38) Blake says no one ever really loved him, They just faked it to get money from the government
39) It’s not, What you thought
40) Last night I got served a little bit too much of that poison, baby, Last night I did things I’m not proud of and I got a little crazy
Oh, and all notes on this entry will be private so you can’t copy someone else’s answers.

819,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/the-election-debate-3930258/,2010-04-19,The election debate,"
On Thursday Britain saw a historic political moment, with the first ever televised debate between the leaders of the main political parties*.
I don’t own a TV, so was unable to actually watch the event live.  I did, however, manage to download it from the BBC iPlayer (despite it being originally broadcast on ITV and I watched it on Friday night.
So, how did they do?
Gordon Brown: Brown had a slight disadvantage.  He’s never really seemed comfortable on front of the camera when being interviewed.  With that in mind, though, he didn’t do too badly but it was still a performance of which he cannot be proud.  He seemed to be stiffer than usual, though he did relax a bit (a very small bit) towards the end of the event.  I think he ran out of ways to say the words ‘I agree with Nick’ and this is something which must be causing the party some problems as it simply served to make him look like a follower rather than the leader of the country.
David Cameron: who the hell was that and what did he do with Cameron?  He’s normally good when it comes to this sort of thing but on Thursday he came across as robotic.  Rather than address the points put to him, he searched (sometimes very desperately) to find a way to get to his next policy, soundbite, attack or anecdote.  I had heard on Friday about the black man** one and didn’t quite believe that he actually said that.  Then I watched it.  Wow.
Nick Clegg: admittedly he had the lowest expectations going into the debate.  This is due, in part, to the press trying to convince people that Britain has a two party political system***.  Which means that the debate was supposed to be him proving he actually exists.  What he did do was go far beyond that, not only introducing himself to the country but showing that he does indeed offer an alternative to the same old, same old.  He was the most relaxed, actually answering the points that had been raised, when he was allowed to (more on this later) and actually engaging with the audience, looking directly at them when answering their questions (which Cameron later copied).
As for the way the debate was run, it was a mixed bag.  I actually liked the lack of audience participation as this differentiated the debate from an average episode of Question Time.  The format, of question followed by genuine debate worked.
The moderation, however, was rubbish.  Everyone I’ve spoken to who watched the debate agreed with that.  Alastair Stewart seemed to be happy to keep it between Brown and Cameron going to Clegg either when someone addressed Clegg or when it appeared that someone was screaming into his ear ‘This is supposed to be a three person debate!’  He also stopped Clegg speaking far more than the other two.  I’ve no idea what Adam Boulton will be like on Thursday but he simply cannot be any worse.  David Dimbleby is in charge of the last one so at least that will be a massive improvement.
As for the next debates?  Again, I’ll be watching them later (not just cos of the no TV thing though.  This Thursday I’m going to [finally] see The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo and the following week is local hustings) but I see it like this: there will be more pressure on Clegg in the second debate.  But the person who really needs the win is Cameron.  The last debate is on the economy.  Brown obviously has the advantage here and can only get an as expected.  Clegg will be getting help from Vince Cable, one of the very few MP’s people actually trust with economic matters at the moment, in his prep for that one.  If Cameron doesn’t have a strong showing on Thursday then it could be that all the debates will be called disasters for the Tories.
As for me?  I think that the debates will swing some voters but maybe not the numbers expected.  I was planning to vote Lib Dem before the debate and I didn’t see anything in the debate to convince me to change my mind.
Don’t forget that the next debate is on Thursday on Sky One.  If you don’t have Sky, you can also see it on the BBC news channel at the same time.  It’s also going to be on BBC2 after Newsnight.
And if you missed the debate, here it is in 15 seconds (hat tip to Steven the Rill:
Will
* Yes, I know that the SNP and Plaid Cymru weren’t involved.  But I think that’s actually fair enough.  They can’t actually form the Government as they don’t have candidates in enough seats.  There is going to be a Scottish and Welsh leaders debate.
** Cameron claimed to have spoken to a black man, 40 years old, who has served in the Navy for 30 years.  It’s not yet been announced if he started as a mascot.
*** Britain does not have, nor has it had for years, a two party political system.  Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise.  Nor does your vote automatically belong to any one political party (despite what the Tories may have you believe) nor is a vote for any party not Labour or Tory actually a vote for either party.  Anyone saying otherwise is trying to scare you into voting how they want you to and is deserving of nothing more than contempt and scorn.  Your vote is just that: yours.  Use it how you see fit.

As you lot know, I’m a Gleek.  So much so that I not only have the show soundtrack on my phone/mp3 player, but I have also downloaded a couple of torrents featuring the original version of the songs which is also on there.
I also keep my mp3 player on random.  Which is how it happened that the Rolling Stones version of You Can’t Always Get What You Want was immediately followed by the Glee version.

Normally, when I see 6am, it’s because I haven’t slept.  So, waking up at that time is unusual.
I took my tablet with a sip of water, got dressed, rolled some cigarettes and headed out with Willy Wonka’s introduction playing on my mp3 player.
I thought it would take me an hour to walk to the hospital, but it only took half that time.  So I was earlier than I expected to be.  I did spot this rather cool shop sign on the way:

While I waited for Nikki to turn up I wandered down to where the college I used to go to was.  It’s now completely gone :¬(
Nikki turned up at about half 7 and we headed to the ward.  The reception wasn’t even open so I went and found someone to tell them I was there.
Back to the reception area where we sat and talked about all sorts of things.  I saw this and just had to take a picture:

At about 8:20, 20 minutes after I was supposed to be there they remembered me and I had a chat to the anaesthesiologist.  Back to the reception and more waiting.  I later found out that they thought they might have to cancel as there was a shortage of beds.
Into another room, got weighed (I weigh 11 stone), answered a few questions, took off my necklaces and took out my tongue piercing and got changed into my lovely gown and plastic undies.  Finally they had a bed for me.
Went to the ward, put my clothes in the locker, fired up my laptop so Nikki could watch videos while she waited for me.  She had to go because she couldn’t wait on the ward.  I then walked, looking like a numpty in my gown and boots, to pre-op.  On the way passed quite a few murals.  Disney, The Simpsons, Star Wars and Dr Who!  (Though they may want to update that one as it’s the 10th Doctor.)
Answered the same questions again, had the dots for them to hook me up to a machine and then to the theatre.
It was here that the anaesthesiologist told me about the op almost being cancelled.  He put the thing into my hand for pumping me full of ‘lovely drugs’ (his words) and that’s all I can remember.
Until I woke up in the recovery room.  I had a couple of pads in my mouth and my throat felt as if someone had looked at the Sahara desert and decided that what it really needed was less moisture.
(Side note: I really, really, REALLY cannot abide having a dry throat.  A dry mouth I can live with, but not my throat.  I can’t explain it either.)
The dentist who did the op came in to see me and told me that they had to remove one tooth they thought they could save.  So, 9 teeth out in total.  I was in the recovery room for about half an hour (I think.  For some reason they had covered the clock with a piece of paper) and then back to the ward.
By 1pm, I was ready to go.  The only feeling I had was as if I was slightly pissed.  But I had to wait.  Eventually they gave me some water but I was still bored, having left my book in my bag which Nikki had.  Eventually someone on the ward lent me a paper to read.
Then Nikki turned up, it being visiting time on the ward.  We sat and chatted for a while then she went to find out how soon I could leave.  She was told I could get dressed so I asked for my piercing and went to the toilet to put it back in.  While there I noticed something strange.  I could understand the body wash beside the sink, but the shampoo and conditioner?
Back to my bed and finally I was given a discharge letter and told I could go.  Got dressed and left.  I was planning to take the straw I was using to use later on, but I forgot.  So to the shop in the hospital we went.  They didn’t have any straws to buy but the person behind the counter gave me one of the slush puppy straws to use.  Yay!
Into the taxi and back to Nikki’s.
Couple more pics:

The ‘L’ on the back of my left hand (not that I need to).

Face!

Was thinking of writing some TV reviews here, but I think I might leave that till tomorrow, take my mind off Friday.
Couple of things though.
Finally, we find out what Inception, the next Christopher Nolan film, is about.  I’ve said before that Nolan, in my opinion, was the best director of the last decade and, if this article is anything to go by, he’s starting this one strong.  Holy shit, that sounds absolutely fucking awesome.
And one for my fellow Whedonites:

So, on Monday I had the doctor about my hand.  Which wasn’t helped much by the fact that I couldn’t sleep (stayed up all night watching The West Wing and Spaced).
Despite this, I got there just in time for my appointment.  Had a very slight wait to see the doctor, told him what was wrong, he had a look and prescribed me anti-inflammatory tablets.  With confusing instructions.  I have to take one a day for the first week, if that doesn’t help up that to two a day, if that doesn’t help try a week without taking any and if THAT doesn’t help, go back and see him.  So far it seems to be working though.
Then I had to sign on and in the afternoon I had an appointment with A4e, the stupid place that the job centre has sent me to.  At least I’ve managed to convince my employment coach that I can actually do more than work at a call centre.
Then yesterday I had the dentist who is going to be operating on me next week.  Wasn’t planning this but I did actually have a pint before heading over there.  I bumped into a friend I haven’t seen in a long, long time and we had a drink and a chat about our various writing projects.  I changed my address at the dentist, gave them my mums contact details when they asked (and, as usual, I had to spell part of my mums address) then they had a look in my mouth.  Turns out I have 8 teeth that needs to come out and some that need fillings.
And having started this to avoid having local anaesthetic used on me, they’re going to use it anyway.
I’ve got my post op instructions, including the fact that I have to cut down on my smoking for a few days if not stop altogether.  I have looked into getting patches but the cheapest I’ve seen is £6- 7 for a weeks course (and that’s at half price).  I’d much rather just buy a fresh pouch of baccy and try and make it last me four days instead of two (which is what usually happens).  Main problem is going to be when I’m at home on my own watching videos.
I was also advised to get painkillers for the next day.  I was specifically advised to get ibuprofen as it can help with the inflammation.  Though I probably won’t bother with them as I’m on anti-inflammatory medication (as I’ve already mentioned).
Phoned my friend Nikki (who is coming with me to the hospital and looking after me for the next day) and arranged to go round to hers and speak to her and her lad about what’s happening.  For example, the fact that she’ll be spending all morning and part of the afternoon at the hospital waiting for me (the op itself will be about 3 hours).  Also need to speak to a friend tomorrow see if he’ll pick us up and save time and money getting a cab.
And that’s about it.  As a treat, I’m posting this video.  It’s funny cos it’s funny and also cos it’s true…

Quite a few of my recent entries have been quite downcast so, in this entry, I’m going to list things that are good.
The last series of Ashes to Ashes starts on Good Friday.
The new series of Dr Who starts on Easter Saturday.
And, based on the newest trailers, not only does Matt Smith look like he’s going to be good (as I said he would be) but it seems that we have a Scottish actor actually using their normal accent in the show.
Glee returns after the ridiculous break on the 13th.  On the 20th it’s the all Madonna episode.  And Neil Patrick Harris will be appearing (and singing) in the Joss Whedon directed episode.
The Scott Pilgrim Vs The World (new film by Edgar Wright) trailer has been released and, in addition to one of the best taglines ever (An Epic of Epic Epicness) it looks awesome:

BTW: I highly recommend the books.  Brilliant.
Just downloaded a shitload of Danny Elfman scores.
Watched Charlie and the chocolate factory last night.  still prefer it to Willy Wonka and the Chocolate factory.
The crime short I’m writing for a competition seems to be going well.  Will need people to read it and give me feedback soon.  Watch this space.
Had quite a good night out last night for a friends birthday.
Wrestlemania is this weekend and should be good.

Winner announced for world’s oddest book title award
Crocheting Adventures with Hyperbolic Planes by Daina Taimina beats Collectible Spoons of the Third Reich to the top spot
Charlotte Higgins
The Guardian,	 Friday 26 March 2010
The annual prize for the oddest book title has been won by the splendidly eccentric Crocheting Adventures with Hyperbolic Planes, by Dr Daina Taimina. Last year’s winner was The 2009-2014 World Outlook for 60-milligram Containers of Fromage Frais.
The Diagram prize has been awarded annually by The Bookseller magazine since 1978. Horace Bent, the magazine’s diarist, who administers it, said: “I think what won it for the book is that, very simply, the title is completely bonkers. On the one hand you have the typically feminine, gentle and woolly world of needlework and, on the other, the exciting but incredibly unwoolly world of hyperbolic geometry and negative curvature.”
“One hopes that Dr Taimina’s win prompts other enlightened crocheters, knitters and embroiderers to produce similar works, so I look forward to seeing books such as Cross-stitching String Theory and Felting Feats with Phenomenology in the near future.”
Taimina will receive no prize aside from “the sales boost that will now inevitably occur”, according to Bent.
The book is in fact a serious work by a mathematician at Cornell University in New York state. As David Henderson, Taimina’s husband, has explained, a hyperbolic plane “is a simply connected Riemannian manifold with negative Gaussian curvature”. Hyperbolic planes  surfaces with constant negative curvature  which are studied as a branch of non-Euclidian geometry, have traditionally been hard to visualise: Taimina’s breakthrough was to use crochet to create such shapes. Dr Taimina’s work has appeared in an exhibition titled Not The Knitting You Know.
The other shortlisted titles included Collectible Spoons of the Third Reich by James A Yannes.

Yesterday, I was slowly waking up when my phone rang.  As the number came up ‘unknown’, I did what I always do and left it to go to voicemail.
(Unless I’m expecting a call from a number I don’t recognise I always do that.  If it’s important, they’ll leave a message and I can call them back.)
T’was the dentist about a couple of appointments.  Now, I’ve mentioned before that I have a consultation at the hospital on the 13th.  So, I phoned them back only to find out that they knew nothing about that.
As it turns out, I was supposed to have an appointment yesterday, which is probably why they were phoning me.  But I didn’t get the letter till after they phoned.
So another appointment has been made for me for Tuesday (which caps off a fun couple of days.  Monday I have the doctor, sign on and a meeting with my useless employment coach.  Tuesday, dentist.  Just shoot me now).
And on the 9th of April I go into hospital for the actual operation.  At 8am.  So, not only am I going to be doing something I don’t want to do, but I’m gonna have to get up early (and get one of my friends up early as well) to do something I really don’t wanna do.  Good thing I don’t eat breakfast.

Cos my hand’s killing me, I can’t see the doctor before Monday and I think it’s funny.  Enjoy.
Once upon a time there was a very large office building in a very large city. This building had 40 levels: level 1, level 2, level 3, level 4, level 5, level 6, level 7, level 8, level 9, level 10, level 11, level 12, level 13, level 14, level 15, level 16, level 17, level 18, level 19, level 20, level 21, level 22, level 23, level 24, level 25, level 26, level 27, level 28, level 29, level 30, level 31, level 32, level 33, level 34, level 35, level 36, level 37, level 38, level 39, and level 40.
One day the owner of the building decided to get a PA system installed on every level, in case there was ever a fire and everyone in the building needed to be contacted at once. The system was installed on every level: level 1, level 2, level 3, level 4, level 5, level 6, level 7, level 8, level 9, level 10, level 11, level 12, level 13, level 14, level 15, level 16, level 17, level 18, level 19, level 20, level 21, level 22, level 23, level 24, level 25, level 26, level 27, level 28, level 29, level 30, level 31, level 32, level 33, level 34, level 35, level 36, level 37, level 38, level 39, and level 40.
One day, an employee named John was doing some paperwork on the 21st level when he saw the pager for the PA system in his bosss office. He could not resist. He picked up the pager, turned it on, cleared his throat, and told a joke. It was funniest joke anyone in the building had ever heard. They were rolling in the aisles, laughing their heads off. The accountants on level 3 were in tears. The engineers on level 34 were in hysterics. In fact, workers on every level  level 1, level 2, level 3, level 4, level 5, level 6, level 7, level 8, level 9, level 10, level 11, level 12, level 13, level 14, level 15, level 16, level 17, level 18, level 19, level 20, level 21, level 22, level 23, level 24, level 25, level 26, level 27, level 28, level 29, level 30, level 31, level 32, level 33, level 34, level 35, level 36, level 37, level 38, level 39, and level 40  could not stop laughing.
He walked out the door of his bosss office, feeling all proud of himself, when who should he run into but his boss. John, come with me now! John relunctantly followed his boss back into his office. His boss looked at him with fury in his eyes. John, he said, your joke was very disruptive to the workers in this building! Productivity was decreased on level 1, level 2, level 3, level 4, level 5, level 6, level 7, level 8, level 9, level 10, level 11, level 12, level 13, level 14, level 15, level 16, level 17, level 18, level 19, level 20, level 21, level 22, level 23, level 24, level 25, level 26, level 27, level 28, level 29, level 30, level 31, level 32, level 33, level 34, level 35, level 36, level 37, level 38, level 39, and level 40! Youre fired! Clean out your desk and get out!
But then his frown softened and he added, Still, I have to admit, that joke was funny on so many levels.

Written for Year of Creativity
Prompt: Something familiar seen from a different perspective
My Dearest Alberforth,
I have no idea whether or not this will reach you.  The nice gentleman from the Time Travel Tourist Agency has given me instructions, written down and has also assured me that this letter will arrive before my return to our time.  I sincerely hope that he is right.
You know that I have always been one for new adventures and blessed, or cursed depending on your point of view, with wanderlust.  I thank you for helping me indulge this and funding this trip.
I would also like to apologise from the start if my penmanship is not up to its usual standard.  I am simply not used to writing with such an implement as this.  There is no ink well.  The ink resides inside the pen all the time.  So simple and a lot cleaner.  I am sorry that I will not be able to take one back with me upon my return as I feel it would be useful (knowing how many letters you have to write) but those were the rules I signed up to.
My goodness, what a lot I have to tell you!  So much difference between our time and the early 21st Century.  Clothing for example.  The outfit I was supplied with is in keeping with the time but is still considered modest.  Women think nothing of walking around dressing like men.  Some of them even have manly hairstyles.  But they are nothing compared to other females.  Clothing of such scandalous dimensions that they can barely even be clothing at all.  So much flesh is displayed that there is very little left to the imagination.  The gentlemen are not much better.  Arms and legs are left bare, usually displaying some kind of artwork, such as can be seen on tribesmen from recently discovered countries.  Some are words, some are pictures, and some are both.  Some of the women have the same decorations.
Another unusual thing, to be seen again on both genders, is metal.  Not discretely through the ears, as is common, but all over!  Lips, eyebrows, stomach buttons, noses, if one can place metal through it someone has.  Its a wonder that they dont get some kind of poisoning from it.
The language is different as well.  So many words that are unfamiliar, it is hard for me to make my meaning clear at times.  And the vulgarity!  My dear, some of the things that are said are enough to make even your darling brother, who fought so valiantly at sea, turn positively crimson!  There is almost no sense of decorum, no regulating the language on front of the womenfolk, such as your brother has the good grace to do.  Indeed, some of the women are worse than the men!  Earlier on, in a local tavern, I overheard a group of women talking about how much ale they had consumed the night before.  One of them, who was clearly unwed, not to mention unbetrothed, was talking in detail about her exploits the previous night with a man whom she had only just met.  If she were I, the gentleman in question would have been fortunate to get the merest kiss on the cheek.  From what she was saying, however, it was clear that they did a lot more.  I felt that I had no choice but to leave quickly.
A lot of people wander round with strange looking devices clamped to the side of their face.  Some have strange pieces of what looks like string falling down the side of their faces.  Others have a funny looking thing in their ear with a flashing light.  And they are talking, apparently, to themselves!  Darling, at first glance I thought that these people had escaped from Bedlam!  As it turns out, the devices are communication devices called mobile phones.  They are used to talk to people who may even be on the other side of the world.  Imagine that!  The hours writing and waiting for the post you could save if you had access to such a device.  Its truly a wonder.
The main entertainment is not books or the theatre although both things still exist.  Instead, people sit and stare at a strange looking box which has both sound and moving photographs.  There are many different moving photographs available at the same time.  It is similar to the theatre only without the actors (both male and female) being in the same room as you.  I was greatly intrigued to see one such moving photograph which was supposedly set during our time.  How amusing to see what these people think of the way we dress and how we talk!  It bears almost no resemblance to real life, except the clothing is quite accurate.  I almost said something about this but decided to keep my own council.  However, I did get some strange looks when I laughed at one situation.
Sometimes they even go into a darkened room to watch these pictures on a wall about the size of the side your dear mammas house.  I would go to one of these places myself but Id be worried that Id fall asleep.  You know how I am anywhere with no light.
I have just about got the hang of the monetary system here.  There are notes, which are used for the larger part of the denomination and coins, which are the smaller ones.  These are swapped for all sorts of goods and services.  Sometimes, these are not used.  Instead, small flat pieces of a strange substance are placed into machines.  After the flat thing is removed, the person picks up what they have purchased and walks away with no sign of payment.  Yet they are not stopped or accused of theft as one might expect to happen.  I find this endlessly fascinating.
Transportation is another unusual thing.  While there are horses, these are mostly for people wearing some kind of uniform.  Judging by the size of their hat, these people have most unusually large heads.  Instead, metal box like contraptions are used.  There appears to be no means of propulsion although they do make an unusual and unholy noise.  These differ in size from small ones that are not contained in any way to large machines containing many people.  Some are not confined to the ground but instead fly in the air like a bird.  They move so fast!  So much so that it is simply not safe to step out on front of one but one must use the special crossing places instead.
There is so much more I want to tell you about, but I fear that I am starting to ramble.  The last thing I wish to do, my love, is bore you.  I will write again in a couple of days, with any luck.  In the meantime, give my love to mama and papa.  I hope your sister is recovering well from her bout of pox.
Yours with eternal love,
Miss Elizabeth Jane Widdesham.

As you lot know, I use twitter.  My ID is williamtheblood
Well, it seems that someone has set up a role play game on twitter based on Buffy.  The name of one of characters?  WilliamTheBlood
Now, I’ve got nothing against people doing this sort of thing.  It’s not my scene but each to their own.
Problem is, I’m getting spammed by replies to the character.  I can only assume that they are getting any messages sent to me.
Hmmm.  Might have to get in touch with twitter, see if there is anything they can do about it or even if they know a problem like this exists.
I’m absolutely knackered.  But that’s my own bloody fault.  I’ve been up late every night since Saturday night watching Skins, which is infinity better than I thought it would be.  I’m now only 7 episodes away from being fully caught up.
If you are thinking of watching The Blind Side you’ll enjoy it if you realise that the film thinks it’s more profound than it actually is.
I’ve been published!  Well, kinda.  After the hustings for the Students Union elections last month I wrote an article for the union newspaper about how badly it was run.  I didn’t know that they even received it until the new edition came out yesterday and they printed it, along with a rebuttal from the current president.
My writing classes are going well.  Have to tidy up a piece of the booklet.  (The class runs in three ten week terms.  At the end of each we hand a piece of work to our tutor and she gets a little booklet made for us.  How cool is that?)
I also have to find a really bizarre reason for someone leaving uni.
Still writing my crime short for a competition.  Didn’t help that something that played a big part in it has been taken away.  Also found the biblical quote I’m planning to use for it, unless someone here can help me out.  This is the quote I’m going to use:
Fathers, provoke not your children, that they be not discouraged.
colossians 3:21
Unless anyone else knows of a better quote about not harming children that is relatively obscure.  And short (it’s being tattooed on someone’s chest).
Actually, speaking of writing, I really enjoyed writing my more serious entry (one back).  Is that something you would like to see more of in here?  If so, any particular topics you would like to suggest?
I applied for a job at a call centre the other day.  Well, more like I was forced to by A4e (who seem to think that I only have call centre experience).  Got an email back from them saying to call them to arrange an interview or to have a telephone interview.
What?
I’m sorry, but if you think I could work there, you contact me.  Why should I have to pay for the phone call for them to interview me?
As it happens, I’m not really that bothered about the job considering it’s a)telesales which I really don’t wanna do and b)the cost of transport will mean that I work my first hour every shift for free.
What’s going on?  There’s been a clarification of the rules here on OD and people aren’t screaming censorship?  I thought that was the thing to do on this site nowadays…
Finally, a motivator.  Why Ace is the best Doctor companion ever:

835,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/cultural-backwaters-3930242/,2010-03-15,Cultural backwaters,"
This was going to be an edit to my previous entry but grew to big, so I’m making it an entry of its own.  Enjoy.
 Why do I have to live in the cultural backwater that is Middlesbrough?  Why?
As you guys know I am a huge fan of the Millennium trilogy.  So it shouldn’t come as any surprise that I really REALLY want to see the film based on the first book.  Especially as everything I heard was about how close they stuck to the book and how faithful it was to the spirit of the book.
Well, it was released over here last week.  Nowhere in Boro showing it.  I decided to wait till this week to see if anywhere got it in on Friday.
Guess what?
The nearest place to me showing it is in Newcastle.  Now, this is good news in that the ticket for the film will only cost me £1 (special discount as I’m on JSA).  Sadly getting there will cost me £10.  I refuse to pay £11 just to see a film.
The nearest thing we have to an art house cinema is going to be showing it.  Mid April (actually, I think it’s nearer the end of the month).  A full month after release.
I did break down and download it.  Which only made me want to see it on the big screen even more.  (BTW it is one of the best thrillers I’ve seen in a while.  And everything I read about it being close to the book is true.)
This happens all the time.  If there is an art house/subtitled film showing in one of the main cinemas in Boro it’s generally on for one week, screening once a day, usually the last showing.  Sometimes they even just show them for one screening.  Which is fine is it’s part of a series (which is how I saw Gozu) but otherwise it’s annoying.  And they probably justify this by saying that the films are not that popular.
But that’s circular logic.  The reason the films aren’t that popular is because they are barely on.  It’s the same as the Students Union claiming that they shut the bar during the summer cos they won’t make enough money to justify opening it.
If they don’t try showing these films with more screenings a day then how do they know if it would be more successful or not?  All indications are that The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo will do very well at the box office this week.  Let’s face it, it’s not a hard sell, based on a best selling novel.
Or maybe it’s the subtitle issue.  You probably know my feelings on this particular subject.  If you are scared of reading subtitled films (and it’s not because of something like dyslexia) you really are missing out on some amazing films.  Cinema Paradiso, Pans Labyrinth, The Ring (original version), Children of God, Y Tu Mama Tambien, the list goes on.
But I’d even go and see the dubbed version of this, that’s how keen I am to see it.  There is a dubbed version out there, they could get that.
Like I say, cultural backwater.  There’s the Dorman museum if you ever know what’s on there, there’s MIMA which is hit and miss and apparently there is another place just across the border but buggered if I know where it is.
The Transporter Bridge is a prime example.  Only working bridge of its type in Britain, the walk to it is through a very run down area.  Anywhere else it would have a dedicated museum to the history of the bridge and the surrounding area.  I think there is one here but, again, I’m not sure if there is or if it actually exists.
There are a few bright spots.  There’s the cinema at The Arc.  But that’s in Stockton so you have to take into account the cost/time it takes to actually get there which means that if you’re on a budget it’s usually not worth it.  There is the start of a writing scene but it tends to be a) a bit cliquey and b) mostly centred around poetry so if you don’t like/can’t write such you fell a bit left out.
Even the AV Festival seems to have given up.  Supposedly run between Newcastle, Sunderland and Middlesbrough, the main thing this year was a series of short films shown on a screen in the middle of town.
When the most exciting thing culturally to happen in a while was filming an episode of Top Gear you know you may have issues.

Title: The Passage
Author: Justin Cronin
The word epic is bandied around a lot.  Films are epic, journeys are epic, sports events are epic.
The problem with all this is that when something deserves to be described that way, it seems like hyperbole.
Which is my way of saying that The Passage truly is an epic book.
Starting out roughly our era and spanning many, many years this first part of a trilogy impressed me with the sheer scale and ambition shown.  This is the first part of a trilogy but could very easily be split into two books of it’s own.  Even at it’s mammoth length the pacing is quick and left me wanting more.
While all this may be true, it is obvious that Cronin remembered the immortal words scrawled on a whiteboard by Ronald D Moore: It’s The Characters, Stupid!  Although it has quite a lengthy cast list every character is one that you can get behind and care about.  Everything they do has a purpose and meaning, something that is sadly lacking in a lot of books nowadays.
It’s as obvious why Ridley Scott has optioned this book for a film as it is hard to work out how it’s going to work on the big screen.  I haven’t said much about the book itself as I don’t want to spoil it for everyone.
When this book is released run, don’t walk, don’t boogie but RUN to your local bookstore and get yourself a copy of what I can confidently say will end up being my favourite book of the year.

So, this weeks theme question is: What seemingly inconsequential decision did you make, or what seemingly inconsequential event occurred in your life, that ended up profoundly changing your life?
And just as I argued that it’s pointless wanting to change sonmething in your past my thesis here is this question is unanswerable.
The reason for that is in the question.  Seemingly inconsequential.  It is my personal belief that short of deciding what socks to put on of a morning every choice that a person makes and every event has significance.  It cannot be any other way.  Every choice we make, every event we take part in has a role in shaping what we become and who we are.
The trick is to reverse this and treat every choice we make and every event as if it is of no consequence.  The alternative is to live your life making no choices.  Which is a waste of a life.
Or you could just curl up in a ball, keening to yourself.

I am so frakking tired.  Not sure why though.  It’s not as if I haven’t been getting any decent nights sleep recently.
(Well, except for last night which was interrupted.)
But, yeah, I’m knackered.  It’s accompanied by a dull (very dull) headache.  Meh, I’ll survive.
Also kinda hungry.  But that’s due to it being payday tomorrow.
Oooh, curry club is also tomorrow.  Might head to that for some nommage.
Apart from that, things are OK.  Enjoying my creative writing class (for which I have to write a story in which I’m a ghost).  It’s actually really good to be writing on such a regular basis to be honest.
I’m also planning to entry this which should be fun.  Just got to find a landmark in Boro to crucify someone on…
Funny story for you guys.  Over here the legal age for drinking is 18, however most places now run a thing where if you look under 25 you have to show ID.  Now, beside when I was at home for the holidays which was for baccy, I haven’t been ID’d in years (and even that was the member of barstaff being cautious).
So, on Saturday I was round at my friend Nikki’s chilling, watching TV and having a laugh with her and her lad.  He decided to send the two of us for more lager.  Nikki asked me to pay as she quite often gets asked for ID.
Guess who got refused service for not having proper ID?
Nikki was pissed off, I thought it was hilarious, everyone else I’ve talked to thought the same thing.  To top it off, we went to another shop where I got served both booze and baccy no problem.
Just about at the end of this, don’t worry.
Also managed to get myself three free books last week.  If you are in the UK and on twitter, follow @Waterstones  They occasionally say that they have x amount of a certain book to give away if you get your email address to them.  Problem is, they don’t tell you if you’ve been successful or not.  So, imagine my surprise last week when first of all I got the first two books in the Conspiracy 365 series by Gabrielle Lord and then on Friday an uncorrected bound manuscript proof copy of The Passage by Justin Cronin which isn’t due out till June.
And I’m just waiting to find out if I’ve got a copy of The White Queen by Philippa Gregory.  So, cool free books are free!
I’m going to go now.  A) I’m probably boring you and B) have to get ready to listen to the Scotland game.
Will

For a bit of asshattery:

Written for Year of Creativity
Prompt: I like my romance like I like my _____________
This months prompt was difficult for me.  Which is really kinda hard to explain, as I came up with it in the first place.
But I really cannot say how I like my romance.
Each relationship I’ve been in has been different.  Live together, long distance, good times, an unmitigated disaster, never the same.  So, it’s a bit hard for me to complete that sentence.
When you also throw into the mix the fact that I am perfectly content being single (as I am now) compared to when I was younger and thought it to be a disaster if I wasn’t dating someone, it gets harder.  (Seriously, folks, it is OK to be single.)
So, my answer would be that I like my romance like I like my life.  Unpredictable.

Afterthoughts Of A Worm Hunter and Collectible Spoons of the Third Reich have been shortlisted for this year’s oddest book title award.
A public vote will determine the winner of The Diagram Prize, to be announced on 26 March.
Trade magazine The Bookseller, which runs the competition, said it received a “record number” of entries this year.
Previous champions include Bombproof Your Horse and Living With Crazy Buttocks.
According to Nielsen BookScan, Afterthoughts Of A Worm Hunter by David Crompton has not sold a single copy in the UK or US.
The shortlist of six books was narrowed down from 90 entries, including Bacon: A Love Story and I Stopped Sucking My Thumb… Why Can’t You Stop Drinking?
The Diagram Prize has been running since 1978 under the watchful eye of The Bookseller’s Horace Bent.
“I received a record number of submissions,” Mr Bent said.
“Sadly, however, almost half the submissions were ineligible as they were published well before 2009.
“However, even after the initial cull, the list was still considerable in size, meaning my panel of esteemed literary minds and I were forced into ruthlessness, brutally cutting any submission we felt carried a deliberately odd title.”
The 2009 shortlist is as follows:
Afterthoughts of a Worm Hunter by David Crompton
The Changing World of Inflammatory Bowel Disease by Ellen Scherl and Marla Dubinsky
Collectible Spoons of the 3rd Reich by James A Yannes
Crocheting Adventures with Hyperbolic Planes by Daina Taimina
Governing Lethal Behavior in Autonomous Robots by Ronald C Arkin

Anyone interested in reading it and giving me feedback?  I’ll be giving it a quick polish tomorrow, so it’ll probably by Monday before it gets sent out.

…Dominate This Years RAZZIE® Nominations
Following a Banner Year for Bad Movies, voting members of The Golden Raspberry Award Foundation have sifted through the cinematic rubble and selected what they consider to be last years Berry Worst Achievements in Film. In addition to 2009s top under-achievers, The Gala 30th Annual RAZZIE® Awards will dis-honor The Worst of the Uh-Ohs, with special awards for the Worst Picture, Actor and Actress of the Decade in ceremonies scheduled for Hollywood’s Barnsdall Gallery Theatre at 7:30pm/PST on Saturday, March 6  the now traditional Night Before the Oscars®.
Leading the pack among this years RAZZIE® contenders are one of the years biggest money-makers and the years biggest money-loser, each with seven nods. RAZZIE® Repeat Offender Michael Bay helped lead the over-loud, over-long, uber-stupid TRANSFORMERS: REVENGE OF THE FALLEN to a huge box office take…and to a huge haul of RAZZIE® nominations as well. In addition to Worst Director and Worst Picture, the film is up for Worst Remake, Rip-Off or Sequel, Worst Screenplay, Worst Supporting Actress (Julie White as the stoned, screaming mother of Shia Le Bouf), Worst Screen Couple (Le Bouf and EITHER Megan Fox OR Any Transformer) and Worst Actress (Fox again, dually nominated for this film and JENNIFERS BODY). Keeping up with TRANNIES, TOO in the RAZZIE® race (but decidedly not at the box office) is Last Summers Biggest B.O. bomb, LAND OF THE LOST, also with 7 shots at taking home spray-painted gold. LOST star Will Ferrell is listed in both Worst Actor and Worst Screen Couple (Ferrell & Any Co-Star, Creature or Comic Riff) and the film itself is also nominated for Worst Picture, Worst Director, Worst Screenplay, Worst Remake, Rip-Off or Sequel and Worst Supporting Actor (the screaching Jorma Taccone as the monkeylike Cha-Ka). Rounding out the Worst Picture list are the Disney dud OLD DOGS, the awful action-figures-come-to-life 9-Year-Old-Boy-Movie G.I. JOE: THE RISE OF COBRA and the So-Good-It-Was-Held-Back-from-Release-for-2-Years comedy ALL ABOUT STEVE (whose star, Worst Actress nominee Sandra Bullock, could pull off the unprecedented feat of winning a RAZZIE® one day before winning an Oscar®).
Other well-known names shamed as being last years worst include 2010 Oscar® co-host Steve Martin (Worst Actor for PINK PANTHER 2), Beyonce (Worst Actress for OBSESSED), Worst Actor of the Decade contenders Eddie Murphy (up for Worst Actor of 2009 in IMAGINE THAT) and John Travolta (Worst Actor of 2009 for OLD DOGS) as well as the twitty Dizz-Knee tween idols Miley Cyrus (Worst Actress for HANNAH MONTANA: THE MOVIE) and any two or more of the Jonas Brothers, nominated jointly for Worst Actor and Worst Screen Couple  for their documentary JONAS BROS. A 3-D CONCERT EXPERIENCE. A complete list of nominees is included with this press release.
Nominees were determined by mailing ballots to 647 Foundation members in 46 U.S. states and 19 foreign countries. The RAZZIES® were created in 1980 as a logical antidote to Tinsel Towns annual glut of self-congratulatory awards by John Wilson, author of THE OFFICIAL RAZZIE® MOVIE GUIDE and EVERYTHING I KNOW I LEARNED AT THE MOVIES. The Barnsdall Gallery Theatre is a facility of the City of Los Angeles Department of Cultural Affairs.
For more information on the awards history, or to arrange an interview with Wilson, please visit the official RAZZIE® web site (www.razzies.com) or contact HeadRAZZberry@razzies.com

Today is Tuesday, Jan. 19, the 19th day of 2010. There are 346 days left in the year.
Today’s Highlight in History:
On Jan. 19, 1960, the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between Japan and the United States of America was signed by both countries in Washington, D.C. (Domestic opposition to the treaty led to the resignation of Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi (nah-boo-soo-keh kee-shee)).
On this date:
In 1807, Confederate general Robert E. Lee was born in Westmoreland County, Va.
In 1809, author, poet and critic Edgar Allan Poe was born in Boston.
In 1853, Giuseppe Verdi’s opera “Il Trovatore” premiered in Rome.
In 1861, Georgia seceded from the Union.
In 1937, millionaire Howard Hughes set a transcontinental air record by flying his monoplane from Los Angeles to Newark, N.J., in seven hours, 28 minutes and 25 seconds.
In 1955, a presidential news conference was filmed for television for the first time, with the permission of President Dwight D. Eisenhower.
In 1966, Indira Gandhi was elected prime minister of India.
In 1970, President Richard M. Nixon nominated G. Harrold Carswell to the Supreme Court; however, the nomination was defeated because of controversy over Carswell’s past racial views.
In 1980, retired Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas died in Washington, D.C. at age 81.
In 1990, Arthur J. Goldberg, former Supreme Court justice, labor secretary and U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, was found dead in his Washington apartment at age 81.
Ten years ago: Michael Skakel (SKAY’-kul), a nephew of Robert F. Kennedy, was charged with bludgeoning to death 15-year-old Martha Moxley in Greenwich (GREH’-nich), Conn. in 1975, when he was also 15. (Skakel was later convicted, and is appealing.) A dormitory fire at Seton Hall University in New Jersey killed three people and injured 62. Former Italian Prime Minister Bettino Craxi died in Tunisia at age 65. Actress Hedy Lamarr was found dead in her Orlando, Fla. home; she was 85.
Five years ago: Previewing his second inauguration, President George W. Bush pledged to seek unity in a nation divided by political differences, saying, “I am eager and ready for the work ahead.” Condoleezza Rice won strong but not unanimous endorsement as secretary of state from a Senate panel. The American Cancer Society reported that cancer had passed heart disease as the top killer of Americans age 85 and younger. Former chairman and chief executive of Citicorp Walter B. Wriston died in New York at age 85.
One year ago: Russia and Ukraine signed a deal restoring natural gas shipments to Ukraine and paving the way for an end to the nearly two-week cutoff of most Russian gas to a freezing Europe.

Former U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar is 90.

Yup, I’m now 32.  (Which means that it’s only 10 years till my age is the answer.)  Got an appointment later on and I’ll probably have a couple in the union tonight.  Apart from that, not doing much.

Written for Year of Creativity
Prompt:  New beginnings are fine, but I’m glad some things stay the same
So, here I am.  First night out in a new town.  It was a pain having to move here for this promotion.  Im very much a homebody.  Never left the place of my birth for longer than a weeks holiday.
But this is where the job is, so this is where I need to be.  Im sure Ill adjust eventually.  Itll be slightly easier when I make some friends.  And when I stop imagining that I know people here.  It happens all the time.  I pass someone on the street, think I know them, then work out that it cant actually be that person as theyre hundreds of miles away.
Thankfully work has given me this first week off so I can adjust to living here.  Decompression time theyve called it.  I dont actually want this, I just want to get back to work.  But its mandatory.  Feels a bit like gardening leave, like Im being punished.
Which is why Im here.  Someone from the office back home has been here for business a few times and highly recommended this place as somewhere thats worth coming to.  He helped me a lot, giving me a list of places to see, nice restaurants and take out places and, of course, pubs to drink in.  As well as some to avoid.
I know that most people dont like drinking alone.  One of my friends back home has almost a pathological hatred of doing so.  Then again, Ive never really claimed to be most people.  I dont mind sitting on my own in a bar, having a pint (or five) and reading the book I always have on me.  The trick is to stop reading when you get too drunk to make out what has been written.
So, here I am.  On my own.  Reading.  (The Girl Who Kicked The Hornets Nest, in case you are wondering.  Highly recommended.)  People seem to be avoiding me.  Whether this is because Im reading, or because they dont know me, Im not sure.  It doesnt really bother me, to be perfectly honest.  Then she comes in.
She isnt a supermodel by any means, but shes not completely unattractive either.  Kinda has an indie punk thing going on.  Just the type of woman Im into.  Though I wouldnt want to piss her off, not with those clod hopper boots on.  She orders her drink, looks round and then sits at the table next to mine.
Good book? she asks.
Definitely.  You read any of the other ones in the series?
Ive read the first one.  Currently making my way through book two and wishing that there was more to come from him after that one.
Trust me, I say.  Its not a bad legacy to leave behind.
I know.  If I ever make it as a writer and I die before my time, Id want this sort of recognition, she replies.  Ive not seen you here before.  New in town?
Just moved here yesterday from Wales.  Business.  Im Alex, by the way.  I hold my hand out and she shakes it.  I then kiss the back of her hand.  Some think thats old fashioned but I dont care.
Amy, she says.  You know anyone in this place?
Only the boss so far.  Im sure Ill meet more people.
Unless you stay in your house all the time.  You likely to do that?
Not at the moment.  As soon as I get internet in the house, maybe.  I blush slightly as I realise Ive just outed myself as a bit of a geek.
She smiles.  Yeah.  I usually have to tear myself away from my computer as well.  Its a running joke that if I could, I would physically move into cyberspace.  Like the main character in Neuromancer.
Its my turn to smile.  We chat for a bit longer about sci-fi, fantasy, favourite TV programmes, stuff like that.  Then Amy announces that she has to run.  As shes leaving, I ask her on a date.  She looks embarrassed.
Look, Alex, youre a really nice bloke.  Unfortunately, youre also the wrong gender for me.  Im suddenly fascinated by my shoes.  But, listen.  Im having a party at my house on Friday.  Youre more than welcome.
We agree to become friends on Facebook.  As she leaves, I pick up my book and resume reading.  As I do I think.
New beginnings are fine.  But at least my legendary bad luck with the opposite sex is still alive and well.

So, last Wednesday I made the return trip to Middlesbrough.  Safe in the knowledge that it wouldn’t be as bad as the trip up
I didn’t start packing (as is the usual for me) until the morning of the trip.  Thankfully, it doesn’t take me long to pack.  This is what I took back with me:

See the green bag?  Nothing but books.  And I couldn’t even fit all my books into there, I had some in my backpack as well.
Got to the train station early.  So I went to Poundland to get the incense tower I had seen a few days before.  Back to the train station and onto the train.  Here are some random pics out the train window:






Got off the train in Edinburgh.  Messed about for a bit then went for a smoke.  Checked which platform my train was due onto first.  Platform 3.  
Checked when I got back in.  Platform 3.  Went to platform 3.  No train.  Turns out it was platform 9.  By the time I got there, the train had left.  No problem.  Went for a cheeky pint and then caught a later train.  Just as the train was about to pull out, got a phone call reminding me of my appointment the next day at 3pm.  No idea who it was.  Turns out it was a4e, who the job centre have sent me to.  I was asked if I had received the letter they sent, at which point I mentioned that I had been in Aberdeen for a fortnight and that the train taking me back was just about to leave Edinburgh train station (which it was, it started pulling out as we were talking.
Edinburgh – Newcastle no problem.  Got some editing done on a story I had written (the one I was looking for feedback on in my last entry), watched Statuesque (written and directed by Neil Gaiman) and the season finale of Glee.  Got on the train in Newcastle and finally back to Boro about 9pm (a couple of hours late).
Phoned my mum to let her know I’d arrived home safely and went for a drink.  Got back to the house about 10:30 to see a sticker for a locksmith on my door.  Tried my key, no joy.  Knocked on the door, no answer.  As it was too late to phone my landlord I phoned a friend to see if I could crash for the night.  Unfortunately, she wasn’t feeling well and said no.  No problem, phoned another friend and stayed at his.
Phoned my landlord the next day.  It turns out that bailiffs had come round on Wednesday looking for former tenants of the house (my landlord knew this was the case as it was about a gas bill.  My rent includes all bills) and the lock needed changing.  My housemate had a key for me and was in.  So no more pink leopard print key of doom :¬(
After opening my mail (which included Christmas cards from people on OD, for which I thank you all) I opened my birthday present from my sister and brother in law.  Shouldn’t have done, considering my birthday isn’t till the 19th, but they should have expected it.  It was a gorgeous shirt, which came in handy for my appointment.  Got changed and went to the bank as it was payday.
No money.  Bugger.
I had to go to the job centre to let them know I was back anyway.  It turns out that because I missed my signing on Monday (despite the fact they knew I would be in Aberdeen) I wouldn’t get my money till I had signed.  So it would be Tuesday before it went into my account.
Which left me with no money and no food (apart from a few rowies I brought down with me) until then.
I went to my appointment with a4e, the person I’ve been assigned to is actually quite hot, which is a bonus, and had to do this thing on a computer.  It was a basic read the statement and score from strongly agree to strongly disagree thing.  Some of the questions I could under stand (I have an up to date CV, I an mentally capable of seeking employment) but there was this segment in the middle with things like I am a solitary person and have few friends, I want to speak to someone about my mental problems, I have no confidence, I don’t like the way I look, etc.  About 30 of the things.  Not to do with work IMHO but more about discovering if I’m clinically depressed.  Which I’m not, but the questions were starting to get me down.
I’ve to do it all again in about a month.
Made an appointment for my induction on my birthday and went home.  I would have gone to the library to go online, but it closed early due to the weather.  Texted a friend to see if they could lend me money to get me through the weekend and they said OK.  So I went round to their house, had a few beers and a chat then went home with some money.  Which I used to buy a parmo, as I was craving one.
Friday, didn’t do too much.  Had a bit of a strange film double bill.  I decided to watch Smokey and the Bandit followed by Mr Smith Goes To Washington.  Good films.
Saturday went online a bit.  Downloaded the new episode of Dollhouse (that was a bit of a shock at the end) and a couple of other things then met up with a couple of friends to watch Soccer Saturday, which was surreal as there weren’t many games on due to the weather.  Then went to Scruffies where I had a bizarre conversation.  I went outside for a smoke and put my hat on cos it was cold.  Now, my hat has the Saltire on it.  This random female asked me if I was from the X Factor, as that’s what it said on my hat.  I pointed out it was a Scotland hat.  Her response?
Are you from Scotland?  Do you play the bagpipes?  Are you wearing underwear?
Things got more bizarre from there.  (Apparently, everything north of Edinburgh are hills and bagpipes.)  Till then, I thought the strangest thing I would hear all day was a friend asking if JohnnyCash was from Birmingham.
Left the pub, went home, watched WWE Raw (still can’t believe I saw Bret Hart in a WWE ring again) and slept.
Yesterday I watched Hamilton – Rangers (Rangers were damn lucky), the Scottish Cup draw (which was kind to Aberdeen), Leicester – Ipswich (with a very early goal), had a few drinks and then home to watch Dollhouse.
And that’s us up to date.
One more pic: who says Boro aren’t involved in any big games?

But, for now, a cheeky request.
I have a short story that I am planning to submit somewhere and it’s due at the end of the month.  I’ve already edited it once and was wondering if anyone would be interested in reading it and giving me feedback?

I do have to point out that there will be spoilers in this entry.  If you haven’t seen the two parter in question, go read something else.  Or go back an entry to ask me questions.

So, here it is.  The End of Time.  The last adventure of the Tenth Doctor.
And, for what it was, it was quite good.  The first part was your average RTD first parter.  Some good ideas not properly utilised (loved the idea of the Grey Cloak over London, just would have built it up a bit more.  Maybe have the Doctor have heard of it but not know what it was till Wilf explained.)  The Master ‘rebirth’ scene should and could have been slightly better.  John Simm, however, was in the finest scenery chewing mode as the Master.  Which was refreshing to see, though it did make me wonder why he was so hungry all the time.
Big yay for Wilf making the step up to full companion (I think I said the idea gave me a happy in my geek place in TTZ) and, as usual, Bernard Cribbins was outstanding.  Sadly, this did mean the return of Donna bloody Noble.  Well, that’s not fair, as I actually quite like the idea of the character as a character.  What I meant to say was it marked the return of Catherine bloody Tate.  (Seriously, I’ve tried to suffer through an episode of her ‘comedy’ series, put up with her quiet or shouty and nothing inbetween acting method in DW and watched her on Never Mind The Buzzcocks and I have to ask what the fuck she is actually famous for?  She seems to be fucking useless at everything.)
It’s ironic to me, when the Narrator said something about everyone moving to their places because that’s what most RTD two parter episode one’s feel like to me.  He’s just moving the characters round in some vaguely interesting way till they are where they need to be for the ending he has designated, which usually involves a cool visual.  Which he managed twice this time with both the Master race and the scene with the Time Lords.
Then, in part two, we got too many ideas, not enough time to fill them out properly.  The return of the Time Lords and Gallifrey should have been fleshed out more.  The talk between the Doctor and Wilf was a wonderful moment that I loved but also feel, with the way the parts were split up we could have done without.  Personally, I’d have ended part one with the Master finding the diamond and the Doctor powering the ship back up.
The scene where the Doctor is tempted to go against all of his beliefs and shoot someone, therefore being directly responsible for their death rather than peripherally was good, as was the way he found to get out of it.  The twist given to the ‘he will knock four times and then the Doctor will die’ prophesy was inspired.
Then we get to my main problem with the whole thing.  And the bit that will probably alienate people.  The last 10-15 minutes.
Look, maybe it’s because I’ve been a fan since the 80’s and had to live through about 15 Wholess years with only a semi decent TV movie to get me through.  Maybe it’s because I was unlikely to be too upset at the tenth Doctor dieing because I’ve been there.  But the only tears that segment almost moved me to were ones of boredom.
It was just RTD showing off.  I know that some will say that it was the Doctor saying goodbye to people but it was just.  Not.  At.  All.  Necessary.  And the fact that all but two of the characters in question first appeared in RTD episodes of the show proves that.
(The inclusion of Midshipman Frame was particularly out of place and seemed to only be there cos RTD seems to have a thing for Russell Tovey.)
We could just have easily done without it.  It wasn’t the Doctor, or RTD, saying goodbye to the characters.  It was RTD saying look what I did people!  For me, it took away from the regeneration completely.
(Oh, and the fact that the regeneration was exactly the same as the one from the ninth Doctor to the Tenth slightly annoyed me as well.  This is actually a deeply, deeply personal thing but, not only is it the first time that I can remember that that has happened, the regeneration is the first thing to clue people in to the fact that the character name may well be the same but the characterisation will be different.  As I said, that is very much just me.)
Then we got the eleventh Doctor.  I loved this scene, the stuff the Doctor was saying (‘still not ginger) and the trashing of the TARDIS interior to explain the new look.  Matt Smith and Steven Moffat combining to prove that the future looks very bright indeed.
Will
*EDIT*
To all those complaining about the eleventh Doctors not ginger comment:
GET.  A.  FUCKING.  LIFE!

867,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/tv-answers-3930183/,2009-12-30,TV answers,"
Sorry it took me so long to get to these, but here you go:
dear_gertrudeperkins gets things kicked off:
Best Christmas episode of any TV show and why?
There are a lot of good Christmas episodes out there.  The king of writing these, however, has to be Aaron Sorkin.  From Sports Night to Studio 60, his Christmas shows are always a cut above average, and it’s no surprise that the actor playing the character at the heart of each West Wing Christmas episode usually walked away with an Emmy.  Of these, Bartlet for America, from the shows third season, is not only the best Christmas episode of any TV show ever but, IMHO, the second best hour of television ever.
Best pilot to new series and why?
There’s so many, I’m not sure how to choose.  Serenity, the original pilot for Firefly.  Pie-lette from Pushing Daisies.  The West Wing and Studio 60 pilots.  Rose from NuWho.  The pilot for Glee.  The miniseries for Battlestar Galactica.  Pick one.
Incidentally, Virtuality stands alone as greatest pilot NOT to make it to series.  Damn you Fox!
Best series finale and why?  
Best series finale that was intended to be a series finale is definitely Not Fade Away from Angel.  Best that wasn’t?  Wonderfalls.
Next we have *Moonglow*:
Fav firefly character and why?
Kaylee.  What can I say?  I have a thing for geeky girls.  Wash is a very close second though.
Fav episode?
I take it you mean of Firefly?  Out Of Gas.  I still cannot believe that Fox originally wanted it to be re-edited into chronological order.
Best Joss Whedon?
I would say Dr Horrible, but that’s not TV.  I want to say Dollhouse as it had huge potential.  Sadly there were too many bad episodes (including, IMHO, the worst episode of any Joss Whedon project).  Buffy and Angel both had consistency problems at times.  So, I’m going to have to go with Firefly.  DAMN YOU FOX!
OH! and favourite “reality show” ( if you dont watch, which would you watch if you HAD to?)
The Apprentice.
SHARPSkinkid had a couple as well:
Angel or Buffy (show?)
Angel.  As said above, both had consistency issues.  But, as much as I love Buffy, when Angel was on the top of it’s game it was miles ahead of it’s parent show.
Greatest drama of all time?
If this had said greatest show of all time, I’d have gone with Battlestar Galactica (new version).  But as it didn’t, nor did it ask about sci-fi, I have to go with The Wire.  It is just so far above average it’s not even funny.  David Simon made a comment about having to teach people how to watch the show, but I don’t think assuming intelligence in an audience is a bad thing.  If you haven’t seen The Wire yet do so.  Ignore everything you’ve been told about how good it is.  It’s far, far, far better than that.
Better channel: BBC or HBO?
This is a difficult one.  I don’t uniformly like either channels output so I can’t base it on that.  I’m going to have to go with HBO, simply cos they take more risks.  It’s what the BBC should be doing, but I realise they are stuck between a rock and a hard place.  If they do make more risky programmes, they get accused of being elitist and there are questions about the license fee.  If they simply chase ratings, they get accused of wasting the license fee on chasing the lowest common denominator (despite the fact that quality programming and ratings aren’t normally mutually exclusive).  But I’d still like to see them have the balls to say to someone like Jimmy McGovern or Paul Abbott ‘You have five years, x amount of episodes a year and no ratings to worry about.  Give us something like The Wire.’
And finally, we have SocksOnRye:
Favorite Dollhouse character and why?
Oh lord.  Here we go.  Probably Topher, because he’s slightly creepy but has a very strong sense of morality.  Somewhere.  (Favourite actor, BTW, is Enver Gjokaj who really should have an amazing career ahead of him.)
Favorite TV director (favorite episode/show they’ve directed?)
I don’t really know that many TV directors.  Or if I do it’s because that don’t just direct (Joss Whedon, Tim Minear, JJ Abrams).  I do know Euros Lynn because, well, you try forgetting that name.  Tommy Schlemme from working with Aaron Sorkin.  Timothy Busfield, ditto.  Most of the male cast of The West Wing had a go at directing at some point, as did Dominic West over on The Wire.  I’m going to have to go with Tim Minear and Through The Looking Glass.  Why?  ‘Numfar, do the dance of joy!’
Favorite freshman 09 show?
I’m going to split this into two.  British and American.
British:  I really, really want to be cheeky and say Torchwood, cos this was the year in which I feel we actually got Torchwood, but I’m going to have to make that my most improved.  Instead, I’m going to pick trinity, a little show on ITV2 starring Charles Dance.  It’s set in an exclusive university where strange things are afoot.  This show proves that ITV can do decent sci-fi.  I don’t know why they stuck it on ITV2 instead of ITV and I hope it’s coming back.  Even if they were a bit lazy with some character names (seriously, see if you can guess where in Britain the character Angus Fergus is from).
America:  I really want to be able to say Dollhouse but see above.  So this will be split two ways.  Glee is just fantastic.  It’s obvious that the last episode was planned in case the show was cancelled but thankfully that’s not happening.  And Joss Whedon will be directing for it.  Now, if only it wasn’t on hiatus till April.  DAMN YOU FOX!!!  The other one is Castle.  Brilliant cop show which is more about the characters than the cases.  Thankfully, the characters are amazing.  Nathan Fillion is obviously having the time of his life as the titular Richard Castle and the Halloween episode is pure geek heaven.
Guilty pleasure?
There’s a show that I’ve stumbled across called The Cut.  It’s a webseries with half hour long catchups on the BBC iPlayer.  Most of the cast are kinda-sorta could be famous types, the acting goes from passably good to could be better and they don’t seem to have got to grips with the idea that you don’t cram tom many storylines into 5 minute episodes.  But i still like watching it and, again, hope it comes back.  The music in it is also decent, even if the theme tune has the worse lyrics I’ve heard since ‘Are we humans, or are we dancers’.
And there we have it.  I probably won’t get my last DePhoMo pic posted till tomorrow (as I’m planning to take it at midnight), so I’d just like to wish everyone a happy Hogmanay and all the best for 2010.
Oh, quick reminder.  For those of you wanting to take part in Year of Creativity, remember that it does start tomorrow.  And if you’re not sure what that actually is, go here

…about this journey?
Tuesday night, I had decided not to sleep as I had an early train the next day.  So I stayed up and left the house at 5:15 to get my 5:45 train.
I thought that this had left me enough time, despite the amount of ice on the roads and pavements due to the snow over the weekend.  I had managed the walk before in those conditions.  Sadly though, I completely forgot about the fact that it may take slightly longer due to the additional weight.  So, as I was walking as fast as I could to the train station, I saw my train pull away.
I panicked.  Went to the bus station to see if there were any buses I could catch that would mean not missing the train from Newcastle to Edinburgh I was booked on.  Eventually I calmed down and decided to just catch the later train.  This would mean it was tighter than I would have liked getting to the bus station in Edinburgh but I’d cope.
Got to Newcastle no problem.  Got on the train to Edinburgh slightly worried that I’d get into bother for not being on the right train.  But, as usual, the ticket inspector didn’t even notice.
The train was delayed getting into Edinburgh so that, and some problems finding the bus station, meant that I rocked up half an hour late.  I went to the ticket desk and plead for help, stating that the problem was caused solely by a delayed train.  It was then that I was told not to worry too much as the 8:35 bus on the service I was supposed to catch had left about ten minutes ago.
I phoned my mum to let her know what was happening and then went to the pub.  Returned just in time to hear them announce a bus to Dundee.  I did have a change there, but first I was headed to Perth, so I ignored it.  Then, a full hour after I got to the bus station, my bus was called.  Stashed one of my bags in the hold, got on the bus only to have the driver give me a bit of a bollocking for not getting on the earlier bus to Dundee.  He then advised me to wait for the next Dundee bus which would be there in about half an hour.
I did so, taking time to go for a smoke.  Then the bus turned up.  Just in time for me to discover that I’d lost my ticket.  I threw myself at the mercy of the ticket desk again, who were able to print out another one for me.  Onto the bus go I, where the driver, after asking why I didn’t get on the earlier Dundee bus made a comment about it not being my day.  Not wanting to delay the bus another half an hour, I simply agreed.
Got into Dundee and phoned my mother again to give her an update.  Then hung around waiting for my bus which was only 10 minutes late.  Got on, sat down, started reading and before I knew it I was in Aberdeen.
Nine and a half hours.  I’ll say it again.  NINE AND A HALF FUCKING HOURS/  That’s from getting on the train in Boro to getting into the new bus station in Aberdeen.  The journey normally only takes 6, 7 hours at the very most.  Phoned my mum to tell her I’d landed and then pissed off down the pub for the pint featured two entries back.
Fingers crossed, the journey back down the road will be a lot simpler.
Will

I know I wrote about my love of books before* but I really do think I would rather live in a world with no colour in it than live without good reading material.
And now for the answers to what yesterdays pics were:

Guesses for this one were split between a radiator and the correct answer, a barcode.

The most common answer for this one was a CD/DVD, with an eye coming in a close second.  A sink plug hole and a dial were also guessed.  It is, in fact, the lens for my camera.

*EDIT*
Cos I just had to add this joke:
A man in Aberdeen calls his son in London the day before Christmas Eve and says “I hate to ruin your day but I have to tell you that your mother and I are divorcing; 45 years of misery is enough.”
“Dad, what are you talking about?” the son screams.
“We can’t stand the sight of each other any longer,” the father says. 
“We’re sick of each other and I’m sick of talking about this, so you call your sister in Leeds and tell her.”
Frantically, the son calls his sister, who explodes on the phone. “Like hell they’re getting divorced,” she shouts, “I’ll take care of this!”
She calls Aberdeen immediately: You are NOT getting divorced. Don’t do a single thing until I get there. I’m calling my brother back, and we’ll both be there tomorrow. Until then, don’t do a thing, DO YOU HEAR ME?” and hangs up.
The old man hangs up his phone and turns to his wife. “Sorted! They’re coming for Christmas – and they’re paying their own way

The Year of Creativity.
The idea would be that on the first of each month I would post a prompt, which would be a sentence.  People could then use this prompt to create something.  Could be a short story, a photo series, a painting, a short film, anything you like.  You can use the prompt right in the piece you’ve created (as a line of dialogue in a short story, for example) or as the inspiration.  You can even mix things up, a short story with an illustration or a photo series intermixed with a poem.
What do people think?  Is this something you might be interested in participating in?
And if you know anyone who may also be interested, send them to this entry.

892,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/wrapped-up-in-books-2-3930158/,2009-12-01,Wrapped up in books,"
I started reading at a young age.  It wasnt entirely by choice, though I always have enjoyed reading.  The main reason I started reading was, in fact, medical.
When I was a child, I had a squint in one eye.  The side effect of this was twofold.  The first was that I had to wear a pair of horrible thick brown framed glasses.  The second was that for two hours every night, for about a year or so, I could take off the glasses in order to wear an eye patch over my strong eye.  While wearing the patch, I had to actually do something, not just sit and stare at a television.  It was recommended that I do one of three things: jigsaw puzzles, crosswords and word searches or read.  I didnt have the patience for jigsaws (still dont, if truth be told) nor for crosswords.  So I read.  (One side effect of this is the speed with which I read.  It amazes people when I look at a particularly thick book and tell the truth about how quickly I can read through it.)
Growing up in the 80s was a particularly bad time for new childrens books.  The world was still waiting for Lyra Belaqua and The Boy Who Lived to enthral and encourage young people to read.  I made do with most Enid Blyton books, the works of Roald Dahl and Asterix and Tintin introducing me to the concept of what I now know to be graphic novels but thought then to simply be comics.  JRR Tolkein was my first introduction to fantasy and the idea that books dont just have to be set in this world but can create entire worlds and universes to be enjoyed.
I was a voracious reader.  Every Wednesday would see me waiting patiently for the mobile library to turn up.  The library at school was another popular haunt.  And it absolutely delighted me when one of my primary school teachers had a collection of books that we could take home with us, as long as we signed for it first.
When I moved up to academy, the school library again became a favourite spot.  In this library the books were segmented by the year that they were deemed suitable for and it was nothing for me to take out and read material that the powers that be thought was aimed at an older age group.
It would be nothing for me to have more than one book on the go, one in the living room where I would curl up and read while the TV was on in the background and one in the bedroom where I would read before going to bed.
After I left school, I discovered the simple joy of wondering round charity shops and discount bookstores looking for something that attracted my attention.  Fiction, non-fiction, almost every genre, if I thought Id like it then I would buy it.  Sometimes it was simply if the title grabbed my attention, as A Handbook for Visitors from Outer Space did, that lead me to buy it, sort of my version of Belle and Sebastians Ill only buy a book for the way it looks, then Ill stick it on the shelf again.  Recommendations from friends and reviews in papers were another way for me to discover something new (and sometimes the two combined as with Northern Lights) as was the ever popular if you liked that book then try… gambit (best discovery with that was The Rule Of Four which was recommended for people who read The DaVinci Code but turned out to be much better).
Sometimes recommendations will surprise me.  The Time Travellers Wife was recommended to me and I wanted to read it due to the sci-fi element.  That part is, as it turns out, the lesser of the reasons I love that book so much.  One of the best pleasures I have in life is recommending books to someone, but it is always tinged with a bit of envy as theyll have the joy of falling in love with the book in question for the first time ever whereas I only have the delight in re-discovering why I love the book at all.
This essay is supposed to be about what books have an influence on me as a writer.  So why, you may be wondering, have I spent time telling you the above?  Well, as I have the belief that humans are more than a mere collection of flesh, bone, muscle and sinews but more made up by our collective of experiences, thoughts, beliefs and decisions both made and not made, so all of the stuff that Ive read over the years has, in some way or another, an influence on my writing.  I cannot see how it can be otherwise.
It also depends on what kind of story Im writing.  A crime story will be influenced more by Stuart MacBride, Mark Billingham and Steig Larsson than Audrey Niffenegger or Sue Townsend.  But there are some influences that I feel no matter what.
My writing tends to be short on description; to the point that I have actually been told that it is my style.  This comes from two places.  The first is the fact that I first approached creative writing from a scriptwriting perspective, where there is not a great deal of space for descriptions.  The other is the works of Raymond Chandler and Dashiel Hamnett who tended to skimp on description in order to get the story moving.
My love of wordplay can be attributed directly to Douglas Adams, whos Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy original trilogy of five remains one of my favourite reading memories from my teenage years.  In fact, I actually consider the books to be somewhat a rite of passage for anyone teenager with a love of reading and one which, if the fates deign to smile benevolently upon me and grant me a relationship with my daughter, I look forward to sharing with her.
My literary influences also include scripts.  I know that there are some who dont consider these to actually be literature but Shakespeare is considered a literary giant and not just for his sonnets.  I defy anyone to read Leo McGarrys speech about the nature of addiction for The West Wing episode Bartlet For America or the entire end voice over from Synecdoche, New York and then tell me that they cant be classed as great writing.
I love playing with peoples expectations, messing about with stereotypes.  This isnt simply putting a twist ending onto a story for the sake of having a twist ending but something more fundamental.  This I get from Joss Whedon in general and Buffy the Vampire Slayer in particular.  (The whole idea of Buffy was that someone that is supposed to be the perfect victim for vampires and monsters is in fact that thing they should all fear.)  Watchmen, and one specific moment in particular, is also an influence in this respect and one Im glad they did not cut from the film.
Another theme that influences my writing that I get from Joss Whedon is that of identity.  I love writing stories that examine exactly what makes us, well, us and putting people and humanity under the spotlight.  But Joss Whedon isnt the only person that influences me when it comes to this subject.  Charlie Kaufman is equally interested in examining identity to the extent that his entire career wouldnt exist if not for that particular theme.
There is one other influence on my writing.  Elmore Leonards belief that endings are a bitch.

895,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/od-survey-156-3930155/,2009-11-23,OD survey,"
Before I start this, you may remember in my writing entry, I said about the article that I wrote for the next issue of TTZ that I said was the most fun I had writing ever.  Well, TTZ5 is now out and you can download it here
My article is on page 10, but I recommend reading it all cos it’s good.
Now to the survey:
What is your OD username?
williamthebloody
What does it mean and why did you choose it?
It’s one of Spikes nicknames from Buffy.  Combine my love of all things Whedon with the fact it features my name and…
What other usernames have you used?
Bungo Loamsdown, sebrof and a few others
What is the title of your OD?
The Skasis Paradigm.
What does it mean and why did you choose it?
It’s from the Dr Who episode School Reunion and I chose it cos it sounds cool.  Though I am thinking of changing it to Galactica Actual.
When did you start your Open Diary?
2000.  I remember I was supposed to be writing an entry for uni, was messing about online instead and found the site.  The rest is history…
How long do you plan on keeping your diary?
As long as I can, to be honest.
How many entries (including this one) do you have in total?
1,572.  Christ, that’s more than I thought.
How many of your entries are Public?
All of ’em.  I have the philosophy that if I didn’t mind reading it, it wouldn’t be online.
How many of your entries are Friends Only?
None.
How many of your entries are Private?
None.  I have saved a few as private, only to put them public later when I finished writing them.  Cos there’s no auto save for people like me who don’t like using the WYSIWYG editor (which is damned annoying, especially after the DM made such a big deal about introducing auto save to begin with).
On average, how often do you post?
Whenever I feel the need to.
Are you a regular OD user, OD+, or OD+ Lifetime?
Regular OD at the moment.  I want to go back to OD+ but can’t afford it at the moment :¬(
Is your OD public, OD members only, OD+ members only, Friends Only, or Private?
Public.  See above.
How many Bookmarks do you have?  
Dunno.  There’s no counter on the page and I’m not counting them all.
How many Friends do you have?
See above.
Do you consider the people on your Friend list REAL friends?
Yeah, mostly.  I think all the people on my list are folks I could have a couple of jars with.
How many notes do you have?
7,854
What kind of notes do you allow in your diary?
All notes.  Unless I’m doing a quiz thing, in which case I’ll privatise notes so no-one can cheat.
Do you have the “bad words” filter turned on or off?
Off.
Have you ever received a dirty, mean, nasty, and/or rude unsigned note?
A few times.  I usually poke fun at them.
Do you delete notes that you feel are dirty, mean, nasty, and/or rude?
Nope.  I tend to leave them and, like I say, poke fun at them.
Are you a regular noter for your bookmarks and friends or do you usually lurk?
I tend to lurk more than I really want to, mostly cos I like to read all the new entries from my bookmarks and then forget to leave the appropriate notes.
Have you ever left a dirty, mean, nasty, and/or rude, unsigned note on another diarist’s OD?
Nope.  Wouldn’t do it.  I’m not that cowardly.
Who was your first Bookmark/Friend?
Really can’t remember at the moment.
Are he or she still on your Bookmark/Friend list?
There’s a very good chance they’re not on the site at all any more.
Does anyone you know in real life keep an Open Diary?
One of my friends does but she’s never been brave enough to write in it.
Have you ever spoken to anyone from your Bookmark/Friend list on the phone?
Yup.
Have you ever met any of the people on your Bookmark/Friend list in real life?
Again, yup.
Do you feel accepted by the Open Diary community?
I feel accepted by my regular readers, but I’m not really the type to look for acceptance.
When writing an entry, do you write for yourself or for your readers?
Mostly for myself.  I’m always kind of amazed that anyone would want to read my inane ramblings but if no-one read that would be fine with me.
When writing an entry, are you completely honest?
I don’t think anyone can honestly answer yes to this, to be honest.  No matter what you are doing in life, there is always a small amount of self censorship that goes on.  I don’t think that OD is any less true for that.
After writing an entry, how long to you wait before you check for notes?
Depends.  I’ve always got the first tab on Chrome open on OD so it really all depends on what else I’m reading online.
If you don’t get notes on an entry, does it make you feel hurt or let down?
Not really.  As I said before, I don’t write in here looking for acceptance.
Have you ever written an entry that didn’t allow notes and if so, why?
Nope.
Would you say that your diary has a “theme”?
Random inanity from a geeky Brit.
If you had to classify your diary style (anonymous, confessional, creative, hobby-focused, philosophical, political, technical) how would you classify it?
See above.
What do you like most about your OD?
I dunno.  There’s not really one thing that stands out.
Do you ever go back and read past entries?
On occasion.  When I worked at the call centre I read all my past entries, while taking calls, in two days.
Can you say keeping an Open Diary has changed your life and, if so, how?
Dunno.  It’s certainly given me a place to rant when I needed to and I’ve met some great people on here, I can say that.

NaNo is going OK.  I’m a bit behind on the word count but it’s nothing that a couple of days locked in my room with a big bottle of Dr Pepper won’t fix.  Thankfully I type quickly (last guesstimate was just under 1000 words in an hour) so I should manage it.
Then I’ve got the Dr Horrible thing I volunteered to do.  That’s easy enough.  Plot summary, track list, cast/crew, Commentary! track list, quotes and possibly a trivia bit.
The creative writing class is going well.  People seem to like my stuff, which is always a nice surprise.  The tutor was slightly evil last night though.  We had to write a six sentence paragraph without repeating any words.  And that included contractions (so if we used isn’t, we couldn’t go on to say is not.  Try it yourself, it’s a lot harder than it seems [and if anyone does so, stick it in an entry.  I’ll post mine here tomorrow when I retrieve it from home].).  For my homework next week, I have to re-write a short story from the perspective of one of the other characters mentioned in it, which should be good.  I also have to take in a piece that I’m submitting to show what I’ve done on the course, which is going to be put together with everyone else’s so we can all see what each other has done.  For that, I’m going to tweak (and possibly expand) something I wrote as homework for class.  (If anyone wants to read and give me feedback, and can do so by Sunday, let me know.)
Next week we have to get our learning plans done.  It has to be done, the council (who run the classes) says they have to be done but the problem is that it can’t be standardised across everyone like they normally would be.  Everyone is there for different reasons.  I started going a) to give me something to do instead of pissing about online all the time and b) to help me get back writing (which it has done).  I’m not going to mention the first one in my learning plan, for obvious reasons, but the second one along with the fact that it helped me with writing descriptions.
Never mind.  The week after that is the last one for now (booo!) but our tutor is going to bring in cake (yay!).
And despite TTZ5 not being out yet, I already have an inkling of an idea for TTZ6.  It’s not fully fleshed out yet but Water On Mars did amplify it for me a bit.  (I can feel toile_de_jouy giving me death glares over t’interwebthingymadoofer).
Incidentally, I can’t wait for the next TTZ to come out.  The article I wrote for it is by far the most fun I have ever had writing anything ever.
Just emailed off a bunch of reminders to places where I have submitted stories and haven’t heard back from.  One sent me an automated reply saying something about waiting till after Halloween.  I will try emailing them again and, if I still get an automated reply, I might just tell them to withdraw my story from consideration.  Another place responded by saying that they had to delay their next issue, would like more time to consider my story if I don’t mind but that they would understand if I chose to withdraw it.  Still not sure if I should email them back and say they can have longer if they want or if they’ll gather that cos I haven’t withdrawn it.
And I started what was going to be this entry, a TV review one.  But I’ll leave that for another time (there’s at least one more programme I want to watch for it).
So, that would be where I’m at with my writing.
Will
*EDIT*
Here, as promised, is my six sentence paragraph:
The silence was overwhelming.  Only punctuated by pencils scratching on paper, desks acting as amplifiers.  Groans could occasionally be heard while people realised they had made mistakes.  It’s not an easy task that teacher had assigned.  But attempt to complete said writing is, if unessential, then desirable.  Even if just so something simpler can be advanced onto.

John Mason always whistled on his way to work.  As the driver of the only remaining working transporter bridge in Britain, he enjoyed his work.  He didnt even let the habitual bad weather get him down.
It was a good job that he had a head for heights, the drivers cab being on top of the gondola that transported humans and vehicles across the Tees.  Then there were the special occasions, people visiting from abroad who wanted a trip across the bridge.  He particularly delighted in inviting them up to the cab for the trip back, giving them a view of Middlesbrough that they would not have ordinarily have received.  Giving them a special memory.
As he approached the gates, he searched his pockets for his keys.  It didnt matter how many days he had worked here, that first sight across the Tees under the bridge, gondola in the foreground, always amazed him.  There were downsides, for example he didnt get to go see Boro play as much as he might have wanted to.  But even then, there was the radio.  And if they were at home that week, he didnt even need that, the sound issuing from the stadium keeping updated better than any commentary did.
Two trips across the river every fifteen minutes, traffic depending, most of the day.  It wasnt a bad life.  At least he wasnt stuck in a stuffy office.  Or even worse, like his daughter, in a call centre dealing with annoying customers.
He opened the office and started up the machinery that would do all the work.  He then went to the gondola to start the pre-flight checks.  As he approached, he noticed a young woman laid out just about dead centre.  She looked as if she was just sleeping, but it was hard to work out how she had got there in the first place.  Opening the passenger gate for the gondola, he had resolved to nudge her with his boot to try and wake her up.  Then he noticed two things.  The first was that her sleeping position seemed to be rather uncomfortable.  The second was that she didnt seem to be breathing.  He gingerly approached her and pressed two fingers to her neck, as he had seen done on TV to check for a pulse.
John just about made it back to the office before the vomiting started.

900,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/geeky-fun-3930150/,2009-11-09,Geeky fun,"
As you lot probably know, I’m a huge geek.  As such, the skin I use for Winamp is one featuring the ten Doctors.  Like so:

The Doctor changes each time I start it up.  (Though I’m going to have to download a new version soon, very probably.)
So, last night I was listening to something to make sure it sounded OK and decided to muck about.  I found a bit with a question mark icon.  I clicked on it, thinking I would get the help thing up as usually happens in programs when I click on a question mark.
Imagine my surprise when I got this:

In case you can’t read it, it says ‘Alert!  Alert!  We are detected  Exterminate!!’
Not earth shattering, but I geeked out.  So there :¬p





"
901,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/more-fun-with-the-jobcentre-3930149/,2009-11-08,More fun with the jobcentre,"
At the moment, as I may have mentioned before, I’m on weekly signings, though there is some doubt as to whether or not I actually should be.
So, I dragged myself out of bed eary this morning, went to the jobcentre, handed over my signing book and took a seat, reading The Rule Of Four (whenever I go into that building I always take a book with me).  Soon enough, my name is called and I head over the the staff member who called for me.  The following took place:
JCS: You’ve got an appointment today at twenty past four*
Me: No I haven’t
JCS: You have.  I can’t get any information on the system for you because of it.
Me: I haven’t.  I had an appointment last week and I’ve got one at the beginning of next month, but not today.
JCS: I’ll show you.
We head over to her desk where she puts in my information, confirms my address and turns the screen to me.  There, on the screen, is a message saying that I’ve got an appointment at 4:20 on 7/12/09.
JCS: There you go.  You have an appointment at 4:20 on the 9th of the 12th.
I wait for the penny to drop.  Then, just before I point out that the 12th month of the year is December.
JCS: Hang on.  The 12th is next month, isn’t it?
Me: Yup.
JCS: It probably got flagged because your appointment is on the 7th and today is the 7th.
Pause.
JCS: Hang on, today’s the 9th isn’t it?
Me: Yup.
At least this one was a bit more amusing than the previous ones.
Will
*If you have an appointment on the same day as your normal signing and the two are at different times, you only need to come in for the appointment and you sign then.  Which is a boon when you sign early in the morning, the appointment is late in the afternoon and you have a habit of staying up too late.





"
902,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/book-answers-3930148/,2009-11-04,Book answers,"
From the centre of downtown BaghdadMiddlesbrough, let’s get this done.
First up is The_Blind_Archer:
Have you read ‘On the Road’ by Jack Keroac? Thoughts?
I haven’t read On The Road.  I want to, but for some reason I’ve never got round to getting it.
Or what five books have influenced your outlook on life?
Despite the fact that I had worked for both McDonalds and Burger King by this time, it was reading Fast Food Nation by Eric Schlosser that really put me off fast food.
The Hobbit was the first fantasy book I ever read and is responsible for me being a huge fan of the genre.
The Hitchhikers Guide to the galaxy is, or at least should be, a rites of passage for any young person.
The Millennium Trilogy by Steig Larsson remain the only books I have ever immediately re-read purely because they were that good.  They also showed me that it is possible to have an ongoing series without losing sight of what drives your characters.
A Short History of Nearly Everything by Bill Bryson is the only science book I’ve ever understood.  And it proves that you can educate people in an amusing way.
toile_de_jouy was next:
What book, if any, have you determined to finish even if you didn’t really like it? Or do you put down a book if it doesnt grab you straight away?
Actually, I’m going to throw in Steven the Rills question here, cos it’s kinda similar:
What was the last book that you started to read but chose not to finish – and why?
I tend to put down books straight away if it doesn’t grab me for some reason.  I do generally go back to that book and give it another couple of chances if I do that.  It may be because of the type of mood I’m in at the time.  If after three or four attempts I still can’t get into it, I’ll generally give up completely.
The last book I did this with was We Need to Talk About Kevin by Lionel Shriver.  I just couldn’t get into it.  It’s not her, cos I love The Post-Birthday World.  The subject is one that really, really interests me.  It’s not even the way it was written, cos The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society is written in the same style (letters) and I consider that my find of the year.  I just couldn’t get into it.  I’ll try again though.
What books have you read purely on other people’s recommendations and found weren’t really that good?
Apples by Richard Millward.  A friend lent it to me as it’s set in Middlesbrough.  The characterisation is for shit, there’s no real plot or point to 99% of what happens.  It has some weird chapters (like the one written by a character that’s dyslexic) that made me think that the writer went for style over substance.  (His second book is promoted chiefly on the basis that it is all one paragraph so that seems to be his style.)
And then we have dear_gertrudeperkins:
Which fictional character do you most indentify with?
At the moment?  Arthur Dent, mostly.
You top 5 fictional character shags.
Lisbeth Salander from The Millennium Trilogy sounds like she’d be fun.  And we could spend time comparing and contrasting tattoos.
Anne from The Famous Five always struck me as one of those posh girls who could be really filthy if given a chance.
Tonks from Harry Potter as long as she didn’t keep changing.
Trinity from The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy.  Well, if she’s willing to go out with Zaphod, surely I stand a chance.
Katie from The Rule Of Four co she seems cool.
And finally, we have Suzy_Brat:
Noticing your a HHGTTG fan, have you read or are you planning to read the new sixth book by Eoin Colfer. If you’ve read it what are your thoughts.. I’m slowly reading my way through it
I have not read it.  I’m not planning to read it either.  I really cannot see it the point of it existing to begin with and there is no way it can be anywhere near as good as the other five.
And there you go.  TTFN.
Will





"
903,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/grrrrrrr-72-3930147/,2009-11-01,GRRRRRRR!,"
So, today I had my pre-op check with the dentist.  This is important as it meant that I met the person who would actually be doing the procedure.  It was supposed to be last Thursday, but with the actual op being cancelled it was changed to today.
At least that’s what I was told.
Looked up the place on google maps and got up early today to start walking.  It took about an hour but I finally made it there.  Went in and was told where to go to be seen.
The person was slightly surprised that I was there.  Eventually, they decided to see me, despite the fact that the appointment that was cancelled was the one for today.
GRRRRR!
They had another look in my mouth, told me what to expect and what was needed of me.  I had already arranged for a friend to meet me afterwards but it turns out they have to arrive with me.  They also have to look after me for 24 hours.  Which, again, I was not expecting.
I have been told not to eat the day of the operation and that I’m not to smoke for 4 days afterwards.  Which means I’ll be a bit of a nightmare.  But it should keep my mum happy.
I’ve also been told that I have to take out my tongue and eyebrow piercing as part of the process could cause these to spark.  I did ask about using a plastic retainer for my tongue and been told that that should be fine but may not be necessary.  Due to the length of time I’ve had the tongue piercing (10 years next summer) it would take weeks for the hole to close.
So, yeah, that was my morning.  This afternoon I have to go to the jobcentre for an interview.  Yay!  Fun day all round for me!
Meanwhile, have a pic.  More fantastic spelling from the THE University of the Year 2009:

906,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/help-edit-24-3930144/,2009-10-26,Help *EDIT*,"
So, on Thursday I have a pre-op appointment with the dentist.  The following Thursday, I have the actual op.  It’ll take about 3 hours, including recovery time and I’ll lose at least 7 teeth.
It’ll take up to three months for me to even think about dentures.  Not sure what’ll happen to my ability to eat in that time.
Why did I start this again?
Oh, that’s right.  Apparently, this is a good thing.  Well, according to those who bullied me into getting it done to begin with.
Tell you something, though.  If I have to take out my tongue piercing, it’s a deal breaker.
Will
*EDIT*  The dentist phoned again today.  They lost the theatre for the operation so it’s had to be cancelled.  Not sure when it will go ahead.  This should bother me but it really doesn’t.

"
908,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/missed-popularity-3930142/,2009-10-20,Missed popularity,"
I was lying awake last night at about 5:30am (don’t ask why, I don’t know) and this thought came to my head.
I don’t understand people obsessed with popularity.
I’m not talking about people who want to be liked.  I can’t, I’m one of them.  And I’m pretty sure that most people do want to be liked in some small way.
I’m talking about people who are obsessed with being popular just to say they are popular.
You know the types.  They have to have the most followers on Twitter, the most friends on Facebook, the most notes left on OD entries.
They enter every election and competition they can just to prove how popular they really are.
Yeah.  Them.
And I just don’t get it.  I really don’t.  Maybe it is because I can be a bit of a loner, but my position is that if you like me, you like me.  If you hate me, that’s fine too.  If you’re indifferent towards me then meh.
The whole popularity thing seems to me to be a bit shallow.  Yeah, you may have more phone numbers stored on your mobile than me, but how many of those people would honestly drop everything and come to meet you cos you’re feeling a bit down?
You may have hundereds of Facebook friends, but how many do you actually know?  And how many of them wouldn’t be able to bail you out cos they’re in the next cell hoping to be released in time for watching the match down the pub.
I can honestly say that my friends like and respect me for me.  Not for the person I became to get them to like me so that I could be just that wee bit more popular.

909,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/censorship-stupidity-3930141/,2009-10-19,Censorship stupidity,"
What happened here over the weekend? 
Seriously, what happened? It looks like a lot of normally rational, intelligent people took a whole heap of stupid pills.
Seriously. They guzzled those fuckers down like an alcoholic at a free bar ten minutes before closing time. Lets see if I’ve got this right:
For a few years now, if you tried to leave a note with certain offensive words, the system rejected it and you had to re-do the note. This system caused a couple of slight issues.
One of these was that, depending on the browser you were using, when you clicked the back button, you lost the entire note. (When I was on Firefox, I had this problem. Not so much now, cos I tend to use frak in notes instead of fuck. But then I do so in real life as well, to the extent that I’ve got one of my friends, who hasn’t even seen BSG, using frak [yes, I’m immensely proud of that].) If it was a particularly long note, this was extremely annoying.
Secondly, the system wasn’t perfect. People were having problems leaving notes with words like snigger in them, or phrases like ‘Don’t panic until told otherwise’ (shamelessly stolen from Krud, with thanks and apologies) due to the ‘offensive’ words in the note. The DM had received complaints about this.
So, at the weekend, he announced that the system had been refined so that, instead of simply rejecting the note, the offensive words were asterisked out. No words were added to the list. And yet, it’s NOW, when the basic system has been in place for a few years yet it’s just become more visible what’s happening, that people are crying censorship.
Are you shitting me? Seriously, this is a giant wind up and I’ll log on tomorrow to find that they were all doing it to fuck with the DM.
That’s the explanation. It has to be.
There is no difference now, except the fact that the note will ACTUALLY GO THROUGH. You won’t get an error screen. You won’t have to press the back button and hope the note is still there. How in the name of all that anyone may find even remotely holy is it now censorship?
I actually read in one of the entries complaining about this the person saying that before it was them that made the decision to go back and change the note. Really? I mean, really? You sure it wasn’t because the options were to change the note or not bother posting it to begin with?
There are also complaints that this was introduced without any warning.  The first anyone knew about this was either a) when they read the DMs entry or b) when they left someone a note that was so affected.  It is true that there is usually some kind of warning.  But, in the entry before that one, the DM tells us about a change he has made to the bookmarks and friends pages.  Again, without warning.  Why no outrage about that change as well?
The bit that makes me laugh the most, however, is this.  There are a lot of people who would like to make this optional, same as the type of note people can leave you.  I agree with that, actually.  If the capabilities are there then it should happen.  However, not being a computer programmer, I have no earthly idea how easy it would be.  Might be a quick job, might take a while.
But there are some of these people who are claiming that such functionality should be OD+/OD Lifetime members only.  Thats fucked up.  Really?  Because you can afford to be on OD+ your freedom of speech, and the freedom of people leaving you notes, is protected but because I cant afford to be on OD+ (much as I would like to be again, I really cant justify the expense at this moment in time) Im fucked?  Is that really freedom of speech, or was Team America right?
Besides, and purely in my honest opinion, the DMs time in this may be better spent solving actual problems, like the fact that when I was on OD+ I was told that I had the ability to upload photos and save them to the OD servers to make things easier to post in my diary.  Except there was no use in me using this, as you can only post the pics in an entry using the WYSIWYG editor.  And dont get me started on the fucking autosave thing.
Incidentally, the DM posted, while I was writing this entry, to say that he has now changed it so that the filter (which, as I said before WAS THERE FOR A FEW YEARS ALREADY) is optional.  I, for example, have switched it off, cos I dont give a flying frak if you want to swear in notes you leave me.
Still posting this though.  As the whole thing was stupid on a level that even George W Bush and Carrot Top would read it and say This whole argument is fucking stupid.

As most of you are probably aware, I am a huge fan of Charlie Brooker.  I find that his writing and shows are amusing, relevant and more often than not to the point.
The reason I bring this up?  Well, in one episode of his show Screenwipe, Brooker looks at rolling news channels and the amount of filler stuff they air.  Stuff which isn’t actually news but, seeing as they have to show something, it’ll do.  He does this by looking at the coverage of the arrest of Kate and Gerry McGann.  Here it is:
I was reminded by this when I went for a pint last night and on the TV was footage about balloon boy.  I just caught the end of the whole thing when the balloon landed and it was discovered that there was no-one in it.  This to me turned the whole thing into a non story.  A helium filled balloon was released.  Here is another story about a helium filled balloon that was released.  And, indeed, another balloon boy.
Yet the coverage continued about this non story.  With every little detail and morsel of information treated as if it were a proclamation from God or something.  Boy apparently not in balloon.  Boy confirmed not in balloon.  Boy possibly in attic at parents house.  Boy confirmed as being in parents house.
All fine and good.  They have to have something that could resemble news 
otherwise they wouldn’t be a 24 hour news channel.  It would be like a channel calling itself Music Television and featuring very little music.  (Whaddaya mean, that does actually exist?)
Except, if you kept an eye on the ticker at the bottom of the screen, there was other news that could be reported on.  Actual news not big shiny thing floats around for about 3 hours.
The breaking news at the bottom of the screen?  The fact that a Tory MP has decided not to run for re-election after it was discovered that he claimed for just over £100,000 in expenses to be paid to a company he owns.
There you go.  That’s news.  At best it is a major breach of public trust and at worse is nothing short of fraud.  But no, Sky News had to concentrate on the shiny object on the ground, doing nothing, containing no-one.
And it’s this that gets me.  There are complaints that people don’t pay attention to the news.  That everything has to be dumbed down for the general populace to understand it.
Ever think that things like this may actually be the reason for that?  I don’t mind them having to explain things in simple terms, if the story calls for it.  But, maybe it’s just me, when I’m watching a channel that’s supposed to be showing news, a channel with the word news IN IT’S NAME, I expect to see, y’know, news stories.  The shiny balloon was news when it was thought there was a young boy in it.  There wasn’t.  It’s not news now.  Sorry.  If I want to watch entertainment, I’ll watch sky One.  Or Channel 4.
If we show people stuff that is actually news, if the time is then taken to explain the bits that are complicated, it won’t be long until there is less stuff that needs explaining.  If we are told about the various political parties and what they stand for, more informed choices will be made at the ballot box and people will be less obsessed with what the candidates partners dog walkers chaplin said one time back in nineteen-oatcake.
But, as usual (and in a quite literal sense) last night we were distracted by the shiny, shiny object.

Seeing as how I haven’t done this in a while, this is the short story that I wrote for my creative writing class.  As per usual with me, it doesn’t have a title.
Hope you enjoy.
Will

The air seethed, with heat and dust and quietness.  Compared to the cacophony that was there before it was eerie.  They looked across the field of battle at one another.  The victors rejoicing.  The losers downhearted.
Then, just as quickly as the silence fell, the noise started up again.  Comrades celebrating with each other, enemies swapping stories.  Telling tales of amazing shots, golden opportunities that had been missed and bodies being flung selflessly across the arena.  Of injuries picked up and discussions about the fairness (or otherwise) of the competitors.
So many stories would be swapped and told about that day, that battle, that field.  Some would become exaggerated over the years, others played down.  Modesty would forbid some from telling about their true part whilst others would expand theirs, making it seem as if they had played a bigger role than they actually did.
Talk was also made about future conflicts.  Planning ahead.  Swapping combatants in the future, possibly to make things fairer.  Then the cry came that they were expecting.  With heavy hearts they started to trudge up towards the building that they had briefly escaped from.  Picking up bags, jumpers and coats.  Passing the ball back to the rightful owner.
The battle may have been over for that day.  But there would, of course, be other games.

So, hopefully this will be a less moany entry than some of my recent ones.
As you can gather, it’s about my writing.
I’m kinda getting back into the swing of things.  It helps that I’m now in a creative writing class, so that’s helping to inspire me to write.
I’ve only written one thing for class so far.  It went down well when I was reading it out though I, of course, was nervous beforehand.
Suppose I should drag that out and see if it needs any editing.  It’s only about 250 words so…
I’m thinking of entering the BBc My Story thing as well as this Dollhouse essay competition.  I have no idea yet what I’m going to write for the first one.  The second one I tried to start yesterday but am now double guessing myself as to if it’s actually a good idea.
Apart from that, I’m looking for decent novel writing software (something that’ll help me keep track of characters mainly) and I’m considering taking part in this years NaNo.  It would be the first time I’ve ever done so, so advice would be cool if anyone has any.  Also if you know of a decent novel writing programme as I would definitely need it for my NaNo novel.
Still waiting to hear back about some of the stuff I’ve sent out.  And I’ve still to write my article for the next issue of TTZ.  So, all in all, quite busy at the moment.

Remember this?
Dear Sir/Madam, 
I emailed on the 27th of last month about a problem I had when I moved back to the Jobcentre from Pertemps. It was my understanding that all complaints would be responded to within 10 days. Well, even if it is 10 working days, your time is up and I still have not heard anything back. 
It is entirely possible that you have already written to me about this, but the letter has been returned. If this is the case, I do most sincerely apologise. My housemate had taken an extreme view to returning any post that arrived at the house for someone who no longer lives there by simply returning anything not for him. I have spoken to him about this and it will not happen again. So feel free to resend. 
Either way, I would appreciate an email letting me know what is happening at the moment. I will give you another week and, if there is still no reply, I will take my complaint further. 
Yours faithfully,
William Forbes

This is something I did last year and thought it would be fun to do again. All I need to say here is that if you are planning to do this, you need to copy everything between the two broken lines.
———————————————————————————————————————————————-
OD tracker survey.
Thank you for deciding to do this. This is an experiment to track a survey around OD.
The reason I am doing this is simple. I thought it might be interesting to see for myself how far a survey could go round this site from this humble entry. It’ll also be interesting in a 6 degrees of separation way.
The instructions:
If you decide to do this survey, I would like it if you went to the entry where the survey originated (at the following address: http://www.opendiary.com/entryview.asp?authorcode=A155313&entry=20698&mode=) and leave me a note saying who you got the survey from.
You can of course change the answers you give to the survey, but I would appreciate it if you left the instructions and the questions as they are. You can put the link back to the originating entry as a hyperlink, but please keep the address in there as well to make things easier for anyone who wants to yoink it from you.
OK, ready? Here we go…
1) What is your name?
2) Where did you get your diary name from?
3) Where did you get your diary title from?
4) Have you ever created any interests on OD? If so, which ones?
5) Do you have any tattoos or piercings? If so what and where? If not, you planning any?
6) Who are your favourite bands?
7) Name some of your favoutire films:
8) Name some of your favourite TV programmes:
9) What is your biggest guilty pleasure?
10) How long have you had a diary at OD?
11) Do you have a paper diary/journal?
12) Name some of your favourite books:
13) How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?
14) Where are you politically?
15) Do you like any sports? If so, which teams do you support?
16) What is your dream job?
17) How, if in any way, is the different from your dream job aged 10?
18) Are you mad?
19) Where are you right at this minute?
20) Can you fight the moonlight?
Thank you for your participation.
Will.

It’ll be fun to see how things have changed.
Also, anyone got any ideas how I can compile the results?  Last year I made a huge table in word but not sure I wanna do that again as a) it takes frakking ages, b) it’s fiddly and annoying and c) I’m not on OD+ at the moment so am not sure I’d have the wordcount anyway.
Any ideas?

920,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/letter-of-complaint-2-3930130/,2009-09-27,Letter of complaint,"
Remember the situation in this entry?
Well, I had the interview this week and brought up what happened.  The guy who interviewed me was as pissed off as I was about the whole thing and suggested I file a complaint.
He did give me a form but I decided not to go that route.  The reason?  Middlesbrough jobcentre has the same affliction as Middlesbrough Council.  They have issues with loosing stuff.  I decided to email them instead and, after spending about ten minutes looking for the fucking page, finally did.  Here’s what I wrote:
NI Number: XX XX XX XX X
Dear Sir/Madam, 
I recently returned to signing on at the jobcentre after being sent to Pertemps for six months. It was this that was the start of my troubles. 
When I was first signing on I was paid every second Thursday. When I was at Pertemps, I got paid every second Tuesday. All of this was fine. On being sent back to the jobcentre I was dealt with as a new claim and told that my pay date would go back to being the Thursday, which is as I expected. What I didn’t expect was the kerfuffle that this caused.
The week after my appointment to go back to the jobcentre was supposedly the week I got paid. Sure enough, as expected half my money (the last week from Pertemps) went into my account on the Tuesday. On the Thursday, however, the rest of my money hadn’t appeared. When I went to the jobcentre about this, I was informed that it was because the person who had signed me had forgotten to put a note on the system saying that I had signed on the Monday. They put through a same day payment and I got my money that afternoon. Two weeks later, I was having the strangest sensation of déjà vu as 9:30 saw me back in the jobcentre, back on the phone to yet again complain that I had not been paid. The feeling grew when I was told that the reason was…
Exactly the same as the week before.
I’m sorry. My feeling is that if it happens once it can be excused. If it happens more than that it is either gross negligence or gross stupidity on the part of the staff. I’ll leave it to you to decide which is the case. So, after this happened I decided that for the next two months I was refusing to leave the jobcentre after signing on until I had personally seen them leave the note on the system to say that I had signed on. This being because, obviously, I could not trust them to leave the note unsupervised. As I am currently a weekly signer, I believed that this was going to annoy the staff but I really didn’t care. The first week I did this, there were no problems. I even got a weeks money, which made me think that while this was going on I would be paid weekly. If only I knew the truth…
The following Monday I again asked to see them log on the system that I had indeed signed on. Only to be told that they didn’t need to make any such note as I wasn’t due to get paid that week. I argued that simply wasn’t true and that week was indeed the week I got paid. It was then, and only then, after over a month, that someone finally decided to inform me that my payment date had been moved back a week.
Now, I’m not bothered about that. You can pay me on a Monday, a Thursday or even every Sunday as long as I spot a heffalump if that is your desire. As long as I get paid, I really don’t mind. What does bother me is the following:
1) Why was I not told, or even warned, when I had the appointment that this was going to happen or even that there was a chance that it might?
2) If I hadn’t done what I had done regarding putting the note on the system, how long would I have been left going into the jobcentre every other Thursday to ask for a late payment? Let’s not forget, there were still two pay weeks where this note was not left. 
My annoyance is on several levels. The first is that fact that it happened at all. As I said above, I’m not bothered about it getting moved, I’m annoyed that I wasn’t warned that it would happen. This is furthered by the fact that I could have been told both when I signed AND when I phoned about my “missing” money but never was. This is vital information, it might be an idea to let me know. At the moment, as with most people on benefits, I live payday to payday. I take the amount I’m going to get, work out what I need to spend on essential items and then budget the rest over the fortnight. This gets harder when I’m not told when I’m actually due to get money. It gets harder still when I discover about halfway through the week that I have to somehow make one weeks JSA last me for two weeks.
It’s hard enough making two weeks money last, one weeks money for double that time is impossible. As a result, I had to get a crisis loan of £20 for food for the week and I also had to borrow money from a friend, which I have to pay back next time I get paid, for general living expenses. So, not only has this whole experience been irritating (and easily avoided) but has also left me out of pocket.
What I would like is an apology and an explanation as to why this happened, whether it should have happened and what steps will being taken to ensure it will not happen again. I would also like, but am not expecting, something towards the money that I am due to my friend.
Yours faithfully,
William Forbes

Seeing as I’m trying to forget about the dentists appointment I have later (the whole process being one I was bullied into starting in the first place), I’ll give you the answers to the two truths, one lie thing I posted at the weekend.
But first, because I’m mildly obsessed with it (and it’s funny):
Ok, here we go:
TWO ARE TRUE. ONE IS A LIE. FIND THE LIE.
1. 
a. I lost my virginity just before my 18th birthday TRUE  It was about 10 days before I turned 18
b. I have never had unprotected sex LIE But every time I have it’s been while in a stable relationship
c. The first person I slept with was also a virgin TRUE
2.
a. I think The Wire is the best programme in the history of TV LIE  I love The Wire.  I think it is the kind of TV we should be seeing more often.  And the kind the BBC should be making.  But, if just for the sheer scope of the subjects tackled, I think the reimagining of BSG is better.
b. I think the Buffy episode The Body is the best hour of TV ever made TRUE  It’s a close call between this and The West Wing episode Bartlet For America.  But The Body just shades it, if only because of the respective ages of the cast.
c. I think the Dr Who episode Blink shows exactly how good British TV can be  TRUE  Charlie Brooker called it the best piece of popular entertainment Britain has produced in years.  That says it all.  Writing, directing, acting, cinematography.  It all just clicked.
3.
a. I’m scared of heights TRUE  Dunno why, I just am
b. I’m scared of apples  LIE  My favourite of all the fruits
c. I’m scared of dentists TRUE  And with good reason, even if certain people decided to ignore that for their own ends
4.
a. Working at the cinema was the best job I’ve ever had TRUE  Mostly for the folks I was working with and some of the daft things we would do
b. Working at the call centre is the worse job I’ve ever had TRUE  And considering the sucktetude factor for some jobs I’ve had, that’s saying something
c. I preferred working at McDonalds to working at Burger King  LIE  Again, this is all about my fellow co-workers.
5. 
a. All of my tattoos feature words or phrases in some way  LIE  The one on my left shoulder is simply a celtic knot with a dragon
b. I have my eyebrow and tongue pierced TRUE
c. I am close to my 25th blood donation  TRUE  I am on my 23rd (I think) donation at the moment.
6.
a. I am a Runrig fan  TRUE  One of my favourite gig going moments was Donnie Munros second last concert with the band at Stirling Castle
b. I am a Take That fan LIE  Though I still stand by my belief that Shine is simply to good a song to actually be by them.
c. I am a NKOTB fan  TRUE  Their first album was one of the first albums I ever bought
7. 
a. Despite not liking either sport I have a Scotland rugby and cricket top  TRUE  They were Easter gifts from my mother
b. I support Aberdeen, Middlesbrough, Scotland and Calgary Flames TRUE
c. My favourite sport besides football is golf  LIE  I hate golf with the fury of 1000 burning suns.
8.
a. I am a huge Star wars fan  LIE  I watched Star Wars: Episode 4: A New Hope: Special Edition and realised that a) the special effects are worse than the effects in Classic Trek and b) the only character who I cared about and showed any emotion was R2-D2.  I didn’t waste my time with any of the others
b. I think Christopher Nolan is the best director to come from Britain since Ridley Scott  TRUE  While Britain has produced other noteworthy directors over the years (David Yeates, Edgar Wright, Sam Mendes) when people talk about the truly great British directors Chris Nolan will be right up there.  With the two Batman films he proved that big blockbuster films can also have ideas and make people think.
c. I think the best piece of social commentary committed to film in the past 10 years is the title sequence from Shaun Of The Dead  TRUE  While not the best opening title sequence I’ve ever seen in films (that award goes to Watchmen), the opening titles of Shaun Of The Dead, which hinted towards the fact that we’re all kinda zombies anyway, was just brilliant in introducing the film and staying true to the social commentary running through all Romero zombie flicks.
9.
a. I have a sonic screwdriver  TRUE  Though I now want the one that Dr Song has in Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead
b. I have a sonic pen  TRUE  It was a birthday present
c. I have a vortex manipulator  LIE  Though I want one, if anyone was thinking of getting me a pressie
10. 
a. I have three siblings  LIE Older sister, younger brother
b. I have been engaged twice  TRUE  Once to The Ex and again more recently
c. I am the only member of my immediate family (mum, dad, siblings, me) to live outside Aberdeen permanently.  TRUE  Admittedly, my dad is away from Aberdeen more often than he is at home, cos of work, but I am the only one to have moved away properly.
And there you go.

922,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/theme-of-the-week-394-3930128/,2009-09-21,Theme of the week,"
I dunno, you wait ages for one theme of the week entry from me then two come along at once :¬p
So, this weeks theme is:
If you could go back in time and change one decision that you made in your life, what would it be? 
And the answer is…
Nothing.
Absolutely nothing.
Not one single moment or decision from my life would be changed if I had a TARDIS.
(Course, I’d be too busy watching classic Aberdeen matches and telling random people I HAS A TARDIS! in the first place.)
The reason?  There are a few.  For a start, I happen to be one of those people who believes that everything happens for a reason.  It’s the puzzle about the British sniper and the German soldier in WWI writ large.  I don’t see the point in dwelling on these things.  Yeah, I could say that i’d finish my degree but then I’d probably still be an unemployed wannabe writer just with a degree in psychology and criminology behind me.
The other reason is that when you make the choice as to what you’d change, you really have to remember what it is you would be changing.  Humans are not just a collection of flesh, bone, meat, sinews and liquids.  We are also the collection of our experiences.  If someone were to clone you, would the clone actually BE you?  Up to the point when it was created.  After that, unless the two of you follow absolute parallel lives, right down to the second, you will be different people, just with the same genetic makeup.
And, really, why would you want to?  In Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Joel decides to get his ex removed from his memory, partly in revenge for her doing the same to him.  He is stunned, however, when he realises that by doing so he’s not just getting rid of the bad stuff, but the good times as well.
And so the situation is here.  I could say that I would never have split up with The Ex or got back together with her the first time, or even getting together with her in the first place.  But those choices lined up and contributed to me moving to Middlesbrough in the first place.  I’ve had some good times here and made some amazing friends.  Admittedly, I’ve had some bad times and some bizarre times.  But I wouldn’t change the time I’ve had here for the world so why on Earth would I go back and change something that led to me being here to begin with?
But, that’s just me.
Will

923,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/middlesbrough-jobcentre-are-completely-useless-3930127/,2009-09-20,Middlesbrough jobcentre are completely useless,"
I find it interesting that after my last rant about the jobcentre on Twitter, I got the following message:
k_faulkner:@williamtheblood Hi, I’m a reporter, doing a story on jobcentres that would rather give out benefits than find people jobs-hav u found this?
Now I didn’t reply.  Partly because I think that this is lazy journalism, simply searching Twitter and replying to people in the off chance.  Not to mention the last part of it. (Hav?  Really?  It would kill you to add one fucking letter?)
The main reason, however, is that Middlesbrough jobcentre seems determined not to do either.
Now, I’m pretty sure that some of you can remember the entry I wrote a couple of weeks ago.  Well, after that situation, I decided to insist on being shown every time I signed on that the note had been put on the system.  at the moment I sign weekly and I’m planning to do this for the next two months.
So, I started last week and discovered, to my surprise, that I got a weeks money on Thursday.  I thought that it was because I had insisted on seeing them log the note and the same would happen this week.
Well, I signed on today.  And, again, I asked them to prove that it was logged on the system that I had.  Only to be told that, as I wasn’t due to be paid this week, that would not be happening.
Which was a bit of a surprise, as I certainly was supposed to be getting paid this week.  When I pointed this out, they told me that I was not due to be paid this week.
They changed my fucking payment date without letting me know.
It’s not as if this is important.  It’s not as if I’m talking about the money I need to survive on.  It’s not even as if I budget very precisely, so that I have enough food, money, etc to last me through till the next time I get paid, is it?
Oh.  Wait a minute…
Which begs the question: if I hadn’t insisted on seeing them log the information today, how long would I have had to keep going into the jobcentre to get same day payments?  Cos they apparently weren’t logging the note the weeks I was supposed to get paid otherwise I would have got paid those weeks.
As usual, there is no explanation as to why this has happened.  They seemed to be blaming it on Pertemps, or me being sent back from there.  But they KNEW that was the situation.  They KNEW that I was being treated as a new claim due to THEIR POLICIES.  How hard would it have been, really, to ask me in the interview I had about going back to them when I was next due to get paid and what the situation is?
Too hard, apparently.  And, as per bloody usual, they are completely unwilling to admit that they are even remotely to blame.
I have another interview with them next week.  I’m going to bring the matter up then stating that I want a full apology and an explanation as to what went wrong.  If I don’t get that, I’m going to file an official complaint.
I also now need to go see about a crisis loan, which I’ll have to pay back.  They should give me the loan.  Cos it’s either that or they explain how they expect me to survive for a fortnight on one weeks worth of money.  Especially as I wasn’t expecting to be.

So, as you all know, I moved into a new place a couple of weeks ago.
Bit of background on the house: there’s seven bedrooms, two bathrooms and two kitchens.  At the moment there’s me and one other person in the house.  Haven’t had much to do with the other guy, but he seemed cool enough.
Until today.
Earlier on, I got a phone call from my landlord telling me to get back to the house and meet him straight away.  He sounded mightily pissed off and so I did.
When I got there, he told me to pack my stuff and hand over my keys as he was kicking me out today.
It turns out that my dickhead of a housemate was letting three of his friends stay in the house, in two of the bedrooms, without going through my landlord.
And why does this concern me?
Well, quite apart from being my house, when the landlord found them there and kicked them out he asked them who let them into the house in the first place.
Guess who’s name they gave him?
One of them, in a really nice touch, actually claimed that they knew me from somewhere else.
Thankfully I managed to calm him down and he believed that I didn’t let them in the house.  Two things that worked in my favour:
1) He was surprised when they said my name as I’ve been pretty straight with him.  Example: when I moved in, I didn’t have the full admin fee they were looking for.  Thankfully, he let me pay it in two instalments instead.  The first was due when I signed the contract and moved in.  Unfortunately, that was the first time the jobcentre fucked up my payments.  I explained and he said to call him when I did have the money which I duly did.  The second was due on Thursday.  Same thing.
2) I pointed out that if anyone I knew was looking for somewhere to live I wouldn’t let them just move in, I’d give them his number and advise them to call.  Which is true.  I might let them crash for a night, but that would be in my room and they would not be there if I wasn’t (exception, if I’m just nipping to the shops).
So he decided to give me another chance.  He’s had problems getting hold of the other guy who lives there, so I’ve to text him when the guy is in the house.  Housemate will probably beg me not to grass him up but, even if landlord hadn’t asked me to, housemate would still be in shit.  Cunt and his cunt friends almost got me kicked out to save his sorry arse.  No fucking way am I helping him out.
Will
*EDIT*
So, more drama.  About 10 last night, housemates friends came round to pick up some stuff.  I refused to let them into the house, up until one of them threatened to kick me in if I didn’t.  They claimed they would only be there for about 20 minutes and they would let me know when they were leaving so that I could lock the door behind them.  After a full episode of The West Wing they still hadn’t gone, so I texted my landlord.  He said he’d be round the next day and to phone the police if there were any other problems.
About 1am, my housemate came back and spoke to me about why the landlord was trying to speak to them.  I told him what had happened, including the fact that they tried to blame me.  At first he tried saying that the bedding my landlord had found in one of the other rooms belonged to him, until I pointed out that he had found them actually here.  Housemate then started panicking about getting kicked out.  I had absolutely no sympathy for him.
About 9 this morning my landlord came round.  It turns out the stupid bastard had 7 people sharing three rooms and thought he could also get away with it.  My landlord told me later, while he was apologising for thinking it was me (which I don’t blame him for, given it was three peoples word against mine) that he had told his friends to blame if ifwhen they were caught.
The yale lock on the door was changed as was the door itself.  Interestingly, when I was waiting for the joiner to turn up, some of ex-housemates friends came round.  Every single one of them tried walking straight in before knocking.  I ignored them till they pissed off.
And after this, I’m going for a couple of pints.  Cos I think I deserve them.

So, this weeks theme question is:
If someone was going to pick out the perfect birthday present for you, what would it be?
Now, some might expect my response to be something like a working TARDIS or unlimited free broadband access.  Something like that.
But it’s not.
My perfect birthday present would be a relationship with my daughter.
For those of you who don’t already know this story, it goes a little something like this:
Just before my 18th birthday, I started going out with The Ex.  And we promptly started sleeping with each other (we were each others first).
It wasn’t all sweetness and light.  We fought, as couples do.  (I’m not sure how many couples fought because she, at 17, wanted a 25 year mortgage and he, at 80 and unemployed, didn’t [I won, BTW] but there we go.)
In fact, we did actually split up for a while before getting back together.
We moved in together and she found out she was pregnant.  And she suffered from horrendous morning sickness.  She literally couldn’t keep anything down and was in and out of hospital with dehydration.
So it wasn’t easy.  It was less easy when she announced on Christmas Day that she wanted to split up with me.
Then the crazy started.  She would phone me at work all the time just so we could talk.  Despite the fact that a) she knew my mobile phone number  and so could call me whenever she wanted, and b) I worked at Burger King so therefore midday, at the height of our busiest time was not the ideal time for a call.
It got so bad that it was pissing off the managers and supervisors.  This is the point at which she sent me into a blind panic by pretending to be my sister, just so she could talk to me.
I really wish I was making that up.
Eventually, she stopped communicating with me altogether.  I did, however, know roughly when she was due to give birth.  So, I headed to the hospital only to be told that she’d banned me from seeing either of them.
And, that was that.  Or it was until a couple of Christmasses ago, fulled on boredom, alcohol and having watched the Pushing Daisies where Emerson tells Ned about his daughter, I looked for The Ex on FB, followed the link to her myspace and found the following pic:

Yup, that’s The Ex.  And my daughter.
I know I could get a lawyer and see about access, etc. while a part of me really wants to do.  But at the same time, I’m not sure what, if anything, she’s been told about me and I don’t particularly want to upset or disrupt her.
But, yeah, that would be my ideal birthday present.

As mentioned in my last entry, I wanted to get a new tattoo on Thursday.  It’s one that I’d been planning for a while but promised to myself that I would get at this point in time.
So I did.  And here it is:


The first bit is on the inside of my right arm and the second is on the inside of my right arm.  And, for some bizarre reason, it hurt more on the right arm than the left.
My only question now is does it count as one tattoo (cos it’s all one quote) or two (cos it’s split in half)?
Then, on my way to have a post ink pint, I met the worlds largest Scot:

(Bonus points: he spoke to me and is actually from Scotland.)
And his dog:

(Bonus point: the dog did actually bark.)

Yeah, this isn’t going to be happy fun time entry.
So, as you lot probably know, about 6 months ago I was sent to an agency instead of signing on.  Admittedly, there wasn’t a hell of a lot they could do for me, but still.
At least I didn’t have to deal with the jobcentre.
Three weeks ago I was sent back to the jobcentre as I’d been at Pertemps for six months.  The initial interview went well and I was told I would have to sign on every Monday morning.  I went to the first signing, which was the week I was supposed to get paid.  The next day, i got my last weeks money from Pertemps, with the rest supposedly going into my account on the Thursday.
Come Thursday morning, no fucking money.
So, off to the jobcentre with me, where I was told that they would have to put through a same day payment for me as they had no record on the system that I had actually signed that week.  It’s this note that triggers the automatic payment.
By the end of the day I finally, finally had my money.  It really should not be this hard, but I can understand, these things happen.
But that would be the end of the problem, right?
Well, until today.
Y’see, that was exactly two weeks ago.  So, hauled myself out of bed early today and went to the bank.  The plan was to get some shopping, top up my phone, give my landlord money I owe him and see about my new tat.
Except, when I checked my account, the was no fucking money.  Again.
So, back to the jobcentre go I.  Back on the phone.  and they know why I didn’t get my money today.  See if you can guess.
Go on.
Here’s an amusing pic while you wait:

Ready?
OK, hands up if you said that there was nothing on the system to indicate that I had signed on Monday?
Cangratumalations!  Milk and cookie (or soft drink and biscuit of your choice) for getting it absolutely spot on!
Yup, the exact same fucking thing that happened a fortnight ago has happened again.
So, this time they’re going to phone me about what they’re going to do.  Course, they were supposed to have called by now, so it’s back to the jobcentre for me.
And from now on I’m not leaving when I sign on until I have seen with my own eyes that the note has been put on the system.  Cos, I’m sorry.  But once is a mistake.  More than that in a row suggests either incompetence or stupidity.
Will
*EDIT* They’ve just phoned and it’s going to be another same day payment.  So, I am getting my money, but that’s not the fucking point, is it?  The point is that I shouldn’t have to do it at fucking all!

10. Answer the phone with “Blue bear, blue bear, this is red bull”, and before agreeing on having a conversation, get them to say the ‘secret phrase’
9. Agree with something they never said: “Yeah, shoot em all. It’s the only language they understand”
8. Answer the phone with “Chello, Mexican embassy? *sneeze* Chow can I chelp joo?”
7. Answer the phone with “Jim’s taxidermy? You snuff ’em, we stuff ’em!”
6. Shout every third word of your sentence. Or do it in some sort of Fibonachi sequence.
5. Mimic the accent of the other guy on the phone. Works particularly well with Northerners.
4. Pretend they have called the local Chinese restaurant, and keep confirming with them that they want “Number Fifree free wiv rice”.
3. Cry down the phone and keep asking them why nobody understands your ‘crippling emotional dysfunction’.
2. Keep asking ‘why?’ at everything they say.
1. Pretend to be interested in what they are saying, then slowly make the conversation more and more surreal. Some suggestions include:
a. pretending you are interested in taking a loan because you are an international criminal who spent too much money trying to kill James Bond, before realising that he doesn’t exist.
b. pretending you are interested in double glazing in order to ‘stop the bees getting me’
c. pretending you need that new car loan in order to drive to your new giraffe farm. Those giraffes won’t be able to teach themselves the harmonicca, eh!

So, as I briefly mentioned in my last entry, I moved house this week.  All I need to do now is find a way to get the rest of my stuff here.
My new room is frakking huge.  But then I knew it would be.  There are seven rooms in the house and, as the first person to look at the place (not long after it was redecorated) I had first refusal.  Yay!

Looking straight ahead from my bed.

My table and the sink in my room.  No more having to go anywhere if I want some water.

The funky shelving unit I found in the cupboard under the stairs.
There is one slight problem though.  This is my new front door key…

Beware the pink leopard print key of DOOM!
I’m going to keep it for a couple of weeks to give my friends a laugh and then get a new one cut.  Probably with the Saltire on it.
So, now that I’m settled, I’m going to try and get some writing done this weekend cos it’s been far, far too long.  Not sure if I’ll start on something new or continue working on something I’ve started.  I’ll see.  Wouldn’t mind getting some work done on one of the books I’m in the middle off, especially as I’ve just found a new quote to fit it.  If only I could get at least one of the political parties to respond to the emails I’ve sent asking for some research…
Apart from that, haven’t been doing much.  Watching films and TV programmes, marathons of The West Wing (up to season 4 now), getting used to not having OD+ (which sucks), factory resetting my laptop, that’s about it.
Here.  Use this to keep the mice away:

I was hoping to do this last week, but some last minute stresses, including moving house, stopped me.  Sorry folks.
Let’s get to it.
Steven the Rill wanted to know:
I know that you’re a Liberal Democrat supporter – but have you ever voted for candidates from any other parties (or, indeed, of no party)?
Indeed I have done both.
May 1997.  There was a general election and I was a newly minted registered voter.  After living basically all my life under a Tory government, and not agreeing with the vast majority of their policies, I had decided that I was going to vote Labour.  And so I did, in my old primary school that I hadn’t been back to in about a decade.
Then things started to go wrong.  About the only thing that Labour did that I agreed with was the referendum on Scottish devolution.  When they brought in student loans and tuition fees (a move that even former Tory PM John Major stated he would never have done) I gave up.  By this time I was paying more attention to politics and realised that the Liberal Democrats were more in line with me and I have supported them ever since.
As for not voting, the European elections I don’t bother with.  This is ever since I found out that the elected MEP’s have absolutely no power whatsoever over laws that are passed.
Equanimous asked:
What do you think devolution will lead to in Scotland? Dissolution of The Union?
Not for a while.  I know the fact that the SNP form the government in the Scottish Parliament may seem to indicate that the people of Scotland want independence but there are two things to remember:
1) Most of that was a vote against Labour.
2) They may form the government but it is a minority government.  Most of Scotland didn’t actually vote for them.  While I respect the push for an independence referendum, even if it does get past parliament, it is likely to lose.  Most likely is that the Scottish Parliament will get more power devolved to it.  (The Lib Dems actually want that to appear on a referendum as a third option.  The SNPs refusal to budge on the issue is the main reason there is not a coalition government.)
Can I see dissolution of the union?  Possibly, although I do think that Britain is too small an island for that to be good for anyone involved.  I think it’s more likely that it’ll keep going like this, with Holyrood slowly getting more and more power.
Rodge challenged me:
I live in the Odsal area of Bradford, postcode BD6. Who is my MP?
Find that out, and get it right, and I will be impressed.
Well, thanks to google and this site I can tell you that your MP is Gerry Sutcliffe, representing Labour.  He won the seat in a by-election in 1994.
And finally, dear_gertrudeperkins wondered:
Well seeing as it’s today’s breaking news, what’s your take on the release of al-Megrahi?
I’m not really sure.  Admittedly, I think that if he is in as poor health as I’ve heard, I think he should have been released.  And I know that there are those who will say ‘life should mean life’ but to them I have to ask, the longest I’ve heard that the guy will live after release is 10 months.  How is that NOT life ?
What I really disagreed with was the reception he got on his return.
And that’s it.  Well, kinda.  If anyone wants to ask anything else, ask away and I’ll answer.

Seeing as how I didn’t have interweb access yesterday (well, I did, but only on my phone which suck interweb wise) I decided to go for a wander and take some pics of the town I currently call home.

Now this is cool.  Discovered it for the first time yesterday.




What it says is: ‘When alchemists were born below Clevelands hills, a giant blue dragonfly across the Tees reminds us every night, 
we built the world, every metropolis came from Ironopolis’.  Which, when you remember the amount of things built in Teesside isn’t that far from the truth.

They don’t believe in normal benches around here.

WTF?

It’s an office of some kind.  But, still.  WTF?

The new Middlesbrough College campus.

Seriously, did no – one, at any time, sit them down and explain that it looks fucking hideous?

Random clock tower beside the college.

Some history.

And some more.

I would just die if a Mr. Spock lived there at some point.

The transporter bridge  Please note, I have not done a single thing to this picture, the sky was like that when i took it.  Looks cool though.

And the carriage.

It’s fucking tall!

Nowadays, this would be made out of stone.  Looks like this one is brass.

And the bridge in action.  I thought I had missed my chance to get this.  I was just about to go when it started moving.

Old style advertising.

James Cook House.  I dream of the day that I have enough money to buy this building and push the plunger to destroy it.

There’s something strange with my camera.  It keep warping things.  I included this pic because it is most noticable here.

This used to be quite a cool fountain.
<a href=""http://s51.photobucket.com/albums/f395/williamthebloody1880/?action=view&current=PICT0029.jpg&#8221; target=”_blank”>
As did this one.  No isea why they did what they did, though it might have something to do with them getting washing up liquid poured into them when there was a big event on.

The duck pond with what looks like a giant chess board.  They were thinking of getting rid of this to build a new hotel, but they changed their minds thankfully.

I just lobve this statue.  Outside of the law court.

The bottle of notes.  And, in the background is MIMA.

The big screen.  Built by the BBC for the 2012 Olympics.  Two years ago.  Thankfully they seem to have wisened up and currently use it for one of performances of things like the ballet.  They also sometimes show Last Night of the Proms here.  Though I wish they would show some Dr Who on this thing.  That would be awesome.

Urban Playground  Parkour display.

And in the background, the new fountain.

The pics really cannot do these guys justice.  It really was an awesome, awesome display.


The supposedly world famous Dickens Inn.  Be honest, how many of you had heard of this pub before now?  (little_chloella, you don’t count :¬p)

I particularly love the fact it simply says ‘Years of Student Tradition’.  Yeah, but not many students can afford to pay around £3 a pint.

The LRC.  Where I spend most of my days.

The Union.  Where I spend most of my non LRC time.

And the terrace.  Where I go to smoke.  Assuming there is enough room seeing as someone isn’t happy with the whole bar and wanted half the terrace to be smoke free despite the fact that the main reason anyone uses the terrace is to smoke.

Don’t ask.  I can’t explain.

Thanks to the BBC, I actually know that this means ‘Either learn or leave’.  Sadly, most people who attend the uni end up doing neither :¬p

It’s an old, old building.

I know i said that I’d answer these before now, but I decided to wait till today and do so to celebrate the start of the new season.
Well, that’s my stoyry and I’m sticking to it :¬p
Let’s get started.
Rodge wanted to know:
How do you feel about former Rangers defender Marvin Andrews winning a one-year contract with Hamilton Academical after rejecting a new deal with Raith Rovers?
Good on him.  I can see why he did it, as it was a choice between SPL or First Division football.  As long as he doesn’t play too well against the Dons.
pheric asked:
Where do you think City will finish in the EPL this year after the laundry list of moves they’ve made?
Honestly?  I kinda like the way that City have done things.  With one or two exceptions Mark Hughes seems to have gone for players that he needed rather than just buying big names for the sake of buying big names (Real madrid, I’m looking at you here).  With that said, I don’t think they’ll crack the top four this season.  While i think Arsenal are weak (they haven’t bought any players but have lost a lot, they’ll need Arshavin to get through the season injury free) I think if anyone will break the top four it’ll likely be Everton or Aston Villa (both have made shrewd buys and both managers, IMHO, are better than Hughes).  City will qualify for Europe this season and they may sneak a trophy.  But they won’t get Champions League football next season.
popeyechicken asked quite a personal question:
what’s the best football match you’ve personally attended? 
Probably the first one I went to.  Aberdeen Vs Rest Of The World XI for Willie Millers testimonial.  Me, my dad and my brother sitting on a bench at the old Beach End.  It was a good game even if Aberdeen did lose.
Kaly enquired:
Give me your personal opinion on Tim Howard.
I haven’t seen much of him playing, but from what i have seen he’s a decent enough keeper.  Sorry I can’t say too much more than that.
I have no idea who left these two:
What are your feelings on AFL???
Australian Rules?  The very little that I have seen looks alright.
What about international rules football?
Never seen it.  Never even heard of it until this question was asked.  (For the curious, it’s a mix of Galic and Aussie Rules.)
And finaly, The Mary ask some questions:
Who do you think will go to the Superbowl?
Unless they’ve changed the rules, one team from each league.  I have no interest in American Football.  I have no interest in a misnamed sport where play is stopped when the ball moves one yard and the entire game takes about twice as long as the regulated time.  Sorry.

Are the Manchester United fans really that obnoxiously awesome?
They are more obnoxious than awesome.  The problem is that a) a lot of them don’t seem to come from manchester at all and b) they have got so used to success that they think they have a divine right to win every game and trophy.  Chelsea fans are getting the same.
AND, how many people have died throughout the history of the game due to stampeding fans?
Far, far too many.  Course, if the answer was only one it’d still be far, far too many.
And that’s yer lot.  This was actually quite good fun, so I might do another one next week with either politics or television.  Keep an eye out.

When I was younger I used to love playing arcade games.  My favourite type of cabinet was the table top ones.

This isn’t the type that I used to play.  The ones that I’m used to, the controls were in the long side, just by my knees.  You could only go left and right, which is why it’s probably just as well that the game was Space Invaders.
So you can imagine my surprise when I went to the pub yesterday and saw this:

Admittedly it uses touch screen technology rather than buttons and joysticks.  It also lets you use google maps and surf the web.  Still cool though.

And there’s no Space Invaders yet.  But hopefully, there will be.

SPOILER WARNING!
You Have Been Watching
The new TV outing for Charlie Brooker and the first not on a digital channel.  This is, at first glance, a celebrity quiz show about TV programmes that have been shown that week.  I say at first glance because, like Who’s Line Is It Anyway, the quiz element is there simply to justify the show while Brooker and his guests take pot shots at the shows in question.  Thankfully, the show has chosen to acknowledge that.  Some of the programmes featured are mad (more on that later) and if there is a way to embarass one of the guests it is taken.  The star of the show is Brooker himself, making his usual caustic remarks (when they featured The Swan [on their weird TV episode] at one point Brooker shouts that the people who made the show are cunts) and, as a result, the whole thing seems like an hour long episode of Screenwipe with guests and an audience.  Not that that is a bad thing.
Deadliest Warriors
I’m really not sure exactly what to make of this show.  I was introduced to it by YHBW and decided to download a couple of episodes to see it for myself.  The idea is that they take 2 legendary warriors, test out their weapons, crunch the numbers, feed them into a computer program and run 1,000 battles between the two to find out who comes out on top.  On the one hand, it is actually quite informative as well as having a high gore and weapon count.  But I can’t keep shaking the thought that it’s all a bit, well, bizarre.  In one episode I saw (spartan vs ninja) they said that it is the ultimate locker room argument.  And that may be the key to how the show was created.  After a planning meeting, some execs went down the pub, got pissed, started one of these arguments and realised that this was their show.  Though what the person who decided that the season finale would be the Taliban versus the IRa in a five a side fight was on is completely beyond me.
Torchwood: Children of Earth
Now, as some of you may remember from this entry I had problems with the first two series of Torchwood, to the point where I gave up completely.  But, after hearing about the one episode a night structure and the fact that RTD was in charge again, I was looking forward to this.  It didn’t disappoint.  THIS is what Torchwood should have been all along.  Cutting the sex n swearing down to a bare minimum and writing something that was dark.  The way that the 456 used the children was downright chilling, some decent backstory for Captain Jack and Ianto and the reason the 456 wanted the children to begin with was imaginative and bizarre.  The fourth episode kind of drags a bit but apart from that it was well worth it.
Young, Dumb and Living off Mum
As soon as I read what this show was about I knew I had to watch it.  Basically, they’ve taken 8 spoilt young people (aged between 17 and 25), most of whom have never had to do anything for themselves, put them in a house together and given then work tasks chosen by their parents.  Vote off the most useless each week and the winner gets a round the world trip.  And they really are a useless bunch.  There’s one who, at 25, has held 23 different jobs.  Another one would live off cup a soup for the rest of her life if she could.  Their first week shopping consisted of 8 youghurts, a bottle of vodka, 2 bottles of wine, 2 bottles of port and a Glade plug in air freshener.  They are all almost universally crap at the work tasks as well.  Part of it is the parents fault for letting them get like this in the first place but still.  The best bit of the show is the narration by Robert Webb as he doesn’t care what he says.  (For example, when a huge fight broke out in the house, he merely commented that if throwing tantrums was a career than the lot of them would be employed full time.)  This is a perfect example of car crash TV (One of them decided to work on a farm she needed three cans of lager and two bottles of wine, for fucks sake).
My Big Decision
BBC3 is aimed at younger audiences (it was the channel that launched Torchwood) but the documentaries can actually be quite good and informative.  Thus it is with My Big Decision.  Each episode (apart from one) centres around two girls looking to make a life changing choice, and not always the one their parents want them to.  So the girls set off with their mother and their gran/auntie/family friend for a five day road trip to find out more about what they want to do before deciding once and for all if they want to do so.  The topics so far have incuded getting pregnant (which one of the girls admitted was because she had an abortion at 14), getting breast implants, losing their virginity and whether or not to give up binge drinking.  On the way they get their eyes opened to a lot of things before making up their minds.  The adults learn a lot as well.  I do think it’s a wee bit suspicious that every single choice has gone the way the parents want them to so far, but I honestly don’t think it’s been rigged like that.  Another nice touch is the one month/two month later updates.  All in all this is a series that may surprise you if you give it a chance.

Is probably not what you’re asking yourself, but I’m going to tell you anyway.  So nyeh!
I was panicking a bit about getting there, as the directions I was given were basically ‘catch this bus’.  I made sure to get through to Billingham early (just after 10 in fact) and set out to find the clinic.  Which was easier than I thought, as it was in the main shopping centre.  (Now, why the fuck could they have not just told me that to begin with?)
So, I wandered around a bit more, chain smoked and then finally went in for the appointment.  I was given a health questionaire to fill in.  It did ask if I had ever had a bad reaction to local anaesthetic, but sadly didn’t have an option for ‘Oh Hell YES!’, so I just ticked yes.
While waiting to be called, I sat and read my book (The Giant Book of Bad Guys, which is actually quite good).  Then I was taken for an x-ray.  In order to have this done, I had to take off my necklace and remove my tongue and eyebrow piercing (the first time ever I had to remove the later).  I then stuck my head in a machine while two cameras revolved round my head.  Which I thought was kinda cool in a sci-fi way.  Though I still don’t understand what the classical music was for.
I was then taken through to meet the dentist.  He asked what happened to me before and I told him.  It was then that he told me what they were planning to do, which was indeed the concious sedation.  As he explained it to me (in fact, from the second I sat down in the chair) I had a death grip on the arm rests.  He explained that the process is the closest I could get to being put under general anaesthetic without them actually doing that at which point I was tempted to shout “So justb give me the fucking general then!”.  He asked me if that sounded OK to which I said no.  He then explained that there are a couple of teeth that can be saved with fillings, but I may not get that done under general anaesthetic.  I’m fairly open minded about that.  The solution is simple.  Drill under GA or remove the fucking things.
He then said that he would write to a hospital about getting me in for the removals, I left, went to the toilet to put my piercings back in place.
Then went to the pub for a couple of pints.

So, here’s the story.
I have an extreme fear of dentists.  This was born when I went to the dentists years ago and was told that I needed a filling.  In order to do this, the dentist had to drill the tooth.
So she gave me a local anasthetic.  When the drilling started I could feel everything that was being done.  Cue injection number 2.  Could still feel it.  That lead to injection number three.  Mouth completely numb but could still feel every bit of the drilling.  This in turn lead to injection number 4.  When I could still feel everything that was happening I scared the dentist.  Sadly I wasn’t allowed any more local anasthetic and the entire proceedings went ahead with me in absolute fucking agony.
I’m not bothered by the way I look.  But, just to get someone to shut up and stop nagging me, I allowed myself to be dragged to the dentist in November.  Where I was told that I needed to have some teeth removed.  After explaining to the dentist what happened last time, they recommended me to a clinic which specialises in high anxiety cases.  I’m not sure that high anxiety accurately depicts the extreme fucking bag of nerves that I am about the dentist but there you go.
So the appointment is tomorrow.  I went to the practice website to get their address and stupidly decided to look up exactly what treatment they use for someone like me.  Turns out it is something called conscious sedation
For those of you who don’t want to follow the link, they basically pump me full of drugs (either oral drugs or IV) in order to depress the central nervous system.  This allows them to use local anasthetic without me stressing about it.  Side effects can include vomiting, headaches and amnesia.  I will be advised not to drive, make critical decisions, or engage in tasks which require a high level of concentration or fine motor skills for 24 – 48 hours afterwards.
As I said on FB and Twitter: If they think they’re doing this to me they can fuck right off, right now.
The problem is that if I was in fucking agony after 4 local anasthetic injections just for a bit of drilling, then what the fuck kind of agony am I going to be in after getting fucking teeth PULLED?  There’s nothing about this doing anything about pain.  Just that I might not be able to remember anything (no fucking chance).
They know that I’m there to have teeth removed.  They even know which fucking teeth need to come out cos my dentist has told them.  Why the fuck to I need to be conscious anyway?
They’re just going to be told straight: they either knock me the fuck out completely or it’s not fucking happening.  Their choice, not mine.
(The only other alternative would be to give me a bottle of decent Scotch and let me guzzle it before the op.  That way, I may still be able to feel it but I’ll be too pissed to give a good goddamn.  But somehow I don’t think they’ll be allower to do that.)
I don’t give a shit what they say about how good this procedure is.  I’ll never know cos it ain’t fucking happening to me.

I’ve heard that one of the strikes against Obama and Biden is that they seem too interlectual. I’ve heard that one of the things that Bush Jr. had going for him and that Palin has in her favour if she runs for President is that they seem like people you can have a drink with.
My question is simply this: what the frak is it with the apparent national obsession with your leader being like that? I’m not being facetious, I genuinely want to know. It’s been bugging me for a while.
For example: Brian seems like a nice guy. I probably would be able to have a couple of drinks with him and shoot the shit (or argue about the state of Scottish football). But if I was hospitalised tomorrow and told I needed my appendix out, I wouldn’t want him. I’d want a damn surgeon.
Over here, one of the biggest cries is to get Vince Cable into the cabinet. Hang the fact that he’s not a member of the Labour party, he seems to know what he’s talking about (dude predicted the current global economic situation and the MP expenses scandal) and so he should be in a position to do something about it.
So, why is it apparently different in the States? Don’t you want the smartest person in the room leading you? Don’t you want someone who at least appears to know what they are talking about? I’m not asking to wind people up.

An earthquake measuring 5.7 on the Richter scale hit Newcastle last Wednesday morning. The epicentre was Byker. Casualties were seen wandering aimlessly saying “bang out of order”, “mental” and “that did my head in”.  The earthquake decimated the area causing in excess of £17.55 worth of damage. Several priceless collections of mementos from Ibiza and Corfu were damaged beyond repair. Three preserved areas of historic burned out cars were destroyed. Many locals were woken before their Giro’s arrived.
One resident, Tracey Sharon Smith, a 15 year old mother of four said “It was such a shock, little Chardonnay-Leigh came running into my bedroom crying, and my hands were shaking that much that I could hardly skin-up”.
The British Red Cross has so far managed to send 4000 crates of Sunny Delight to the area to help with the crisis. Rescue workers are still searching through the rubble and have found numerous ‘Elizabeth Duke’ sovereigns, benefit books, bone china from Poundstretcher and Argos catalogues. However they have not managed to save any furniture from Crazy George’s as yet.
How can you help?
This appeal hopes to raise money for food and clothing parcels for those unfortunate enough to be caught up in the disaster. Clothing is most sought after. Urgently needed are LaCoste tracksuits (his & hers preferably) white socks, Burberry caps, woolly Benny hats, and Reebok trainers. Food parcels are also needed. They include McCain’s Micro-Chips, Aldi Beans, Monster Munch, and Iceland pizzas. Alcohol is also in short supply, especially White Lightning Cider and Carlsberg Special Brew.
Cash donations are also needed. 22p buys a Bic biro for signing on, £2.50 buys a jumbo sausage dinner, £3.00 buys a blag CD (not an original copy), £20 buys a fake M.O.T., (or 10 gallons of red diesel to burn the vehicle out), and £26.00 buys 200 Regal from Tommo who has just got back from Kavos.

953,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/hey-1254-3930097/,2009-06-26,Hey,"
So, I was sat in my room on Thursday night watching Famous, Rich and Homeless when my roommate came in and informed me that Michael Jackson had died.
I was floored.
I’m not afraid, nor have I ever been, to admit being a fan.  I loved his stuff growing up and I still do.  I remember waiting up to watch the premiere of the Black or White video on Top Of The Pops.  He had an extremely fucked up personal life but I remember the music and the joy it gave me when I was younger.
Apart from that, I’ve been OK.
Not really done much, just the usual.  Job hunting, sleeping, watching stuff I’ve downloaded (I have Virtuality to watch to night.  Yay!).
One of the things I watched was Reefer Madness the movie musical.  It’s great cos it’s cheesy and doesn’t pretend to be otherwise.  I’m trying to pinpoint my favourite bit in it.  I’ve managed to narrow it down to:
the use of the word transubstantiate in a song,
the animated bit about eating a hash brownie,
FDR, George Washington, Lady Liberty and Uncle Sam making an appearance or
singing Jesus introduced by Joan of Arc.
I think the latter will eventually win out though.
Finally found out when the Torchwood 5 parter starts on BBC1.  July 6th.  Looking forward to that.  (Not to all Brit readers.  Due to not having a TV, I will probably be about a day behind watching the episodes.  So try and keep the notes section of my diary relatively spoiler free, OK?)
And not much planned for the weekend.  Will hopefully get some editing done, though.  I’ve had some great feedback on this story so I may have a lot of work to do.  I’ll manage it though.
Have you heard?  They’ve finally found the difference between men and women:

Over the weekend I:
Watched some BSG (including BSG at the UN), MST3K shorts and Cupid,
Watched Sweeney Todd, Hellboy 2, Idiocracy, Good Night, And Good Luck and Reefer Madness,
Got my TTZ thing written,
Got my ‘My life is a sham’ story done (usual drill, if wanna read and give feedback, let me know)
And stayed off the internet all weekend.  And it was actually kinda cool.
Then this morning, waiting to pay for my Dr Pepper, a young kid (I’d say about 5) was exitedly telling his mother that I was definately a woman.  Which made me chuckle.
Oh, and Check out B and D.

I don’t know what’s causing it exactly, but lately, whenever I’ve unplugged my laptop to go for a smoke and then plugged it back in, it’s completely and utterly frozen.  Meaning I have to perform a hard shutdown.  I know it’s not because of the upgrade to Windows 7 as it happened a few times when I was still on Vista.
I also had something annoying happen today.  I thought I had to go to Pertemps to speak to my employment coach (still think that’s a bloody stupid job title, BTW).  So I dragged myself out of bed and into town for the appointment, got slightly stressed because I thought I was going to be late, signed in, mentioned the appointment, sat down and then, and only then, checked the appointment card.  My appointment is for 11am.  Tomorrow.  GRRRRRRRRRRR!  Particularly as I could have done with a wee bit more sleep.  So, it’s back in tomorrow.  Which means that my plan to get some writing done tomorrow will have to be moved forward to tonight.
I’m going to be working on my locked room mystery short and another piece for submission to a magazine.  The other piece has to start with the sentance ‘My life is a sham.’  I think I can do that.
I’m also going to start fleshing out something for TTZ4 just to see if it’ll work and I can make sense of it.  I am, of course, assuming there is going to be space in TTZ4 for what I’m writing.  Meh.  I’ll just go for it.
Oooh.  Need to find somewhere to watch the GP this weekend as well.
apart from all that (and still getting the emails from Maplins for jobs well away from Boro) there’s not much happening in my life.  So I’ll leave you with the song that I’m currently obsessed with.  I stumbled across this through the Time magazine website, aquired the album, listened to it and fell in love with it.  (It’s very much like classic Beach Boys).  But this is my favourite song on the album.  Enjoy.

957,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/various-stuff-edit-2-3930093/,2009-06-08,Various stuff *EDIT*,"
I was thinking about writing an entry about the fall out from Sunday nights European election results, but I can’t be bothered right now.  (Unless anyone would like to read it.)  But if, like me, you are disgusted about two of Britains new MEP’s then go here and make yourself known.
I’ve recently upgraded from Windows Vista (the first OS I’ve seen that is actually a lot worse than it’s predecessor) to the RC of Windows 7 (after originally setting up my machine to dual boot both).  Night and day my friends, night and day.  Particularly useful is the sticky notes option which, as the name suggests, is basically post it notes.  Much easier than using notepad, which I did before.
I’ve still to hear back from Route to let me know that they got the short I submitted to them.  So either they didn’t recieve it, or the SAE I put in with the story has got lost in the post.  This would be why I usually submit via email.  Well, that and it’s cheaper.
I’m currently looking for places to submit Justification to as I think that it is read to go out there.  I’m looking for places that accept simultanious submissions so instead of anxiously waiting for one reply, I’ll be waiting for 4 or 5.  (Yes, I’m a bit of a massochist.)  I’m finding all the publications on Duotrope which also has a very handy submission tracker, which is pretty much the only reason I regestered with the site.
Also through Duotrope, I’m going to be looking throught the deadline calander to see if there is anything coming up that I can write something for.  (Most of the stuff there is themed.)  And I’m in the middle of writing a locked room short that I really should get finished.  I’m determined that if I haven’t been published by the end of the year, it won’t be for the want of trying.
Tomorrow I need to make a phone call about being a possible bone marrow donor.  I’ve also worked out that I need to get a hairdryer.  I’ll try one of the charity shops in town.
Toodles!
Will
*EDIT*
So, I made the call and answered a few health questions (mostly stuff like was I on any medications, had I had any tattoos or piercings in the last six months, nothing I haven’t had to answer before giving blood).  I was then told to make an appointment with my doctor and then pass on my doctors details to the place for sending the test tubes for the blood samples to go into.  Which is a bit of a relief as the place I had to phone is in Newcastle (with an actual Geordie answering the phone!) so I’d have been stuck if I had to head up there.
And it turns out that the potential recipiant of my marrow is in Switzerland.  Which is kinda cool.
And finally, the worst film review in the world.

Tania Branigan, Beijing
guardian.co.uk,	 Wednesday 3 June 2009 22.56 BST
It is 20 years since Ding Zilin stood by her gate and waited for her son. “What came were students with tattered clothes and dishevelled hair, shouting ‘they are killing people, they are shooting at people,'” she recalled.
“The more we watched, the more terrified and desperate we felt  At about five in the morning we saw a car with a flat wooden board on it and a child’s body on the board. When I saw the body of that child I felt my son’s fate was the same, and he would not come back again.”
Her son, Jiang Jielian, 17, was one of hundreds who died that day, shot dead by the People’s Liberation Army on the streets of Beijing. Some believe the death toll in the crackdown on the Tiananmen Square democracy protests stretches into thousands. But no one knows for sure, and Ding’s attempts to list the dead have resulted in two decades of harassment.
Security officials have repeatedly prevented her from marking her son’s death. “You killed my son and you’re stopping me going to commemorate him? You didn’t do enough?” was her incredulous comment about them to the Guardian earlier this year.
Today police again arrived to blockade her home amid a broad security clampdown. Other dissidents have been detained or invited on “holidays” by security officials this week. Plainclothes and uniformed officers have flooded Tiananmen Square. Popular online services including Twitter and Flickr and bulletin boards have been blocked. BBC broadcasts on the anniversary are blacked out and pages of imported newspapers are cut out or glued together.
Tonight an exiled student leader trying to return to China was refused entry to the territory of Macau, where he has not seen his parents for two decades. An arrest warrant for Wuerkaixi has been in force since 1989, when he was second on China’s “most wanted” list. Like the peaceful activities of Ding  a 73-year-old retired philosopher and grieving mother  Wuerkaixi’s presence is unacceptable to a state determined to suppress memory of the Tiananmen protests.
Turning point
Bao Tong, a chief aide to the reformist former general secretary of the Communist party, Zhao Ziyang, who was purged for his sympathy towards the students, said: “A lot of people have forgotten; foreign people forgot; many Chinese young people forgot too. But as long as China is still under one-party leadership  you can’t avoid talking about 4 June, because it was a turning point. It’s the key turning point, when it could have gone in the right direction, but went in the wrong direction instead.”
His remarks emphasise the double amnesia surrounding the summer of 1989. The demonstrations’ bloody ending has largely erased memories of the carnival of protest that preceded it: an astonishing uprising which lasted six weeks and drew in millions of people from around the country, threatening an end to communist rule. Anything seemed possible.
Ten years of reform had created an appetite for freedom, but also new economic pressures such as rampant inflation, leaving many anxious and insecure. The party’s paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping, tacked between reform and party orthodoxy as he tried to hold the leadership together.
Then, in April 1989, came the death of purged reformist leader Hu Yaobang. It sparked student protests with modest demands: greater freedom of speech, economic freedoms, curbs on corruption.
“The top leadership was very divided over what it meant. One view was that the students were patriotic  The other was that they were challenging the leadership of the party and that [would lead] to chaos,” said Professor Andrew Nathan, editor of The Tiananmen Papers.
Bao said: “When protests began, I was at that time very optimistic. I thought students raised anti-corruption issues, and asked for democracy. It was an opportunity to make progress.” But while his boss was pressing for dialogue with students, others were pushing Deng to crack down.
“What happened later was not the students increasing their level of activity, but Deng irritating them,” Bao said. Riven, the leadership swung between tolerance and suppression: one side emboldened the protesters, the other appeared to inflame them. As the demonstrations spread to hundreds of cities, primary school teachers took their charges to the square. Police, judges and naval officers marched to support the students.Even the city’s pickpockets were said to have stopped work in sympathy. The explosion of dissent took demonstrators as well as the government by surprise. Students found themselves heroes to thousands. Workers were drawn in almost by accident.
“It was not that on the first day I knew what my agenda was, that I was fighting for democracy. I was not there for that  I was there just for fun  curiosity,” said Han Dongfang, now director of China Labour Bulletin, who was passing on a bus when he first spotted the demonstrations. His decision to get off at the next stop would transform his life, resulting first in leadership, then jail, then exile.
“To me that was a fast growing period mentally, ideologically, politically,” he said. “As a human being, as an activist, I grew really fast in this six weeks, from zero to a spokesman of my organisation  the only workers’ organisation in the square  and then into a wanted person.”
But what exhilarated participants terrified leaders who had lived through the chaos of the cultural revolution, when young people turned on their elders. The participation of workers was particularly frightening for the government.
“Their logic was very simple: We took power with the ideology of a workers’ movement, therefore, if others are starting a labour movement not under our control, it will one day take away our power,” said Han.
The movement’s demands were growing bolder and more fractured as students flooded in from the provinces and new leaders emerged, scorning suggestions of compromise.
That was inevitable in a state which had never tolerated alternative organisations, said Chen Ziming, one of the intellectuals who attempted to mediate. For his pains would serve 13 years as a “black hand” behind the events. There was simply no way of channelling or shaping such dissent. “Students who didn’t compromise cannot be described as hostile to the government. It was more like children talking to their parents,” Chen said.
“”They think because they are children they can show their temper and parents won’t treat them that badly and will in the end step back and agree with whatever they ask,” Chen said.
“Fate was against the reformers,” said Nathan. “Zhao Ziyang was suggesting a softer line that isn’t in the DNA of the CCP  Deng had been through the [communist] revolution, through the cultural revolution. I think it was in his nature to crack down eventually.”
Zhao refused to support the use of troops and was purged; he died years later under house arrest, while Bao served seven years in jail.
But when the government declared martial law, the unthinkable happened.
“I waited all night on the monument of the people’s heroes in the middle of the square for troops to arrive  and they didn’t,” recalled Robin Munro, then a human rights activist in Beijing and now at China Labour Bulletin.
<BR>
“The student loudspeakers burst into life and someone announced ‘the great Beijing people have blocked the advance of the army’  and this roar went up. It was an extraordinary moment that no one had believed would be possible. Beijing citizens, ordinary people, had all turned out and physically stood in front of tanks to stop them coming into their city. And the troop columns halted.”
Unlike many of the celebrating students, Munro correctly read the brief triumph as the beginning of the end.
“I felt it was huge loss of face for the authorities. They will not accept it. They will have to end it their way,” he said.
Two weeks later, Deng’s patience ran out. Troops were ordered to clear the square by dawn. “They woke me up and said tonight, army really, really will break in; we have to get prepared,” said Han. “I still did not believe it  I had been in the army for three years. We were educated that the only aim as a soldier was serving the people.”
Jielian, pushing his way through the crowd in a Beijing suburb, was hit almost as soon as the firing started.
“Even after they were shot, they thought it was rubber bullets, so they tried running away,” said Ding. “After he ran a few steps he said to his friend, I may be shot  you run fast; don’t wait for me. And after he finished the sentence he knelt down and then fell forward.”
Munro thinks the authorities had never expected that citizens would dare to defy the state en masse for a second time. Yet they sent their troops in with tanks and live ammunition.
“I believe what probably tilted the balance was this point: that it would shock and awe the Beijing citizenry into submission for the far foreseeable future,” he said. “And terror works. That’s the awful thing.”
He watched as troops fired on civilians and an armoured personnel carrier rammed a truck, sending it crashing on to the crowd. “There was one poor man who had been crushed underneath it and his brains were lying outside of his head  squashed out,” Munro said. “It was literally ‘over our dead bodies will they go in and kill our students’. It was a very heroic moment for the people of Beijing – and they paid the price. They were the ones who were slaughtered.”
Amid the chaos, some soldiers were set upon, beaten and killed by angry citizens. Officials would cite this as proof of “a counter-revolutionary riot”.
“It was a one-way shooting massacre,” said Wuerkaixi, who left the square on the last ambulance to arrive in hospital awash with blood: “Darker, fresher, lighter, red. And the awful smell.”
In Tiananmen Square, as the dawn approached, troops were massing in their thousands. “The students left it till the very last minute  and many were determined to stay and sacrifice their lives. They were writing their wills on the monument,” said Munro.
In the end they walked away, minutes from the deadline. Some would flee into exile, where many remain; others were caught and jailed. Across the city, hundreds lay dead, among them Jielian.
“The last time I kissed him was two days after his death,” said Ding. “He was so cold. So cold, I can never, ever forget his cold cheek.”

Although it may not seem like it from this diary, I’m actually quite a shy, introverted, private person.  The reason that all my entries (apart from the occasional comp) is public with all notes is that if I’m brave enough to post it online, I’m brave enough to let anyone read and comment on it.
Maybe I’m not normal.  In fact, I’m very probably not normal.  But when I’m depressed, I don’t like listening to upbeat stuff.  I like to mainline this:

Hello.
Is there anybody in there?
Just nod if you can hear me.
Is there anyone home?
Come on, now.
I hear youre feeling down.
Well I can ease your pain,
Get you on your feet again.
Relax.
I need some information first.
Just the basic facts:
Can you show me where it hurts?
There is no pain, you are receding.
A distant ships smoke on the horizon.
You are only coming through in waves.
Your lips move but I cant hear what youre sayin.
When I was a child I had a fever.
My hands felt just like two balloons.
Now I got that feeling once again.
I cant explain, you would not understand.
This is not how I am.
I have become comfortably numb.
Ok.
Just a little pinprick. [ping]
Therell be no more –aaaaaahhhhh!
But you may feel a little sick.
Can you stand up?
I do believe its working. good.
Thatll keep you going for the show.
Come on its time to go.
There is no pain, you are receding.
A distant ships smoke on the horizon.
You are only coming through in waves.
Your lips move but I cant hear what youre sayin.
When I was a child I caught a fleeting glimpse,
Out of the corner of my eye.
I turned to look but it was gone.
I cannot put my finger on it now.
The child is grown, the dream is gone.
I have become comfortably numb.
You may not think that this entry serves a lot of purpose.  That it’s the insane ramblings of an idiot.  But it’s good for me.  For my soul.  And to someone who will definately not be reading this, what can I say?  Happy birthday(ish).  I’m more sorry than there are words for, in any language, in this world.

A while ago, Wil Wheaton put me onto a website called Ficlets.  Then AOL (who owned the site) decided in their infinite dumbasserywisdom to close said site.  (Sadly, I was unable to save my stories, but they have been archived, thankfully.)
The original creators decided not to take it lieing down and restarted the whole thing, this time under the name Fictly.
What is a fictly?  It’s a short story.  Very short.  As in 64 – 1,024.
That’s characters, not words.
Another cool thing about the site is that if, after reading someone else’s story, it inspires you, you can write what happened before the story in question.  Or what happened next.  Then there is the chance that someone will be inspired by you and the story will span off in a bunch of different directions.
It’s well worth a look.  And, if you do decide to sign up, you can friend me here.
And I worked out yesterday that I’m not normal.  That shouldn’t come as any big surprise to anyone here, but yesterday I found out exactly how not normal I really am.
It’s a little known fact about me that I have a wierd obsession with serial killers, mass murderers, spree killers and religeus cults.  I was annoyed last week when a documentary called Going Postal was shown on BBC2, put on the iPlayer and not made available for download.  I’ve since found a torrent, except it has absolutely no-one seeding it so it’s not moving.
But I digress.
WH smiths over here has just started a six week collection about serial killers.  Each issue focuses on two killers complete with a DVD with a documentary about the people.  The first one is Fred and Rosemary West and Dennis Nielson (who is of particular interest to me, coming from Fraserborough, which is about 1 hour away from Aberdeen).  I bought the first part yesterday, read who was to feature in the six part run and discovered that three of the killers to be profiled I had never heard of before.  (The Sussex Strangler is one.  I can’t remember the na,me of the other two off the top of my head.)
Now, I didn’t think “OK, I’m going to learn something new”.  My thought process was more this:
“Oh, my fucking God, how the hell have I NOT heard of these people before.  This is so cool.  Seriously, this is mega frakking exciting.  Should I google them to find out more, or just wait till I get the issues and learn about them then?”
(In case you’re wondering, I decided to go with the latter so, please, don’t spoil it for me.)
Told you I wasn’t normal.
Hmmm, how to end such a strange entry?
I know.  Square trees!

Will

…it’s all just a little bit of history repeated.
So, remember the second thing I wrote about in this entry?
Well, Stuart didn’t last with that girl.  And everything was fine.  Until about a week ago when Stuart told Jemma that he had a new girlfriend.  And it seems like all hell has broken loose again.
Admittedly, I’ve been kept out of it this time.  Also admittedly, I haven’t seen or spoken to either of them in a week.
Another admittedly: I am staying out of it this time even if they want to drag me into it.
Harsh?  Maybe to some but these are the facts: he’s 20.  She’s 22.  they’re both in second year at uni.  They’re supposed to be adults.  They should be able to sort it the fuck out themselves or just stop speaking to each other.
Plus I simply do not have the time, energy or patience to waste on being daddy to them.  Amongst other things I’m starting to at least attempt to get serious about getting my writing career of the ground, which means actually sitting down and doing some fucking writing.  (Not easy when all i can hear is the siren call of that flighty temptress Procrastination.)
And the fact that it is coming up to my least favourite time of year no matter what else I have on my mind.
So, my attitdue is fuck them.  They can either get their shit sorted out, or not and they don’t speak to each other ever again.  I really couldn’t give a shit.
And if this makes me seem like a bad friend?  Fuck it.  You don’t know the hassle these two have put me through since I’ve known them.  Unless you do.  In which case, if you still think I’m being bad bad friend, fuck you twice.
I knew I should have found a cave to hide in when I said: “have had it with humanity. Will interact with the bare minimum needed. That is all

Cos I can’t be bothered writing a proper entry right now.

Ducks!

Taken at stupid o clock in the morning on the main road in Middlesbrough

You have no idea how long it took to get pics with them all close together.


Interesting grafitti.

And a close up.

Sailing on the Tees

And some rowing

A bit of racing

The Infinity bridge in Stockton which was officially opened on Thursday.  It’s called that because, when the conditions are right, the relfection makes it look like the inifity symbol.  There’s an interesting story behind this.

The council held a public vote for which bridge they should build here.  They said that the one that won the vote would be the one they went with.  When they tallied the vote they decided to build the one that came second.  The reason?  They couldn’t actiually afford the one that won.  Which begs the question: why offer it as an opttion in the first place?

Looking up at the tallest arc.

And the smallest.

And just some random boats.
I know these aren’t the best pics, but I never claimed to be a photographer.  Besides, it just shows that I need a decent digital camera instead of using my phone.

So, here’s the thing.
I’ve just finished the first draft of a short story that I want to submit for publication in an anthology.  The deadline for submissions is June 3rd.  As I have to submit the story via snailmail, this means that I need to get it in the post by the 27th at the latest, just to be on the safe side.
This, obviously, doesn’t leave me a hell of a lot of time to edit it.
One thing I’ve gotten a lot of help from when it comes to editing is feedback from others that have read the story, as some of you know.
So, if there is anyone out there who would be willing to help me, leave me a note and let me know.  I’m planning to send them out tomorrow evening my time and would like to get your feedback by Monday evening at the latest so I can edit the middle of next week.
Thank you in advance if you can help.
Will.
P.S. If you’re wondering why I left it so late, I only got the email about the deadline a week ago and I’ve had things more pressing than this to deal with in the meantime.  And, no, I’m not going to go into details.

It’s been sent out to the unfortunate victimsmassochistspeople who agreed to help me.

Not much been happening in my life.  Still no sign of a job :¬(
I made a decision at the end of last week.  I’m going back to uni.  Kind of.  I’ve signed up for a creative writing course through the Open University.  I’m hoping that it’ll kick me into action and get me writing more.  I did do some writing today and am hoping to do a bit more on Friday.  We’ll see what happens with that one.
So Battlestar Galactica has finished.  Was kinda surprised by the ending as it was more upbeat than I thought it would be.  I was expecting, considering how dark the series was at times, that it would be a kill ’em all ending.
Now all I have to look forward to watching sci-fi wise on Saturdays is Dollhouse which has steadily got better of the season.  The last episode was described by everyone as a game changer and it certainly was.  See Fox?  THAT’S why you should have had a big old glass of shut the frak up and let Joss do his thing.  I don’t think it’s much of a coincidence that the episode with the least amount of studio interference is also the best reviewed thus far.
This is ordinarily the time of year when I’m looking forward to the return of Dr Who.  But, of course that’s not happening this year.  And there’s no sign of the second series of Ashes To Ashes.  Ah well, at least I have new Red Dwarf to look forward to soon.
It’ll soon be Script Frenzy time again.  You all know that I took part in the first two, completing it the first year and failing last year.  Well, I’m not bothering this year.  I don’t really have a story I’d like to tell.  I know that I can adapt something if I really want to.  But I’d rather write something new.  What I am going to do is my very own NaNo instead.  I’m going to take one of the novels I’ve started (probably the fantasy crime novel) and hopefully, throughout the month of April, finish it.  The word count for NaNo is 50,000 words, right?  That should be doable.
Spent last Wednesday ranting at the TV as I watched, and subjected a couple of friends to, the Aberdeen – Dunfermline game.  I’ve always supported Jimmy Calderwood in the past when people have wanted shot of him but this time I simply can’t.  Yes, he’s stabilised the club but he doesn’t seem to be able to take things to the next level.  Time for him to go.
Slowly getting my new room sorted.  I discovered that I took with me pictures from my trip to Odense (pronounced Oonsey) and Italy, so I’m planning to scan them into my computer.  And I might share them.  In the meantime, enjoy younger me:

Me in Odense, aged about 13.  See if you can spot me.

Me and a couple of friends in Aberdeen 14 years ago.
Have to go soon (going to watch Betty Blue.  The unedited directors cut).  But before I do so, three things:
1) I’m still looking for feedback on the idea posted in this entry
B) As said above I’ve done some writing today.  Mostly editing work on one of my short stories, Justification.  I’ve expanded it to about twice it’s length and am therefore refering to the current draft as the second first draft.  As such I need people to read it and give me feedback.  Drop ne a note if you are interested.
3 or C or iii) My next entry is my 1500th one.  So this is your last chance to ask me questions.  I’ll be posting it next Thursday so you have a week.  And you can’t say I didn’t warn you.

Anyone else see something wrong with the bit I’ve circled here?

9.) Your nickname: Will
A trench coat wearing, tall, blue eyed son of a bitch. Usually is proficient in some form of self defence, and just as likely to kick someone’s ass in an argument than reason with them. 
A Will usually carries two different personalities. There is the fiery emotional character who is caring, compassionate, and aggressive when angered, as well as the cold, contemplative warrior that he is frequently percieved as. Described as having “unlimited patience, and unlimited rage”. 
Well known for their craftsmanship, creative, and/or debating skills. Feelings towards them are usually extreme, being either deep affection or incredible hate. They dislike making enemies but strangely take pleasure in physical fighting, and are sometimes too quick to resolve situations with physical force. 
Overall, though they may be intimidating at first, they are often kind people at heart, and are prone to emotional damage resulting from failed or lost relationships. As a slight result of this, many “Will”-type people are social nomads, not really binding with any type of social clique and working best by themselves. 
Though a trait that they are certainly not proud of, some Wills are so eager to create friends, not enemies, that they will lie, and this actually leads to loosing in relationships, further on. They fiercely adhere to their beliefs however, and some even live by a veritable “code of honor”, somewhat like modern-day samurai.
“He was pulling some real stuff… and he was so aggressive with him!” Thomas spoke to his friend, recollecting the earlier fight. “He usually doesn’t seem like this; perhaps he’s turning into another Will?”

First of all, the obligatory OD6 comment.  I like it.  Couple of quibbles about it.  For example, why is it only the people using the WYSIWYG editor who get an autosave/draft feature?  And how do you put the pictures you’ve uploaded to the pictures section into your diary?
But overall, I like it.
So.  Last week, the place that the jobcentre sent me to sent me on a course called Routes To Work.  Frankly, I wasn’t expecting much from the course, and that’s exactly what I got.
We played silly games that had some mysterious meaning, wrote a lot of lists and that was about it.  One of the things we did was find out what our learning style was be marking statements that we agreed with and then scoring them.  I came out as an Activist.  Then I read the description of an Activist and burst out laughing.  This is it:
Activists:
Thrive on the challenges of new experiences and like to be fully involved.  They revel in coping in crises but, once the excitement has died down, they like to move on because they get bored with implementing systems and processes.  They enjoy working with others but tend to hog the limelight.
Learn best when:
There is a wide range of new experiences, problems and oppertunities to tackle.
They are thrown in at the deep end with a task they think is difficult.
They are given free reign to generate ideas.
They have the opertunity to lead and organise others.
Learn less when:
They have to listen to long explanations of how things should be done.
They have to work on their own a lot e.g. reading or writing lots of notes.
They are asked to take a back seat and not get involved.
They have to follow instructions to the letter with little room for manoeuvre.
So, lets see in how many ways this is wrong.
They enjoy working with others but tend to hog the limelight.
I will work with others if I really need to but if I do I prefer to take a back seat.
They are thrown into the deep end with a task they think is dificult.
I hate being thrown into the deep end with no time to think.
They are given free reign to generate ideas.
Only for stories.  Otherwise, don’t bother.
They have the opertunity to lead and organise others.
I can barely even organise myself, never mind others.
They have to work on their own a lot e.g. reading or writing lots of notes.
I want to work on my own.  I love working on my own.
They are asked to take a back seat and not get involved.
The further back the seat, the better as far as I’m concerned.
So, that was that.  At the end of the week I had a mock interview which I aced.  Mainly because the person interviewing me was one of the trainers that had been working with us all week so I wasn’t as nervous as I usually am.  (The main reason I interview badly is because I hate meeting new people and it usually takes me about 5 minutes to warm to the interviewer.  Before then, getting me to answer questions is like getting blood from a stone.)
Then on Saturday, I moved house.  Finally, I’m out of that hellhole.  I carried most of my stuff round myself (as the person who was supposed to be helping me had his car break down that day) and my new housemate/landlord helped me with the rest in his car.
And then on Sunday I got a text from my old housemate asking if I had locked my bedroom door.  I said yes and he informed me that it had been kicked in.
So, that was my week.  Couple more things before I go.
First of all, I’m still looking for your questions for my 1500th entry.
And secondly, inspired by the download to PDF option in OD, as well as Wil Wheaton, I’m thinking about downloading all of the short stories I have posted in here and self publishing them in PDF format.  There are a few things I need to work out (for example, editing PDF’s after they have been turned into PDF’s), get in touch with as many ODers as I can who have left notes on the stories to see if they mind the notes being published (as the download without notes option doesn’t work for PDF), possibly ask the Diary Master if he minds as the content may be mine but the formatting is his and see if I can find someone who would be willing to design a cover for me for no more payment than a 1 year OD+ subscription.
But what I wanted to ask is: do you lot think that I’m being Loony McInsane and should slowly step away from the keyboard?  Or is this something you might actually buy?  (I’m looking to keep the cost as low as possible, the lowest that I’ll be allowed to if I can.)
Let me know what you think.
Will
*EDIT*
So, because I did so well on the course, they’ve moved me into intensive jobsearch.  So, for 2 hours a week I have to go to Pertemps and look on the jobcentre website for work.  Which is what I do everyday from home anyway so I’m failing to see the point of it.
Oh yeah, they’ll send out my CV and a covering letter for me.  Which I can do from home.  So, still not seeing the point of it.
Today I had to fill out an online application for Barclaycard to work in their call centre.  I swear, I left shool just before my 16th birthday and this application was the most pathetic I’ve ever experienced.
It started with this thing they made me do to help me decide if the job was suitable for me or not.  (Incidentally, even if it turned out that the job wasn’t for me, they still encouraged me to apply.)  This was a series of questions with three possible answers.  There is a way to do this so that you give the answers they are looking for but, as there is nothing stopping you applying even if you ‘fail’ there really is no point.
One of the questions it asked was “How would you prefer for others to think of you?”  The three options were:
That you are reliable,
That you like to make others laugh or
That you are genuine.
I took option three only to be asked how it would feel if people said that you were reliable and always followed through on your promises.
Hang on a second?  So what they are saying is that being genuine and being reliable are mutually exclusive?  If you are one you can’t be the other?  Really?
And it gets better.  I start the application proper and get to the educational history section.  No problem.  All they wanted to begin with was my school records.  Now, as most of you know, I am from Scotland.  So, the qualifications I left school with were Standard Grades.  I filled out the first subject, looked on the pull down menu.  No option for Standard Grade.  I had to type it in.  7 frakking times.  (Or I would have done if I hadn’t got bored with it and used copy/paste.)  Even better, I’ve just checked and they have 2 call centres in Scotland.  So people applying for a job there do not have an option for the type of qualification they have.
Next up was the section for further/higher education.  Now, I’ve done a few courses since leaving school.  There was only space for entering details for one course.  Never mind, once I’ve done that one I’ll be able to submit another one.  Right?
Wrong.  Apparently everyone does one course at further or higher education and absolutely no more.
<BR>
Employment history.  Fill out the details for Garlands, use the pull down menu to say what year I started work there and…
Hang on.  2019?  Have I suddenly become a Time Lord or something?
Personal details.  Here we go.  I’ll be able, as well as saying what my hobbies and interests are, mentioning my time as an officer in the Boys Brigade, etc, I’ll be able to say exactly what my educational history is.  Y’know, the bits I had to miss out but may explain why I left one job to go to uni despite the fact that I have apparently only studied at Aberdeen College.
What’s that?  They only want to know my age, ethnicity and gender.  OK then.  This is strange.
And then the situation test.  This is where they ask you to put yourself into a situation and give you three options as to how you would resolve it.  Or, as I call it now, the bit where they suggest you can see a customer being angry over the phone.
They turned me down.  I’m glad.  I’m not entirely sure I want to work for a company where the application seems to have been designed by a 5 year old monkey.
And now I’m going to do some writing.  Or, at least, some editing.
Will
P.S. Still looking for advice about the above.  And questions.

Go Gaga Over Paris & Uwe Boll
At least someone loved THE LOVE GURU. Voters for The 29th Annual RAZZIE Awards spread the dis-honors around this year, but gave several of their berry biggest trophies to one of 2008s most notorious box office losers, Mike Myers misbegotten, far-from-mystical comedy THE LOVE GURU. In addition to being named the years Worst Picture, GURU also received spray-painted gold for its screenplay and Myers as Worst Actor, in intentionally tacky ceremonies held on Oscar Eve at the Barnsdall Theatre in Hollywood.
But the former SNL star wasnt the years biggest RAZZIE winner/loser. That dis-stink-tion belongs to sex-tape-celeb-utant Paris Hilton, who tied Eddie Murphys hat-trick from 2007, taking a record-tying 3 trophies in a single year. For her starring performance in Worst Picture nominee THE HOTTIE & THE NOTTIE (which Hilton herself executive-produced) the air-headed heiress was gonged for both Worst Actress and as part of the years Worst Screen Couple (along with co-stars Christine Lakin and Joel David Moore). And for her mostly-left-on-the-cutting-room floor cameo in the slasher musical REPO: THE GENETIC OPERA, she was chosen Worst Supporting Actress.
Others roundly RAZZed in the 90-minute Oscar parody included Pierce Brosnan as Worst Supporting Actor for his tone-deaf turn in MAMMA MIA! The years third-biggest grossing (and most disappointing) movie INDIANA JONES AND THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL won as Worst Prequel, Remake, Rip-Off or Sequel and world-class worst movie-maker Uwe Boll took both the 2008 Worst Director RAZZIE® (for 3 titles) and a well-deserved special Worst Career Achievement dis-honor. For a complete list of this years winners click here.
Winners were determined by mailing ballots to 657 voters in 45 U.S. states and 19 foreign countries. The RAZZIES® were created in 1980 as a logical antidote to Tinsel Towns annual glut of self-congratulatory awards by John Wilson, author of THE OFFICIAL RAZZIE® MOVIE GUIDE and EVERYTHING I KNOW I LEARNED AT THE MOVIES. The Barnsdall Theatre is a facility of the City of Los Angeles Department of Cultural Affairs.

Shortlists for major literary prizes often leave casual readers scratching their heads, as they wonder why such acclaimed novels have passed them by.
But even avid bookworms may have missed out on Baboon Metaphysics, which is up for this year’s Diagram Prize.
The award, which is run by The Bookseller magazine, aims to reveal the oddest book title of the last year.
Five more titles, including Strip And Knit With Style, have been shortlisted. A public vote will decide the winner.
‘Problematic’
The Diagram Prize has been running since 1978 under the watchful eye of The Bookseller’s Horace Bent.
Announcing this year’s shortlist, the columnist said he had never found it “so problematic to pick a shortlist of just six”.
“At a time when the economic climate is forbidding and cost-cutting companies are ten-a-penny, I’m proud to report that the British publishing industry has remained as stubborn in the face of change as ever,” he added.
Bent’s colleague Philip Stone revealed some of the titles which failed to make the grade – including Excrement in the Late Middle Ages and All Dogs Have ADHD.
The 2008 shortlist is as follows:
 Baboon Metaphysics by Dorothy L Cheney and Robert M Seyfarth
 Curbside Consultation of the Colon by Brooks D Cash
 The Large Sieve and its Applications by Emmanuel Kowalski
 Strip and Knit with Style by Mark Hordyszynski
 Techniques for Corrosion Monitoring by Lietai Yang
 The 2009-2014 World Outlook for 60-milligram Containers of Fromage Frais by Professor Philip M Parker
Last year’s winner was If You Want Closure In Your Relationship, Start With Your Legs by “celebrity bodyguard” Big Boom.
“So effective is the title that you don’t even need to read the book itself,” noted the Bookseller’s deputy editor, Joel Rickett.
The self-help tome took 33 per cent of the public vote. I Was Tortured By The Pygmy Love Queen came a close second, on 20 per cent.
Third place was taken by Cheese Problems Solved – which was described by its publishers as providing “responses to 200 or so of the most commonly asked questions about cheese”.
This year’s winner will be revealed on 27 March.

First of all, I am now mercifully sling free.  I went to the hospital on Monday to see someone at the trauma clinic and the doc recommended leaving the sling off and using my arm as normal.  So, that’s what I’m doing
Even though it still hurts like mad.
I’ve also got an appointment to go back next month.  But I only need to go if it’s still hurting or if I still don’t have full range of motion back.
Onto the stuff I can’t believe.  From yesterdays paper:
Dim drug dealer texts police by mistake to demand his missing heroin back
By Richard Smith 17/02/2009
A gormless drug dealer who texted police about his stash of heroin was jailed for six years yesterday.
Andrew Law, 23, had been forced to dump his jacket containing £1,400 of drugs in a garden while being chased by officers.
But he stupidly began texting the mobile he left in a pocket demanding the return of the heroin and crack cocaine – unaware it had been handed to police.
In one message, he even suggested: “You can make some money if you get in touch.”
When no one replied, he texted: “I know which f***ing garden it was. I’ll burn your house down. Get in touch otherwise you’ll get f*** all apart from a gun in your mouth.”
Detectives promptly traced the messages and arrested Law.
Yesterday he was jailed after admitting five charges of possessing Class A drugs with intent to supply and four of dealing. Derek Ryder, prosecuting, said: “The texts showed the desperate attempts he made to get his jacket and drugs back.
“Little did he know police got hold of the phone and they saw the texts, made the link to who he was and went and arrested him.
“They found the phone on which he was sending the messages.
“Also on that phone were further texts which indicated he was supplying drugs.”
Law, of no fixed address, was freed on bail but CCTV caught him dealing crack cocaine at a city centre bus station, Gloucester crown court was told.
Detectives began receiving texts on Law’s phone during September last year.
The first said: “Who’s got my jacket? I want the stuff back.”
Four minutes later, another message said: “If you’ve got this phone, ring me.”
No one replied and Law got increasingly angry.
He texted: “I want those f***ing drugs. Do you know who I am? Just answer the phone and we will do the deal. Why won’t you answer the phone?
Chances are you don’t know what you’ve got.”

And finally, a bit of an explanation first:
Because I’ve been signing on for more than 18 months, the job centre has sent me to what is called an employment zone to help me find work.  In my case it’s a company called Pertemps.  Now they have moved me onto what they call stage 2.  Which is good, as I no longer need to go to James Cook House to sign on.  It does, however and unfortunately, mean that I have to go on a one week course to help me when looking for work, in interviews, etc.  I really don’t know what this is going to be able to teach me but there you go.
So, yesterday, I got through the post a letter from Pertemps reminding me of about the course, the sort of things I’ll be doing, the rules, etc.  It also contained the course objectives.  I tried reading them out to Daphne, but could not read the last sentence without disolving into laughter.  It’s just so ridiculous.  I was going to type it out here but, in case anyone accused me of making it up, I scanned it in.  The sentence in question is underlined:

Don’t forget I’m still looking for questions.

I’m sure you all remember me writing about what happened on my birthday
Well, of course, that left me stuck.  Daphne did put out a call for donations towards getting me aq new laptop and had some offers and even some money come through.  But I found another way.
T-Mobile over here do a thing over here for broadband on the move.  It’s a usb modem that you just plug into the computer and away you go.  Well, one of the deals that they offer comes with a free laptop.  I did my maths, figured out that I can just about afford it and signed up.  The package was supposed to arrive today but it got here on Saturday.
And so, ladies and gentlepeople, it is my honour and indeed privilege to iontroduce you to Galactica Actual:


The spec:
3gig memory,
250gig hard drive,
15″ widescreen monitor,
4 usb ports,
built in webcam,
built in wifi card,
built in bluetooth.
And, dear FSM, is this thing ever fast.  I know it’s much more powerful than my old machine but still.  I noticed the difference when downloading Being Human from the BBC iPlayer (incidentally, if you do have the iPlayer, get the desktop version.  Much better than the old manager style) and it downloaded in minutes rather than about an hour.
There are a few problems I have with it, the main one being that is runs Vista (seriously, how do you make a new OS that’s worse than the one it’s replacing?) but I’ll deal with it.
So the weekend has mainly been spent pimping it out. I know Daphne may not like that I’m not using a pic of her (sorry honey) but I could not resist this as my desktop pic:

So, next entry will probably be a general update entry and will be in video form.
Couple of other things before I go (I did add these as an it on my last entry, but as it was a few days later I’ll repeat them here).
I defy you not to smile while watching this:

And it’s coming up to my 1500th entry.  So those of you who have been reading me for a while will know what that means.  To everyone else, it means that I’m looking for your questions.  Go to it.

Operation carried out two months before 50th anniversary of failed uprising against Chinese rule
Chinese authorities have launched a security operation in the Tibetan capital, Lhasa, running checks on almost 6,000 people and detaining 81, including two with “reactionary music” on their mobile phones, state media reported.
The Tibetan Daily said the “strike hard” campaign was targeting criminals.
However, campaigners for Tibetan autonomy said its timing  just two months before the 50th anniversary of the failed uprising against Chinese rule that resulted in the Dalai Lama’s flight into exile  suggested it was meant to intimidate residents.
The centre of Lhasa has been under heavy paramilitary security since last year’s violent riots, in which at least 18 people were killed.
The violence broke out following a clampdown on peaceful protests to mark the 10 March anniversary of the rebellion.
According to the Tibetan Daily, the public security bureau in Lhasa began its campaign on 18 January with raids on residential areas, hotels, guesthouses, internet cafes and bars.
By Saturday, officers had detained 30 people for robbery, prostitution, theft and having “reactionary music”  probably songs praising the Dalai Lama  on their phones.
Another 51 people were arrested for unspecified activities.
Calls to the Lhasa government office went unanswered and an employee at the public security bureau told the Associated Press the office was not authorised to speak to the media.
Tibet campaign groups quoted an earlier report in the Lhasa Evening News as saying that 5,766 people had been checked in a campaign focusing on high crime areas, those used by a floating population and places of “filth and iniquity”.
It added: “Fugitives in crimes involving guns and explosives, murder, theft and robbery were arrested, with a total of 66 suspects detained on suspicion of theft, burglary, prostitution and having reactionary opinions.”
The newspaper’s website could not be accessed today.
China first introduced “strike hard” campaigns against crime and corruption in 1983, concerned that offences were soaring in the wake of economic reforms.
The authorities have used them periodically since, often in the run-up to major events, and punishments meted out can include lengthy jail sentences and the death penalty.
“With unprecedented levels of security already in place throughout Tibet, this latest campaign appears to be intended to intimidate Tibetans still further in the build-up to the Tibetan new year in late February, the 50th anniversary period of the March ’59 uprising and the Dalai Lama’s flight to India, when the authorities fear further unrest,” the International Campaign for Tibet said in a statement.
In December, Chinese state media reported that the authorities in Tibet had detained 59 people suspected of disseminating rumours inciting ethnic tension and were cracking down on illegal downloads of “reactionary music”.

I know this won’t actually matter as it’s not China against Christans, or China supporting genocide, or China against it’s own people but it’s still worth pointing out that this place, which, in case you had forgotten, recvently hosted a sporting event aimed, in part, at suporting human rights are still carrying out an illegal occupation of another country and seemingly getting away with it.
There was a time when I kept posting articles about the elections in East Timor.  And I suspect that people were asking why.  The reason is because it deserves knowing about

So, I’m going to say that everyone is pretty much guessed out for the lyrics game.  So, here are the answers, with youtube videos where possible.
1) Broken glass and cigarettes,
Nothing like starting you off with an easy one.  And this was nothing like starting you off with an easy one.  It is, in fact, There Was A Time by Guns N Roses, from Chinese Democracy:

2) Here comes the rain again
toile_de_jouy got thios one right.  It was Here comes the rain again by Eurythmics:
(Sadly, I couldn’t find embedable versions of the official video to this, or any other Eurythmics song.)
3) I can’t deny what I’ve become
This is another one that no-one got.  It’s Magic Doors by Portishead:

4) Yeah there`s no evil introductions
And again.  This time it’s Rather Be by The Verve.  It’s from the new album, which is amazing BTW:

5) We come from the land of the ice and snow,
Just about everyone got this one.  Well, if you count Tender Lumpling, pherific and toile_de_jouy as everyone.  It is, of course Immigrant Song by: Led Zeppelin

6) Perhaps it is the color of the sun cut flat
Another one no-one got.  And, sadly, I couldn’t find a video of this version of this song on youtube.  It was Mama, you’ve been on my mind by Jeff Buckley
7) Go to sleep you little baby
toile_de_jouy was the only person to know that this one was Didn’t Need Nobody But The Baby by Emmylou Harris, Alison Krauss and Gillian Welch, from the amazing film Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?:

9) I’m through with standing in line to clubs I’ll never get in
Corbeau said she was embarrassed to know this one, but I’m not afraid to admit I like the song.  Rockstar by Nickelback:

10) You gonna look fine
And after the excitement of the last two, we’re back to ones that no-one got right.  This one was Ballrooms Of Mars by T-Rex:

11) Now I want someone badly
Chances are that a lot of people will be kicking themselves when I say that this one was I Want Someone Badly by Jeff Buckley:

12) So here I am with my thoughts of you
And this one I fell in love with at Wrestlemania last year.  Leave The Memories Alone by Fuel:
<object width=”660″ height=”525″>
13) Sweet dreams are made of this
This is another one that was correctly guessed by Tender Lumpling, pherific and toile_de_jouy  It was, of course Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of These) by Eurythmics:

14) He saw the operation you tried to pull today
No-one got this, which doesn’t really surprise me.  It was Dark Horse Chorus (Reprieve) from  Dr Horribles Sing Along Blog:

15) Now that I’ve met you
And again with no-one getting Deathly by Aimee Mann:

16) I had a friend named Ramblin’ Bob
Another one no guesses, another one from Oh Brother.  It was In The Jailhouse Now by the Soggy Bottom Boys:

17) Make a new cult every day to suit your affairs
And again no guesses for The Star Of Track And Field by Belle & Sebastian:

18) Kiss me mother kiss your darlin’
Another one I know from Oh Brother.  I Am Weary (Let Me Rest) by The Cox Family:

19) One is the lonliest number that you’ll ever do
Ahhh, the infamous number 19.  Just about everyone, who guessed knew it was the song One.  And all the guesses suggested the artist was Three Dog Night.  Other suggestions were Harry Nillson and Filter.  But no-one got it.  The version I was listening to plays over the opening titles of the film Magnolia and was performed by Aimee Mann:

20) Ridin’ down the highway
No guesses again.  It was It’s A Long Way To The Top from, and by, School Of Rock:

21) Anthony walked to his death because he thought hed never feel this way again
pherific got this one, which was a pleasent surprise, if only cos I didn’t think anyone would.  If You’re feeling Sinister by Belle & Sebastian

22) Look at these People
Another one from Dr Horrible, it was Slipping by Neil Patrick Harris:
<param name=""movie"" value=""http://www.youtube.com/v/RidsxnnVTR4&hl=en&fs=1&rel=0&color1=0x5d1719&color2=0xcd311b&border=1″&gt;
23) When I was young, it seemed that life was so wonderful,
Kinda surprised that no-one got The Logical Song by Supertramp

24) I’ve got a funny feeling there’s something wrong today 
And the second one from Chinese Democracy, it was Shackler’s Revenge by Guns N Roses:

25) Send a heartbeat to
Discovered thanks to the awesome Watchmen trailer, this was The Begining Is The End Is The Begining by Smashing Pumpkins:

26) I heard there was a secret chord
pherific got this one.  Hallelujah by Jeff Buckley:

27) Oh, for the sake of momentum
More from Magnolia and Aimee Mann, Momentum:

28) She came from Greece she had a thurst for knowledge
Amelie’s Twin correctly guessed that it was Common People by William Shatner (not the pulp original, though I do like that one):

29) Well billy rapped all night about his suicide
Mott The Hoople singing Bowie.  All The Young Dudes:

30) As I went down in the river to pray
And finally, correctly guessed by Amelie’s Twin (and also toile_de_jouy, but she said this was the answer to number 20 and I felt evil) another one from Oh Brother, Down In The River To Pray by Alison Krause:

And there you go.
Will

								Your result for The Kink Spectrum Analysis Test…

Green (530 nm)
You scored 42% self-confidence and 36% bandwidth!

Not bad! You’re probably not willing to try everything, but you have quite a few kinks. Or you strongly prefer one side of the fence. Look for another Green, or a Blue if you feel adventurous. Reds may be okay as well if they share one or two of your likings (see below). But stay away from Ultraviolets unless you want to radically spice up your sex life. You’ve been warned.

But I promised you a more detailed analysis, so here it is. Note that most scales are twofold: There are separate values for giving (active) and receiving (passive). If you scored high on one of them, you should look for a partner who scored high on the other. If you scored high on both of them, go for someone who is similar (or for multiple partners if you’re into that). If you scored low on both, this probably is not your kind of kink.

You scored 44% giving and 46% receiving on oral.

You scored 11% giving and 10% receiving on anal.

You scored 23% giving and 21% receiving on bondage.

You scored 15% giving and 10% receiving on humiliation.

You scored 17% giving and 25% receiving on pain.

You scored 27% dominance and 28% submission.

You scored 38% voyeurism and 29% exhibitionism.

Besides that, you’re 31% into fetishism and 44% polysexual (i.e. interested in sex with multiple partners, whether at the same time or not). You’ll probably want a partner who is similar, whether you scored high or low in these categories.

Finally, you scored 11% on autoerotic – a scale that measures your ability and/or willingness to have kinky fun without a partner. It’s not exactly a matching criterion, but it’s good for you if your score is high. Keep it up!

…THE HAPPENING, DISASTER MOVIE and Uwe Boll Rank Among 2008 RAZZIE® Worsts
It wasnt just the American economy that took a disastrous downturn in 2008  so did the quality of Hollywood movie-making. Of the 573 films released last year a record 75 rated forum discussions on the official RAZZIE® Awards web site. This plethora of putrid motion pictures proved a double-edged sword  It meant Golden Raspberry Award voters had plenty to choose from  but it also made their task of culling the crud down to a mere five contenders each in nine categories berry complicated. What they selected as nominees for this year’s 29th Annual RAZZIE® Awards is the subject of this press release. The eventual winners will be unveiled in intentionally tacky ceremonies set for the now traditional Oscar® eve, Saturday night February 21, 2009 at the Barnsdall Gallery Theatre in Hollywood.
Among the contenders for the Worst Picture are several laugh-free comedies, the year’s most laughable vision of the apocalypse, a pair of puerile parodies, a couple of big budget B.O. bombs, and a decidedly un-romantic romantic comedy co-produced by Paris Hilton. The list includes the first ever dual Worst Picture nominees, two films from the same two talent-free writer/directors, both featuring essentially the same cast  those twin towers of pop culture babble, DISASTER MOVIE (which lived up  or down  to its title) and MEET THE SPARTANS (a parody of THE 300 which somehow managed to work references to Britney Spears into an ancient Spartan plot). Other Worst Picture picks: The latest mystery with a twist from that self-important twit (and multiple RAZZIE® winner) M. Night Shyamalan, THE HAPPENING, an eco-disaster tale whose villain drew more guffaws than gasps; The robotic rom-com THE HOTTIE AND THE NOTTIE copping Hilton three of her four RAZZIE® nominations this year alone as the films producer and star; Bad Movie Uber-Meister Uwe Bolls video-game-based fiasco IN THE NAME OF THE KING: A DUNGEON SIEGE TALE, which grossed under $5 million on a $60 million budget and was also a factor in Boll being selected to receive the first Worst Career Achievement RAZZIE® awarded since 1987. And last (and possibly least) the years biggest box office bomb, Mike Myers as a platitude-spouting mystic in the decidedly unloved LOVE GURU. Also singled out for dis-honor: The years third-highest-grossing (and most disappointing) movie, INDIANA JONES AND THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL, as Worst Prequel, Remake, Rip-Off or Sequel, 2007 Triple Crown RAZZIE® winner Eddie Murphy, back for more abuse in two categories for MEET DAVE; Oscar® winner Al Pacino sporting his third RAZZIE® nomination for both 88 MINUTES and RIGHTEOUS KILL, Pierce Brosnan singing(!) in MAMMA, MIA! as Worst Supporting Actor, Worst Actor choice Larry the Cable Guy, all five top-billed stars of THE WOMEN (jointly vying as Worst Actress)…and more!
Nominees were determined by mailing ballots to 687 voters in 45 U.S. states and 19 foreign countries. The RAZZIES® were created in 1980 as a logical antidote to Tinsel Towns annual glut of self-congratulatory awards by John Wilson, author of THE OFFICIAL RAZZIE® MOVIE GUIDE and EVERYTHING I KNOW I LEARNED AT THE MOVIES. The Barnsdall Theatre is a facility of the City of Los Angeles Department of Cultural Affairs.

I was going to write an entry with the pics of me with the FA Cup.  And my opinion of Frost/Nixon.  And a pic of the sonic pen a friend gave me for Christmas.
I was even thinking of mentioning how the staff at the job centre here in Boro couldn’t find their own arses with both hands, a torch, a map and a giant neon sign pointing the way.
But I’m not.
The reason I’m not is this.
Got home last night after having a couple of birthday drinks with a friend in the union to find a pile of black bags at the foot of the stairs.  Went to my room (still locked) and found a note from one of my housemates asking me to knock on his door when i got in.  Knocked on his door and he told me that the nightmare housemate I mentioned before is now a ex-housemate as my landlord kicked her out that day.
However, he had got in (he’d been staying at his siters for a few days) to discover that his stereo and £500 in housing benefits cheques had been stolen.
So I went to my room and unlocked the door.
And there it wasn’t.
I usually take it with me whenever I leave the house.  But yesterday, for some reason, I forgot.  I thought it was safe due to my bedroom door being locked.
But there it wasn’t.
The police were phoned, they came round, took statements, etc, etc.  Sat up chatting with my housemate for a while, then went to bed as I had an appointment early today.
Got up, went to pack it in my bag and then remembered.
There it wasn’t.
My laptop.  Which was also my TV, DVD player, music centre and main writing tool.  Gone.
Thankfully, most of the stories I had on there (including the opening of my novel) are safe as I had emailed them to people for feedback so I downloaded them from the emails I sent and saved them to my drive on the uni servers.  Also, thankfully, I had put the photo’s from when Daphne was here (both times) onto my external hard drive so they’re safe as well.
But still.  My laptop.  Basically part of my body.  I’m slightly lost (particularly at nights when I would watch stuff I’d downloaded or listened to music while reading/writing).
Will
P.S. No, i didn’t have insurance.  I couldn’t afford that.

Today in History – Jan. 19
By The Associated Press  10 hours ago
Today is Monday, Jan. 19, the 19th day of 2009. There are 346 days left in the year. This is Martin Luther King Jr. Day.
Today’s Highlight in History:
On Jan. 19, 1809, author, poet and critic Edgar Allan Poe was born in Boston.
On this date:
In 1736, James Watt, inventor of the steam engine, was born in Scotland.
In 1807, Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee was born in Westmoreland County, Va.
In 1853, Giuseppe Verdi’s opera “Il Trovatore” premiered in Rome.
In 1861, Georgia seceded from the Union.
In 1937, millionaire Howard Hughes set a transcontinental air record by flying his monoplane from Los Angeles to Newark, N.J., in seven hours, 28 minutes and 25 seconds.
In 1944, the federal government relinquished control of the nation’s railroads following settlement of a wage dispute.
In 1955, a presidential news conference was filmed for television for the first time, with the permission of President Dwight D. Eisenhower.
In 1966, Indira Gandhi was elected prime minister of India.
In 1970, President Richard M. Nixon nominated G. Harrold Carswell to the Supreme Court; however, the nomination was defeated because of controversy over Carswell’s past racial views.
In 1979, former Attorney General John N. Mitchell was released on parole after serving 19 months at a federal prison in Alabama.
Ten years ago: President Bill Clinton delivered his State of the Union address, in which he proposed to protect Social Security by using huge budget surpluses and announced the government would sue the tobacco industry for smokers’ health costs. Hours earlier, at the president’s impeachment trial in the Senate, White House Counsel Charles Ruff opened the defense with ringing statements of Clinton’s innocence.
Five years ago: John Kerry won Iowa’s Democratic caucuses, while John Edwards placed second; Howard Dean, who finished third, delivered a fist-pumping, bellowing concession speech that was viewed as politically damaging. A freighter capsized near the western Norwegian port of Bergen, killing 18.
One year ago: Republican John McCain won a hard-fought South Carolina primary; Democrats Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama split the spoils in the Nevada caucuses. A soldier was killed south of Baghdad in a roadside bomb attack; his was the first American death to occur on a newly introduced, heavily armored vehicle known as MRAP. Death claimed actress Suzanne Pleshette in Los Angeles at age 70; John Stewart, a former member of the Kingston Trio, in San Diego at age 68; and former Chicago Mayor Eugene Sawyer at age 73.
Today’s Birthdays:
Actress Jean Stapleton is 86.
Actor Fritz Weaver is 83.

Actress Jodie Sweetin is 27.
Actor Logan Lerman is 17.
Thought for Today: “Words have no power to impress the mind without the exquisite horror of their reality.”  Edgar Allan Poe (1809-1849).
Yup, I turn 31 today.  And, due to the fact that have a job centre related interview tomorrow, my big plans for the day involve going to the Riverside to see if I can get my pic taken with the FA Cup and going to a free screening of Frost/Nixon.

…Abortion Doughnuts
By Kyle Munzenrieder in Politicks
Thursday, Jan. 15 2009 @ 1:16PM
Krispy Kreme, being the genial purveyor of glazed goodness that it is, decided to get in on the Obama inauguration craze and is offering one free doughnut to every costumer on January 20, Inauguration day, and released this seemingly innocuous press release:
“Krispy Kreme Doughnuts, Inc. (NYSE: KKD) is honoring American’s sense of pride and freedom of choice on Inauguration Day, by offering a free doughnut of choice to every customer on this historic day, Jan. 20. By doing so, participating Krispy Kreme stores nationwide are making an oath to tasty goodies — just another reminder of how oh-so-sweet ‘free’ can be.”
Well, The American Life League noticed the liberal use of the word choice and decided to blast the chain bakery for producing abortion doughnuts.
“The unfortunate reality of a post-Roe v. Wade America is that ‘choice’ is synonymous with abortion access, and celebration of ‘freedom of choice’ is a tacit endorsement of abortion rights on demand,” the group’s president, Judie Brown said in a statement.
File this under “Overreactionary Wing Nuts” and another attempt of conservatives to redefine words for their political means (You can try to rewrite the Constitution, but not the dictionary). Of course, the “overreactionary libtard” counter to this is that conservatives want to demonize all choice from America until we’re living under a fundamentalist dictatorship. A fundamentalist dictatorship without doughnuts.
KRISPY KREME CELEBRATES OBAMA WITH PRO-ABORTION DOUGHNUTS Washington, DC (15 January 2009) –
The following is a statement from American Life League president Judie Brown: 
“The next time you stare down a conveyor belt of slow-moving, hot, sugary glazed donuts at your local Krispy Kreme, you just might be supporting President-elect Barack Obama’s radical support for abortion on demand – including his sweeping promise to sign the Freedom of Choice Act as soon as he steps in the Oval Office, Jan. 20.
“The doughnut giant released the following statement yesterday:
‘Krispy Kreme Doughnuts, Inc. (NYSE: KKD) is honoring American’s sense of pride and freedom of choice on Inauguration Day, by offering a free doughnut of choice to every customer on this historic day, Jan. 20. By doing so, participating Krispy Kreme stores nationwide are making an oath to tasty goodies — just another reminder of how oh-so-sweet “free” can be.’
“Just an unfortunate choice of words? For the sake of our Wednesday morning doughnut runs, we hope so. The unfortunate reality of a post Roe v. Wade America is that ‘choice’ is synonymous with abortion access, and celebration of ‘freedom of choice’ is a tacit endorsement of abortion rights on demand.
“President-elect Barack Obama promises to be the most virulently pro-abortion president in history. Millions more children will be endangered by his radical abortion agenda.
“Celebrating his inauguration with ‘Freedom of Choice’ doughnuts – only two days before the anniversary of the Supreme Court decision to decriminalize abortion – is not only extremely tacky, it’s disrespectful and insensitive and makes a mockery of a national tragedy.
“A misconstrued concept of ‘choice’ has killed over 50 million preborn children since Jan. 22, 1973. Does Krispy Kreme really want their free doughnuts to celebrate this ‘freedom.’  
“As of Thursday morning, communications director Brian Little could not be reached for comment. We challenge Krispy Kreme doughnuts to reaffirm their commitment to true freedom – to the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness – and to separate themselves and their doughnuts from our great American shame. 
“American Life League was cofounded in 1979 by Julie Brown. It is the largest grassroots Catholic pro-life organization in the United States and is committed to the protection of all innocent human beings from the moment of creation to natural death.”

Seriously?  No company is allowed to put the word choice in a press release anymore?

So, I’m back in Boro.  And the new housemate is a bigger nightmare than my other housemate told me.
She has friends round all times of the night, plays loud music (you try sleeping when there is reggae covers of crap boyband music playing) and I actually have to knock on the door to get in at night.
So, yeah, one of my friends has a room he’s renting out and I’m just waiting for him to get back in touch with me about going to see it.  The rent works out about £10 a week more than I’m paying just now but, to be honest, I’d be happy paying all of my housing benefits and my JSA just to get out of there.
Tomorrow I have an interview at the jobcentre about the fact I’ve been signing on so long.  They’ll either (if experience has taught me anything) send me to a place to look for work twice a week or they’ll send me off to an agency.
Then there’s a job fair in a nearby town on Thursday so I’m planning to pop over to that.  Once, of course, I’ve been to Forbidden Planet to pick up the copy of Spiderman with Obama in it :¬)
I lost my phone in the house last night.  Fairly certain it was lost in the living room, which means that it is gone :¬(  So I bought a new one today, which is actually better than my old one.  My old sim card is being cancelled and I’m getting a new one for my old number.  Plus, I’ve got a voucher for 1000 free text messages.  Hopefully it’ll work for sending texts abroad so it’ll be easier for me to text Daphne.  But even that amount wouldn’t be enough for this girl.
And I’m about to geek it out.  The ringtone will be the sound of the TARDIS taking off, my alarm will be the BSG theme tune and the text message alert is going to be the cloister bell from the TARDIS.  Yup, whenever I get a text there’ll be trouble :¬p
Did find out something good today.  Last year, the BBC showed a one off programme called Being Human, about what happens when a vampire, a warewolf and a ghost share a house.  it was brilliant and well made and made me feel a bit sad that it was only a one off.  Well, they’ve finally seen sense and a series of it starts soon on BBC3.  Yay!
People often slag me off for being a fan of wrestling (I blame the fact that, when growing up, I watched British wrestling on ITV) but, be honest, how many other events give you the chance to see something like this?

And would you look at the tits on this!

Hogmanay was quite quiet.  I went for my now traditional mini crawl round the bars in the Belmont Street area of Aberdeen and saw in the bells with a pint of Tennants, a nip of whisky and my darling fiancee on the phone with me.
New Years Day itself was quiet.  I was thinking about going to see Che part 1 and 2, but the tickets were £12 and I really couldn’t afford it.  So I basically did nothing.  And it was pretty much the same on the second.
The Saturday I had to go into town to pick up my tickets for returning to Middlesbrough.  Sadly, this meant that I couldn’t go to Sandhaven to visit my gran.
I got home, watched Dr Who Confidential (see last entry).  I will add to this that I’m getting sick and bloody tired of people critisizing him before we’ve actually seen him in the role.  For the love of FSM, does it bloody matter if he is only 26, or not black, or not female, or appears to have no eyebrows (a serious complaint from some)?
Then I settled down to watch Demons.  Oh dear FSM.  I had hopes that it would be watchable.  Particularly with the Van Helsing connection.  But between Philip Glenisters shite American accent (just let him use his normal accent, that’ll distance him from Hunt), the fact that a 16 year old lad is apparently the last of the Van Helsing bloodline (and the indications are that they actually mean the last ever despite the fact it appears the guy has never even had a girlfriend) and the naming of a character Ruby apparently just so they could use the song I had to give up.
Which is a shame, cos the person playing Mina Harker is quite nice to look at.
Then my friend Lewis came round.  Which was cool as I hadn’t seen him in ages.  We had a few drinks (actually, we got pissed), listened to music, watched Ren & Stimpy, I introduced him to Dr Horrible and got caught up.  It was fun.
Sunday was also quite a relaxed day.  well, apart from the packing I needed to do.  I really hate packing, even if it is for a holiday.
I also got a shock when I found out that one of my favourites here on OD, Liberalis Femina, passed away.  I know I’m slightly late to the party on this one but I think the thing that shows her character isn’t the number of people who agreed with her politically who have commented on her death but rather the amount of people she didn’t agree with who have remarked on what a good person she is.
And yesterday was the trip.  Got to Edinburgh ok and this is where I hit problems.  Due to the previous 2 Kings Cross trains being cancelled there were three trainloads on the one train.  Now, this shouldn’t have been a problem for me as I has a seat booked on that train.  Except someone had taken the reserved sign off my seat and sat in it.  I founf somewhere else to sit.  Unfortunately, that seat was reserved from Newcastle and the person did want their seat.  So, for the half hour journey from Newcastle to darlington I had to stand in the doorway.  Darlo to Boro wasn’t an issue.
Got home, dumped my stuff, came to the LRC to check emails and such and then it was off to a free screening of Slumdog Millionaire.  I’d been wanting to see this film for a while and when I got the chance to go to a free screening I just had to take it.  Short review?  Brilliant.  Well worth going to see.
I then headed to the union, had a couple of pints with friends, spoke to Daphne online, got some food and home.
And that’s things right up to date.

994,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/in-which-will-answers-your-questions-3930056/,2008-12-31,In which Will answers your questions,"
Happy New Year folks!
As promised here’s my answers to the questions you left me about 2008.
First up is my gorgeous fiancee Loves Snogs:
Tell me your most exciting time in 2008.
That would have to be the week that Daphne was here in November.  It was amazing to be able to spend time with her (including sexy time).  And we had a blast.
Tell me your favorite memory from 2008.
Meeting Daphne in the train station in August.  Finally being able to hold her and kiss her was brilliant.
tell me what you look forward to in 2009.
Daphne coming over here in the summer and possibly living with her at some point.
What do you want to change the most in 2009?
My job situation.  As in I’d like one.
next up was Shesolovely
Will you move to the states in 2009?
Possibly.  We’ll just have to wait and see what happens.  But I would like to.
Then findingsunshine had somethings she wanted to ask:
*As a whole, how would you rate 2008 against previous years?
Better.  I was skint for most of it, but I also met the most amazing woman ever.  And, for some strange reason she likes me as well.

My cute girl.  Even if she thinks she doesn’t look good in this pic.
And I started making contacts with other writers in Middlesbrough which is always good
*What did you learn from 2008 that will help make 2009 better/easier?
Dunno really.  Probably the stuff in my writing classes about different techniques.
*What was the best book you read, movie you watched & tv series you discovered in 2008?
Book: It was quite a good book year for me, starting with The Kite Runner by Khaled Hosseini and finishing with A Thousand Splendid Suns by Khaled Hosseini.  In between there was Stuart MacBride, Union street by Pat Barker, finally got round to reading The Secret Purpose by David Baddiel.  And of course The Tales Of Beadle The Bard.  But my favourite book was The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo by Steig Larsson.  Got it cheap read it, loved it and immediately started re-reading it.  Which is always the sign of a good book.
Movie: I watched quite a few films this year thanks to the film society that my friend runs.  For films that were released this year, WALL-E is fun and inventive and Get Smart was more fun than I expected.  But the best film was The Dark Knight.  Much like Watchmen did with superhero comics and graphic novels, TDK is a game changer.  Change the characters from Batman, etc, and what you have is a very good crime film.  As for films that weren’t out this year, there were a few that I saw but I’d really have to go with the Three Colours trilogy, in particular the last one.
TV shows: None that started this year really grabbed my attention and kept hold of it.  But I will say that Ashes To Ashes isn’t as bad as everyone says and I’m interested in what happens with that ending which changed not only A2A but Life On Mars as well.
Next we have Karma Girl
Where do you hope to be living in 2009? America or Scotland?
Either America, Scotland or England.  Not bothered where as long as it is with Daphne.
Are you planning any more tattoos for 2009?
Possibly.  I’m not sure.  I’ve seen a couple I’d like to get, it all depends on the money thing.
What was your most fun moment of 2008, if you can possibly just choose one?
August 15th, when I got Daphne back to my house :¬D
And then it was Kaly’s turn, including one question that doesn’t really qualify so I’ll answer it in my next scheduled Q&A session:
So… who will move to which country in 2009?
Not sure yet.  Depends on the work situation.
Will you celebrate the inauguration of Obama?
Hell yes!
With what kind of beer?
I’d like it to be with Tennants but it’ll probably be Fosters or Carling.
What are your fondest hopes for 2009?
That I’ll be living with Daphne.
Will you do Script Frenzy again?
Dunno.  Depends on if I have the time and find a story worth writing.
If you come to America, will you let us know so we can visit wherever you are and buy you a pint?
Of course I will.  It’d be lovely to meet you.
Equanimous asks a tricky one:
Can you give a summary of Scottish politics in 2008? My in-laws live there but are as dense as cabers when it comes to politics, and I’d love someone on the ground to say what was happening. 
Sadly, I’ve not been keeping up with Scottish politics this year, due to me living in England.  I do know it looks like the independance referendum won’t happen (which is a good thing as it’d be a no vote), constant bickering over whether or not Britain should enter a football team for the next Olympics.  Oh, and the Homecoming Scotland ad, which is an attempt to get ex-pat Scots to visit the country for Rabbie Burns 250th birthday that, for a while, was only being shown in…
Scotland.  Which is useful considering it’s aim.
Finally, he have quite a few drom Corbeau which, again, includes some that will be answered in the next Q&A entry:
Do you make New Year Resolutions? Do you keep them?
Nope for the first one.  Which should also answer the second one.
Are you going to America next year?
Answered.
What’s one thing you’re looking forward to in the New Year?
And this one as well.
Favorite book read in 2008?
And this one.
Favorite TV show in 2008?
And this one too.
Name one accomplishment you’re proud of from 2008.
The summer classes and the Chinese class.
Are you afraid Fox will screw over Dollhouse just as they did Firefly?
It is a worry, with the Friday time slot.  But the guy who is running Fox now is a) a huge Joss fan (he said that when Joss went in to pitch the show that Joss had him at hello) and b) kept two critically acclaimed but little watched shows in air while in the same position on NBC (The Office and Friday Night Lights).  Also, with the fact that Fox quickly upped the episode order from 7 to 13 episodes and spent the money put aside for the pilot episode into building the set it looks like they have faith in the show and in Joss.  I’m not overly concerned. 
What are you afraid might happen in 2009?
Daphne comes to her senses and dumps me.  Death and dismemberment.
Do you think aliens will invade in2009?
Dunno.  It could be cool though.
Did you know the Smurfs are coming back in 2009?
No.  That’s kinda cool.
Is there one thing you hope will happen before New Year’s Eve 2009?
Me and Daphne living together and possibly married.  (Still working on getting her to agree to the Vegas thing :¬p)
What movie are you most looking forward to in 2009?
Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince looks good.  As a Trekkie I should be excited abut the new Trek film.  But I’m not feeling it.  It’s a combination of things.  a) JJ Abrams.  I’m not a big fan of his stuff, I think it gets unnessecarily complicated (Alias, I’m looking at you).  b) the fact that the plot apparently involves time travel.  Really?  I mean, really?  c) Simon Peggs Edingowdeen accent which I think is trying to be generic Scottish and has ended up bizarre.  And d) my slightly irrational hatred of the Bad Robot logo at the begining of the trailers.  But there is the genius casting of Zachary Quinto as Spock and the correct decision to have Majel Barrett-Roddenbury as the voice of the ships computer.  In the end, it’s a Trek film so i’ll probably go see it.  There’s also going to be a film version of The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo which I’m looking forward to.
But the main one for me is going to be Watchmen (BTW, this article is right, Fox can eat all the dicks).  Zach Snyder really gets and understands it as evident from him wanting to do it so he could be sure it was done right.  He managed to get Warners to agree to it being R rated, not PG-13.  And just watch this then tell me that this film will not have a couple of very large vats of awesomesauce and the purest win on the market:
Book?
It’s hard with books because I never know exactly what’s coming out, unless it’s well hyped like with the Harry Potter books.  The only one I know is coming out that I want to read is The Girl Who Played With Fire, the next book in the Millenium trilogy.
TV Show?
The Dr Who specials should be good and a fitting send off for RTD and David Tennant.  Torchwood will, I think, benefit from the 5 episode storyarc and RTD taking over from Chris Chibnal.  BSG finishes this year and, after the mid season cliffhanger, I can’t wait to see how it ends.  Heroes volume 4 will benefit from the return of Bryan Fuller as consulting producer as he’s already said that he’s getting the room to go back to focusing on the characters.  Plus he wrote what is still the best episode of the show’s entire run.  Unfortunately, that does mean that Pushing Daisies is done :¬(
But the main one for me is, of course, Dollhouse.  Joss Whedon, Eliza Dushku (in a role that most actors would kill for).  Watch this scene and you may be slightly interested in the show:
And that’s your lot for this year.  My next regularly scheduled Q&A session will be in 26 entries time but I will, of course, give you reminders in plenty of time.

995,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/students-100bn-overdraft-shock-3930055/,2008-12-30,Student’s £100bn overdraft shock,"
A student from Ayrshire was left in a state of shock when his online banking statement showed him to be overdrawn by almost £100bn.
Donald Moffat, 38, from Irvine, said that on Tuesday morning his Barclays account was showing two separate withdrawals of £50bn.
The bank said a “technical error” was to blame and apologised.
Mr Moffat said Barclays also offered £10 in compensation for the phone calls he had to make to resolve the error.
The full-time student, who is also a part-time care worker, e-mailed a copy of his bank statement to BBC Scotland.
It showed a debit balance on 30 December of just under £100bn.
Mr Moffat said on Tuesday morning his wife had noticed “a major discrepancy of two £50bn debits” being taken out of his account.
“We knew we still had quite a bit left in the account as we checked last night before we went out,” he said.
“This morning I went out to get a few things, then, when I came back, my account was overdrawn by that amount.”
Mr Moffat said he had “been passed from pillar to post” after making the error known to Barclays.
He also said he was looking for the bank to increase its offer of compensation for the level of stress he had been put under in trying to resolve the situation.
In a statement Barclays said: “Earlier today a technical error caused some customer accounts to be incorrectly debited.
“The problem was immediately identified and corrected within less than an hour, and all affected customer accounts are now showing correct balances.
“No customers will be financially impacted by this error. We apologise for any inconvenience this may have caused our customers.”

997,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/daphne-visit-friday-friday-edit-3930053/,2008-12-27,Daphne visit:  Friday – Friday *EDIT*,"
*WARNING!*  Long entry ahead.  *WARNING!*
So, I was planning to get a good nights sleep the night before Daphne arrived here.  But I just couldn’t get my head down.  About 7:30 I left my house for the train station.  I was planning to get the bus at 9am from Darlington train station directly to the airport.  But, not knowing where I needed to catch the bus from, I decided to get to Darlington half an hour early, as the next train would leave me about 6 minutes to find the bus stop.
Upon arriving at the train station, I decided to go for a smoke and then wory about finding the bus stop.  Only to discover that it was actually part of the train station.  I caught the bus and went, for the first time ever, to teeside Durham Tees Valley airport.  Turns out that when I was told it wasn’t big, the person wasn’t actually joking.
I sat in the arrivals part of the airport waiting for her.  And then she appeared.  I stood up and rushed over to meet her.  We hugged and kissed, then she told me that the person she sat next to on the plane had offered us a lift home.  As long as I didn’t mind the car smelling of dog and there being no seats in the back.  I had absolutely no problem with this so, when Vanessa appeared from trying to find her luggage (which had been left behind in Amsterdam) we set off.
When we got back to my house Daphne showed me all the goodies she had bought for me.  Including my swank new Dr Who t shirt.  We then went into town so that Daphne could change her money.  That done, she bought me a Boro scarf (which could easily be changed into a Dons scarf if need be) and we ate.  Back to the house for a quick nap and then into the LRC so she could email her father and I could email my mother.  From there, we proceeded to the union for food and a few drinks with Stuart and Jemma.
The next day was an early start so we could go to York to meet up with Steven the Rill.  On the way, Daphne decided that she wanted something to eat.  So we called by Greggs, as when she was here in August she tried one of their sausage rolls and liked it.  Said foodstuff wasn’t ready yet, but we were told it would be about 5 minutes.  We went outside so I could smoke and Daphne was so excited that she was bouncing up and down.  It was cute.
We then went to the train station to meet Stuart.  There were supposed to be more of us but 2 people had to pull out due to illness and one due to babysitter issues.  I wore the Arizona t shirt Daphne gave me in August and Stuart wore the Beatles t shirt Daphne had given him the night before.  At the first stop on the way to York we were joined by Jemma (as she lives there so it just made more sense).  She was also wearing the Arizona t shirt she got in August.  (I was trying to organise for everyone to wear one.)
We got into York train station and found Steven.  From there we went to York Minster walking past a busker playing the piano (I’m serious).  We went into the Minster and had a look round.  Though we couldn’t go into the Minster itself, as there was a service going on, we did go down into the crypt and wondered round looking at the exhibits from throughout the life of the Minster.  This was interesting but it was a shame that, in an effort to shore up the building and stop it collapsing, they had reinforced concrete with steel bolts in it to point out where we needed to go.  I can understand why this was needed but the fact is that, surrounded by so much history, it looked a bit ugly IMHO.
After we left the crypt we headed to the top of the tower.  This was up 275 steps.  The first set were not too bad but the second lot were steep, winding and so narrow I was literally shoulder to each wall and so ended up going up sideways.  The views from the top were breathtaking and well worth the hike.  There was also a small moment of amusement as when we reached the top one of the piano playing buskers on the street below could be heard playing The Simpsons theme tune.
We then headed back down (after being told we could) and wondered round the gift shop, where I picked up a gargoyle I have called Gary.  We then went to the Three Legged Mule pub for a non-alcoholic drink and give our legs a chance to recover.  As everyone was hungry, it was decided to walk round the city walls and visit the Morrisons where Stuart’s mum works and have lunch.
Sadly this did mean more stairs but we did stop off at a gift shop (where I got myself a replica medieval coin) and Daphne treated everyone to a chocolate.  We got to the shop, surprised Stuarts mum and then ate a surprisingly good meal.
From there we made our way to the Jorvic Viking Centre.  There was a queue to get in so we waited and then entered.  After heading down some stairs (there’s that bloody word again!) we entered a room that we were told was a time machine.  Naturally I thought this was cool.  We then got into something like a roller coaster carriage and went round listening to a narrationj which we could have in a variety of languages (including English for children) and enjoying the sights, sounds and smells of the time.  We then had a look around the rest of the stuff on display, I found out how much of a viking I am and then left.  I was hoping to buy a version of a viking board ganme but the cheapest they had was £10 so I couldn’t afford it :¬(
Then, at my insistance, we went to the Japanese Shop where I found something I’d been looking for.  As you lot know, I’m taking Chinese classes and I had been looking for a special pen with a brush on it so I could do the characters properly.  I had a feeling that this would be the ideal place to find it, and so it was.  They were hiding from me, but I found one and Daphne bought it for me.
From there we went to the National Railway Museum cos it was free.  They have the Flying Scotsman there, but it’s been dismantled for maintenance so there really isn’t much to see.  We then headed to the train station, saw Steven onto his train and then headed home ourselves.  We were all knackered but in need for a drink.  There was one criteria when trying to decide where we were heading.  NO BLOODY STAIRS!  We ended up meeting another friend Emma in the Camels Hump (which had a couple of stairs) for a few drinks.  Then away for a parmo and home.
Woke up early the next day and went for a wonder round town.  I had previously mentioned to her that one shop had a sweet looking mancala set with a folding board, stones and a box that looked like a book.  We went to the shop so I could show her it and she bought it for me.  (I was going to buy one before but got my laser screwdriver instead.)  We then headed to another shop to buy a foam mattress topper for my bed (as Daphne was complaining that my mattress was lumpy).  We headed home with our purchases, picked up our Boro scarves and headed to the union to watch the Boro – Everton game (yes, brian, it is the one that was described as high school soccer)
We had talked about actually going to the match but tickets were too expensive so we did this instead.  It was quite a good game (even if Everton were lucky with the equaliser) and we had fun.  We went back to the house to sort the bed and break in the new mancala set and then ended up back in the union where the friends we were satwith while watching the game could still be found.  We had something to eat, a couple of drinks and then went home.
On Monday I had to go and sign on.  So I introduced Daphne to the delights of James Cook House (long time readers will no doubt remember some of my rants about that place).  After this was done we went to see my friend Emma so that Daphne could meet her daughter and give Emma the reading material she asked for from the States.  Daphne had also got a Winnie The Pooh marshmallow lollypop for Charlotte which was quickly desticked.  I also took the opportunity to return a book to Emma, lend her a couple more, get back a couple I had lent her and borrow a Christopher Brookmeyer book.  From there we went to the train station to get the tickets for the next day, the union for food and then to see my other friend Emma and her son, neither of whom I’d seen much of since I split up with Kat.  We spent about an hour there and were presented with a picture by Emaa’s son before we left.
We then went to Lindthorpe cemetary (last of the romantics, me) to visit Moses Carpenters grave  While there we noticed that some people had left coins for luck so we did likewise.  We then got the stuff for making spaghetti bolognaise and went home to eat and relax.
Tuesday we were up at stupid o clock to head to Edinburgh so Daphne could meet my parents.  We got to the train station in Edinburgh, hung around where we had arranged to meet my folks when all of a sudden there was a poke in my side and my mum was there.  We went to get something to eat then headed to the Royal Mile so Daphne could find a fudge shop she was obsessed with finding.  We stopped off at a few shops on the way and my mum and Daphne seemed to enter some sort of gift buying competition with each other.  Daphne also bought me a wooly hat with the saltire on it.  After we found the shop, we wondered round the national gallery and then it was picture taking time where everything went well up till the point where I dropped my mums camera and broke it.
We saw my mum and dad off to the bus station and then went hunting for dark chocolate Caramel Wafers for one of Daphne’s friends.  We eventually found some in a cafe that was selling them individually.  We went to the train station where I bought some cans of Tennants lager and then back to Boro.  We headed to the union for a quick drink and ended up playing Rock N Roll bingo.  After that we went for food and then home.
Wednesday was quite a chilled out day.  We were planning to get a tattoo (Scotland in Mandarin characters for me, America in Mandarin characters for her) as well as give Jemma some moral support for her first tattoo (musical notes on her shoulder blade) but the artist we like was away home ill.  So we made appointments for the Friday.  We then decided on taco’s for dinner and went to Sainsburys to buy the stuff.  While wondering around we discovered that they had packs of the wafers we spent ages looking for in Edinburgh.  GRRRR!
We ate our food and then went to the Union for kareoke.  I was slightly worried that it may not be on due to the England – Germany match but it was.  So she got to see me do The Time Warp.  Then I nearly got a hit for the way I sing Angels by Robbie Williams (and no, honey, I’m still not apologising for that :¬p).
Thursday was payday.  It was also the day that we finally made the trip through to Whitby we had been planning since August but never quite got round to.  We quickly found our way towards the Abbey and stopped en route for some food in a pub.  Then we tackled the steps up and wondered round the Abbey itself, which was cool.  Afterwards we tried two different types of mead, as Daphne was thinking about buying some as a present and then we headed back into town.  Wandered around for a bit, got some sweeties for the trip home and then we caught the train.
That night we met up with Kev and Nikki for a curry.  The meal was gorgeous as always and we had fun.  Daphne got a shock as I had forgotten to tell her that Kev had got his hair cut since she last saw him.  We were going to head to the pub for a quick drink afterwards but we were tired so away home to bed for the pair of us.
Friday was tattoo day.  We headed to the shop where Jemma met us (as she had a lecture beforehand).  My design was changed slightly from simplified Mandarin to traditional and Daphne’s was changed to Japanese.  Then it was Jemma’s turn.  She was terrified about getting it done so I let her hold my hand.  I then convinced her that the best way to get over her fear was to just get it done.  All three tattoos turned out well and we went to the pub for a quick drink and some food.  We then got a taxi to the shop so I could get the stuff to cook chilli.  
Stay tuned for the next installment of this.  Photo’s from the visit can be found on Daphne’s entry (Pics! to Lets go to Whitby!!!) and don’t forget I’m still looking for questions about my life in 2008 and hopes for 2009 for my NYD entry.

The Hokey Cokey is an old novelty song that has been sung in music halls, at children’s parties and at sherry-fuelled family gatherings for many years.

But according to the Catholic Church and some Scottish politicians, singing the popular tune that begins with the words “You put your right hand in, your right hand out,” may constitute an act of religious hatred.
A spokesman for the leader of the church in Scotland said the song had disturbing origins.
Critics claim that Puritans composed the song in the 18th century in an attempt to mock the actions and language of priests leading the Latin mass.
Now politicians have urged police to arrest anyone using the song to “taunt” Catholics under legislation designed to prevent incitement to religious hatred.
Supporters of Rangers FC have been banned from singing anti-Catholic songs at Ibrox stadium to taunt their rivals Celtic, a club with Catholic roots.
But fans of the club are said to be discussing on internet forums the possibility of getting round the ban by singing the Hokey Cokey at next week’s Old Firm derby between the clubs.
Peter Kearney, a spokesman for Cardinal Keith O’Brien, said:
“This song does have quite disturbing origins. Although apparently innocuous, it was devised as an attack on and a parody of the Catholic mass.
“If there are moves to restore its more malevolent meaning then consideration should perhaps be given to its wider use.”
According to the church, the song’s title derives from the words “hocus pocus”.
The phrase is said to be a Puritan parody of the Latin “hoc est enim corpus meum” or “this is my body” used by Catholic priests to accompany the transubstantiation during mass.
Several years ago, a canon from Wakefield Cathedral said the dance came from the days when priests celebrated mass with their backs to the congregation and whispered the Latin words of consecration with many hand movements.
Michael Matheson, the SNP MSP, said it was important that the police and football clubs were aware of the sinister background of the song and took action against groups who used it in matches.
But opposition politicians and football fans ridiculed the critics of the ditty. Murdo Fraser, deputy leader of the Scottish Tories, said: “I can’t believe Scottish children performing the Hokey Cokey are doing so in pursuit of any sort of anti-Catholic agenda.”
Barry McFarland, 26, a Rangers fan from Stirling, pointed out that Scotland fans sang a version of the song praising Diego Maradona’s so-called “hand of God” goal against England.
He said: “The Tartan Army sing ‘Diego put the English out, out out’. Does that make them sectarian? It is an absurd claim and a lot of utter nonsense that anyone would sing this in a bigoted way.”
Criticism of the Hokey Cokey follows a long-running row over the singing by some Rangers fans of the Famine Song, which refers to the famine that left one million dead in Ireland and led to mass migration in the mid-19th century.

And it may involve a bit of ranting and sweary type words.
I’ll start on the Friday, when I attended a writers event in Boro.  Having been warned that there may be an open mic slot, I took alonmg a story to read out (Justification, if anyone who has read it is wondering).  I sat at a table on my own and was joined by two guys from Glasgow, one of whom supported Rangers (and sarcastically thanked me for the fact that the Dons cost them the league title last year) and one who supports Man U.  We were later joined by a Sunderland fan which made for an interesting combination.
There was some stuff read from a book that was being launched and then we stopped for some surprisingly posh food.  Then there was the open mic spot.  My story went down well with everyone seeming to enjoy it.  There was a pause before people started applauding which is always a good sign in my view.  The rest of the people taking part were poets and it was quite good, apart from one which went on far, far too long and everyone at my table got bored with.  The last poem read out was an amusing little thing about excuses for not lending someone your England shirt.
Afterwards a few people came up to me and said how much they liked my story and how they couldn’t see the ending coming, except for one person which was a first for that story (those who have read it will understand.  I hope).  And I got a free anthology of short stories from the tees area.  All in all, it was a good night and I’m glad I’m now making contact with other writers in the area.
On Monday I decided that it was about time to get my train ticket home for the holidays.  I went to one website, for times and prices and put in that I would be traveling on the 18th of December.  Looked through all the times and prices and found one train that would cost me £13.  Perfect.  I was then taken to the National Express website to actually buy the tickets where, again, I specified Dec 18th.  Keep this in mind, it will become important later.
On Tuesday I went for a drink with a friend and dropped Data off with her, as she is tree sitting for me.  Then I found out something that pissed me off.
We had no heating in the house for a couple of weeks as first of all the gas payment meter was broken and then neither me or my housemate had money to put on the meter.  The landlord is supposed to put on £30 a month but he decided, as he had not recieved my housemates rent yet, that he wasn’t going to until he got that money.  So I’ve decided when I get back that I’m going to look for somewhere else to live, assumiong of course that I can find somewhere in Boro that will let me move in without a deposit.
Wednesday night was spent packing and then on Thursday I set off.  Got on the train to Darlington no problem.  At Darlington they had set up a temporary ticket barrier and so I had to show my ticket before leaving the station for a smoke.  I also had to show it on the way back in, at which point the person told me which platform I needed to be at.  Got on the train to Newcastle.  No problem.  Had a couple of smokes there and then got on the train to Aberdeen.
Sat down, powered up the laptop and started to watch WWE Armageddon.  I wasn’t the only one watching something on my laptop, I counted one person watching Iron Man and at least one watching The Dark Knight, leading me to dub our section of the train the coach of extraordinary superheroes.  But I was happy with my sports entertainment.
Phoned my dad from Stonehaven (the usual routine, by the time the train gets from there to Aberdeen my parents can get to the station.  Saves them having to hang round at the station if the train is delayed).  I then got off the train in Aberdeen and wenty to go through the ticket barrier.  Wouldn’t let me through.  Spoke to a guard about it.  Turns out that my ticket was for the day before.
So I had to speak to someone at the ticket counter.  Who insisted that I must have ordered my ticket for the Wednesday and therefore I had to pay for a new one.  In the end I had to give them my name and address so they can send me the bill.
so, it’s going to cost me £92 for a single ticket and a £10 admin fee on top of the £13 I paid for the ticket in the first place.
But I’ll tell you something.  If those dozy fucking cunts think that I am paying a penny fucking more for my ticket when something got fucked up on their end (including the fact that I didn’t receive a confirmation email, for fucks sake), especially after I put the right fucking date into two websites, including their own fucking one, they can fuck right off and while they are there I will be quite happy to use a nuclear missile to aid them in extracting their stupid, fucked up, zero fucking braincell containing head from their useless arses.
Apart from that, everything has been OK while I’ve been home.  I’ve had quite a good time.
Thus far from OD I have received one card from Scotland (with a monster), one from Norway (with some chocolate) and two from New Zealand.  Anyone else who has sent one, I’ll probably get it when i get back to Boro.  (That reminds me shesolovely, the chocolate you sent me has a story on the inside of the wrapper.  If I scan it in and email it to you, any chance you could translate it for me?  It’d be kinda cool to read it.)
I know that I still owe you a mega entry about Daphne’s entry.  Hopefully I’ll get that done over the next couple of days.
And finally.  Like last year, rather than doing one of those year end surveys that is flying about, I’m open to your questions about my life in 2008 and hopes for 2009 only.  Any questions not about that will be held over till my next regularly scheduled Q&A period.
Have at it.
Will

1002,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/lockerbie-bomb-anniversary-marked-3930046/,2008-12-20,Lockerbie bomb anniversary marked,"
Relatives of the 270 people killed in the Lockerbie bombing have been marking the 20th anniversary of the tragedy.
Pan Am Flight 103 was blown up over the town on 21 December 1988, claiming the lives of everyone on the plane and 11 local residents on the ground.
A number of “low key” ceremonies took place in the town, and another was held at London’s Heathrow Airport chapel.
A tribute was planned in the US at the Lockerbie memorial in the Arlington National Cemetery in Washington DC.
New York State’s Syracuse University, which lost 35 students in the bombing, also held a service.
Special “places to remember” were opened in Lockerbie, with a wreath-laying ceremony taking place at the Dryfesdale Cemetery.
In the evening services took place at both the Tundergarth and Dryfesdale Church.
A little after 1900 GMT the exact anniversary of the atrocity was remembered with a silence.
The Rev Sandy Stoddart told the congregation at Dryfesdale he had printed a list of the 270 people who died, on the order of service.
“But it is not a list of the victims, because we can never list all those names, he said.
“Nobody but God knows all the names on the list.”
He also spoke of the strong bonds that had been formed in the aftermath of the atrocity, including the creation of a scholarship programme at Syracuse University which sees two students from Lockerbie Academy study there each year.
Earlier, one of the commemorations was held in the Garden of Remembrance, which has been built on the area where the plane came down in Lockerbie.
The US consul in Edinburgh, Lisa Vickers, attended the ceremony.
She said: “There were 180 people that were American citizens on board that flight, 35 of them students at Syracuse University, and we still remember very much the events of that night 20 years ago.”
Relatives and some former employees of the Pan Am airline attended a private memorial at Heathrow Airport chapel led by the Rev John Mosey, whose daughter Helga died in the disaster.
For many who lived through it, the memories remain fresh despite the time which has passed.
George Stobbs, Lockerbie’s police inspector at the time, said he recalled the events of 20 years ago with great clarity.
“Nobody actually knew what had happened, we realised an aircraft had come down but I thought it was a military aircraft,” he said.
“Once I got into Sherwood Crescent I could see flames along the roadside, the footpaths were burst and there were gas pipes fractured – there were dancing flames coming up from them.
“Hedges were on fire, drop pipes on the side of houses were on fire and they were in turn climbing up and setting fire to the roofs.”
It was only later in the evening that the scale of the death toll at Lockerbie began to emerge.
The town has moved on in the intervening years, but Mr Kerr said it was right that it should mark a major anniversary.
Eyewitness Maxwell Kerr said: “You realise just how lucky we are to have had another 20 years of life.”
“These people who died – that was it snuffed out in one second. I think you have never to forget this, it is too big an event, it is too big a disaster.”
Paying tribute, First Minister Alex Salmond said: “I know that through the events being organised in Lockerbie, at Syracuse University, and at other locations in the UK and the US, that fitting tribute will be paid to those who so tragically lost their lives and those, in south of Scotland and beyond, whose lives have been affected by the atrocity.”
He added “I offer my support to all involved in marking the anniversary and, in particular, my condolences to those who will be mourning the loss of a loved one.”
Jim Murphy, Secretary of State for Scotland, said: “Our eternal sympathy goes out to all those who lost family members and friends and who to this day feel the dreadful effects of that terrible event.”
Former Libyan intelligence officer Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed Al Megrahi was found guilty of mass murder following a trial at Camp Zeist in the Netherlands in 2001.
Megrahi, who was recently diagnosed with terminal prostate cancer, has consistently denied responsibility for the bombing and a second appeal against his conviction will be heard by the courts next year.

I know that I still owe you lot a mega update from Daphne’s visit (and have actually started it, it’s currently saved as a private entry) but health issues and housing problems have prevented me from finishing it.  It will get done though.
In the meantime, have a stolen survey:
1. Did you ever have a great teacher – in school or out?
I didn’t have that many bad teachers to be honest (notable exceptions were the maths teacher who told my parents I intentionally forgot my calculator for my mock exam and the English teacher who got permisson to give me detention whenever he wanted with no notice [the rule was that we were supposed to get 24 hours warning]).  Most notable were:
Mr Gordon, my primary 6 teacher who applied to become manager of Aberdeen after Sir Alex Fergison left.
Mr Peaker my second year Biology and third and fourth year Chemistry teacher who grew a beard for the winter, shaved it off for the summer and conducted an experiment to make it sound like the school had blown up.
And Mr Johnstone my first and second year History teacher who had WW2 bombs all ofer the classroom and taught me how to drink lager properly on the exchange trip to Denmark.
2. What would you be learning if you had the time?
Creative writing.  Try to hone whatever skills I have.
3. What would you have learned to do if you knew then what you know now? (another language, for example)
I really don’t know.
4. What would you teach, if you were asked?
Not too sure about this one either.
5. Do you know any silly tricks?
I can pull a balloon inside out using my mouth.  And I can rub my head and pat my stomach.
6. If you could be an eyewitness to some event in history, which one?
I dunno.  I want to say something British but the only thing I can think of is Powell’s Rivers of Blood speech (not because I think he was right necessarily but because of the impact it had).  But it would probably be another speech King’s I Have A dream one.
7. If you could see anyplace in the world before human history, where would you go and why?
If I want to do something like this I wait till I get back to Aberdeen and take the dogs for a walk through Hazlehead woods.
8. Who would you like to see naked?
Only person that I would want to see naked I already have.
9. a)Who do you admire? b)Who admires you?
I admire anyone who tries to make a difference in some way.  I admire people who volunteer their time to work with kids in some capacity.  As a former Boys Brigade officer I know how hard it can occasionally be but I also know how rewarding it is.
I’m not sure who admires me.  I’m fairly certain that at least one of my friends does.
10. Answer an unasked question – something you know but nobody would ever ask about and you would never volunteer.
Yeah.  That’s not going to happen, to be honest.
11. Decisions of consequence: what forks in the road were on your Way – and what if you had taken the other path?
When me and my ex split up originally, we ended up back together.  Most of my heartache over the past ten and a half years stems from that.
12. Pick another time/place in modern history – since 1700 to live.
Britain in the 60’s.  I’ve always said that I was born a couple of decades too late.
13. What book, movie you’re read or seen more than once. Why?
Too many to count.  Seriously.
14. What ability or talent do you not have but would like to have?
I wish I could draw.
15. Have you ever thought about changing your appearance or identity? Did you do it?
I like pop’s answer to this one so I’ll just leave it:
Ive thought about it but I havent done it. I think that my personality is so quirky that if someone is still interested in my despite my looks then they might have a chance to connect with the important part of me.
16. If you were a spy, what would be your cover?
I wouldn’t actually want to be a spy.  I’d rather be the geek back at the base that the spy relies on for info.
17. What was the worst/best summer job you ever had?
I’ve only had one summer job, working in a dairy putting bottles of milk onto cages.  It was frakking freezing.
My favourite job was working at the cinema.  Most of the staff were around the same age and we just had a laugh when it wasn’t busy (I still remember helping make the jelly baby Star Wars display).
The worst one was the call centre.  Between annoying customers, stupid work rules, the company I was taking calls for asking me to be unprofessional and crap management it’s a surprise I lasted as long as I did.
18. If you knew how your life would end, but still could not change it, would you want to know?
Why?  Seriously, why would anyone actually want to know that, especially if you couldn’t actually do anything about it.
19. If you could live one short episode of your life over again, a day, a week, a month, which would it be and why?
None.  I don’t see the point.  The thing about the episodes and experiences in your life is to live them once, learn from them and grow as a person.
20. Do you remember your first love? Tell me about it.
That was probably Kelly.  I went out with her when I was 16 and she ended up moving to Surry while we were still dating.
21. Have you ever experienced the kindness of a stranger? How?
Yes.  From the notes that people leave on my diary to simple things like holding open a door for me.
22. Do you have have any bizarre thoughts?
Yup.

So, what’s been happening with me?
I’ve been running around for the past few days organising things for Daphne’s trip.  Just about finished, which is just as well, as she arrives on Friday.  Yay!
That reminds me, must email my mum and let her know what time we’re arriving in Edinburgh.  Yup, that’s right, Daphne will be meeting my mother.  (And my father if he’s still not working then.)  I’ll also ask her when she’s going to email me the pictures from the award ceremony.  Which I’ll post about once I have the pics.
Last Tuesday was a fun day.  For a couple of weeks now I’ve been permanently tired and had next to no energy.  So I finally plucked up the courage to go see the doctor.  The appointment was at 8:40 which, when you consider why I wanted to see him, didn’t exactly please me.  I told him what was wrong, he asked a few questions and then got me to make an appointment to get some blood taken for tests.  The appointment, as it turns out, was for the next day.  They took three samples and I go back tomorrow for the results.  Fingers crossed.
I then came here to the lrc to mess about online, talk to Daphne and look for work.  Then I headed out to a local cinema for a free screening of W.
Verdict?  It’s a good film.  Very even handed (it almost made me feel sorrt for the son of a bitch.  ALMOST).  The performances were good and go to show that you don’t need lookalikes to make a biographical film.  And don’t be surprised to see Josh Brolin nominated for a Best Actor Oscar.  He nailed Bush’s mannerisms, speach and facial ticks perfectly.
Then, after getting slightly lost, I went round to a friends house for the election results.  Sadly, my friend didn’t drop his trousers (as he said he would do if either Texas or Alabama (I think) turned blue.  Sent a few texts to Daphne, spoke to her a few times and got pissed off with John Boulton
Seriously, what the hell were the BBC thinking?  He didn’t let anyone else complete an answer or a point, unless it was supporting the Republicans, and complained, on air, that the BBC were biased and had been for years.
Then, finally, at 4am GMT, it was announced that Obama had won.  And me and my friends went ballistic.  We watched McCains concession speach then, the greatest interview ever.  Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Gore Vidal Vs David Dimbleby:
Then Obama spoke.  He spoke with the clarity and vision I have seen from him before (most notably in his acceptance speech) and proved why he was the right choice.
Couple more election things:
There is a lot of talk about what the Republican party should do now with a lot saying they should go back to their conservative roots.  Not sure about that, but what they need to do is learn from Obama and energise the youth of today.  At the moment it is a vicious cycle with young people being seen as lazy and politically apathetic, so no attempt is made to engage and energise them.  Therefore, young people don’t see the point in bothering with elections as no-one is speaking to them.  Hopefully Obama’s campaign has proven that if you do engage with them, if you do energise them, they will be more than happy and get involved.  And they might teach their elders a thing or two.  (BTW: this is a lesson that the British parties need to learn as well.)
And then there is this.  Newsweek got backstage with the Obama, Clinton and McCain campaigns on the understanding that everything was embargoed until after the election.  This is the result.
Finally got to sleep at 6 and then got up to go get the blood taken.
And I think that’s us pretty much up to date.
Good luck to all my fave’s taking part in NaNoWriMo (was hoping to do it myself, but the only thing I want to work on I’ve started already (and just emailed another political party about, seeing as Labour never bothered with a response), my laaptop adapter is still playing up and with Daphne here I wouldn’t have had the time) and NaNoJoMo (again, with Daphne here I won’t be online every day this month).
And finally:

33 miles per gallon

*EDIT*
So, i went to the doctors today and the blood tests came back fine.  But he did hear a noise in the bottom of my right lung.  So, I’m currently on antibiotics for an infection.
In the meantime, I really, really hope this is a joke

Everyone knows the undead don’t run – so how come they were sprinting about in Charlie Brooker’s recent TV drama? Simon Pegg argues for a return to traditional zombie values
As an avid horror fan, I found the prospect of last week’s five-night TV zombie spectacular rather exciting. Admittedly, the trailer for E4’s Dead Set made me somewhat uneasy. The sight of newsreader Krishnan Guru-Murthy warning the populace of an impending zombie apocalypse induced a sickening sense of indignation. Only five years previously, Edgar Wright and I had hired Krishnan to do the very same thing in our own zombie opus, Shaun of the Dead. It was a bit like seeing an ex-lover walking down the street pushing a pram. Of course, this was a knee-jerk reaction. It’s not as if Edgar and I hadn’t already pushed someone else’s baby up the cultural high street – but that, to some extent, was the point. In Shaun of the Dead, we lifted the mythology established by George A Romero in his 1968 film Night of the Living Dead and offset it against the conventions of a romantic comedy.
Still, I had to acknowledge Dead Set’s impressive credentials. The concept was clever in its simplicity: a full-scale zombie outbreak coincides with a Big Brother eviction night, leaving the Big Brother house as the last refuge for the survivors. Scripted by Charlie Brooker, a writer whose scalpel-sharp incisiveness I have long been a fan of, and featuring talented actors such as Jaime Winstone and the outstanding Kevin Eldon, the show heralded the arrival of genuine homegrown horror, scratching at the fringes of network television. My expectations were high, and I sat down to watch a show that proved smart, inventive and enjoyable, but for one key detail: ZOMBIES DON’T RUN!
I know it is absurd to debate the rules of a reality that does not exist, but this genuinely irks me. You cannot kill a vampire with an MDF stake; werewolves can’t fly; zombies do not run. It’s a misconception, a bastardisation that diminishes a classic movie monster. The best phantasmagoria uses reality to render the inconceivable conceivable. The speedy zombie seems implausible to me, even within the fantastic realm it inhabits. A biological agent, I’ll buy. Some sort of super-virus? Sure, why not. But death? Death is a disability, not a superpower. It’s hard to run with a cold, let alone the most debilitating malady of them all.
More significantly, the fast zombie is bereft of poetic subtlety. As monsters from the id, zombies win out over vampires and werewolves when it comes to the title of Most Potent Metaphorical Monster. Where their pointy-toothed cousins are all about sex and bestial savagery, the zombie trumps all by personifying our deepest fear: death. Zombies are our destiny writ large. Slow and steady in their approach, weak, clumsy, often absurd, the zombie relentlessly closes in, unstoppable, intractable.
However (and herein lies the sublime artfulness of the slow zombie), their ineptitude actually makes them avoidable, at least for a while. If you’re careful, if you keep your wits about you, you can stave them off, even outstrip them – much as we strive to outstrip death. Drink less, cut out red meat, exercise, practice safe sex; these are our shotguns, our cricket bats, our farmhouses, our shopping malls. However, none of these things fully insulates us from the creeping dread that something so witless, so elemental may yet catch us unawares – the drunk driver, the cancer sleeping in the double helix, the legless ghoul dragging itself through the darkness towards our ankles.
Another thing: speed simplifies the zombie, clarifying the threat and reducing any response to an emotional reflex. It’s the difference between someone shouting “Boo!” and hearing the sound of the floorboards creaking in an upstairs room: a quick thrill at the expense of a more profound sense of dread. The absence of rage or aggression in slow zombies makes them oddly sympathetic, a detail that enabled Romero to project depth on to their blankness, to create tragic anti-heroes; his were figures to be pitied, empathised with, even rooted for. The moment they appear angry or petulant, the second they emit furious velociraptor screeches (as opposed to the correct mournful moans of longing), they cease to possess any ambiguity. They are simply mean.
So how did this break with convention come about? The process has unfolded with all the infuriating dramatic irony of an episode of Fawlty Towers. To begin at the beginning, Haitian folklore tells of voodoo shamans, or bokors, who would use digitalis, derived from the foxglove plant, to induce somnambulant trances in individuals who would subsequently appear dead. Weeks later, relatives of the supposedly deceased would witness their lost loved ones in a soporific malaise, working in the fields of wealthy landowners, and assume them to be nzambi (a west African word for “spirit of the dead”). From the combination of nzambi and somnambulist (“sleepwalker”) we get the word zombie.
The legend was appropriated by the film industry, and for 20 or 30 years a steady flow of voodoo-based cinema emerged from the Hollywood horror factory. Then a young filmmaker from Pittsburgh by the name of George A Romero changed everything. Romero’s fascination with Richard Matheson’s novel I Am Legend, the story of a lone survivor struggling in a world overrun by vampires, led him to fixate on an aspect of the story leapfrogged by the author: namely, the process by which humanity is subjugated by the aggressive new species. Romero adopted the Haitian zombie and combined it with notions of cannibalism, as well as the viral communicability characterised by the vampire and werewolf myths, and so created the modern zombie.
After three films spanning three decades, and much imitation from film-makers such as Lucio Fulci and Dan O’Bannon, the credibility of the zombie was dealt a cruel blow by the king of pop. Michael Jackson’s Thriller video, directed by John Landis, was entertaining but made it rather difficult for us to take zombies seriously, having witnessed them body-popping. The blushing dead went quiet for a while, until the Japanese video game company Capcom developed the game Resident Evil, which brilliantly captured the spirit of Romero’s shambling antagonists (Romero even directed a trailer for the second installment). Slow and steady, the zombie commenced its stumble back into our collective subconscious.
Inspired by the game and a shared love of Romero, Edgar Wright and I decided to create our own black comedy. Meanwhile, Danny Boyle and Alex Garland were developing their own end-of-the-world fable, 28 Days Later, an excellent film misconstrued by the media as a zombie flick. Boyle and Garland never set out to make a zombie film per se. They drew instead on John Wyndham’s Day of the Triffids, as well as Matheson and Romero’s work, to fashion a new strain of survival horror, featuring a London beset by rabid propagators of a virus known as “rage”.
The success of the movie, particularly in the US, was undoubtedly a factor in the loose remake of Romero’s Dawn of the Dead in 2004. Zack Snyder’s effective but pointless reboot parlayed Boyle’s “infected” into the upgraded zombie 2.0, likely at the behest of some cigar-chomping, focus-group-happy movie exec desperate to satisfy the MTV generation’s demand for quicker everything – quicker food, quicker downloads, quicker dead people. The zombie was ushered on to the mainstream stage, on the proviso that it sprinted up to the mic. The genre was diminished, and I think it’s a shame.
Despite my purist griping, I liked Dead Set a lot. It had solid performances, imaginative direction, good gore and the kind of inventive writing and verbal playfulness we’ve come to expect from the always brilliant Brooker. As a satire, it took pleasing chunks out of media bumptiousness and, more significantly, the aggressive collectivism demonstrated by the lost souls who waste their Friday nights standing outside the Big Brother house, baying for the blood of those inside. Like Romero, Brooker simply nudges the metaphor to its literal conclusion, and spatters his point across our screens in blood and brains and bits of skull. If he had only eschewed the zeitgeist and embraced the docile, creeping weirdness that has served to embed the zombie so deeply in our grey matter, Dead Set might have been my favourite piece of television ever. As it was, I had to settle for it merely being bloody good.

BBC News
It’s hard to imagine too many similarities between the cerebral game of chess and the bone-juddering discipline of boxing and yet there is a new sport that melds the two.
When you think of chess players, you probably think of tangle-haired geniuses, reclusive Russians, and the boys at school who were too delicate to play in the yard.
You probably don’t think of bulging biceps, iron jaws and sweat flying. That’s why the mere mention of chessboxing causes so many raised eyebrows.
It’s a mixture of chess and boxing – one round of chess is followed by a round of boxing and so on until the winner is declared by knockout, checkmate or points victory.
The sport, brought into reality in 2003 by a Dutch performance artist inspired by a French comic, came to the UK in April and has its headquarters at a boxing gym in north London. On the continent, the sport’s epicentres are in Amsterdam and Berlin.
Some might assume that boxers lack the cerebral skills required for the game of kings, while a single punch would knock a chess player’s glasses clean off his head?
But tactical thinking, stamina and quickfire responses are vital for both sports. The two best heavyweights of recent years are both keen chess players. Lennox Lewis played chess in breaks in training and is a supporter of chess tuition for children. Vitali Klitschko once said: “Chess is similar to boxing. You need to develop a strategy, and you need to think two or three steps ahead about what your opponent is doing. You have to be smart.”
But for most non-boxing, non-chess fans, the links are esoteric.
“It’s a devilish combination,” the sport’s Dutch inventor Iepe Rubingh tells a crowd of shaven-headed East End geezers and wild-haired cool kids at Bethnal Green Working Men’s Club, east London.
He has come to see the latest instalment in chessboxing’s rise in popularity – a UK international bout.
A large chessboard sits in the middle of a boxing ring beneath the club’s dusty glitter ball.
As paramedics wait behind the ring and a rockabilly DJ plays 80s electro music to the sold-out venue, there is a palpable sense of uncertainty and menace.
It lifts when the first fighters take to the stage, with a compere whipping the crowd into a frenzy and a traditional glamorous lady circling the ring with a sign declaring “Round One”. The boxers then sit down and play chess. A bout of chessboxing stretches to 11 rounds – six of chess (four minutes each) and five of boxing (three minutes each).
Event promoter Tim Woolgar has put his money where his mouth is by taking part in the first bout. Unfortunately he is up against Konrad Rikardson from Sweden, a confident chess player and even more confident boxer.
As their chess moves are tracked on a giant computer screen, a commentator guides us through the game and evaluates the players’ tactics.
A blokey cheer erupts whenever a piece is taken, but the boxers wear headphones to block out the noise. We are told they pump out Eric Clapton songs all night to increase the players’ aggression.
“Go on – ‘ave him!” shouts someone in the audience after a particularly good move. “Bash his bishop!”, another yells, while the commentator sagely notes: “It’s a pawn storm.”
Minutes later the mood darkens as the board is moved aside, gloves and gum shields are put on and the boxing begins.
As the pair bob around the ring ducking and weaving, jabbing and defending, it becomes clear that they are deadly serious about their sport.
Woolgar takes one head blow after another yet minutes later returns to drip sweat over the chessboard.
He defends himself admirably but suffers a further physical pounding before Rikardson snatches his queen. The crowd goes wild.
Two further fights take place including a match between Bob “The Red Kite” Innes and Jay Mortimer, who prove to be fierce in the ring but not so confident at the chessboard. The Red Kite soon falls to the floor.
The headline fight is an impressive grudge match between Germany’s Wolfram von Stauffenberg (white pieces) and Andy Costello from Exeter (black pieces).
It is clear why they are hailed as chessboxing champions as their rapid, shrewd chess playing is matched only by the vicious ferocity of their boxing.
As the pair tussle in the ring, half the crowd is baying for blood while the remainder winces as blows connect. In a surprising twist, the audience is unanimous in its enthusiasm for their chess playing.
As Costello took the checkmate it seemed Von Stauffenberg had a narrow escape.
After the tournament, Woolgar has recovered enough to explain the pain and pleasure of chessboxing. “I took an almighty pounding. I have a sense that it didn’t do me any good.”
Chess Boxing has already proved popular in Germany
Nevertheless he is undaunted in his enthusiasm for the hybrid sport, adamant that chessboxing has an “instant appeal” that wins over “a cross section of the community”.
He now wants to encourage more young people to take it up and is aiming for it to be recognised as an Olympic sport.
“We’re being realistic about it, so we’re not going for 2012 or even 2016,” he said. “But by 2020 we want chessboxing to be up there with the other professional sports.”
If its popularity continues to grow, chessboxing might just make it.

Two men – one dressed as a cow and the other as a horse – were involved a fight among a group of people which left one man requiring treatment.
Police described the incident near the Farmers Showfield in Nairn, in the Highlands, as a “serious altercation”.
Northern Constabulary said at one stage the fight spilled on to the A96 road and disrupted the flow of traffic.
One man was detained in hospital overnight following the incident, which happened early on Saturday morning.
Straw hat
Police said: “Two of the men were in fancy dress outfits.
“One was dressed as a cow wearing a brown hat and the other as a horse wearing a straw hat. Both of these men are described as stocky/heavily built.
“As a result of this incident, one man was conveyed to Raigmore Hospital where he was detained overnight. His injuries are not life-threatening.”
Northern Constabulary is appealing for witnesses.

1015,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/david-tennant-quits-as-doctor-who-3930009/,2008-10-28,David Tennant quits as Doctor Who,"
David Tennant is to stand down as Doctor Who, after becoming one of the most popular Time Lords in the history of the BBC science fiction show.
Tennant stepped into the Tardis in 2005, and will leave the role after four special episodes are broadcast next year.
He made the announcement after winning the outstanding drama performance prize at the National Television Awards.
“When Doctor Who returns in 2010 it won’t be with me,” he said.
“Now don’t make me cry,” he added. “I love this part, and I love this show so much that if I don’t take a deep breath and move on now I never will, and you’ll be wheeling me out of the Tardis in my bath chair.”
‘I’ll miss it’
Three years was “about the right time” to play the role, he told the BBC in an exclusive interview.
“I think it’s better to go when there’s a chance that people might miss you, rather than to hang around and outstay your welcome,” he said.
His stint in the show had been “the most extraordinary time, it’s been bewildering, life changing, very exciting”, he said.
“And just so much fun, such a great show to work on.
“That’s one of the reasons I think it’s right to take a deep breath and bow out when it’s still fun, when it’s a novelty.
“I don’t ever want it to feel like a job, so I want to move on when it still feels exciting and fresh and that means I’ll miss it.”
Drama award
Tennant, the 10th actor to play the Doctor Who, left fans guessing about his return at the end of the latest series.
In the last episode, in July, the Doctor had to defeat his enemies the Daleks to save the universe.
Almost 10 million people watched as the Time Lord apparently started the process of regeneration – but did not complete it.
Tennant will appear in a Christmas special, titled The Next Doctor, before filming four more specials in January.
“They’ll be the four last stories that I do,” he said.
In a sign of his popularity, he was voted best drama performer in a public vote at the National Television Awards.
He has been named most popular actor at the same ceremony for the past two years. That prize has been discontinued this year.
An average of 8.1 million people a week watched the latest series – the fourth since it made a comeback in 2005 – in its Saturday evening slot on BBC One.
‘Spectacular’ exit
Russell T Davies, executive producer, said: “I’ve been lucky and honoured to work with David over the past few years – and it’s not over yet, the Tenth Doctor still has five spectacular hours left!
“After which, I might drop an anvil on his head. Or maybe a piano. A radioactive piano. But we’re planning the most enormous and spectacular ending, so keep watching.”
A fifth series of the show is scheduled for 2010.
Tennant replaced Christopher Eccleston, who resurrected the show after a 16-year break.
Tennant made his name in TV dramas such as Blackpool and Casanova.
He started his career in theatre and in recent months has returned to the stage with well-received performances in Hamlet and Love’s Labour’s Lost for the Royal Shakespeare Company.
In December last year, Tennant denied rumours that he was planning to quit after Catherine Tate – his new companion in the Tardis – told the Jonathan Ross radio show she thought the next series of Doctor Who would be Tennant’s last.
He said at the time: “Catherine Tate stitched me up good and proper. She goes on Jonathan Ross and makes up a load of old nonsense.”

Damn.  I’ll miss him, he was brilliant in the role.  But at least this gives Moffat a complete clean slate when he takes over.

…for doing wrong.
So, this would be about Monday night then.
I had an interesting day on Monday.  I finally got the solution to not one but two technical problems I’ve been having recently (which I’ll write about later), and life was pretty good.
Then I got a phone call from my friend Nikki.  Now, the two of us used to do the quiz at the union every other week when we had the money.  She’s started French classes so we can’t anymore.
Anyhoo, she wasn’t going to class this week as she had been away to visit fer fiance’s mother.  So she asked if I wanted to do the quiz as we hadn’t done so this academic year and she didn’t know when the next time we would be able to do so is.  I said sure and met her in the union.
Everything was going fine and we had been joined by another friend Stuart.  Then Daphne phoned me and told me about her huge phone bill.  We got into a bit of an argument about that and I pointed out that I was out with Nikki as I probably wouldn’t see her again until Daphne came over here.  (Me and Nikki get ‘paid’ on the same day and usually go out for a few drinks then.  The next time we get paid is the week before Daphne gets here, so I won’t be going out then so I can save my money.)  This resulted in me hanging up on Daphne.
Then Stuart dragged me to one side to talk to me about Jemma, a mutual friend.  Jemma was feeling down at the weekend and did something stupid.  I found out when she texted me and tild me.  Daphne found out cos I was speaking to her on MSN at the time and I told her (Jemma and Daphne met when Daphne was over in August).  Stuart found out through Jemma.  He was pissed that she didn’t text him herself.  But, not being able to be too angry at her, he took it out on me.  Which I can understand.
The thing that was depressing Jemma was something she needed some advice from a female about.  Her only friends (as far as she is concerned anyway) in Boro is me and Stuart.  So I decided to ask Nikki if she could get closer to Jemma.  That upset Nikki as she already thought that her and Jemma were close.  I then told Nikki about what happened at the weekend, and she was then upset that I asked her for a specific reason.  (Which, in truth, I did.  Just not the one that Nikki thinks it is.  Both her and Jemma have a lot of male friends but not many female friends.  I thought it would be good for both of them.)
Then Stuart kept asking why Jemma didn’t tell him.  Little backstory here: Stuart fancies Jemma.  Even Stevie Wonder could see that Stuart fancies Jemma.  This scared her to the point that I kept being asked to meet up with them to help her out.  So I point out that he is scaring her a bit and needs to back off.  He then wondered how she would know how he feels about her (he’s only young and has little experience with women).  I pointed out that she knows but it’s never going to happen if he keeps up like this and to just be a friend to her.
(Little postscript to this story: I’ve just got a text from Jemma saying that her and Stu are going to make a go of it.)
So now Stuart is pissed off with me again for telling him this.  Then Daphne phones back and I manage to calm her down about what happened before.  Then she phones back again to tell me she’s thinking about going out for a few drinks with someone and do I mind?  I say no and then have to cut the call short as I’m literally about to be thrown out the building.
So, during the night, I manage to piss of Daphne at least once, upset Nikki twice, upset Stuart twice and possibly upset Jemma (I’m not entirely sure).  All in the process of trying to be a good friend.  It’s times like this that I wish I never bothered.
Then, just to cap everything off, I manage to break my terracotta warrior at some point during the night.

1017,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/theme-and-tracker-3930006/,2008-10-25,Theme and tracker,"
This week marks the tenth anniversary of Open Diary. Tell us about your OD experience – how long you’ve been here and how your life may be different because of OD.
I have been on OD since early 2001.  My life is different thanks to OD because I have met many people here that I consider to be friends.  Admittedly I havent met many of you, but I do still consider you to be friends.  You have got me through things like being homeless and finding out what my daughter looks like and what her name is.
Not to mention that if it wasnt for OD, I would not have met my incredibly cute and amazing fiancé Daphne.
If not for the support I have received from the OD community, I would not have done any of the courses I have done over the past few years.  I would not have posted any of my stories online.  And some of you have even been brave enough to proof read stuff I have written (you know who you are, and I thank you).
It was while preparing to write this entry that I remembered something that I wrote back in April last year for a diary a favourite had set up.  I could link to the entry in question but instead Ill re-post it here:
*lights up cigarette*
It all started on April 9th 2000. I was in the university library, supposedly working on some assignment or other. So, of course, I was doing nothing of the sort.
I was messing about online. I tried looking up bored.com, just to see what happened, then looked through the links it provided. And there was one for something called open diary. I clicked on it.
I was taken to a site that hosted online diaries. I looked through a few and thought “I’ll sign up.”
That was the start.
I wrote a few entries and got some readers. I started reading their diaries and pretty soon I actually had a favourites list.
But I still thought I had it under control.
*stubs out cigarette and lights another*
Then the surveys started. And then I discovered the different circles the site had to offer. Then the interactive entries. The Peoples Interview, to celebrate every 100 entries. The Quote Comp. The Trivia Comp. Interactive Create-A-Surveys.
But I still thought, it’s not a problem.
Pretty soon, the site was amongst the first I would check every day. Not long after that, it did become the first. I started a host of different diaries, for different things. Still, I convinced myself I wasn’t hooked.
I tried different diary sites. I even tried starting my own blog. But OD, like the sirens on Odysseus, kept luring me back.
Still, I convinced myself that I did not have a problem. Sure, there were some things I’d rather talk/ask advice about here than ask a real life friend, but that’s only natural, isn’t it?
Then I was left with on internet access for a while. Didn’t mind not being able to check my email. It was not being able to check OD. Check my notes, read entries made by my favourites.
That’s when I realised it had happened.
My name is William Forbes, and I’m an ODaholic.
But you know what?
*stubs out cigarette*
If being an ODaholic is wrong, I don’t want to be right

And finally.
I’ve been planning to post the results of my tracker survey at some point and this seemed like the perfect entry in which to do so.
A few notes:
1) I wasn’t sure how to do this.  I would have liked a spidergram or flowchart, but I don’t have the ability to do so.  Anyone else want to attempt that, feel free and let me know.
2) I know the table is in 4 sections.  It was the only way I was able to get it from word to here.
3) Key:
[r] means that the person taking the survey found it on random,
(fp) means that the person taking the survey found it on the front page,
anon means that the person who left me the note didn’t sign it.
4) I know that calling the last column given to is unelegant but I really couldn’t find another way to put it.
5) If there are people on your faves list that you think might want to see the results, let them know.
And here we go:




And finally:
HAPPY BIRTHDAY OD!
(I know I’m about a week late but I can has birfday cake?)

1018,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/quiz-answers-12-3930005/,2008-10-20,Quiz answers,"
So, a few entries ago I posted the questions and choices for the quiz about me I created and gave everyone the chance to answer them.  Two people took me up on the offer.  The first was Kaly who has been reading my diary for less than a year and the other was Rodge who, by his own estimation, has been reading me about 5 years.  so, the newbie versus the old timer.  Let’s see who knows me best.
I’ll repost the question and the possible answers.  I’ll then post Kaly’s guess, then Rodge’s, then the actual answer.  So, here we go:

Scores: Kaly 3; Rodge 0
5) Which political party does Will support?
a)Labour
b)Liberal Democrat’s
c)Conservative
d)Monster Raving Looney Giant Green Party
Kaly: 5) Ha ha ha ha ha ha! D, no, A

But HDM (the main books in the series) is the only one I have two copies of each.  I got them on paperback and then bought the 10th anniversary hardbacks when they were released a few years ago.
Scores: Kaly 4; Rodge 4
10) Who does Will describe as his Doctor and assistant?
a)Christopher Ecclestone/Billie Piper
b)Tom Baker/Elisabeth Sladen
c)Sylvester McCoy/Sophie Aldred
d)David Tennant/Freema Agyeman
Kaly: 10) C because I’m a bigger Tom Baker fan.
Rodge: d
Answer: C.  I did like Ecclestone/Piper, haven’t seen much of the Baker years (though I have since seen Sladen in NuWho) and D is my favourite combination from NuWho.  But it will always be McCoy/Aldred for me.  And if anyone doesn’t think Ace is cool remember she once took out a Dalek with a baseball bat.
Final Score: Kaly 5; Rodge 4.
So it was a close run thing, but the new person to my diary did better than the person who’s been reading me for years.  However Rodge did guess how many he’d got right.
And there you go.  Don’t forget, I’m still doing this:

…£8000 newsagent robbery
Oct 20 2008 By Fariha Karim
A PAIR of pensioners are being hunted after they robbed a newsagent of more than £8000.
In a scene worthy of BBC comedy Still Game, two OAPs took the shop’s takings while a third elderly man, who may have been an accomplice, distracted a shop assistant.
The OAPs struck on Thursday afternoon while the woman worked alone in the shop in Glasgow’s west end.
It wasn’t until CCTV tapes were played back that staff realised they’d been robbed.
The female worker, who asked not to be named, said one elderly man came in and asked for help while two more OAPs helped themselves to the takings, utilities cards and phone cards underneath the till.
The 57-year-old woman was left badly shaken but unhurt after the incident.
She said: “When I saw on the tape that they were pensioners – that really surprised me. I just couldn’t believe it.”
The woman told how one first came in and asked for light bulbs, which were at the back of the shop.
She helped him find them and he then asked for several more.
The woman only realised that the takings had gone missing after they had all left.
She said: “The first man went to pay for the bulbs, then said, ‘Don’t bother with the change, put it into the charity box’.
“Then he left and afterwards, I realised everything was gone.”
Mamun-ur-Rashid, owner of the News and Views shop on Byres Road, added: “When I heard what had happened, I thought it would be youngsters. But then I saw from the pictures they were old pensioners.
“They are vagabond pensioners.
From looking at the pictures, it’s a very well-planned thing to have done.
“They took more than £8000. I’m so surprised guys of this maturity would do this.”
A police spokeswoman said: “The men entered the premises and managed to distract a female shop worker.
“They made off with a quantity of cash and other items.”
However, the spokeswoman could not confirm if they were looking for three suspects named Jack, Victor and Winston.

I dunno.  Between this and running a benefits scam I want to know what has got into pensioners in Britain nowadays.

1020,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/jamaica-puzzled-by-theft-of-beach-3930003/,2008-10-18,Jamaica puzzled by theft of beach,"
By Nick Davis
BBC News, Ocho Rios, Jamaica
Police in Jamaica are investigating the suspected theft of hundreds of tons of sand from a beach on the island’s north coast.
It was discovered in July that 500 truck-loads had been removed outside a planned resort at Coral Spring beach.
Detectives say people in the tourism sector could be suspects, because a good beach is seen as a valuable asset to hotels on the Caribbean island.
But a lack of arrests made since July have led to criticism of the police.
‘Complex investigation’
The beach at Coral Springs, in Jamaica’s northern parish of Trelawny, was 400 metres (1,300ft) of white sand. The 0.5-hectare strand was to form part a resort complex costing US$108m, but the theft of its most important feature has led to its developers putting their plans on hold.
Illegal sand mining is a problem in Jamaica; the tradition of people building their own homes here means there is a huge demand for the construction material. However, the large volume and the type of sand taken made suspicion point towards the hotel industry.
	There is some suspicion that some police were in collusion with the movers of the sand
Mark Shields
Deputy Commissioner of Police
The disappearance was deemed so important that the Prime Minister, Bruce Golding, also took an interest in the theft and ordered a report into how 500 truckloads of sand was stolen, transported and presumably sold.
Three months on, and with no arrests or charges in the case, the main opposition People’s National Party have suggested that some people now think there has been a cover up.
But the deputy commissioner for crime at the Jamaica Constabulary Force, Mark Shields, insisted this was not an open-and-shut case.
“It’s a very complex investigation because it involves so many aspects,” he told the BBC.
“You’ve got the receivers of the stolen sand, or what we believe to be the sand. The trucks themselves, the organisers and, of course, there is some suspicion that some police were in collusion with the movers of the sand.”
Police said they were carrying out forensic tests on beaches along the coast to see if any of it matches the stolen sand.

Yoinked from CookieBurglar:
CookieBurglar’s Survey for Bored Bookworms
1. Name the book that made you laugh the most.
Any Bill Bryson book can generally get me giggling.  Terry Pratchett tends to do the same as well.  And the Harry Potter books can be quite humerous at times as well.  But I’d have to say The Hitchhhikers Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams (any of the 5) are the one’s that made me consistantly laugh.
2. Name the book that made you think the most.
I’ve read a lot of non fiction so there are quite a few here.  How Mumbo Jumbo Conquered The World was good (and gave me an idea for the novel I’m working on at the moment).  No Logo by Naoni Klein did so as well.  But Fast Food Nation is the only one to make me change my habits so I’ll have to go with that one.
3. Name the book that made you cry the most.
I I’ve never actually cried while reading a book, so pass.
4. Name the book you found the most scary.
Fast Food Nation again.  More, Now, Again by Elizabeth Wurtzel by showing how easy it is to get addicted to a supposedly non addictive drug.  1984 and A Clockwork Orange (the former for the way it ends, the latter for what the main character is put through).
5. Have you ever read a book that you hated so much you couldn’t finish it?
Sabriel by Gareth Nix was recommended to me by an ex.  I started reading it and just completely lost the will to carry on.  Same with Lionboy.  I now know the reason they were giving it away with copies of one of the HP books.
6. Ever read any Shakespeare for fun?
Actually, yes.
7. Make a choice: Lord of the Rings, or Harry Potter?
If I have to choose between the two of them, it’d have to be Harry Potter.  The LOTR books are good but need serious editing.  Seriously, how many pages describing trees or plants?  Whereas there is very little filler in the HP books.  My personal choice isn’t here though, and that’s the His Dark Materials books.  While both HP and LOTR are good, HDM is in a class above.  Ambitious plot and brilliant characterisation.  It’s too bad it got caught up in the HP storm.
8. How many books do you read a month, on average?
God.  Can be anywhere from 3 – a lot.  Depends on what I’m doing.  (As a reference, whenever I leave the house I’ll generally have a book of some description with me.)
9. Got any books you’ve been meaning to read but haven’t got around to yet?
Loads.  I have a terrible habit of buying books that are considered classics and never reading them.  I also have a bad habit of buying books either a) by authors people have recommended or b) cos they have a funky name (anyone seriously expect me not to buy a book called A Handbook For Visitors From Outer Space?)  It’s so bad that one of my ex housemates tried to ban me from buying books till I’d read all the ones I had.  It didn’t work.
10. What are you reading right now?
I’m currently re-reading the aforementioned Fast Food Nation, which is still a good book (though I’d kinda like Schlosser to write a follow up, showing how things have changed (or not) in the intervening years.)  Before that it was The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo by Stieg Larsson which I highly, highly recommend.
A couple more things before I go.

1024,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/internet-use-good-for-the-brain-3929999/,2008-10-13,Internet use ‘good for the brain’,"
For middle aged and older people at least, using the internet helps boost brain power, research suggests.
A University of California Los Angeles team found searching the web stimulates centres in the brain that control decision-making and complex reasoning.
The researchers say this might even help to counter-act the age-related physiological changes that cause the brain to slow down.
The study features in the American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry.
As the brain ages, a number of changes occur, including shrinkage and reductions in cell activity, which can impact on performance.
It has long been thought that activities which keep the brain active, such as crossword puzzles, may help minimise the impact – and the latest study suggests that surfing the web can be added to the list.
Lead researcher Professor Gary Small said: “The study results are encouraging, that emerging computerized technologies may have physiological effects and potential benefits for middle-aged and older adults.
“Internet searching engages complicated brain activity, which may help exercise and improve brain function.”
The latest study was based on 24 volunteers aged between 55 and 76. Half were experienced internet users, the rest were not.
Compared with reading
Each volunteer underwent a brain scan while performing web searches and book-reading tasks.
Both types of task produced evidence of significant activity in regions of the brain controlling language, reading, memory and visual abilities.
However, the web search task produced significant additional activity in separate areas of the brain which control decision-making and complex reasoning – but only in those who were experienced web users.
The researchers said that compared with simple reading, the internet’s wealth of choices requires that people make decisions about what to click on in order to get the relevant information.
However, they suggested that newcomers to the web had not quite grasped the strategies needed to successfully carry out a web search.
Professor Smith said: “A simple, everyday task like searching the web appears to enhance brain circuitry in older adults, demonstrating that our brains are sensitive and can continue to learn as we grow older.”
Rebecca Wood, chief executive of the Alzheimer’s Research Trust, said: “These fascinating findings add to previous research suggesting that middle-aged and older people can reduce their risk of dementia by taking part in regular mentally stimulating activities.
“Older web users – ‘silver surfers’ – are doing precisely this.
“Frequent social interactions, regular exercise and maintaining a balanced diet can also reduce dementia risk.”
Dr Susanne Sorensen, head of research at the Alzheimer’s Society, said: “Use it or lose it may well be a positive message to keep people active but there is very little real evidence that keeping the brain exercised with puzzles, games or other activities can promote cognitive health and reduce the risk of dementia.”

…wins Ig Nobels
Fri Oct 3, 2008 7:01pm EDT
By Maggie Fox, Health and Science Editor
WASHINGTON (Reuters) – A researcher who figured out that Coke explodes sperm and scientists who discovered that people will happily eat stale chips if they crunch loudly enough won alternative “Ig Nobel” prizes Thursday.
Other winners included physicists who found out that anything that can tangle, will tangle and a team of biologists who ascertained that dog fleas jump farther than cat fleas.
The Ig Nobels honor real research, but are meant as a funny alternative to next week’s deadly serious Nobel prizes for medicine, chemistry, physics, economics, literature and peace.
Awarded by the editors of the Annals of Improbable Research, a scientific humor magazine, the prizes are based on published research, some intended to be humorous but often not. Usually the “honored” researchers go along with the joke.
Deborah Anderson of Boston University Medical Center and colleagues were awarded the chemistry prize for a 1985 study published in the New England Journal of Medicine that found Coca-Cola kills sperm.
She said she was serious in testing the soft drink because women were using it in a douche as a contraceptive and, later, to try to protect themselves from the AIDS virus.
“It definitely wouldn’t work as a contraceptive because sperm swims so fast,” Anderson said. But Coke made with sugar quickly kills sperm, she said, probably because sperm soak it up. “The sperm just kind of explode,” she said in a telephone interview.
It kills the AIDS virus too, she said.
The Ig Nobel committee made up a “nutrition prize” to go to Massimiliano Zampini of the University of Trento, Italy and Charles Spence of Britain’s Oxford University, who tricked people into thinking they were eating fresh potato chips by playing them loud, crunching sounds when they bit one.
The biology prize goes to a French team that found dog fleas can jump higher than cat fleas, while the medicine prize was awarded to a team at Duke University in North Carolina who showed that high-priced placebos work better than cheap fake medicine.
Dorian Raymer of the Scripps Institution in San Diego and a colleague won the physics prize for demonstrating mathematically why hair or a ball of string will inevitably tangle itself in knots.
The peace prize was given to the Swiss Federal Ethics Committee on Non-Human Biotechnology for adopting the legal principle that plants have moral standing and dignity. There is a website explaining this: here
A team at The University of Sao Paulo in Brazil won a special archaeology prize for showing how an armadillo can mess up an archaeological dig.
The economics prize went to researchers at the University of New Mexico who learned that a professional lap dancer earns bigger tips when she is most fertile, while David Sims of Cass Business School in London won the literature prize “for his lovingly written study ‘You Bastard: A Narrative Exploration of the Experience of Indignation within Organizations’,” the committee said.
Past winners include the creator of the plastic pink flamingo, a researcher who recorded a mallard duck sodomizing a dead drake and a doctor who cured hiccups by applying digital rectal massage.

I’m not too bad.  Got a bit of a cold at the moment, but that’s not much of a surprise for me this time of the year.
Apart from that, not been up to much.  Started my foundation Chinese class on Wednesday.  It’s quite good.  We’re learning about the characters, what they mean and how to write them properly as well as the spoken language.  I’m having fun.
The tracker survey has gone better than I hoped.  Someone did ask if I was going to post the results of it and I’d love to.  Just not entirely sure how I would do that.  Anyone got any suggestions, let me know.
On Monday I was speaking to Daphne before she went to work.  She went for a shower, came back and told me she was freaking out because there was an infestation of ants in her kitchen.  Not long afterwards my friend Emma texted me asking if I wanted to meet up with her as she had to vacate her house for three hours after getting it sprayed due to an invasion of fleas.
Course, they then went on to blame me for posting my pics of the ugly bug ball on fb.
Anyway, have to go watch a film then tidy my room for my fathers visit tomorrow.  I’ll leave you with this:

So, you guys remember the ghost walk I mentioned in my last video entry?  Well, it turns out that I won a prize in the quiz afterwards.  A signed copy of the book that was used to come up with the tour.  I got it today and it looks quite good actually.  Maybe not a cover to cover read, but something I can dip into every now and then.
It’s freshers week (sorry, welcome week) at the university this week, so meeting up with friends I haven’t seen in ages.  Earlier on at kareoke I had some random bloke tell me that he’d missed my version of The Time Warp over the last four month.  Thought, but not said, was my reaction of ‘You really do need a life, you know that?’
Anyway it took me ages to get to sing my second song.  And I was in a hurry as I wanted to get home to speak to Daphne.  Finally got up.  Was about 2 lines into the first verse when she phoned me.  Bloody predictable.
Anyway, about the title.  I’ve enrolled at the university to learn Chinese.  (The title apparently says Hey there, folks.  But this is through babelfish.)  I decided that I wanted something to occupy my mind while I’m still signing on and have wanted to learn a second language for a while.  After seeing that the uni didn’t offer any Italian courses (I’ve harboured for a while the dream of reading The Divine Comedy of Dante Alleghri in Italian and I think it’s an amazing, lyrical language) I chose Chinese.  Why?  A) it’ll be interesting and b) I wanna swear at people in Chinese.  like this:
Besides, as the Monty Python crew once said:
Apart from that, all is well in my world.  Still can’t wait for Daphne to get here (only 7 weeks to go, not that I’m counting or anything).  Still miss her like crazy.
Coming soon may be a political entry, but we’ll see.
And with that, I’m out.

…30 MILLION ONE POUND COINS	
ALISTAIR Darling is to boost Britain’s faltering economy by giving 30 million one pound coins to poor people.
Mr Darling assured the Labour conference in Manchester that these coins are top quality but should not be used in fruit machines, adding: “They won’t work. I’ve checked.
“And don’t go examining them to see if the Queen’s head is lined up properly because that’s a lot of bollocks anyway. 
“Look, who are you going to believe? The BBC website or the guy – me – who has the actual keys to the Royal Mint and can go in – whenever – and just take loads and loads of pound coins? Exactly.”
The chancellor said the economy had been damaged by reckless lending and excessive debt, but stressed everything was going to be fine because he had just applied for a £90bn overdraft.
Mr Darling insisted the loan was affordable as it was no more than 600,000 times his current salary.
He told delegates: “I’ll just cut back on DVDs and Haagen Dazs. And I’ll cancel my gym membership. Why do people pay for a fancy gym when they can just go for a run? Doesn’t cost any money to go for a run. 
“And I’ll start getting the bus to work and I’ll renovate all my old shoes and I’ll make loads of soup. It tastes so much better when you make it yourself, doesn’t it? And it’s so cheap!”
Meanwhile the government has pledged to crackdown on City bonuses right up to the point where everyone moves to Hong Kong.

‘No undie sundie’ banned
An Australian pub has halted a promotion offering free drinks to girls who took off their knickers and showed them to the customers.
The “No Undie Sundie” at the Saint Hotel in Melbourne, Australia, offered $50 worth of drinks to girls who whipped off their garments and hung them over the bar.
The event was criticised by women protection groups, reports The Sun.
Liquor Licensing Victoria director, Sue Maclellan said: “On the face of it, it looks like an inappropriate liquor promotion and we will be investigating with a view to banning it.”
Man has sex with car
A drunk man has been arrested after being caught having sex with a car.
The car’s owner left the SUV on a quiet street in the US.
The man, who has not been named, was seen with his pants down and getting friendly with the front of the car.
He was arrested after passers-by called the police, reports Metro.
Woman, 33, posed as daughter to enrol at school
A 33-year-old US woman posed as her 15-year-old daughter to enrol at school because she wanted to be a cheerleader.
Wendy Brown, of Green Bay, Wisconsin, has been charged with identity theft after used her daughter’s ID to become a student at the school.
She attended cheerleading practices and a party at the cheerleading coach’s house. She was given a cheerleader locker and paid for her uniform with a check that later bounced.
Officials said the woman stopped attending school after the first day, prompting a truancy investigation that led to the discovery of the woman’s true identity.
Teachers said the student appeared older but had a teenage-like demeanour.
“In school you see a lot of children who look older and dress older,” said Don Penza, liaison officer. “At what point do you say, ‘You’re lying.'”
The woman told police she wanted to get her high school diploma and become a cheerleader because she had no childhood.
“We find it not funny at all,” said Lt. Jody Crocker of the Ashwaubenon Public Safety Department.
Streaker knocked himself out
A streaker fell over and knocked himself unconscious during a football match in Australia.
The streaker jumped over the fence and on to the pitch in front of jeering fans during a match between United and Hummocks Watchman Eagles at Virginia Oval, north of Adelaide.
Witnesses told AdelaideNow that he did a “funny jump” on the pitch, landed heavily on his head and knocked himself out cold.
St John Ambulance volunteers at the ground attended to him and several minutes later he was carried from the oval, still naked, on a stretcher. He reportedly recovered soon after.
Prof: ‘Schools should teach magic’
A psychologist says British children should follow in Harry Potter’s footsteps and study magic at school.
Professor Richard Wiseman says conjuring boosts children’s self-confidence and social skills, reports the Daily Mirror.
“Learning magic requires self-discipline, an understanding of how other people think and an ability to entertain,” he said.
“And unlike computer games it encourages children to interact with their friends and family.”
Researchers tried out his theory by sending 50 children in Hertfordshire to magic school.
They learned to repair a rope cut in half and did a Derren Brown-style mind-reading card trick. They later performed in front of friends and family.
They were tested two weeks later and scored higher in confidence and social skills than their classmates who had been to conventional personal and health lessons.
Prof Wiseman told the British Association of Science Festival in Liverpool: “We would like to roll this out nationally as part of the national curriculum.
“The success of Harry Potter means it’s fun going to magic lessons. We couldn’t stop them. There was a real sense of excitement.”
He added: “They have to have the self-discipline to learn the trick and think it through and look at it from someone else’s perspective. They also had to learn to keep a secret while being likeable.”

Minister quits for dancing in his undies
An Australian government minister has been forced to resign for dancing in his underpants at an office party.
Matt Brown quit only three days after he was sworn in as police minister of New South Wales, reports the Sydney Morning Herald.
It came after reports were leaked that Brown danced in “very brief” pants to techno music on a leather couch during a drunken office party and straddled the breasts of a lady MP.
Premier Nathan Rees said he demanded Brown’s resignation because the former lawyer had given assurances that “absolutely nothing untoward” had happened during the party.
“I subsequently put it to former minister Brown late last night that there are too many reports of you in your underwear for me to ignore,” Rees told local radio.
“He conceded he’d been in his underwear and that gave me no option but to demand his resignation,” Rees added.
Mr Brown has admitted behaving “in a manner not befitting a minister”, but denied claims that he straddled the breasts of Wollongong MP Noreen Hay at the post-budget party.
A witness told The Australian newspaper that Mr Brown stripped and danced to loud techno music, then “mounted the chest” of Ms Hay.
The saga is a major embarrassment for the new government whose cabinet ministers were sworn in on Monday.
A visibly shattered Mr Rees said he was fed up and conceded the revelations were a big setback: “Embarrassed doesn’t begin to describe it … It’s beyond even anger. This is just a gross disappointment,” he said.
Porter happy with 25th wife
A Nepalese porter says he has finally found happiness after 24 failed marriages.
Ramchandra Katuwal, 49, of Khandbari municipality in Sankhuwasava, and his 25th wife recently celebrated their seventh wedding anniversary.
The landless labourer says that his marriage to Sharada has been a “journey of happiness”, reports the BBC.
And for Mr Katuwal, the trek before his latest journey was paved with pitfalls and potholes. He first got married at the age of 26.
His first wife set a precedent followed by many of her successors: she eloped with her lover. From then onwards his life veered from one disastrous marriage to another.
“My second wife also ran away,” he said, “and the third one too.”
From the succession of wives who came and went over a 16-year period, Mr Katuwal says he can only remember nine of them clearly.
“(Like other ex-wives) the 24th one also ran away. And I decided not to marry again,” he said.
But his resolve did not last and he wed 23-year-old Sharada seven years ago: “I wanted to have a wife, because a house is not house without a wife,” he said.
Mr Katuwal says that he is now so happy he has vowed not to marry again.
Boy, 5, blew £60,000 at shops
A five-year-old boy went on a £60,000 shopping spree after finding a fortune in cash in his dad’s safe.
The boy took a gang of friends to a shopping mall and blew the loton clothes, toys, bicycles, sweets, computers and games.
His father Slobodan Markovic, a Serbian businessman, kept the money in a safe at home, only realised what had happened when his son and his friends came home with dozens of shopping bags.
He said: “I must have forgotten to lock the safe and he just saw the money and took it. I have asked the police to investigate because it is unbelievable that the shop owners let such a young boy do this.”
A Belgrade police spokesman confirmed they are investigating Djodja Markovic’s spending spree.
Reprieve for jailed goats
A minister in the Democratic Republic of Congo has ordered a Kinshasa jail to release a dozen goats.
Deputy Justice Minister Claude Nyamugabo said he found the goats just in time during a routine jail visit.
The beasts were due to appear in court, charged with being sold illegally by the roadside, reports the BBC.
The minister said many police had serious gaps in their knowledge and they would be sent for retraining.
Mr Nyamugabo was conducting a routine visit to the prison when, he said, he was astonished to discover not only humans, but a herd of goats crammed into a prison cell in the capital.
He has blamed the police for the incident. It is not clear what will happen to the owners of the goats, who have also been imprisoned.
Murder on the dancefloor…
A Romanian woman was arrested after she pulled out a pistol and took pot shots at a disco Romeo who wouldn’t take no for an answer.
Fed-up Raluca Radu, 24, let fly after the luckless lover asked her to dance five times at the nightclub in Pascani.
Her four shots missed her would-be suitor who fled the club unharmed. She faces charges
“This guy was really coming on strong and being a real pain. She took the gun out of her handbag and let rip. I doubt anyone will be brave enough to ask her for a dance for a long time,” said one clubber.

1041,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/havent-we-seen-this-election-before-3929982/,2008-09-14,Haven’t we seen this election before?,"
By Janette Ballard 
BBC producer, President Hollywood
The Obama v McCain race for the White House has been run before – NBC’s The West Wing pitted a charismatic, non-white Democrat against a maverick, experienced Republican.
In the The West Wing’s fictional 2006 election, actor Jimmy Smits played Latino presidential hopeful, Matthew Santos. He announced his intention to run with the words, “We live in cynical times, but hope is not up for debate… there is only hope.”
Sounds familiar doesn’t it?
“Barack Obama was one of the people that I looked to draw upon,” admits Smits.
Just at the time that the Matt Santos character was being developed, Barack Obama gave the key note address at the 2004 Democratic Convention introducing John Kerry.
Smits studied the speech and then met Obama at a political event where they were both speaking. “We were in this tent that normally would have been filled with people and for some reason it was just me and him. And we were talking about Chicago politics and he looked at me and said, ‘I think I can make an impact’.”
Similarities between the fictional Matt Santos and Barack Obama are striking; Santos was a charismatic newcomer, promising hope and raising the possibility of the first non-white Commander in Chief. In both style and content, he’s a reflection of Obama.
Eli Attie, a writer and producer on the show, was given the task of developing the character. Attie knew Obama’s key aide, David Axelrod, so he called him for some advice.
“David Axelrod helped explain to me how Obama viewed his race, how he refused to be defined by it. In politics people are always looking to force people into categories: What’s your slice of the constituents? What’s your political base? And it seemed that Obama was very resistant to that idea and that was a key element in his success.”
Attie drew on this information in writing his scripts. As fans of The West Wing will remember, the issue came up several times during the fictional race for the White House, but Matt Santos never let it distract him from his politics.
“We wanted to make sure that Santos was communicative and politically strong, and then you have the other layer there, that he just happens to be Latino,” says Smits. He sees that it is the same for Obama; his ethnicity is important, “but is not the be all and end all of the man”.
Maverick figure
Running against Matt Santos in The West Wing’s election was Arnold Vinick. More by coincidence than design, he bears a striking similarity to John McCain. Played by Alan Alda, Vinick is a veteran Republican from out west, wise in the ways of Washington. A maverick on some issues, he is attractive to those in the centre ground.
“The McCain candidacy is very similar to the Vinick candidacy,” says Lawrence O’Donnell, who wrote the character. “They are good at appealing outside their own party. And that is actually one of their problems, within their own party, of Republicans not believing that they were Republican enough.”
In The West Wing, Arnold Vinick chose a very conservative Republican as his running mate in an attempt to appeal to his own political base. It’s a move that McCain seems to have mimicked in his choice of Sarah Palin.
The series took up real political issues, still hot topics this year – the price of oil and bio fuels, national security, immigration, health care, jobs, gun control.
When The West Wing held the all-important TV presidential debate, the show went out live, just like the real thing.
“Both Alan Alda and myself prepared as if we were candidates,” say Smits, acknowledging how it put genuine pressure on the actors to know their positions and get it right.
Some of their exchanges we may hear again in the coming weeks; Vinick declared himself pro-nuclear, Santos spoke against that position. Santos committed to government spending to improve health provision for all, Vinick promised to never raise tax on healthcare.
Crystal ball
So what does this tell us about who is going to win?
As The West Wing’s election campaign unfolded, the candidates were neck and neck, both on screen and in the writer’s room, with rival camps keen to see their candidate getting ahead.
“It was like two campaigns on the staff of the West Wing firing shots across the bow,” says Eli Attie. For viewers the outcome was far from certain, much like this year’s real election.
For those still ploughing through West Wing DVDs, we won’t give away the end result. But so far at least, events have been a strange case of art reflecting life, reflecting art. “We ran this campaign in The West Wing before it happened in the country,” says O’Donnell.
“We got lucky on a lot of the stuff – we’re not that smart.”

I know I haven’t commented much about the Presidential election going on across the pond in this diary.  It’s not because there’s nothing I want to say, but because I don’t like being told to keep my nose out because I don’t live in the States.  (Incidentally, New Rule [yeah, I’ve started watching Real Time with Bill Maher]: if you don’t like people from outside America commenting on the Presidential race or the President, you no longer get to call the President “The Leader Of The Free World”.  Cos, if that’s true, than the rest of the free world has the right to comment on their actions/who the next one is going to be.)

As you may or may not be aware, Google has launched their own browser called chrome.  At the moment it’s not available on Macs or machines running Linux.  As I’m neither, I decided to give it a shot.  Verdict?  It’s not too bad.  Yes, there are some Firefox add on’s that I miss.  Yes, it’s annoying having no way to switch off the spellchecker.  Yes, the way I have my desktop set up makes switching tabs slightly annoying.  But, the page that it opens to when I open a new tab is brilliant (it shows you the pages you visit most often) and it is significantly faster (even on my machine where everything runs slowly).  I still need Firefox for downloading stuff from a couple of sites but, once that’s fixed, I think I’ll be sticking with Chrome.
Back at the begining of the year, Neil Gaiman and HarperCollins gave us the chance to read American Gods online, for free, for a month.  Such was the success of that, they’re repeating the experience with Neverwhere.  I’ve already got my copy and look forward to reading it.
The feedback for the story I mentioned a couple of entries ago has started to trickle through.  People seem to like it, which is good.  I always get worried when staring something new (particularly when it’s something completely new to me like a fantasy crime novel) that it won’t be liked.  I aim to edit it tomorrow or Saturday, then get it sent away.
I’m quite the sad case.  I found out on Monday that the new album from the freshly reformed New Kids On The Block was released in the States on Monday, so I downloaded it.  It’s quite good.  I also downloaded their greatest hits album which sent me back in time.  Sadly, I knew most of the lyrics for the stuff on it.
I do have to say, though, that between the new NKOTB and 90210 (watched the first two episodes and can see it becoming a guilty pleasure) I feel like there’s a late 80’s – early 90’s revival going on.  Which is quite scary.
And finally, there’s a thing going round for your top 5 cover versions.  As i’m feeling generous, i’ve not only included the video for the cover, but also the original for the sake of comparison.
1) Hurt by Johnny Cash (original by Nine Inch Nails)
A lot of people doing this have named this song.  And for good reason.  It’s amazing.
When I first heard that Cash would be covering NIN, I thought it was nothing but a wind up.  Then I heard it.  Cash took a song that was about drug addiction and made it about him and his life.  It’s almost an apology to June.  Even Trent Reznor has said that Hurt is no longer a NIN song but a Johnny Cash song.  American IV: The Man Comes Around is a brilliant album, but this is the shining jewel.
2) Hopelessly Devoted To You by Kirsten Chenoweth (original by Olivia Newton John)
I’ll admit a bit that this might be considered cheating as you will only have heard this if you watch Pushing Daisies (and if you watched it on ITV over here, not even then) but I don’t care.  Chenoweth has an amazing singing voice and I love the way they worked it into the show.  
Showrunner Bryan Fuller has threatened to write a musical episode and if the rest of the cast is even half as good as Chenoweth (and Ellen Greene [Audrey in Little Shop Of Horrors]) it will be good.
3) The Rip by Radiohead (original by Portishead)
A fairly new one as Thom Yorke and Johnny Greenwood (I think) from Radiohead perform an accoustic version of my personal favourite song from the latest Portishead album.  I always new that both Yorke and Portishead singer Beth Gibbons had unique voices, but I never thought that one could sound so much like the other.  I’d love for Portishead to cover a radiohead song (as long as it’s not the massively overrated Paranoid Android).
4) Dr Who theme by Orbital (original by Ron Grainier)
<embed src=""http://www.youtube.com/v/LF2x5IKxmAQ&hl=en&fs=1&rel=0&color1=0x5d1719&color2=0xcd311b&border=1&#8243; type=”application/x-shockwave-flash” allowfullscreen=”true” width=”425″ height=”349″> 
The Dr Who theme is iconic.  which is why I still can’t believe that Fox wanted to change it for the TV Movie.  (Thank FSM that the BBC nixed that idea.)  When the new version of the show was in the planning stages, Orbital, who readily admit to being fans of the show (and may or may not be related to William Hartnell, who played the First Doctor), were hoping to be asked to perform the theme.  This is a taste of what we might have got.
(There is an album version of this song, but I much prefer the live version.)
And, as a bonus, the Dr Who theme performed by John Barrowman and David Tennant:
5) Hallelujah by Jeff Buckley (original by Leonard Cohen)
(I couldn’t find an embedable version of the proper video for either version of this song, so this’ll have to do instead.)
I have heard many versions of this song (including one which was re-written about former Boro player Mark Viduka), but none have ever been able to top Buckley’s version.  I’ve loved this version of this song since I first heard it in the 3rd season finally of The West Wing.  Simply beautiful and if the rest of his stuff is anything like this (haven’t heard anything else by him, a situation I’ll have to recify soon) then it’ll be amazing.
I was going to throw in as a bonus The Satuisfacton Skank, Fatboy Slim’s mash up of The Rockafeller Skank and (I Can’t Get No) Satisfation by The Rolling Stones, but I couldn’t find it on youtube.  But you should hunt it down cos it rocks.
OK.  I’m going to go to bed, dream about Daphne and resume counting down the days till she get’s here and is back in my arms.  I can’t wait.
Laters.
Will
*EDIT*
Cos I accidentally put the NIN version of Hurt twice.

OK, so here’s the thing.  I’ve just finished a short story and would like people to read it and give me feedback.  Here’s the information about the story:
It doesn’t have a title (although there are two names I have in mind),
It is a fantasy crime story (no, I’m not joking, hence wanting the feedback),
It is 11 pages long,
I’m hoping to submit it for a magazine and the deadline is the 10th.  So, I’d need your feedback by the end of the week so I can start editing.

1) I was one of the few, the merry few, the band of hacked.  (Yes, I know, not exactly the St Crispins Day Speech but give me a break.  It’s nearly 1am and I haven’t had much sleep.)
Kudos to the DM and the support team for getting the problem fixed quickly.  And, reading about the way it was done, that does sound like quite the impressive piece of code.
b) I didn’t get the Subway job.
III) Although I was hacked, I didn’t get the email because they said I didn’t have an email address regestered with them.  Which I’m fairly certain is rubbish, as they needed to use it to let me know that the OD+ subscription I got Daphne as a present went through (I think, I’m not entirely sure).  Still that problems sorted now.
Lots) I need to get going on a short story I’m submitting for a pdf magazine, as the deadline is the 10th and I would like tyo leave some time for editing.  Must do that tomorrow.

So, thanks to my anonymous friend, I now have Tical 2000, which I haven’t heard in about 10 years.  still as good as I remember.  Thank you, whoever you are.
For a while now, I’ve been having problems with my right ear.  It hurt sometimes when I got up and the hearing was reduced on and off.  At the begining of last week, the reduced hearing was permanent.  So, off to the doctor went I on Thursday and it turns out the problem was impacted earwax.  I had to use eardrops for five days (whioch actually made the problem worse) and then I went to get my ears syringed yesterday.  So, I now have full hearing again.
Woohoo!
And, I have a job interview for Subway tomorrow.  Wish me luck.
Daphne is now back in the States and she’s picked something up over here.  I just wish I was there to look after her :¬(

So, there’s this website for making a manga version of yourself.  I gave it a shot and came up with this:

Whadda think?
You can make one for yourself here
And, seeing as everyone else is doing this, a survey:
What is the type of music you like that would most surprise people that know you?
I’ve got a varied taste in music, but people always seem to be surprised when I say that I like hip-hop.  Yes, some of it is crap, but the stuff that’s good is brilliant.  I’m still trying to find a copy of Tical 2000 by Method Man.
What is the type of music you dislike that would most surprise people that know you?
Probably Oasis and The Stone Roses.  Though lately, I’ve been getting a bit of stick for not liking any of Pete Docherty’s stuff either.
What is the movie that you like that would most surprise people that know you?
I’ve talked in here before about my inexlicable love for Grease and High School Musical.  So I’m going to say Bring It On.  It’s a surprisingly good and subtle film.  Plus Kirstin Dunst and Eliza Dushku in bikinis :¬p.
What is the movie that you dislike that would most surprise people that know you?
Most people, especially when they find out I’m into sci-fi and fantasy, are very surprised when i say I don’t like Star Wars.  I watched Episode IV: A New Hope: Special Edition and couldn’t believe I’d wasted time on it.  Note to directors: when the only character capable of emoting is a faceless android peaking in only beeps and whistles, you may have a bit of a problem.
In addition, while Blade Runner is a good film, it’s not as amazing as everyone says it is.
If you’ve read this, and you haven’t already done it, you’re tagged.

1051,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/last-weekend-70-3929972/,2008-08-22,Last weekend,"
So, I’m finally updating about Daphne’s visit last weekend.  Here we go…
Got up early on Friday so i could go to the LRC, check some stuff online and then get to Newcastle to meet the train.  We had decided, as she hadn’t travelled by train on her own before, the best thing to do was for her to get the train through to Newcastle and I’d meet her there.
So I panicked slightly when she phoned me and said that the train she was supposed to be catching was cancelled and she would have to change trains in Edinburgh.  In one of the biggest train stations in Britain.
Went online, then to the train station then to Newcastle.  Checked which platform her train was getting into and had a quick pint to settle my nerves.
Then waited for the train.  She got off, looked round, in a slightly confused manner, and started walking away from me.  I ran over to her and called her name.  she dropped her bags and ran towards me for a hug :¬D
We then decided to go for a drink as she needed one.  (The second train she caught from Glasgow broke down.)  Had a drink and headed back to Boro, talking and kissing all the way.
When we got back to mine, she showed me all the munchies she had bought me and the t-shirts she had got me as well.  One has a gorgeous picture of a castle with a vampire standing over a corpse and the message ‘Vampire: The Buffy Killer’ on it.
The other?  A Dr Horrible t-shirt.  Yay!
We headed out for something to eat and then back to the house where I taught her how to play mancala and we did other stuff.
Saturday, we were supposed to head to Whitby, to see the abbey and hit a tattoo parlour.  However, Daphne decided she wanted to buy me a new outfit, so we headed into town first.  She got me a pair of combat rrousers and a new shirt (which I still have to take back as it is ridiculously tight on me, especially for a large).  So, by the time we got to the train station, the next train would have given us about 20 minutes in Whitby, or made us late for the night out that had been organised.  So we decided to go the next day.
Went for a wonder round town and booked ourselves in for our tattoos.  We went for some shopping (so I could make spaghetti bolognaise for her), home to drop off the food and back into town for the appointment.

This is me getting my tattoo.  The artist is the same person who did the last one I got  (And, yes, that is the Dr Horrible t-shirt I’m wearing.)

Me, just about there.

And the finished tattoos, side by side.  She chose the design, I chose the colour.
We then went for a drink and some food then back to my house to get ready.  And then out.
Straight to what turned out to be a reggae night.  Not that I have a problem with that type of music, but it was a bit loud.  Once all my friends had turned up, we went to another bar so we could chat and then to a friends housewarming party.  And here are some pics:

My friends Kev and Nikki.  (They were the ones who put me up for three weeks last year while I was househunting.)

Daphne and Jemma

Scaramouche, scaramouche, will you do the fandango?
On Sunday, we got up early to make the trip through to Whitby.  But it was pissing rain, so we decided not to bother with it.  Course, then the weather was quite good for the rest of the day.  Grrr!  Argh!
We went into town, had a wonder round MIMA (surrealist art exhibition, actually really good), went back to mine and I cooked for her.  That night we went for a moonlit wonder where I managed to say my warewolf joke, and changed this for her.  We then went home and prepared for the next day.  I alsoasked her to marry me and she said yes.
On Monday, we got up early again, this time to head through to Newcastle.  Got there and Daphne found out I was planning to go for a wonder round the city after she left.  So, she decided to get a later train and come with me.  We wondered round and something special happened.
You see, when I proposed the previous night, I didn’t actually have a ring for her, as the place I went to didn’t have it in her size.  I gave her my necklace (which she knows I love) and agreed to order the ring for her and send it over when I got it.  Well, with about half an hour to go before her train left, we found a branch of the shop in question in Newcastle, went in and, sure enough, they had the ring in her size.  So I got it for her.
We then left to go back to the train station taking the ‘scenic route’ (i.e. I got slightly lost).  Made it just in time and, as she was just about to jump on the train, the doors closed.
So we went for a drink and she cought the next train, with me trying everything I could not to burst into tears.  And that was it.
Or so I thought.
On Tuesday, I was in the LRC messing about online when Daphne phoned me asking about times and prices for trains to Newcastle as she was coming down for another night.  I told her and she agreed to phone me from Newcastle to say what time her train was getting into Boro.
Met up with a friend to give something to her, and get a present for Daphne from her and wait for the call from Newcastle.  And waited.  And waited.  Finally, she called from Darlington, letting me know what time her train left, but not when it got into Boro.  Asked my friends for advice and went to meet her.
We then went to the pub to meet up with my friends and have a drink.  There were more photos taken, but I’ll just share one as it’s my favourite:

Oh, OK, one more:

(My friend Emma has a thing about sticking her thumbs up in pictures, hence this one.)
We both got a parmo and went back to mine.  The next day (Wednesday) we went back into town (where Daphne bought me the first part of a Buffy/Angel collecatable thing), had some food and went into a jewelry shop on the way back.  We had a look at rings for me and found one that I absolutely loved in my size.  So we got it:

The rings.
Then back to the train station, back to Newcastle (after a delay that had Daphne panicking), and she went to Edinburgh to the tattoo.
And that was that :¬(

So, here is the genesis of this entry.
For a while now, I’ve been thinking about a handwritten entry.  One where I write it on a piece of paper, scan it in and post the scan in here.
Now, the problem till now has been the lack of a scanner.  Which I now have.  So, instead of an entry (cos I’ve just written a huge arsed update entry) I decided to write a short for you lot.  And here it is:


Hope you can all decipher my crap handwriting.  Oh, in case you were wondering, it was written in pencil, so I had to adjust it to make it easier to read.
And finally.  Best remake news EVER!

So, much needed update.
I recently went to the Stockton Riverside Fringe Festival.  Not the whole thing, but part of the second day.  It was quite good.  I must admit, when I saw how close the two stages were, I did wonder how they were going to work it, as there was no way that they could have a band on each stage at the same time.  Turns out they were working it that as soon as someone finished on one stage there was someone else ready on the second stage.
And I got pics!

Finally got myself a new phone:

It’s funky!  It’s got a built in mp3 player!
What else?  Waiting to hear back about a job I applied for back home.  Should hear sometime this week so, fingers crossed.
One of the simple pleasures in life for me is finding hidden things.  So, you can imagine my joy when I walked past this in Boro a couple of weeks ago:

My mind works differently.  Before heading to the festival, we met up in a Japanese resteraunt and had something to eat.  I can’t remember what we were talking about, but I ended up asking if you could have such a thing as an insomniac narcoleptic (hence the entry title).  If anyone knows the answer to that one, could they let me know?  I’d still really like to find out.
Finished my other writing class and got my assignment handed in for it.  It didn’t help when, at 5pm the day before it was due in, I decided that the story I was going to do wasn’t working and decided to junk the whole thing and start again.  But I got it done.
BTW, if anyone would like to read the story I wrote for it and give me feedback, let me know and I’ll email it to you.
Am currently organising my room and discovered my decent mancala set yesterday.  (I have 2, one folds up and cost me £1.  The one I’m on about was in my Santa sack one Christmas.)  So I cleaned the board, soaked the stones and dried them by hand.  Then took a picture, cos I’m strange like that.  Here it is:

I love telling people that I play mancala, cos they either a) don’t actually know what it is or b) think it’s difficult to learn, when the fact is it’s easy to learn.  I keep threatening to teach Daphne how to play when she’s here this weekend.
That’s right.  Almost forgot.  I finally get to meet Daphne this weekend and I can’t wait.  I really can’t wait.  (And, no, it’s not about the presents.)  So, if you could see your way clear to not updating much between Friday and Monday (as I won’t be online) I’d really appreciate it.  Cheers m’dears.
And as I’m currently having issues with the whole typing thing, I’ll let you lot go.
But keep your eyes peeled on Wednesday as, depending on how things go, I might have a surprise for you all.

By ANDREW KLAVAN
July 25, 2008; Page A15
A cry for help goes out from a city beleaguered by violence and fear: A beam of light flashed into the night sky, the dark symbol of a bat projected onto the surface of the racing clouds . . .
Oh, wait a minute. That’s not a bat, actually. In fact, when you trace the outline with your finger, it looks kind of like . . . a “W.”
There seems to me no question that the Batman film “The Dark Knight,” currently breaking every box office record in history, is at some level a paean of praise to the fortitude and moral courage that has been shown by George W. Bush in this time of terror and war. Like W, Batman is vilified and despised for confronting terrorists in the only terms they understand. Like W, Batman sometimes has to push the boundaries of civil rights to deal with an emergency, certain that he will re-establish those boundaries when the emergency is past.
And like W, Batman understands that there is no moral equivalence between a free society — in which people sometimes make the wrong choices — and a criminal sect bent on destruction. The former must be cherished even in its moments of folly; the latter must be hounded to the gates of Hell.
“The Dark Knight,” then, is a conservative movie about the war on terror. And like another such film, last year’s “300,” “The Dark Knight” is making a fortune depicting the values and necessities that the Bush administration cannot seem to articulate for beans.
Conversely, time after time, left-wing films about the war on terror — films like “In The Valley of Elah,” “Rendition” and “Redacted” — which preach moral equivalence and advocate surrender, that disrespect the military and their mission, that seem unable to distinguish the difference between America and Islamo-fascism, have bombed more spectacularly than Operation Shock and Awe.
Why is it then that left-wingers feel free to make their films direct and realistic, whereas Hollywood conservatives have to put on a mask in order to speak what they know to be the truth? Why is it, indeed, that the conservative values that power our defense — values like morality, faith, self-sacrifice and the nobility of fighting for the right — only appear in fantasy or comic-inspired films like “300,” “Lord of the Rings,” “Narnia,” “Spiderman 3” and now “The Dark Knight”?
The moment filmmakers take on the problem of Islamic terrorism in realistic films, suddenly those values vanish. The good guys become indistinguishable from the bad guys, and we end up denigrating the very heroes who defend us. Why should this be?
The answers to these questions seem to me to be embedded in the story of “The Dark Knight” itself: Doing what’s right is hard, and speaking the truth is dangerous. Many have been abhorred for it, some killed, one crucified.
Leftists frequently complain that right-wing morality is simplistic. Morality is relative, they say; nuanced, complex. They’re wrong, of course, even on their own terms.
Left and right, all Americans know that freedom is better than slavery, that love is better than hate, kindness better than cruelty, tolerance better than bigotry. We don’t always know how we know these things, and yet mysteriously we know them nonetheless.
The true complexity arises when we must defend these values in a world that does not universally embrace them — when we reach the place where we must be intolerant in order to defend tolerance, or unkind in order to defend kindness, or hateful in order to defend what we love.
When heroes arise who take those difficult duties on themselves, it is tempting for the rest of us to turn our backs on them, to vilify them in order to protect our own appearance of righteousness. We prosecute and execrate the violent soldier or the cruel interrogator in order to parade ourselves as paragons of the peaceful values they preserve. As Gary Oldman’s Commissioner Gordon says of the hated and hunted Batman, “He has to run away — because we have to chase him.”
That’s real moral complexity. And when our artistic community is ready to show that sometimes men must kill in order to preserve life; that sometimes they must violate their values in order to maintain those values; and that while movie stars may strut in the bright light of our adulation for pretending to be heroes, true heroes often must slink in the shadows, slump-shouldered and despised — then and only then will we be able to pay President Bush his due and make good and true films about the war on terror.
Perhaps that’s when Hollywood conservatives will be able to take off their masks and speak plainly in the light of day.
Mr. Klavan has won two Edgar Awards from the Mystery Writers of America. His new novel, “Empire of Lies” (An Otto Penzler Book, Harcourt), is about an ordinary man confronting the war on terror.

A 56-year-old man from the Midwestern US state of Wisconsin has been arrested after shooting his lawn mower in his garden because it would not start.
Keith Walendowski was charged by police in Milwaukee with disorderly conduct and possession of a sawn-off shotgun.
He could face a fine of up to $11,000 and a maximum prison sentence of six-and-a-half years if convicted.
Police officers said Mr Walendowski had told them: “It’s my lawn mower and my yard, so I can shoot it if I want.”
Police found the shotgun, a handgun and a stungun, as well as ammunition, when they detained Mr Walendowski in the basement of his house.
Witnesses told police that he appeared to have been drinking.
The lawn mower was found sitting outside Mr Walendowski’s house, which he shares with his mother, with the rubbish on Friday.
A local retailer said that Mr Walendowski might now have difficulty getting his lawn mower repaired.
“Anything not factory recommended would void the warranty,” said Dick Wagner, of Wagner’s Garden Mart in Milwaukee.

A British woman has admitted trying to smuggle drugs under her wig at an airport in Norway, police have said.
A customs officer noticed the passenger had “a lot of hair” and a closer inspection revealed a bag glued to the 32-year-old woman’s head.
Norwegian police believe the kilo package contained cocaine, but are still awaiting test results.
The unnamed woman admitted smuggling drugs but said she was unaware what kind of drugs she was carrying.
The woman was arrested on 15 June at the Vaernes airport, near the city of Trondheim in central Norway.
A statement from the country’s customs service said: “A customs official thought the woman had a lot of hair and found a kilo of cocaine.”
A date for sentencing has yet to be set, but police will ask on Wednesday for the woman to remain in custody while they complete their investigations.
A police spokesman said the woman could face two to three years in jail.

Imagine my shock when I opened it to discover that my housing benefit was being suspended due to the fact that I have moved.
So, off I went to Middlesbrough House to speak to them about it.  After waiting about an hour, I finally got to speak to someone.  (The wait is normal for that place.  i always make sure I take a book with me to read when I need to go there.
Turns out that when my new housemate moved in, he said on his application that he was the only person living in the house.  So, I informed them that I do still live there and they’re going to try and change it.
I’m not holding my breath over that one (remembers that last year it took them 2 months to start actually paying it.  I’m still paying off the difference to my landlord).
Bonus points for the fact that the person I spoke to bursting out laughing and saying it was funny.  Maybe for you but, y’see, my landlord actually likes recieving rent for me.  So, when that’s cut off, I tend not to find it too amusing.

1062,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/forever-synonymous-with-tragedy-3929961/,2008-07-05,Forever synonymous with tragedy,"
By Ken Banks
North East and Northern Isles reporter, BBC Scotland news website
Certain names have found themselves destined to forever be synonymous with tragedy in Scottish history.
Lockerbie. Dunblane. Each conjures up memories of human loss on a shocking scale.
On 6 July, 1988, there was another unwelcome addition to that infamous list. Piper Alpha.
Just before 2200 BST, a major gas leak was followed by fire and a series of explosions on the North Sea platform.
The heat ruptured a gas pipeline from another platform causing another massive explosion and fireball that engulfed Piper Alpha.
It all took just 22 minutes and left 167 of the workers on board dead.
Many of the 61 who survived had to jump into the sea through darkness, a desperate leap that killed other colleagues.
Rescue crews flying to the Occidental-owned Piper Alpha platform were confronted with the sight of flames that could be seen 100km away.
Flight Lieutenant Steve Hodgson, an RAF rescue pilot based at Lossiemouth in the north of Scotland, was on a Sea King helicopter.
He recalled: “We have excellent training, but I don’t think that any form of training could prepare you for what we were confronted with that night.
“It was dark ahead of us, and then all of a sudden in the distance we could see a huge fire. I would imagine it was something like 50 to 70 miles in front of us. It was a massive set of flames, the heat was intense.
“I actually remember people in the helicopter closing windows as we moved round. We normally fly with the windows open but they were closed because you could feel the heat from a considerable distance away.”
‘Fry or jump’
Flight Sergeant Trevor Parker, who was in an RAF Nimrod, said: “When we arrived it was completely ablaze. The fuel was on the sea and that was on fire as well. There were a lot of people in situations and certainly people jumping off the rig while we were there.
“It wasn’t until afterwards that the magnitude of what had happened became clear.”
The phrase “fry or jump” would be mentioned by some survivors as the sudden desperate dilemma facing the men.
Roy Carey was one who survived after plunging into the sea.
He said of his ordeal in the water: “I was trying to decide which way to die, whether to drown or whether to die by the fire.
“I decided drowning would possibly be a better way to go, and so I pushed myself on the water and went down a wee bit.
“Then it came to mind I had promised my youngest daughter the same type of wedding as I had given my elder daughter and it gave me reason to survive again.
“I got back to the surface.”
He was among those flown to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary for treatment to terrible burns, and remains grateful for the medical attention he received.
‘Good friends’
“I did have quite a lot of psychological troubles,” he said.
“Your thoughts return to the Piper. It was a bad experience for anyone obviously. It’s still in your dreams.
“I knew most of the people who perished. They were good friends. You knew their lives, their kids’ names. It was like losing friends and family.
“It was hard to say you had survived, you felt guilty.
“Your mind plays tricks with you at times, you maybe see one of them across the road and you have just got to realise it’s not them.”
Legendary Texan firefighter Red Adair arrived to quell the blazing wells on what remained of Piper Alpha.
And Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was among those to visit the survivors and members of the rescue services.
Twenty years on, Piper Alpha remains the world’s worst offshore disaster.
Jake Molloy, of the OILC/RMT union, said there have been safety improvements in the years since, but that there can never be complacency.
Mr Molloy explained: “There is no doubt that significant improvements in safety have been made across the industry in the 20 years since Piper.
“The industry specific regulations that have been introduced coupled with the installation of improved hardware should prevent another disaster on the scale of Piper Alpha. I say should because we can never say never.
“Regulations must be adhered to and the hardware will only ever be as good as the people charged with looking after it. People are therefore key to ensuring safety standards are maintained and improved upon.”
Oil and Gas UK director of health and safety, Chris Allen, said: “Piper Alpha was a turning point for the UK oil and gas industry, leading to significant changes in the industry’s approach to safety management, regulation and training.
“This included transferring the responsibility for offshore safety to the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), encouraging greater workforce involvement and making major changes to the design of offshore platforms.
“Today the offshore industry compares well with many other industries.”
Darren Miller was just six when his father, Alan David Miller, lost his life.
Mr Miller, 26, told the BBC Scotland news website: “Initially I was angry, angry that my dad had been taken, angry that now my life experience set me apart from my friends.
“But, over the years, the anger has subsided, replaced by the tugs of responsibility, of sadness, and of guilt.
“As the eldest of three siblings, I have always felt an overwhelming responsibility to fill the role my dad would have played.
“The sadness is overwhelming at times.
“Hopefully, this 20th anniversary will trigger a renewed focus on oil industry safety, not only in the North Sea but around the world.”

So, just thought I’d write a quick update.

And things with Daphne are going well as well.  We’ve had a few ups and downs, but it seems to have settled now.
Still can’t wait until I get her over here.  It’ll be amazing.

Was going to rant about the ew.com 100 classic albums since 1983, but I can’t be bothered.
And finally.  Some information.  I don’t own a TV.  So i don’t watch programmes (like, say, Dr Who) when they air.  Leave a note asking if I’ve seen it, that’s fine (although if it’s before Sunday afternoon the answer will probably be no).  Leaving a note containing anything that could constitute a spoiler and I’ll be forced to hunt you down and decapitate you with a cod*.

I had a proper entry planned.  Pics, videos, the lot.
This is not it.
As you lot know, I have a laptop.  I like to use said laptop in the university library, as it is better than the uni computers.  Besides, I have firefox set up just the way I like it.
Every so often, the LRC tech bods like to put my computer into quarantine so they can check that I’m running all the security software they think I need to run.  Including anti – virus.
I tend not to use anti – virus software.  Through personal experience (and having worked tech support for Wanadoo broadband), I’m of the belief that it causes more problems than it’s worth.
But, I have to install it when I go through this.  So I install the uni recommended one, leave it there for about a day and then uninstall it.  This usually does the trick.
And so I installed Sophos.  And then ran the check programme again, only to be told that I need to download and install the latest definitions for it.  Despite the fact it has just updated itself.
Click the link to download the definitions only to be back to the page for downloading Sophos.
Fucksocks.
Nothing on the page for the definitions.  Tried a search.  But, because my laptop is in quarantine it won’t bring up the relevant page.
Try restarting my laptop.
Same thing.
Ask at the helpdesk.
They phone the IT department who say they’ll lok into it and to try again in 10 minutes.
Go for a smoke, back in, try again, same bloody thing.
Now, as you can imagine, I’m getting more than a little frakked off.
Try another reboot.
Same thing.
Back to the helpdesk where they get one of the IT bods in the LRC to try and help me.  We try reinstalling Sophos.  Same thing
He tells me to come back tomorrow and, if need be, he’ll get the definitions on a usb stick and stick them on.
So, a few questions arise from this:
1) What kind of definitions do you need to put on this thing if even the latest updates aren’t good enough?
2) Why oh why oh why oh why don’t they simply make the link saying you need to update the definitions go to the page for, y’know, actually downloading the definitions?
And finally,
3) Why the frak is this university so bloody retarded?  (Remind me to tell you about the regestration fun and games later.)

So, when I got up today, there was a card for me saying that a package had arrived.  Went to pick it up,  got it home, opened it up and found the following from Daphne inside:

Let’s go through the list.

Butterfingers.  Never heard of them before, but peanut butter and chocolate always equals goodness in my eyes.

Hershey’s nuggets.  Chocolate, toffee and almonds.

Tootsie pops!  Something I’d always heard of, but never actually tried.

A variety pack thingy.  Can’t remember exactly what’s all in there.

And the first kisses from my honey.
It’s going to be all I can do to stop myself from nomming the lot tonight.
In case you’re wondering, Daphne is the girl I mentioned in the previous entry.  We’ve been talking online through MSN for about 2 weeks now.  And I’m completely mad about the girl.
I look forward to speaking to her every night.  I miss her when we don’t speak.  She’s the first thing I think of in the morning and the last thing I think of when I go to sleep at night.
I really can’t remember the last time I felt like this about anyone.  I really can’t.  It’s been such a long time.  And it sucks that I can’t see her every day.  But that’s what happens when you live on different continents.
She’s coming over in August to see a friend of hers, and while she’s there she’s going to come down and see me.  It was just going to be an overnight visit, but she’s extended that.  We were also talking about me going over there next month, but sadly, that didn’t work out.
I can’t wait to see her.  To touch her, taste her, smell her.  I want to be the first thing she sees when she awakens and the last thing she sees when she falls asleep.  I want to whisper sweet nothings in her ear, private jokes in public that will make her and her alone laugh.
I am completely ensorcelled.

1067,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/things-going-well-2-3929956/,2008-06-20,Things going well,"
So I decided to submit the final edit of End Of An Era (which, till that time only one other person in the world had read) to a website in the hope that they’ll stick it up.  I won’t get paid for it, but it does mean I’ll get my stuff out there.
So I emailed it in, along with a short (and not entirely serious) biog and waited to find out what would happen.
The guy who runs the website emailed me back the next day saying that not only did he want to post it but he loved the story so much, would I mind if he held back on doing so so that he can make it his next story of the month!
Course, I said yes, so as soon as it goes live on the site I’ll post a link.
I start my regional writing class on Monday.  So, I’ve just got a book (Union street by Pat Barker) that I have to read for it.  I got the book today and it’s only about 300 pages so I should be finished it in time.
I also went to a recruitment day for a new shop that’s opening up today.  The poster says they are looking for geeks, gadget fans and gamers, so I’ve got two out of the three covered.  At the end of the interview, the guy recommended that I look up the company online to prepare for the next interview so I think it went well.
Should hear about that on Tuesday/Wednesday so fingers crossed.
There’s also a girl.  We’ve been chatting online for just over a week now and I’ll get to see her in August.  I can honestly say it’s been a long, long time since I’ve felt like this about anyone.  She is amazing and sweet and cute and brilliant.  There have been a couple of nights where I haven’t been able to speak to her and it sucks when that happens.
But hopefully I’ll soon have access to a more secure internet connection, so that won’t be an issue.
So, yeah.  New girl in my life, a good possibility of a new job and the fact that someone other than friends thinks I’m a good writer.  Life is pretty sweet right now.
Couple more things.
1) Seen the pilot to Fringe (new JJ Abrams series).  It’s good, if a bit too much of an X Files clone.  Well worth it.  (And I’m currently downloading the pilots for the US version of Life On Mars and True Blood, the Alan Ball vampire thing for HBO.  will give feedback once I’ve watched them.)
2) Strange news story:
 US fears of teen ‘pregnancy pact’
Officials in the US state of Massachusetts are investigating how 17 teenage girls from the same school have become pregnant.
The number is four times as high as the year before at Gloucester High School.
There are reports that some of the girls – none of whom is older than 16 – entered into a pact to have their babies together.
The girls and their families have so far made no comment. Officials are also investigating the ages of the fathers.
Some are believed to be in their twenties and could face the possibility of being charged with having sex with minors.
It is illegal to have sex with anyone younger than 16 in Massachusetts.
Disturbing
Some of the school’s own staff believe the sharp increase in the number of pregnancies was no accident.
	Don’t try to get pregnant – people say they know what it’s like but they really have no idea
Amanda Ireland
Gloucester teenage mother
“Some girls seemed more upset when they weren’t pregnant than when they were,” Gloucester High School principal Joseph Sullivan told Time magazine.
Local officials say that nearly half of the girls had entered into a bizarre pact to have their babies together.
Dr Elizabeth Guthrie, a paediatric psychiatrist at New York’s Columbia University, told the BBC that some girls might be viewing pregnancy as a fast-track to adulthood and independence.
“It may give you an opportunity for unconditional love and attention from the baby,” she said.
Local teenager Amanda Ireland, a mother who has just graduated from Gloucester High School, offered a blunt warning to other girls.
“Don’t try to get pregnant. People say they know what it’s like because they have younger siblings, but they really have no idea,” she told the BBC.
David Landry, a researcher at the Guttmacher Institute, a New York-based non-profit group focusing on reproductive issues, said the declining teenage pregnancy rate of recent years appeared to be reversing.
Birth rates for girls aged 15 to 17 rose by 3% in 2006, the first increase since 1991, according to preliminary data released in December by the National Center for Health Statistics.
This trend was highlighted on Thursday when Britney Spears’ 17-year-old sister Jamie Lynn, star of a popular television show Zoey 101, gave birth to a baby girl, according to People magazine.
But Mr Landry cautioned against attributing the pact or the worrying statistics to Hollywood. Recent hits have included Juno, in which a teenager gets pregnant and decides to have the baby, and Knocked Up, a comedy about a one-night stand.
“The trend emerged before those movies,” he said.

1068,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/the-peoples-interview-williamthebloodyedit-3929955/,2008-06-17,The Peoples Interview: williamthebloody*EDIT*,"
Helli there.  And it’s time, once again for another Peoples Interview with yours truely, in which I answer all the questions you left for me.
Quick note: the first 5 questions were left for the year end Q&A thing I did and, seeing as how they weren’t about 2007 and I said I would answer them here, I will do.  First up is Karma Girl:
Who’s your closest friend? Tell me about them.
That would probably be Lewis, a friend of mine back home.  Yes, he is the one mentioned here.  I’ve known him about 11 years now and he’s the type of friend where we may not speak to each other for ages, but when we do speak again we just pick right up where we left off.
But there is someone I’ve started speaking to in the past week or so who I’ve become closer to than anyone I’ve met in the past few years.
Are you a hat person?
Yes.  (See later.)
What’s your favourite sex position?
Don’t actually really have one, if I’m perfectly honest.
Do you have a good poker face?
Hell no.  I have a crap poker face.
Next up is Ken Fitlike who wins the award for strangest question:
can you keep a good poker face while in your favourite sex position wearing a hat?
Can’t say I’ve ever really tried that one.
Now to the questions left specifically for this entry.  Starting with the most asked question:
what’s the first geekiest shirt you own?
That would be my Joss Whedon one.  (Course, if we were talking about tops in general, that one would be second to my ST:TNG Season 3 command uniform top.)
Then there were some questions from pierced poet
if you had to be a cartoon character for a day who would it be?
I dunno.  Probably Stewie Griffin, just cos he’s evil.
Capital punishment – yay or nay?
Definate nay on that one.  I don’t believe in taking lives for any reason (euthanasia excepted).
favourite firefly episode?
Probably Out Of Gas.  Tim Minear is a genius to keep that many timelines straight in his head at the same time.  That Fox wanted it re-edited into chronological order (when the was it is set out is part of what makes it so good) shows what complete and total idiots they were at the time.
She was quickly followed by findingsunshine
*If you were to be made Prime Minister, what would be the first thing you’d change?
Honestly?  I’d solve all the moaning about petrol prices by banning all non essential vehicles from the roads.
*When you die, what do you want written on your tombstone?
Well, I want to be cremated (got a thing about being buried alive) so it’s kind of a moot point.  Besides, I don’t actually know.
*What do you want to be best known for?
Being a good friend and a semi decent writer.
*What genre should Joss Whedon tackle next? Or do you think he’s just so brilliant at the sci-fi drama-type genre that he should just keep doing that?
I don’t so much think that it’s that he’s so good at genre stuff, it’s just that he can do so much with it that he should stick to that.  Though he has written a short ballet (seriously) and co-written a horror film so I’ll wait and see what they are like.
*What book SHOULD be written but isn’t?
The Big Book Of Procrastination Ideas.
*Which TV/movie character do you most relate to and why?
Again, I’m not too sure about that one.  Probably Willow in the first three seasons of Buffy, cos everyone turned to her for advice.
*Please do a show and tell of your favourite possession.
I’m doing a few of my favourite possessions:

The aforementioned Joss Whedon T shirt.  Anyone who has been reading this diary for a while should know what a huge fan of his I am.

L – R: Scotland cricket top, AFC top, Scotland rugby top.  I’m not embarassed of being Scottish nor am I afraid to show my support for my team.

My backwards clock.  I’ve had this for about 10 years.  I like it cos it’s unusual (it’s the only backwards clock I’ve ever seen with the numbers in mirror writing as well).  It’s also fun to see people trying to get the hang of using it.

My whiteboard.  Just cos it’s good for jogging my (admittedly terrible) memory.  On it at the moment is the dates/times of the classes I’m doind this summer and the letter about a book i need to buy for one, protected by my hockey player.

Not this book specifically, (although it is a damn good book for a random charity shop find) but my books in general.  I’d go stark raving mad if I had absolutely nothing to read.

Taken with my mobile phone, this is my camera.  It is a digital camera, video camera with sound, MP3 player, e-book reader, dictaphone, webcam and has 20 built in games.  Beside it is the memory card which transforms it from 64meg of wimpyness to 2gig of awesomness.

My ashtray, baccy tin full of filters, baccy, papers, rolling machine and lighter.  I am an unrepentant smoker.
<img src=""http://i51.photobucket.com/albums/f395/williamthebloody1880/PICT0014-1.jpg” border=”0″ alt=”Photobucket”>
My biohazard necklace.  I’ve had to replace the clasp god alone knows how many times but I love it.

My baseball cap.  Whenever I am outside, i always wear a hat.  The badges say (L – R) I do what the voices tell me and Beam me up Scotty.  But I’m always looking out for more.

My collection of movie tickets.  Some of these go back years.

My trusty laptop (also my entertainment centre).  The wallpaper is the DRADIS display from BSG.

My framed picture of Amy.  The pic cost me nothing, the frame £1.  The precious stuff in life doesn’t have to be expensive to buy, just priceless to you.  Still wish I had a better pic though.
Next we have shesolovely:
Any place you would really like going to travel?
America (more on that later).
Anywhere you’d want to move?
Phoenix sounds good right about now.
Are you close to your family?
Closer to my mum than anyone else really.  But, yeah, I am.
Then it was Kaly with a couple:
If I visited, could I buy you drinks instead of that guy?
Yeah, by all means.  I rarely say no to free booze.
If you had the resources to plan a trip of any length to anywhere, what would your “dream” trip be and why? What would you see, what would you do, whom would you meet, what would your expectations be, would you travel with anyone in particular, would you write about it? Are you a good traveler who is at home in many different situations, or are you an Ugly Whatever? Would you prepare by learning languages? Would you stay in hotels? Hostels? Camp out? Couch surf? What would really work for you, enliven you, make you feel alive?
Go for it!
Probably tour the States.  I’d go to Aberdeen, Seattle (just so I can say I had been to somewhere else named Aberdeen), DC, a quick trip to canada to see the Flames play, Edgar Allen Poe’s grave on his (and my) birthday hopeing to see the Poe Toaster, Florida and Phoenix.  (If you think there’s something important I’ve missed out, let me know.)  I’d see everything is possibly could, do whatever I could, meet whoever i happen to meet (and some people from here) and would have no expectations whatsoever.  I would travel alone and write about it in here.  I’m a not bad traveller as I approach travelling with the same ‘roll with the punches’ attitude I take to most of my life.  As it’s America I’m talking about, I wouldn’t need to learn any languages (at least I don’t think I would).  I would stay in B&B’s (guesthouses) for most of the trip, though if anyone did feel like offering me a couch to crash on #I certainly wouldn’t say no :¬p.  I think that would really work for me.
Just the one question from isaidcallmebetty (incidentally, as I can call you Betty, feel free to call me Al :¬p):
“Spike what are you doing in 5 words or less?”
Out for a walk… bitch.
And someone else who only wanted to ask one question was dear_gretrudeperkins:
What first inspired you to write?
Not sure really.  The first time I can remember writing something creative was at college back home, when I wrote this.  I’ve always had an active imagination, I’ve been told that I’m a good writer and I enjoy doing it.
And another one question person, in the form of scottish freya:
you’ve been asked to do a plot outline for a new buffy season, what’s your recurring theme ? 
I’d probably do Buffy 7.5, bridging between the end of Season 7 and the Season 8 comic books.  It would be about the difficulty in organising the new slayers into the cells in the comics, difficulty accepting and fitting into new roles and would feature at least one rogue slayer (cos they’re always fun).
And finishing up with the two that started off this entry (though they’re not getting another link).  First up, it’s Karmie!
Do you think fresh, innovative music is done with? Have we done all we can, or is there more potential in the human race?
I dunno.  The main thing nowadays is to take stuff that’s been done before and make it seem fresh.  An example of this (IMHO) is the Arctic Monkeys.  The same goes for books, TV, films, etc.
How do you like your eggs?
Over easy.
You’re directing a movie – who’s your dream cast? We need a male and female love interest, and two good sidekicks, either gender. GO!
Really depends what kind of film it is.  But here we go:  male lead: James McAvoy.  Female lead: Ellen Page.  Male sidekick: Chiwetel Ejiofor.  Female sidekick: Eliza Dushku.
LOLcats – yay or nay?
Yay!  particularly when it lead to Lol Trek!.  *EDIT* Oh, and The LOLcky Horror Picture Show
And finally, Ken Fitlike:
Are you enjoying Euro 2008? …and why do English football journos always mockingly dismiss Spain as ‘perenniel under-achievers’? (pot / kettle) Have these people no self-awareness…? [Ken Fitlike] 
I’ve only actually seen the one match, but that was the amazing Holland – Italy game.  The sad fact is that Spain, for all the talented players they’ve produced over the years are perennial under-achievers (and this year looks to be no different, I really can’t see anyone stopping Holland).  It’s not that they don’t have any self awareness.  What you’ve to remember is that, Euro 2008 aside, the reason that England apparently fail to qualify for/win tournaments is due to dodgy refereeing (which we have a legitimate complaint about this time)/the dreaded penalty shootout/opposition players winding up England players/the artificial surface they’re playing on.  Y’see, if all the refs and the other teams did what they were supposed to, no-one would ever beable to stop England.
Course, the reality is that the England squad are either massively overrated (Beckham), made of glass (Owen), to tempramental (Rooney) or actually quite talented (Gerrard).
And with that I’m out.  Still taking suggestions for a new name for these entries, and I’ll answer your questions again in another 100 entries time.
Will
*EDIT*
Not often I’ll do this, but here are some late questions from someone special (but seriously folks, after this, no more till the next time I open up the floor, k?)
So, sonme questions from Lady Gemma:
If you had to pick a romantic place to take someone special, where would it be?
Probably for a walk along Aberdeen beach or the banks of the river Dee (not many romantic places in Boro I’m afraid).
Would you move to another country to be with that one special person?
Yeah, if it felt absolutely right.  Otherwise I could end up stranded in a foreign country with no friends.
What is the most daring thing you have ever done?
Probably, not actually moving to Boro in the first place, but staying here after finishing uni rather than moving back home.
How do you know when you are in love?
Dunno, really.  It’s a variety of things that I can’t quite put into words.

So, what’s been happening in my world?
Well, the tattoo has scabbed over, so I’m just waiting for them to go away.
Went to a rock night for the first time in ages last night.  (Side note: it was amazing to walk up to the bouncers and say “I’m on the guest list.”)  It wasn’t bad, but would have been better if I actually had the money to drink.
What else?  Now housemate, so unfortunately I can’t use that room for internet access anymore.  Boo!  But he has said he can probably fix the washing machine (which isn’t spinning) so, that’s good.
I’ve to find an extra 1000 words for End Of An Era by Monday for submitting it to an online (well, PDF) magazine.  I think I can do it.
Don’t forget, my next entry in my 1400th entry, and I’m still looking for questions if you haven’t aready submitted some.  Or even if you have and you want to ask more.  You have till Wednesday.
And finally.  Best way to disrupt a press conference EVER!  (Very, very, VERY NSFW):

*EDIT*
This is just damn freaky.  Got home from the LRC, watched the lastest episode of BSG, which is called Revelations.  Decided after that to start watching Buffy Season 3 from where I left it off last night and started with an episode called?
Revelations.
That’s just frakked up, in a cool way.

1070,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/so-how-did-it-go-edit-3929953/,2008-06-09,"So, how did it go? *EDIT*","
This was the inside of my left wrist at about 11:15am, when I left the house:

And this was it about an hour and a quarter later:

As you can see it’s doing it’s best impression of Laura Palmer at the begining of Twin Peaks.
And once it was unwrapped?

The finished result.

And a clearer pic.
Did it hurt?  Well, to paraphrase Ethan Rayne it stung a little, just at first. But, don’t worry, that went away once the searing pain kicked in.
And that went away when the adrenaline kicked in.  Plus the fact that the girl who did the tattoo was actually kinda cute.
So, there it is.  My new tat.
Couple more things.  Last night I couldn’t sleep.  So I finally got the story written for the Waterstones thing I mentioned.  Wanna read it?  Bear with me.
I had hoped to post a direct link to it, but the way the website has been set up doesn’t allow that.  So, if you go here, click on view the story gallery, view stories by name and search for William, the story you’re looking for is called Outside Looking In.
Secondly, have some more randomly cool grafitti:

Lastly, you have this entry and the next one to submit questions for my 1400th entry.  So, what’re you waiting for?

Thought I’d give you lot a proper update.
Had a strange experence on Wednesday night.  A friend came round with some beer as I didn’t want to be on my ownsome.  When my money went into the bank, the two of us headed out to a 80’s night.  (Which I go to quite a lot as it’s damn good fun.)  We find seats and I head to the bar.  While waiting to get served, a guy comes up and stands beside me.  i could tell from his behaviour that he was going to try and get served before me and he did.  What I didn’t expect is that he would then turn round and buy my drinks for me!
(And this apparently is not the first time he’s done this, as he mentioned to me that someone had ordered champaign before.)
So, rather cool, but rather random.
I’ve finally booked myself in for the tattoo I’ve been threatening to get since Christmas.  I’m getting it done on Tuesday.  Wish me luck.
I was spoiled for decent sci-fi this weekend, with BSG featuring Jane Espinson’s best script ever, as well as the usual amazing acting, and Steven Moffat showing everyone how to conclude a Dr Who 2 parter.  Roll on the 2010 series.
Big thanks to everyone for their feedback on the story linked to in the last entry.  Much more informative than the original feedback I got.  I’m going to leave it until I can get my hands on the Minority Report book (as I’m not a big fan of either Spielberg or Cruse).  I’ve finished editing End Of An Era and have got it to a place where I think it’s not bad (which, for me about something I’ve read, is high praise indeed).  I’m torn between trying to get it published or sending it out again to see if there are any other tweaks that need to be made.  I’ve also got a short story I promised a friend I’d write for them, a 600 character story for a Waterstomes thing and an idea for a new novel which is something I’m not sure has actually been attempted before.
And how do I spend my time?  Playing The Passively Multiplayer Online Game  Which is hugely addictive.  Damn you Wil Wheaton!  (If you do decide to sign up for it, let me know).
You’ve only got another couple of entries to submit questions for my next Peoples Interview entry.  So, what you waiting for?

1072,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/strange-feedback-3929951/,2008-06-03,Strange feedback,"
So, I’m a member of a website called Writers Cafe, where I occasionally submit stories and people can leave reviews.
One story I posted a while ago is called Time And Tide.  You can read it here.
I finally got a review of it today.  It mentions that the story is obviously influenced by Minority Report, says I should remove the reference to MR, remove the word precog and lessen the likenesses between the two.
Except I’ve never seen the film MR, never read the book (never read and Phillip K Dick at all, which I’ll have to rectify at some time) and only know that MR uses precogs because of the publicity for the film.
So, the question is, what do I do?  Do I let the person know this, get hold of the book/film and watch/read so I know what to change, ignore what was said or what?
Any advice welcome.

Although it may not seem like it from this diary, I’m actually quite a shy, introverted, private person.  The reason that all my entries (apart from the occasional comp) is public with all notes is that if I’m brave enough to post it online, I’m brave enough to let anyone read and comment on it.
Maybe I’m not normal.  In fact, I’m very probably not normal.  But when I’m depressed, I don’t like listening to upbeat stuff.  I like to mainline this:

Hello.
Is there anybody in there?
Just nod if you can hear me.
Is there anyone home?
Come on, now.
I hear youre feeling down.
Well I can ease your pain,
Get you on your feet again.
Relax.
I need some information first.
Just the basic facts:
Can you show me where it hurts?
There is no pain, you are receding.
A distant ships smoke on the horizon.
You are only coming through in waves.
Your lips move but I cant hear what youre sayin.
When I was a child I had a fever.
My hands felt just like two balloons.
Now I got that feeling once again.
I cant explain, you would not understand.
This is not how I am.
I have become comfortably numb.
Ok.
Just a little pinprick. [ping]
Therell be no more –aaaaaahhhhh!
But you may feel a little sick.
Can you stand up?
I do believe its working. good.
Thatll keep you going for the show.
Come on its time to go.
There is no pain, you are receding.
A distant ships smoke on the horizon.
You are only coming through in waves.
Your lips move but I cant hear what youre sayin.
When I was a child I caught a fleeting glimpse,
Out of the corner of my eye.
I turned to look but it was gone.
I cannot put my finger on it now.
The child is grown, the dream is gone.
I have become comfortably numb.
You may not think that this entry serves a lot of purpose.  That it’s the insane ramblings of an idiot.  But it’s good for me.  For my soul.  And to someone who will definately not be reading this, what can I say?  Happy birthday(ish).  I’m more sorry than there are words for, in any language, in this world.

Hello there!
Life has been pretty uneventful the past few days.  Had a few drinks, messed about online, discovered that I wouldn’t have to wait until today for new BSG (yay!), got the new Spiritualized album (verdict: superb), had something strange happen to my camera when it was in MP3 player mode and comforted a friend.
I also got some feedback on the short story so I’ll start on the re-write soon.  The one thing that has been universal is that they want to read more, which is a good thing.
Really just posting to provide a few links and videos.  So, here we go!
Who says that Sesame Street doesn’t need editing?
(NB: I accept no responsibility for damage caused to computer equipment due to watching this while drinking something.)
Now this is amazing.  Honda (who are up there with Sony Bravia for amazing adverts) have a newish slogan saying Difficult Is Worth Doing.  So, in order to prove it, they hired 14 skydivers to spell out Honda and broadcast the advert live on Channel 4.  This is the result:

1075,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/blair-to-devote-life-to-faith-3929948/,2008-05-28,Blair ‘to devote life to faith’,"
Former prime minister Tony Blair has promised to “spend the rest of my life” uniting the world’s religions
He said faith could be a “civilising force in globalisation”, bringing people together to solve problems such as malaria and extreme poverty.
Mr Blair, who is now a peace envoy to the Middle East, told Time magazine that religious belief had given him “strength” while in power.
He is launching a “faith foundation” in New York on Friday.
Mr Blair, who recently converted to Catholicism, said: “Faith is part of our future, and faith and the values it brings with it are an essential part of making globalisation work.”
‘Fantastic thing’
His foundation will attempt to bring religions together to tackle global issues such as the UN’s eight Millennium Development Goals, which range from eradicating extreme poverty to ensuring environmental sustainability.
One of its first priorities will be to fight the spread of malaria.
Mr Blair said: “If you got churches and mosques and those of the Jewish faith working together to provide the bed nets that are necessary to eliminate malaria, what a fantastic thing that would be.
“That would show faith in action, it would show the importance of cooperation between faiths, and it would show what faith can do for progress.”
He added that it was possible to “achieve a greater understanding between the different religious faiths, so that we make platforms for action by those faiths and deal with some of the biggest issues in the world”.
Mr Blair’s press secretary Alastair Campbell, when asked about his boss’s faith, once famously remarked that the government didn’t “do God”.
But Mr Blair, 55, has recently spoken out on the subject far more than during his 10 years in Downing Street.
Discussing decisions he made as prime minister, he told Time: “You don’t put a hotline up to God and get the answers.
“The worst thing in politics is when you’re so scared of losing support that you don’t do what you think is the right thing.
“What faith can do is not tell you what is right but give you the strength to do it.”
Mr Blair is not being paid for his work as a Middle East envoy for the “Quartet” of the United Nations, United States, European Union and Russia.
But he has lucrative consultancy posts with insurer Zurich and merchant bank JP Morgan, on top of a reported £5m deal for his Downing Street memoirs.

Hello folks.
Had quite a quiet weekend.  Listened to the Scottish Cup final on the internet, then met up with a friend for a couple of drinks.  Then a couple more.  Then a couple more.
Next thing we knew it was 10:30 and she’d missed her last bus home.  So she crashed at mine where we ate rice and watched The Unicorn And The Wasp (cos she hadn’t seen it.)
And the past couple of days, I’ve mainly slept.  Well, that’s what happens when you stay up to 7am watching Buffy (season 2, if anyone is wondering.)
For those of you who agreed to read my short story, check your inbox.  Anyone else interested, let me know (with an email address if you don’t think I already have it).
I got on to the two courses I talked about in my video entry.  I’m looking forward to them.  I have an idea for another short story, but I’m saving it for the course.
Wondering round town today I noticed that Spiritualized have a new album out.  Not having the cash to buy it, I’m going to have to see if I can aquire it by other means.  But why is it that of all the albums being released this year, it ones by old bands that I was/am looking forward to?  Portishead, Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, Spiritualized, Nine Inch Nails and (if the rumours are actually true) The Fugees.  Admittedly, I don’t actually listen to much modern music, but still.
Also had a great/strange experience in town.  Rock Band has just been released in Britain and most of the shops have set up consoles so you can have a go.  I was stood waiting for two girls to stop playing one of them so i could have a shot.  The song they were performing was In Bloom by Nirvana.  Now the girl on the drums was quite good, but the one who was supposed to be singing wasn’t.  Singing I mean.  So, I’m stood there singing along when they ask me if I want a go.  I ended up standing in Zavvi, near the door, singing Nirvana while a girl who must have been about 10 played the drums.  And yes, I did score more points than her.
The two of them asked if I was embarassed to be doing it and I said no.  Didn’t point out that I’ve been a kareoke afficionado for the past six years.
Don’t forget, I’m still looking for questions for my 1400th entry.  I’ve had a couple so far (well, one has been asked by just about everyone) but obviously, that won’t make for a particularly exciting entry.  So i need more people!
I’ll stop rambling now.  Besides, I want to watch Mad Men.
Couple of thing before I go though.  This is quite amazing (to me anyway):
Judge gives girl, 12, go-ahead to change sex
By Nick Squires in Sydney
Last updated: 12:22 AM BST 26/05/2008
A judge has provoked controversy in Australia by ruling that a 12-year-old girl could begin the first phase of a sex change.
The unnamed girl has begun hormone treatment to block puberty after a judge accepted an application from her mother for her to begin to reassign her gender.
A family court judgment said it was important to act quickly to prevent the onset of puberty as the girl dreaded the prospect of menstruation and developing breasts, and had threatened self-harm.
It was reported yesterday that during a hearing in December, the court heard that the girl from Victoria had thought of herself as a boy since the age of four. Several medical experts, including a psychiatrist, backed her application for a sex change.
The judge said that while the initial treatment was reversible, it needed to be seen as the first step in a process which, if continued, would allow the girl to live as a man.
“In my view, and on all the evidence, the treatment is in [the child’s] best interests,” the judgment said.
Further court applications will have to be made if the child wants to take the process further. Surgery to remove her womb and ovaries or construct a penis cannot be performed before the age of 18.
The head of the Australian Medical Association said it was a decision that would not have been taken lightly.
“It is a case-by-case instance. Maturity, intellectual ability, understanding, competency, are things that doctors assess very carefully,” said Dr Rosanna Capolingua.
But the child’s father bitterly opposed the decision, in part because of his daughter’s young age, the court was told.
A medical ethicist, Dr Nicholas Tonti-Filippini, said the decision was astounding. “Twelve is a time of great uncertainty for a young person … I would question whether the medical evidence supports treating [her] in this way.”

Well, hello there.
Thought I’d update.
Not really been up to much recently.  Went to watch the Champions League final in the Union on Wednesday.  Then headed to a club to celebrate Chelsea losing.
While there, my friend Stuart was being chatted up by someone old enough to be my mother, never mind his.  Of course, I had to take the piss.
She later turned to me and said if I gave her 10 minutes, she’d have me.  Erm, don’t quite think so somehow.  Thanks for playing!
Yesterday, went for a wonder round town with a friend.  While in town I spotted a really cool t-shirt, which I didn’t have the money for.  So my friend bought it for me!  Here I am wearing it:

I’ll take a better picture later.  Basically, it’s the diagram for a computer system of some kind.  It’s the second geekiest t shirt I own.
We then went for a drink and discovered that, although it wasn’t on in the bar where we were, the Aberdeen – Rangers game was on the telly.
To the union!
They didn’t have a game on, so they put the Dons match on for me.  So I got to sit and watch as we helped stop Rangers win the league.
Freya, it was our privilege.
So, that’s my last couple of days.
Last two things.
1) I’m still looking for people to read my new short story for me.  Check out the entry HALP! (2 entries back) for more details.  As I will have no internet access on Sunday or Monday, i’ll probably send it out on Tuesday.
2) It’s coming up to my 1400th entry.  So you know what that means.  I’m looking for your questions.  Ask away.
And now i’m going to go and get some food.

1078,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/doctor-who-guru-davies-steps-down-3929945/,2008-05-19,Doctor Who guru Davies steps down,"
Russell T Davies is to step down as executive producer of Doctor Who, the BBC has announced.
Davies is credited with breathing new life into the show which he brought back to television screens in 2005.
Bafta-winning writer Steven Moffat will succeed Davies as lead writer and executive producer of the fifth series of Doctor Who.
Moffat said that the whole of his career had been “a secret plan to get this job”.
BBC Fiction controller Jane Tranter said the past four series of Doctor Who had been “brilliantly helmed” by the “spectacularly talented” Davies.
“As lead writer and executive producer, he has overseen the creative direction and detail of the 21st century re-launch of Doctor Who and we are delighted to have his continued presence on the specials over the next 18 months,” she added.
Davies will remain in charge of four specials to be shown in 2009.
The fifth series, with Moffat at the helm, is scheduled to be broadcast on BBC One in Spring 2010.
Moffat has already written some of the most memorable Doctor Who episodes of recent times, including The Girl in the Fireplace and The Empty Child.
Earlier this month, he picked up the best writer Bafta for the Blink episode of series three which featured terrifying weeping angels.
Moffat said: “I applied before but I got knocked back ‘cos the BBC wanted someone else. Also I was seven.
“Anyway, I’m glad the BBC has finally seen the light and it’s a huge honour to be following Russell into the best – and the toughest – job in television.
“I say toughest ‘cos Russell’s at my window right now, pointing and laughing.”
Doctor Who’s return after a 16-year break from the screen received praise from critics and fans alike.
Speaking after the first series of the revamped show in 2005 – which starred Christopher Eccleston as the Time Lord – Davies said Doctor Who had been in desperate need of regeneration.
“I love Doctor Who and I love the old Doctor Who,” he said.
“But, even with all that love, you have to admit that the name of the programme had become a joke and its reputation had become a cheap joke at that – you know, rubber monsters and shaky sets.”
He added: “It’s been everything we planned and more, and it’s very rarely in life you get the chance to have that happen.”

By Gabriel Gatehouse
BBC News, Tallinn, Estonia
As Hillary Clinton battles to stay in the race for the White House does Tallinn hold the truth of an old legend that the former first lady once had a vodka drinking contest with her rival US presidential hopeful, Senator John McCain?
Picture the scene: August 2004, a congressional delegation from the US is visiting the Estonian capital, Tallinn.
The group includes two future presidential hopefuls – Hillary Clinton and John McCain.
After a long day of official meetings, the senators want to relax.
And what better way to do that, in the Baltics at least, than with a few good shots of vodka?
One thing leads to another and a contest develops – which Senator Clinton wins.
At least, that is according to Terry McAuliffe, chair of Mrs Clinton’s presidential campaign.
The cobbled streets of Tallinn’s walled old town are certainly picturesque. And there are plenty of pavement cafes, bars and restaurants, pulling in the punters.
But the alleged incident took place nearly four years ago, and my inquiries among the waiters and waitresses were getting me nowhere.
Rumour or fact?
Somebody pointed me in the direction of Molly Malone’s Irish Bar.
It seemed like a highly unlikely venue to me, but worth a try.
Inside I found Johan, an off-duty barman, sipping apple vodka with lime and ginger ale.
“I’ve heard they had a drinking match or something,” he told me.
“And that at the end of the day, John McCain said about Hillary Clinton that she could really hold her drink.”
It was a start but I needed an eyewitness, and Johan could not tell me where this fabled contest might have taken place.
It was becoming clear to me that I was not going to find what I was looking for by methodically trawling the many bars and restaurants of Tallinn.
So I paid a visit to the ministry of economic affairs.
The minister, Juhan Parts, was prime minister at the time, and he met the delegation.
They drank coffee, he told me, and even tasted some Estonian sweets. But there was no vodka contest.
“If there was something like this, it was definitely after their meeting with me, because I think they were very fresh and concentrated on the real topics.”
My next stop was the harbour. The senators were taken on a sailing trip round Tallinn Bay. The skipper that day was Capt Alar Volmeri.
Mrs Clinton and Mr McCain seemed to get on well together, he recalled.
They probably had little choice, cooped up with around 16 others on a 49ft boat.
But still no vodka.
Back in the centre of town, right opposite the ministry building, there is a restaurant called Gloria.
I had heard this place mentioned as a possible venue for a senatorial drinking contest.
Fuelling the hunt
So, I went to see the chef and owner, Dimitri Demjanov.
The place was certainly plush. I was ushered into a secluded booth. Behind a velvet curtain, the table was set for two. A waitress brought a plate of Baltic herring.
“Should I wait for Mr Demjanov?” I asked. I was told to go ahead – he would be with me shortly.
I was finally summoned downstairs.
Mr Demjanov, in a vast chef’s hat, was jovial but firm: “I don’t give information about my big customers,” he told me.
Something told me I was very close. I had to give this my best shot.
“If I ask you a series of very simple questions, you could give me a yes or no answer,” I suggested.
He did not object.
“So,” I began, “in August 2004, did John McCain and Hillary Clinton have dinner in your restaurant?”
“Yes,” came the one-word answer. Was there any vodka drunk? The answer, again, was: “Yes”.
I wanted to know how much. The chef said he could not remember. I jogged his memory, and it turned out they had downed four shots – each.
And then the crucial question: who won?
“Hillary won,” he said, without hesitation.
After four shots, he told me, she was still standing.
So what about John McCain?
There was a long pause. Mr Demjanov thought hard, and then concluded that Mr McCain had also remained standing.
This raised more questions than it answered: by what criteria had Mrs Clinton won the contest?
But Mr Demjanov had had enough. He laughed, but would divulge nothing more.

So, yeah, didn’t get the BBC job.  Ah well, their loss.
I’ve been spending some time deciding what my next move is.  I’m in the middle of writing a short story, so the plan at the moment is to finish that off then send it to some magazines and see if any would be interested in publishing it.
I might ask if anyone is interested in reading it and giving me feedback before then.  So, keep an eye out.
I’ve also got addicted to writing ficlets.  Main thing I like about it is the challenge it offers.  You have to write a story of between 64 and 1,024 characters.  Not words, characters.  It’s not as easy as it seems.  (In fact, a challenge for those stupidbrave enough to try it.  Write an entry of no more than 1,024 characters.)
The other good thing about the site is that if you read something written by someone else and it inspires you, you can write a prequel/sequel for it.  That’s what I did for my first ficlet.  You can read what I’ve written (if you so wish) here
Apart from that, not much has happened.  So I’ll sign off now.

1087,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/cinema-chatterboxes-must-die-3929936/,2008-05-02,Cinema chatterboxes must die,"
writes Donald Clarke.
Being the very model of a flabby western liberal, I pretend to oppose the re-introduction of the death penalty for even the most serious of crimes. Of course, like most reasonable people, I admit that, when subjected to an extreme outrage, I do find my hand itching for the noose or the deadly syringe.
Imagine the situation. You are sitting happily in the cinema when you become aware of an insistent droning emanating from the obese imbecile in front of you.
“Who’s he? Is he the man who was wearing the hat earlier?” he says before shovelling another hundredweight of salted corn kernels into his empty head.
“Paris . . . France . . . 12 o’clock,” his equally detestable mooncalf of a girlfriend says in response to a legend at the bottom of the screen. “Are they in France, now?”
State-approved slaughter is the only reasonable response to talking in the cinema. If you say nothing to the gibbering jackass you will be condemned to an hour or two of silent fuming. If, however, you do decide to have a word, then a simmering tension will hang about the auditorium until the credits roll. How much simpler it would be if you were allowed to whip out an axe – a chainsaw or a revolver might disturb the other cinema-goers – and neatly lop the offenders’ heads off. No decent person would mourn their passing.
Now, I know what you’re thinking. Screenwriter is, here, indulging in unhinged hyperbole. I’m not so sure. I would, I think, genuinely relish the public execution and disembowelment of cinema conversationalists. My girlfriend and I would, perhaps, draw up deckchairs before the scaffold and focus on the wrongdoers’ ashen faces as they were led towards oblivion.
“Who’s he? Is he the man with the popcorn?” I might say.
“I bet that man in the black hood is going to kill that foul woman,” she would reply. “Not so f**king chatty, now. Is she?”
When did people start behaving like pigs in the cinema? A degree of civility persisted throughout the 1960s and 1970s, so you certainly can’t blame the decline in conduct on habits picked up in front of broadcast television. Perhaps it was the arrival of video in the 1980s that blurred the distinction between living room and auditorium. If you jabber before Harry Potter at home then you may feel entitled to jabber before that wizard in public. Whatever the cause, there can be no doubt that today’s cinemagoers are less respectful towards the medium than their parents were.
Or can there? As late as the 1970s, when films still played in a continuous loop, it was quite normal to enter the cinema halfway through the action and remain seated until the next screening reached the point at which you came in. People smoked foul cigarettes, snogged furiously and, if stories about the release of Rock Around the Clock are to be believed, occasionally rioted in the sticky aisles.
They should have strung them all up. It’s the only language they understand.

1088,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/sex-pest-seal-attacks-penguin-3929935/,2008-05-01,Sex pest’ seal attacks penguin,"
By Matt Walker
BBC
An Antarctic fur seal has been observed trying to have sex with a king penguin.
The South African-based scientists who witnessed the incident say it is the most unusual case of mammal mating behaviour yet known.
The incident, which lasted for 45 minutes and was caught on camera, is reported in the Journal of Ethology.
The bizarre event took place on a beach on Marion Island, a sub-Antarctic island that is home to both fur seals and king penguins.
Why the seal attempted to have sex with the penguin is unclear. But the scientists who photographed the event speculate that it was the behaviour of a frustrated, sexually inexperienced young male seal.
Equally, it might be been an aggressive, predatory act; or even a playful one that turned sexual.
“At first glimpse, we thought the seal was killing the penguin,” says Nico de Bruyn, of the Mammal Research Institute at the University of Pretoria, South Africa.
Pinniped behaviour
The brazenness of the seal’s behaviour left those who saw it in no doubt as to what was happening.
De Bruyn and a colleague were on Trypot beach at Marion Island to study elephant seals when they noticed a young, adult male Antarctic fur seal, in good condition, attempting to copulate with an adult king penguin of unknown sex.
The 100kg seal first subdued the 15kg penguin by lying on it.
The penguin flapped its flippers and attempted to stand and escape – but to no avail.
The seal then alternated between resting on the penguin, and thrusting its pelvis, trying to insert itself, unsuccessfully.
After 45 minutes the seal gave up, swam into the water and then completely ignored the bird it had just assaulted, the scientists report.
Why a fur seal would indulge in such extreme sexual behaviour is unclear.
Sexual coercion among animals is extremely common: males of many species often harass, coerce or force females of their own kind to mate, while animals are also known occasionally to harass sexually a member of a closely related species.
Harassment is common among pinnipeds, the group of animals that includes seals, fur seals, and sea lions; and occasionally it happens between related species.
Male grey seals have been known to harass and mate with female harbour seals, for example, producing hybrids.
“Sexual harassment is often more commonplace in non-monogamous mating systems, and in species where males are physically much larger than the other sex and thus physically capable of coercion or harassment,” says de Bruyn.
But this is thought to be the first recorded example of a mammal trying to have sex with a member of another class of vertebrate, such as a bird, fish, reptile, or amphibian.
‘Too young’
Chinstrap penguins occasionally indulge in homosexual behaviour, and adelie penguins sometimes “prostitute” themselves to get stones for nest-building; while one in seven emperor penguins will change partners from one year to the next.
But generally, king penguins lead straightforward sex lives: males and females pair up for years on end.
Marion Island is the only place in the world where Antarctic fur seals are known to hunt king penguins on land, so the idea that the fur seal was trying to eat the object of its attention made sense.
“But then we realised that the seal’s intentions were rather more amorous.”
The researchers speculate that the male seal was too young to win access to female seals, and in a state of sexual excitement, looked elsewhere.
But the mating season was nearly over when the incident took place, leading the scientists to also wonder whether the seal’s natural predatory aggression toward the bird became redirected into sexual arousal.
Equally, the incident may have arisen because the seal was “play-mating”.
“It was most certainly a once-off and has never previously or since been recorded anywhere in the world to our knowledge,” says de Bruyn.
The penguin did not appear to have been injured by the seal, the scientists report.

Let me take you back in time.
It’s 1999 and I’m 20/21.  Studying at college, working at the cinema and enjoying nights out with my friends.
Two friends in particular stick out.  Lewis and Lindsey.
Now, Lewis fancies Lindsey.  This much is obvious to anyone with working eyes.  What a lot of people don’t know is that Lindsey, stuck in a relationship she doesn’t want to be in any more, fancies Lewis.
But I do.
Cos for about three bloody months, all I get from Lewis is how much he fancies Lindsey and all i get from Lindsey is how much she doesn’t want to be with her boyfriend and fancies Lewis.
On joint nights out and individual nights out with one or the other.  Meanwhile, I’m struggling through college, trying to juggle college, work, Boys Brigade and dealing with an idiotic supervisor who seems to keep forgetting that I can’t work Wednesdays.
Oh, almost forgot to mention that, as you would expect, neither of them wants me to tell the other one how they feel.
Eventually, I get pissed off, drag them both down the union, get them to tell each other how they feel, go to the toilet and come back to find them kissing.
Now, I’ll return you to the present day.  (You can tell I’m re-reading The Time Travellers Wife, can’t you?)
Two of my friends are Stuart and Jemma.  Stuart fancies Jemma and has done since they met.  Jemma likes Stuart as a friend but that is all, and he knows this.
Then, Stuart gets himself a girlfriend.  The first I know about this is when another mutual friend tells me he’s going on a date and won’t be at kareoke.  Jemma arrives, says about Stuart being busy, I say he’s on a date.
And all hell breaks loose.
Jemma freaks.  She’s a) single and pissed off about it, b) upset at the way she found out (which I don’t really blame her for) and c) paranoid that because stuart now has a girlfriend he’ll stop hanging out with her (which has happened to her before).
I manage to calm her down and we have a good night.  Until stuart turns up.
Then the three of us head to a nightclub.  Stuart is talking to me and to Jemma through me.  His assumption is that she’s jealous  that he’s going out with someone Not Her.  Jemma’s only speaking to me and I feel like I’m back in time.
This time, I’m trying to get two friends who don’t want to lose touch with each other to stop being so bloody stupid and work things out, my computer is still playing up (the process of loading the files to the online drive is taking longer than I thought it would and I was right about my external drive BSODing my laptop) and I want to get it done so I can do some writing, I owe my landlord money for my rent which I can’t afford to give him and there’s almost no prospect of work in Boro except the bloody call centre.  So, I’m a little bit stressed and really don’t need this.
So, I point out to him that she’s not jealous, she’s worried about losing him as a friend (and not just him, another mutual friend whos’ just got a girlfriend as well) and the shitty way she found out about the new girlfriend.  I point out to her that she is acting as if she’s jealous and that yes, it does suck that everyone else is getting together with someone (well, except me and her) but that’s just life.
I then go for a smoke, hopeing they’ll actually talk.
Come back and she’s still ignoring her.  I’m getting really pissed off at her about this and, before going for another smoke, beg her to let him speak, if only for the sake of my sanity.  I come back, get sent to the bar.  When I return they’re both dancing to Madness.  (Wednesday nights at The Crown is ’80’s night.  I think it’s great.)
We end the night by getting food, going back to mine, listening to music and chatting.
I swear I should be working as a peacekeeper for the UN.  My talents are wasted here.
And now I’m going to go watch some improv comedy.

By Joe Bavier Wed Apr 23, 1:07 PM ET
Police in Congo have arrested 13 suspected sorcerers accused of using black magic to steal or shrink men’s penises after a wave of panic and attempted lynchings triggered by the alleged witchcraft.
Reports of so-called penis snatching are not uncommon in West Africa, where belief in traditional religions and witchcraft remains widespread, and where ritual killings to obtain blood or body parts still occur.
Rumors of penis theft began circulating last week in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo’s sprawling capital of some 8 million inhabitants. They quickly dominated radio call-in shows, with listeners advised to beware of fellow passengers in communal taxis wearing gold rings.
Purported victims, 14 of whom were also detained by police, claimed that sorcerers simply touched them to make their genitals shrink or disappear, in what some residents said was an attempt to extort cash with the promise of a cure.
“You just have to be accused of that, and people come after you. We’ve had a number of attempted lynchings. … You see them covered in marks after being beaten,” Kinshasa’s police chief, Jean-Dieudonne Oleko, told Reuters on Tuesday.
Police arrested the accused sorcerers and their victims in an effort to avoid the sort of bloodshed seen in Ghana a decade ago, when 12 suspected penis snatchers were beaten to death by angry mobs. The 27 men have since been released.
“I’m tempted to say it’s one huge joke,” Oleko said.
“But when you try to tell the victims that their penises are still there, they tell you that it’s become tiny or that they’ve become impotent. To that I tell them, ‘How do you know if you haven’t gone home and tried it’,” he said.
Some Kinshasa residents accuse a separatist sect from nearby Bas-Congo province of being behind the witchcraft in revenge for a recent government crackdown on its members.
“It’s real. Just yesterday here, there was a man who was a victim. We saw. What was left was tiny,” said 29-year-old Alain Kalala, who sells phone credits near a Kinshasa police station.

By William Forbes
BOBDAMNIT!
That was the cry from the small office.  Obviously, something had gone wrong.  Which may have been a bit of an understatement.  When it was followed by the sight of the door literally flying across the room, that observation was confirmed.
When I get my hands on that oily little idiot, Ill force a broomstick straight through him and slow roast him.  Anyone fancy slow roasted politician for dinner tonight?
Jaim sat at his desk, head in hands, counting under his breath.  The Magical Restriction Legislation Act.  While not actually making magic illegal, it made things so difficult that it may as well be.
They had, of course, been assured that there was no chance of the law passing.  This government, they had been reliably informed, is not in the process of passing legislation making it impossible for legitimate businesses to continue their trade.  The magic industry brought many benefits to the community and the country as a whole.  That would not be allowed to be disrupted.
Jaim?  His boss was stood right beside his desk.  Jaim looked up and stopped counting.  He had reached 12.  You were the chief lobbyist on this one.  Find out what went wrong.
Jaim got up and left the office.  Great, why couldnt this be given to the investigative lot?
As Jaim approached the governing building, he felt unexpectedly nervous.  As the chief lobbyist on behalf of MagCorp he had visited this place many many times before.  So why was he so worried?
As he entered the building he was approached by the official Top Person in the government.  The two men shook hands.
Top Person, what happened?  How did the legislation pass? Jaim enquired.
Really cant tell you.  We ordered all our people to vote against, the other parties were, by and large, against it as well.  Then, when the call for the vote came, there were a few people on our side of the room, and the other side was so full there wasnt enough room for them all.
Did you notice anything unusual about the gate side area?
Actually, yes, came the reply.  There was a strange smell.
And were most of the people who voted against big office holders.
Well, with one or two exceptions they all held a big office post.
Jaim pondered this for a second.  Could you take me there?
As the two men walked through the building, Jaims mind was working.  Definitely had to be magic.  All ministers in the big office positions were treated so that magic had no effect on them.  This was a simple measure to make sure that they could not be unduly influenced.
The people were calling for all politicians to be so treated, a call that MagCorp backed.  They were worried about people using magic in an underhanded way and casting dispersions on the magic community at large.
They stopped beside the Voting Gates.  Two huge, cast iron gates over the entrances to the main debate hall.  The word Yup was beautifully inscribed across the top of one with Nope across the top of the other.  The process was simple.  When it was time for the debate to be over and the votes to be cast, a large gong was struck and the ceiling of the hall lowered.  The members of the hall then left through a door in the back and made their way to the gates.  They either walked through the Yup or Nope gate to indicate their vote on the issue at hand.  Once fully through the gate, there was no changing of minds.  The gate would not let you back through and an invisible barrier separated the two sides of the hall itself.
Jaim sniffed the air.  There was still a trace of something there.  He followed the weakening scent to a shelf behind the Yup gate.  There was a small bowl containing a dry powder, aquamarine in colour.  He lifted it up, and took a sniff of the powder before tasting it.  It was definitely a confuzzeling spell, with just the merest hint of something else.
Definitely magic? asked the Top Bloke.
Jaim smiled.  Oh yes!  Ill need to take this away for examining.  Well have a report for you in the morning.
The Top Bloke let out a relieved sigh.  So, Ill be able to call the result invalid due to outside influence?
Yup.
Thank Bob for that.  Dont want you lot trying to jinx me.
Jaim looked at the Top Bloke with a shark like grin on his face.  Would 
now be a good time to talk to you about the Politician Magical Protection act?
Back at the office and the results were in.  Tracing who originated any particular spell is easy.  When the spell is made, an ownership mark is put in place.  This is not due to any rule except that of nature.  Most magical organisations keep a database of these marks.  This makes it easier to discover when a magical being has gone rogue, or just when someone messed up a spell.  It also helps to locate new magical beings and arrange their training and prevents magical beings from being affected by their own spells.
But this was surprising.  The perpetrator was Qitor Badang.  Widely expected to be a great magical being when in training, he stunned everyone when, after graduation, he completely shunned the magical world and lived normally.  He had not appeared on the magical radar since.
Sighing, Jaim connected to the magibase and the relevant information scrolled through his brain.  There it was, the address he needed.  He got up and walked out of the office.  He had already been instructed to deal with this one personally.  He had let the investigative team know where he was going anyway, just in case.
As he approached the house, he was still struggling to work out why this was happening.  There was nothing on the magibase that indicated why Qitor had decided to do this, and everything about him was on the magibase.
Just as Jaim was about to knock on the door, it swung open, revealing to Jaim a perfectly empty hallway and, beyond that, an empty kitchen.  Just then a male voice, deep and slightly booming, made him jump.
Hello there.  Ive been expecting you.  Why dont you come on up?
Jaim tentatively entered the house and climbed the stairs.  He looked round at the three closed doors.  Suddenly, the one on front of him opened.
And there sat Qitor, mixing something in a bowl.  Come on in.  Im just preparing a little something.
Another confuzzeling spell with a hint of obey?
Yes, young Jaim.  Cos Im going to use the same spell twice in a row.  What can I say, Im just that stupid.
So, why did you do it?
Qitor stopped mixing the spell and leaned back.  Do you remember the first bit of magic you ever performed?
Jaim knew it was a daft question.  Every magical being remembered that.  Yes, it was a simple invisibility potion my dad had taught me.
Well, mine teleported my mother somewhere.  As I didnt know what I was doing, Im not sure where.  Ive been looking for her ever since.
So why help the bill to pass? Jaim asked.  Surely it would make your life more difficult.
Ive discovered that although I have a lot of ability, I dont have all the skills I need to find her and get her back.  Ill need the help of others for that.
Jaim quickly caught on.  Ahhh.  So by helping the bill pass, you can drive our kind underground and get the help you need better?
No.  The purpose wasnt to get the bill to pass.  I agree with you, the bill is bad news for all magical beings.  All I needed was for it to pass once, then the help I need would come to me.
You mean
Why do you think that daddy dearest sent you to confront me rather than someone from investigations?  Qitor smiled.  And I didnt lie to you earlier when I said this is not the same spell as before.  This one is an obey spell with a side order of confuzzelment.
Qitor lifted the bowl to his mouth and muttered a few words.  He then threw his head back, and a small flame detached from the overhead light and gently floated down into the bowl, setting the powder alight.  He then looked at Jaim.
Remember, breathe deeply

1094,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/drunk-darth-vaders-jedi-assault-3929929/,2008-04-22,Drunk Darth Vader’s Jedi assault,"
A man posing as Darth Vader attacked a Star Wars fan, who had founded a Jedi Church, a court has heard.
Arwel Wynne Hughes, 27, from Holyhead, Anglesey, admitted assaulting Barney Jones and cousin Michael with a metal crutch. They suffered minor injuries.
Hughes, who was drunk and dressed in a black bin bag, shouted “Darth Vader!”
Earlier, when Hughes failed to arrive on time, District Judge Andrew Shaw issued an arrest warrant, adding: “I hope the force will soon be with him.”
In the event, Hughes turned up and the case at Holyhead magistrates court resumed.
The court heard he had jumped over a garden wall wearing the bin bag before the attack.
Outlining the case againt Hughes, prosectutor Nia Lloyd said Barney Jones had recently started the Jedi church in Holyhead – in honour of the Star Wars’ good knights.
It had about 30 members locally and “thousands worldwide”.
The cousins had been filming themselves playing with light sabres in the garden before the attack.
Hughes admitted two charges of common assault.
The court heard he has a “chronic alcohol problem” and had drunk the best part of a 10 litre box of wine.
Mrs Lloyd said: “He was wearing a black bin bag and a cape and had a metal crutch in his hand.”
Mrs Lloyd said he was shouting “Darth Vader”.
She added that Hughes hit Barney Jones over the head with the crutch, leaving him with a headache.
He then laughed and hit Michael Jones in the thigh, causing bruising.
Both men were left upset by the incident and they believed it was pre-planned.
She added that the pair believe “very strongly in the church and their religion”.
Hughes could not remember the incident and only realised what had happened when he read about it in local newspapers, the court told.
Defending, Frances Jones said alcohol was “ruining his life” and he had no idea where he got the crutch from.
The court head Hughes had previous convictions, including affray, assault and disorderly behaviour.
The judge warned Hughes that jail remained a possibility before adjourning for pre-sentence reports until 13 May.

…Broadcasters
Posted April 15, 2008 | 04:47 PM (EST)

The following is my opening keynote speech for the National Association of Broadcasters Show in Las Vegas, which I delivered Monday night.
Hello, I’m Tim Robbins. I’d like to thank you for the invitation to address you here at the National Association of Broadcasters. When I first received the invitation I was a little confused because the last time I had contact with the national media I seem to remember them telling me to shut the hell up.
I would like to start with an apology. To Rush and Sean, and Billo and Savage and Laura what’s-her-name. A few years ago they told America that because I had different opinions on the wisdom of going to war that I was a traitor, a Saddam lover, a terrorist supporter, undermining the troops. I was appealing at the time for the inspectors to have more time to find those weapons of mass destruction. I was a naïve dupe of left wing appeasement. And how right they were. If I had known then what I know now, if I had seen the festive and appreciative faces on the streets of Baghdad today, if I had known then what a robust economy we would be in, the unity of our people, the wildfire of democracy that has spread across the Mideast, I would never have said those traitorous, unfounded and irresponsible things. I stand chastened in the face of the wisdom of the talk radio geniuses, and I apologize for standing in the way of freedom.
So when they asked me to come speak to you I said, “Are you sure? Me?” And they said, “Yes.”
And I said, “You know, I have a tendency to say things that I believe at the time to be well-intentioned but that are actually traitorous.” And they said, “Sure, cool.” And then I read the press release and it said, “Mr. Robbins will be speaking about the challenges of new media and delivery systems.” Oh, OK. But I just want you to know I’m not sure I know what that fucking means.
But it is an honor to be speaking to you here at this years National Association Broadcasting convention even if I don’t know what the hell I’m talking about.
I owe a lot to broadcast media. I got my start in radio in the early 20s. In my early twenties. And it was television.
But these tremendous inventions have benefited us all.
Radio has come a long way from the early days when family’s gathered around the trusty old Philco to listen to such programs as Superman, Sherlock Holmes and Amos and Andy. Thanks to music and sound effects, this magical medium was able to transport families to a place where a man could fly, a brilliant detective could solve the most perplexing of crimes, and two white guys could portray ridiculously offensive black stereotypes for the amusement of millions.
The first broadcast occurred on Christmas Eve in 1906 at Brant Rock, MA, when a man named Fessenden played his violin, sang a song and read Bible verses into a wireless telephone of his own invention. His goal was to find financial backers, but no investor of the day believed that radio could ever replace the most popular leisure activity of the day; listening to the hoot owl while playing the zither as your 14-year-old niece bounced on your knee. Some of you may remember. It was all the rage in the early century.
But soon broadcasting over the radio caught on and zither playing and child molestation were a thing of the past. Radio reached a boom time during the Depression as people begin to listen to and depend on radio to lift their spirits during that catastrophic economic crisis. Shows such as The Bickersons taught people life is not so bad as long as somebody has got it worse.
President Roosevelt became the first “radio president” and his “fireside chats” set the stage for later presidential weekly addresses such as; “chew the fat with Ike,” “LBJ’s bull session,” and George W’s “Hooked on Phonics and Strategery Hour.”
Radio continued to expand and soon, the public turned to their radios for news, which began to mature during World War II with the regular reports of the bombing of London by Edward R. Murrow, with his “London After Dark” series, where Murrow coined the famous phrase: “Good Night and Good Luck” as well as the lesser known phrase; “Die, you Nazi cocksuckers.”
In the post war years, the radio business exploded when 90% of all American’s claimed radio was their primary source of news and entertainment. To meet this incredible demand Philco built 6 million radios in 1947. And to provide content for those 6 million radios, we were introduced to some of the greatest drama, comedy and musical entertainment this country has ever seen.
In the ’70s, radio took a serious nosedive when Edwin Armstrong invented FM to eliminate the static and noise associated with AM and unwittingly provided a home for easy listening jazz rock, overly dramatic disco songs and 20 minute psychedelic sitar jams.
In the ’80s and ’90s the FCC, under pressure from the Reagan and Clinton administrations, changed the rules limiting the number of radio and television stations a business entity could own, paving the way for such conglomerates as Infinity broadcasting and Clear Channel to buy up local stations and put them under the umbrella of their larger corporations. Again the community benefited because due to Clear Channel and Infinities’ conservative approach, listeners no longer had to be subjected to perplexing controversial subjects, or confusing varied opinion, or alternative rock. And as a bonus these large companies, with the help of Mr. Reagan and Mr. Clinton got rid of that annoying Fairness Doctrine, freeing its listeners from the burden of hearing equally from all sides of the political debate. What a bore.
This new world of conglomeration also brought us back to a simpler, more exciting time with regard to natural disasters and calamities. Your local station would now be broadcasting from a city many miles away and should there be a tornado coming your way you wouldn’t know about it until the funnel was in full view. Exciting times.
In the 1950s, television began to replace radio as the chief source of revenue for broadcasting networks. It quickly became apparent that talking about “Old Sandusky Lager” on the radio didn’t quite have the same impact as watching a buxom flaxen haired temptress in a skin tight dress play pool in a bar while she drank “old Sandusky Lager.” Beer sales skyrocketed.
In the ’60s, American television networks began broadcasting in color bringing a new vibrant reality to the content of the day. Suddenly it didn’t seem unusual that an astronaut was dating a scantily clad genie that lived in a bottle in his living room.
Television also brought the horror and reality of war into our living rooms airing footage of the war in Vietnam. Building on the mistakes of the past, war is now televised in an easily digestible sanitized version. The current administration has proven that war doesn’t have to be upsetting, or sacrificed for, or even reported on at all. We have come a long way, baby.
But what is the state of broadcasting today? Some critics have noted that there is a dangerous lack of diversity and opinion. Thatmay be true, but imagine the nightmare of having to rectify that situation.
I propose a much simpler solution, which I’ve separated into three prongs, or a Satan’s trident if you will.
First, erase all diversity. Thankfully the majority of what is broadcast over television and radio is of two opinions and that feels good. That’s simple. But unfortunately there is a tiny minority out here on the airwaves expressing a different view outside of the Democrats and Republicans nexus trying to confuse us all. Can we please shut them up? How expensive could it be to buy Pacifica Radio? These people are driving us apart.
Secondly, let’s stay focused on Sex Scandals. Stop with the in depth reporting that gets outside of the sound bite. More sex scandals! Surely with a little more prying, a little more effort we can find more sexual deviants. And trust me, sexual deviancy is something we can all agree on. It’s deliciously intoxicating to watch unfold. It’s titillating.
The absolute zenith of news, the perfect storm of reporting, the shining city on the hill in news coverage was Lewinsky v Clinton. Now that was fun. We couldn’t get enough of that. There were salacious details, semen stains, oral sex. And the president lied. He threatened every notion of marriage and the sanctity of family. He put our country at risk. And when he did lie we held his feet to the fire. We reported on every angle, every permutation of the story. We held hearings, appointed an independent council, led off every newscast for months about the lie, played it until there was no hiding from it, and then held him accountable by impeaching him. It is our moral responsibility to report on the sex lives of the powerful. It is the only thing that kept our country alive at that point. It righted our ship of state. It saved our collective soul. And it was great, juicy fun. Imagine what would have happened to our country’s soul if the president lied and nothing was done about it, if impeachment was off the table. Where would we be today if we did not hold our president accountable?
Third, find more racially divisive news and play that constantly. As long as we hate each other we will never be bothered with this gnawing lefty obsession with information. Let’s make the purpose of the media salacious entertainment, not information. The more our news outlets and talk radio can distract us the better. We love distraction. When the nattering nabobs of negativity tell you that the economy is falling apart, that gas costs four dollars a gallon, that they are foreclosing on your home, that there is chaos in Iraq, when these propagandists spread this “information” it is our moral responsibility to distract. I don’t know about you but show me a starlet without panties getting out of a car and suddenly the world seems like a better place. Show me Knight Rider drunk on the floor eating a hamburger, and I won’t ask why my kid has no health insurance. Let’s stop burdening people with facts. I bet some of you are saying; “Sure Tim, there’s no question, sex scandals, race riots and drunken TV stars are a lot of fun, but shouldn’t broadcasters see themselves as part of the larger picture? Isn’t there an obligation to honestly report on what is going on, to pursue stories past their headlines? Haven’t criminal acts occurred in government? Shouldn’t there be accountability for inept policy decisions? Shouldn’t someone be fired?” And you know something? I didn’t hear any of that because I’m still thinking about that starlet getting out of the car without her panties. You see, that doesn’t take any energy. I know exactly what to think about.
Now some of you are concerned with that unrelenting pesky competition. You know, the new technologies; the Internets and satellite radio and television. The problem is there are too many people in this country that take the notion of creativity and invention too damn seriously. Just when one technology is centralized, conglomerated, monopolized, along come new technologies and delivery systems to threaten the good work born of deregulation. Just when we were getting close to a national playlist for our music, satellite technology is threatening to provide music that people actually want to hear. Just when we were close to a national news media, providing a general consensus on what the truth is, along comes the Internets that allow its users a choice on the kinds of news it watches. And the You Tube. My God we’ve got to stop them. Recently when we were about to enjoy our great national pastime of ‘tearing apart a presidential candidate with relentless repetition of ugly things his friend said’, You Tube provided the candidates reasoned response and millions watched and responded positively.
Well you here at NAB have the power to stop this dangerous technology. The question is, how? I respectfully suggest that you do what others have done when facing the competition of new technologies. Get compromising information on your enemy and expose them in a sex scandal. Or call them a racist, or better yet a traitor. That not only undermines your competitor, but provides the public with fantastic entertainment.
Of course you can do that. And no one in this current world would fault you for it. It is, after all, where we stand today. In all seriousness folks, let’s face it. We are at an abyss as a country and as an industry. And I know that saying we are at an abyss isn’t the stuff of keynote addresses but all sarcasm and irony and rude pithiness aside, we are at a critical juncture in this nation’s history. This is a nation divided and reeling from betrayal and economic hardships. And you, the broadcasters of this great nation have a tremendous power, and a tremendous potential to effect change. You have the power to turn this country away from cynicism. You have the power to turn this nation away from the hatred and the divisive dialogue that has rendered such a corrosive affect on our body politic. You can lift us up into a more enlightened age. Or you can hide behind that old adage; “I’m just a businessman, I provide what the audience wants.” Well, I’m here to tell you that we don’t need to look at the car crash. We don’t need to live off of the pain and humiliation of the unfortunate. We don’t need to celebrate our pornographic obsession with celebrity culture. We are better than that.
Some of you are trying. Some of you are inspiring people towards altruism and compassion with your programming. Some of you are trying to lift the civic dialogue into a more responsible and adult arena. But I know you do so against the odds of ratings and job security. It is really up to the leaders in this room. It is up to you, the scions of this industry to leave behind formulas and focus groups and your own fears of job security. Only with your courage and your vision can we begin to imagine a world of broadcasting where the general consensus of those with real power say “Enough is enough. Now is the time to move away from our lesser selves. Now is the time to stop making money on the misfortunes of others and the prurient and salacious desires of the public. Now is the time to admit and recognize that we aren’t just businessmen but the guardians of the human spirit, with a responsibility to the health of this nation. That we can lift this country up with our programming, that instead of catering to the gossips and the scolds and the voyeurs we can appeal to the better nature in our audience, the better nature of what this country is all about.”
This is a country filled with people of great compassion and tremendous generosity. This is a country that has survived dust bowls and depressions, that united to defeat Hitler and fascism and communism. We are a resilient people and a tenacious people. And we are ready for change.
Imagine a new broadcasting industry aesthetic, that respecting the better nature of the American people, produces shows that promote strength instead of fear. That does not divide, but inspires, that does not promote hate, but unity, that will not tear the weak down, but build up their strength. Imagine a world of broadcasting where the American people are encouraged to reject despair and distrust. And when they turn their TVs and radios off at night and go to sleep they possess strength, and unity and compassion for those they disagree with. That’s not out of the question. You can make that happen. It will be difficult, and will fly in the face of conventional wisdom, and standard operational procedures. But do we have any choice? The road we are on is leading us to a corruption of our former selves. We are better than that. You can help us reclaim our better nature, our perfect union. It isn’t necessarily a matter of country before profit, or of patriotism and truth before personal comfort. There could be money to be made in appealing to our better selves. Wouldn’t that be great?
And if there isn’t and we came out of it a little less rich but more unified and healthier as a nation wouldn’t that be something we could all be proud of?

1097,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/confession-269-3929926/,2008-04-14,Confession,"
The genesis for this was this entry from Pheric, in which he proposed that American football be called throwball, as that is the most descriptive name.
One reader took offence to that and blasted him for it.  Then Popeyechicken pointed out in this entry that I am guilty of anti – American spelling, like honour.
That got me thinking.  And I’ve decided to come clean.
I hate America.
I hate any and everything about America.  If you’re American and on my favourites list, don’t be fooled, I hate you.  Even if you’re American, live in a different country now and are on my favourites list, I still hate you.  You may not live there anymore but you are still American.  And so, I hate you.
I hate everything to come out of America.  Especially Buffy the Vamipre Slayer, Angel, Firefly, Battlestar Galactica (new version), Pushing Daisies, The West Wing, Studio 60 On The Sunset Strip, Family Guy, American Dad (double hatred for that as it has the word American in the title), Wonderfalls, Dead Like Me, MST3K, the films of Charlie Kaufmann, Martin Scorsese and Kevin Smith, anything Pixar has ever made, The Godfather, Brick, Citizen Kane, Bruice Springsteen, Bon Jovi, They Might Be Giants, Nine Inch Nails, Aimee Mann, To Kill A Mockingbird, The Catcher In The Rye and Bill Bryson books.
Who needs that when Britain has given the world Sex Lives Of The Potato Men, Pop Idol/The X Factor, Catherine Tate, I’d Do Anything, The Spice Girls, Take That, East 17, Garry Glitter, Ricky Gervaise and cricket.
So, there you have it.  I am indeed plotting from within (the University of Teeside LRC, Middlesbrough, England) to take down America by misspelling words.  I blame my education.
Now, if you’ll excuse me, I must go home, eat crumpets, drink tea and plan the next step in the inevitable downfall of America.  The honour of the world is at stake.
Oh, and raise the airfare to Camp X-Ray.

So, I’m up to 22 pages of my Screnzy script.  Which is far behind where I wanted to be at this stage in the month.  But I was expecting this to happen any so, hey ho.
Apart from that, not really been up to much.  I am forced to watch Dr who on a Sunday instead of Saturday as one of my housemates has nicked the ariel for the TV in the living room.  GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!
(Incidentally, I am so jealous of Americans who will be getting a Dr Who/BSG double bill.  Lucky swine!)
Overall, I did enjoy the first episode of Dr Who except for one thing.  I gave her a chance, I really did.  But now the question must be asked:
Who the frak told Catherine Tate that she could act?  Cos that’s a cruel, cruel trick to play on the girl.
She’s just…  She’s just not that good.  There were scenes in the episode which had to be played with incredible subtlelty and she could not do it!
Still looking for work.  I have applied for a metorship thing with the BBC.  Still to hear back, so fingers crossed.
And that’s about it.  Gone on a few nights out and grabbed a girls asre.  Twice.
Pics!

I’m trying to decide if this is the club that never opens or if it’s the club that never shuts.

Mar 29 2008 by Gareth Lightfoot, Evening Gazette
A FORMER Boys Brigade captain is today facing a long prison sentence after he was found guilty of a string of child sex offences from up to 40 years ago.
Kenneth Charles Williams, 68, was unanimously convicted by a jury at Teesside Crown Court yesterday of 11 charges of indecent assault and one other serious sexual offence.
A victim of Williams today spoke of how the abuse had cast a shadow over his life and urged other victims of sexual abuse not to suffer in silence.
The repeated sex crimes against two boys date back up to 40 years, when ex-steel worker Williams was living in Middlesbrough.
The first complainant, now a married dad in his forties, told the Gazette today: Im absolutely elated.
I was just so pleased when I heard those verdicts read out.
Its taken such a long time. Its been on my mind for years and years. Its just one of those things you try to put to the back of your mind. You try to block it out.
Williams, of Scalby Square, Thornaby, denied all of the offences.
He claimed the victims made up the allegations, but could not explain why. He said: Its just not feasible, Im not that kind of person.
But one of his victims told the Gazette how the assaults which terrified him were dismissed by Williams as a bit of fun.
He said Williams did not meet his gaze across the courtroom as the two came face-to-face for the first time in decades.
From the beginning Ive wanted to see him in court, he added.
I wanted him to look at me in the witness box. He wouldnt turn. He didnt look at me once.
I wanted him to look me in the eye and he couldnt.
It did hit me hard in the stomach when I first saw him. But I came to tell the truth.
He told his wife years ago of the abuse, but did not make an official complaint until last year.
As a youngster he felt frightened, intimidated and confused, then as an adult embarrassed to speak out. As you grow up you dont want to talk to anybody about it. Even with my wife its difficult, he said.
But he realised his past traumas spoiled his family, inhibiting him from showing affection to his children for fear of it being misconstrued.
He pleaded with others in a similar position to report abuse to police. He said: To be perfectly honest it was a lot easier than I thought it was going to be because of the way the police handled it.
He thanked Detective Constable Sharon Husband, from Cleveland Police child protection unit, for discreet, professional and understanding handling of the case, and court staff and his family for help and support.
He added that Williams testimony was absolutely ridiculous.
Your dream would be for him to stand up and say, I did it, in an ideal world. But that wasnt going to happen.
Williams used to be the captain of a Boys Brigade company attached to a Middlesbrough church and was responsible for the welfare of about 100 boys aged eight to 19.
The second complainant was in his teens when Williams repeatedly indecently assaulted him, once taking him into Linthorpe cemetery and carrying out a serious sexual assault.
Judge George Moorhouse told Williams: These are very serious charges and I can assure you, you will be receiving a lengthy prison sentence.
Williams was allowed conditional bail until he is sentenced in about three weeks time. He must register as a sex offender.

Life is what you make it.  That was the lesson that was imprinted on my brain since before I can remember.  But heres one you may not have heard:
You are what life makes you.
And here I sit.  With nothing but time on my side.  So I am able to ponder the event that led to this.
I thought things were so fucking simple.  Then the event.
I guess I pissed off the wrong deity.  Not sure which one.  Either that or the cosmos decided to have some fun with me.
I had a normal life.  At least by the standard definition.  Wife, kids, the whole kit and caboodle.  Then I got the offer.
Was going to say no.  Why was I going to say anything else?  There was literally nothing else I wanted.  But then he pulled out the trump card.
A video.  Of the future.  I know how that sounds, but it did look amazingly real.
Me and the missus, we were fine.  Completely fine.
Well, apart from the fact that we barely spoke and introduced each other to our respective girl/boyfriends.  In her case, both.
My son, my darling boy, had been killed in a hit and run.  He wasnt even supposed to be there, but there he was.
As for my little girl, she couldnt cope.  A very rapid descent into drugs.  She ended up as a crack whore.
It was all very convincing.  And all I had to do to change things was win a coin toss.  So I went for it.
And this is what life made me.
Eternal, stuck in this room, surrounded by images of my family getting on with life.
And the guy who won the toss dating my wife.

So, no treat for you yet.  I’m not going to say what it was going to be, because it could happen this weekend.
For the past few days I’ve been craving spaghetti bolognaise.  So, tomorrow, I’m going to cook some for myself.  Can’t wait.
And I’mgearing up for Script Frenzy.  I’ve actually decided to work on episodes 5 and 6 of the series.  Due to the way it’s structured, that makes most sense.
Oh, and big thanks to A Rather Shady Mogwi for the awesome icon.  I especially love the fact that if the border was removed it would blend right in to the background.:¬)
Rant time.
As you lot probably know, Simon Pegg is playing Scotty in the new star Trek film.  As you probably also know, my choice would have been someone who is actually Scottish.  But I was willing to go along with thing.
Then today, I read an interview that Pegg did with aintitcool.com in which he states that he has been working on his accent with his wife, his family in Scotland and a crewmember who is Glaswegian.
Yup, it looks like Scottish Accent Symdrome has struck again.
SAS, for those who are unaware, is the tendency for people outside Scotland to assume that when playing a Scottish character, a vaguely sounding accent will suffice, regardless of where the character is actually from.  So, you get an Orkadian who sounds Glaswegian, A Glaswegian who has a strange Borders mix accent and, in this case, an Aberdonian with a Glaswegian accent.
While there are regional versions in England (everyone from the north east is Geordie, everyone from London is either a toff or a cockney), the syndrome gets it’s name as it assumes that Scots have interchangable accents.
(For American readers, imagine how annoying it would be is a character from upper Manhattan had a deep south accent.)
While it won’t stop me from enjoying the film (JJ Abrams may just do that), it is still going to irk me.
Rant over.
Hopefully, I’ll be able to watch the Scotland match in the union bar.  And hopefully Scotland will win so I can take the piss out of my English friends.
Anyhoo, have to go watch a film.  Speak later.

1105,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/cigarette-display-ban-considered-3929918/,2008-03-23,Cigarette display ban considered,"
Displaying cigarettes in shops could be banned in England under government plans being considered to cut smoking and discourage children from starting.
Tougher controls on vending machines in pubs and restaurants are also being discussed, and the public will be consulted on the proposals soon.
Ex-smoker and Tory leader David Cameron said the idea was worth looking at.
But the Association of Convenience Stores said the move would be ineffective and present major problems.
It said forcing shops to hide their cigarettes would create practical difficulties and result in extra expense for shop owners.
Under the counter
Outlining the proposals, Public Health Minister Dawn Primarolo said it was “vital” to teach children that “smoking is bad”.
“If that means stripping out vending machines or removing cigarettes from behind the counter, I’m willing to do that,” she said.
Ms Primarolo stressed: “Children who smoke are putting their lives at risk and are more likely to die of cancer than people who start smoking later.”
Opposition leader Mr Cameron backed the idea, saying: “As someone who struggled with giving up smoking, it helps if you take away some of the temptation.
“It is difficult and there will be all sorts of problems in terms of the layout of shops, that’s why it is right to have a consultation.
“Let’s not rule it out,” he added.
The measures could effectively force the sale of cigarettes and tobacco products under the counter in convenience shops and supermarkets.
Measures that make it easier to sell nicotine replacement gums and patches are also under consideration.
The Department of Health, which is keen to prevent youngsters from smoking, has cited research that suggests someone who starts smoking at the age of 15 is three times more likely to die of smoking-related cancer than someone who starts in their late 20s.
The proposed measures come after this year’s Budget in which Chancellor Alistair Darling increased the duty on tobacco, adding 11p to the price of a packet of 20 cigarettes and 4p to the price of five cigars.
The chancellor also said the government was continuing the 5% reduced rate of VAT on smoking cessation products beyond 30 June.
A ban on smoking in public places and workplaces in England came into force last July.
Bans were introduced in Scotland in 2006, and in Wales and Northern Ireland in 2007.

How many people, honestly, do they think walk into a shop, look at the cigarette display and decide “I know!  I’ll take up smoking!”  Or lookat a vending machine in a bar and think the same thing?

Rowan Bridge
BBC News, Liverpool
An anti-smoking group in Liverpool is calling for all movies with smoking scenes to be given an 18 certificate.
SmokeFree Liverpool told BBC’s Radio 5 Live it wanted to see the change but the film classification board said the idea was “heavy-handed”.
The push – backed by the city council – comes amid research showing young people pick up the bad habit from watching films containing smoking.
One city official said Liverpool may even act alone to restrict film access.
Andy Hull, the city’s head of public protection and chair of SmokeFree Liverpool, said an adult rating on movies that depict smoking will reduce the number of young people lighting up.
“The international evidence…is that one in two children between 11 and 18 who witness smoking in movies actually experiment with – and therefore start – smoking themselves,” Mr Hull said of recent research.
Liverpool already carries the unenviable title of lung cancer capital of England, with some of the highest smoking rates in the UK.
Not popular
Mr Hull said Liverpool wants the British Board of Film Classification to act.
But a spokeswoman for the film board said smoking and alcohol use are already taken into consideration when a film is rated and a blanket 18 certificate for all smoking scenes is “heavy handed”.
“To simply classify a film 18 because people smoke in it would not be popular with the public,” the spokeswoman said, adding an extensive public consultation has already examined the issue to come up with existing guidelines.
For example, if a character popular with children such as Harry Potter was somehow promoting cigarettes or seen smoking, the film would be rated accordingly, she said.
“We would take that very seriously,” she added.
Dr Stacey Anderson, of the UK Centre for Tobacco Control Studies, said the evidence of smoking’s influence on young people is very clear.
“The more smoking a child views in films, the more likely they are to take up smoking,” she said of the scientific evidence gathered in the United States and elsewhere.
Dr Anderson said characters do not even have to be smoking for there to be an adverse influence, just the sight of a pack of cigarettes or a tobacco advertisement has an effect on youth attitude.
She said if part of the role of the film board is to protect young people from potential harm, then smoking should be included in those considerations.
Mr Hull said if the BBFC is not prepared to adopt an 18 certificate then the city will consider using licensing laws to bring in its own stricter ratings for films screened locally.

Oh, for the love of FSM!
Let’s see, you can no longer smoke in public areas in Britain (in Middlesbrough that includes public parks), they’re looking to stop people smoking in their own homes when workmen/health workers are due round, they’ve banned all tobacco advertising (including signs in shop windows advertising the price of cigarettes/tobacco/cigars), about half the packets consist of a health warning and there is copious advertising on TV, radio and the papers about the health risks.
But this is what’s going to stop people from taking up smoking.

It’s the only explanation I can think of.
My right shoulder has been hurting for a few days now.  It affects the whole arm, but usually manifests itself as a ring of pain right around the shoulder.
As this is the shoulder I carry my laptop bag on, this is not good.
Yesterday morning, my left shoulder decided that it must be missing out on some fun and decided to join in.  So, that’s hurting too.  (That one’s more like a small sharp pain just below the neck.)
So, yeah.  My body hates me.  It’s the only possible explanation.
What else?
Was dragged out to a friends friends birthday night out last night.  We were going to go to one place, but they were charging entry, so we went to another pub.  Outside the second pub, there were some girls on a hen night and they asked that I pose for a picture with two of them.  (Niehter one was the bride to be though.)  Not only that, but when one of my friend volunteered to be in the pics, they specifically asked for me!
Kinda did the ego good, that.

*EDIT*
GODDAMN MUTHERFUCKING TWATTYWAFFLES!
So, here’s the story.
Last week, i managed to fry my mobile phone by accedentally plugging the charger for my digital camera into it.  (The connections are the same, so it’s an easy mistake to make.  Though I may have been slightly intoxicated at the time.)
On Thursday I phoned Virgin mobile about the problem after topping up my phone.  (I caould have used a payphone but calls from a virgin mobile number are a flat reate of 10p.)
They decided that the phone was fucked and I needed a replacement.  It was due to be delivered on Friday.
I forgot to set my alarm to get me up early and, as my room is at the back of the house and the door is PVC (therefore not good for hearing people knock), I missed the delivery.  I phoned the number on the card that was left and arranged delivery for Saturday.
Got upearly on Saturday and waited for the delivery.  (I even watched the Coronation Street omnibus FFS) and it never arrived.  So, I thought it had been put back till today.
So once again I got up early today and waited in the living room for the phone.  (And suddenly remembered why I no longer own a TV.  There’s frak all on.)  By 12:30, still no sign of the phone, I phone back to find out what was happening.
I was expecting to hear that it was on it’s way and to sit tight.  What i was told instead was that the delivery was on hold and that it hadn’t been sent out from the base!
I explained that I had been assured that it would be delivered on Saturday, only to be told that I should have gone through VIrgin Mobileto arrange that as it casts more.
(This I know to be complete bullshit as the last time I needed a mobile replaced it was delivered on the Saturday at no extra cost.)
So, it’s being delivered tomorrow.  In the meantime I’m left using my unreliable old phone.
And now I have to go to the doctors.

The PM’s spokesman said he welcomed the “interesting” review, adding that it had sparked “quite a lively debate”.
However, John Dunford from the Association of School and College leaders said the citizenship ceremony was “a half-baked idea”.
Graduation ceremonies
A Scottish Government spokesman said it did not support the plan and did not believe it would find favour with parents or school pupils.
Welsh Deputy First Minister Ieuan Wyn Jones said: “I don’t think that’s appropriate myself.”
And Labour peer Baroness Kennedy said: “I think this is a serious mistake – I think it’s puerile and I think it’s rather silly.
“The symbols of a healthy democracy are not to be found in empty gestures and I’m afraid I see this as an empty gesture.”
Lord Goldsmith, who quit government in June, believes that citizenship ceremonies for teenagers would help improve their sense of what it means to be a British citizen.
“Certainly there isn’t a crisis of national identity, but the research does tend to show there’s been a diminution in national pride, in this sense of belonging,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.
“The citizenship ceremonies, which are just one of the many things I have suggested, are a way of marking that passage of being a student of citizenship to a citizen in practice.
“It does make sense to promote a sense of shared belonging, a sense that you are part of a community with a common venture, to integrate better newcomers to our society and be clearer about what the rights and responsibilities are.”
Lord Goldsmith said that while he favours an oath of allegiance to the Queen, the statement could be a pledge of commitment to the country or a statement of what the rights and responsibilities of citizens are.
He also stressed that he could not see why Republicans would not want to swear an oath, even though they may not believe in the present system of government.
However, Graham Smith of the group Republic, which campaigns for the abolition of the monarchy, questioned whether children who refuse to take part will be told “they are somehow less British or less loyal or less patriotic”.
Shadow justice secretary Nick Herbert said people would see straight through “synthetic patriotism” and that it was “profoundly un-British” to make them swear oaths of allegiance.
Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg said taking an active role in society was a better way of creating a sense of belonging for teenagers than asking people to swear allegiance.
Bank holiday
Citizenship ceremonies already exist for immigrants and the report suggests holding them in schools, where youngsters who are about to leave the school and move on to work or further education could participate.
Lord Goldsmith says a new British national day should be established by 2012 to coincide with the Olympics and what will be the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee.
It could operate in the same way as Australia Day, which is a public holiday on 26 January and is used to celebrate what it means to be an Australian.
And young people who volunteer could receive a reduction in tuition fees, while others who work in the community could be given a small council tax rebate.
A new “Deliberation Day” would be held before each General Election to encourage political debate and other events.
The peer also proposed that ministers should consider withdrawing Commonwealth and Irish citizens’ right to vote in UK elections.
But campaign group Unlock Democracy described this as a “gross insult to expect soldiers to die for this country while removing their right to have a say”.
Lord Goldsmith has called for Britain’s old treason laws to be scrapped or reformed. At the moment they include sleeping with the wife of the heir to the throne, which is punishable by life in prison.
The peer has also hinted at updating the national anthem by removing verses which are rarely performed.

Some of these, like the Deliberation Day and reforming the treason laws, are a good idea.  Unfortunately, what they are surrounded by is a bunch of complete and utter nonsense.

First of all, the military of my nation has improved somewhat:
Military techniques have finally been upgraded in Bloodyites and soldiers are taught to fight with sticks and stones.
I still have the best army ever.
Next, the survey.  Pinched from, well, just about everyone.
THE RULES:
1.) Go to Photobucket. (Don’t sign in.)
2.) Type in your answer to the question in the search box.
3.) Use only the first page.
4.) Copy the HTML and paste the answer.

THE ANSWERS:

1) What is your first name?

2) What is your favorite thing to do?

3) Who is one of your favorite bands lead singer?

Guess who and from which band and get a cookie.
4) What is your relationship status?

5) Who is your celebrity crush?

From Wonderfalls, the best show you’ve likely never heard of.
6) What band are you listening to right now?

On the computers in the LRC (for some reason my laptop isn’t connecting here) so no tunes.
7) What is your favorite movie?
Gonna do a few here.





And, no, I’m not kidding about that last one.
8) What is your favorite time of year?

9) Name your favorite beverage:

Or:

10) Where is your dream vacation?

Odense in Denmark.  Went there as part of a school exchange and always wanted to go back.
11) What is your favorite dessert?

14) One word to describe yourself.

15) What is your favorite dog breed?

no particular breed, I’m just a dog person
So, as you lot will know by now, I’m taking part in script frenzy this year.  Some changes have been made from last year.
The big one (apart from the move in month) is that each script has to be 100 pages (or multiple scripts totaling 100 pages) rather than 20,000 words.  I like this one, as last year I had to add a lot of padding to get my script up to the word count (as anyone who has read the script will be able to guess).
The other one is the type of script you can write.  Last year it had to be a film.  This year however:
4) You may write screenplays, stage plays, TV shows, short films, comic book and graphic novel scripts, adaptations of novels, or any other type of script your heart desires.
Fair enough on the most part.  I’m going to use it as a chance to finally get moving on the Fucked Up Crime Series.
My problem is with this:
adaptations of novels
I don’t think that’s particularly fair, really.  I go to all the trouble to come up with something new, characters, world, etc., and someone else has the chance to get over the word count by picking a book of the bookshelf and adapting that.
Yes, I am well aware that adapting a book is harder than just lifting from the book and placing in the right format, but I thought that the idea of Script Frenzy was to encourage creativity.  This seems like the opposite.
Sorry, that bit just flat out annoyed me.
Will
*EDIT*
I’ve decided to go for this.  Wish me luck.
Will
*Son of the edit*
So, you know I was rantng above about the adaptation part of script frenzy?  Well, it turns out that because of that rule, you can work on scripts you’ve already started.
I’m going to leave a message on the board asking if their page count will be 100 pages plus what has already been written or 100 pages including what’s been written as if it’s the latter it’s not really fair on the rest of us.

Anyone remember the Dizzy computer games?  If so, check out this.
So, the FA Cup quarter finals were this weekend.  Now this was the fixture list (in order of when the games were played):
Manchester United V Portsmouth
Barnsley V Chelsea
Middlesbrough V Cardiff City
Bristol Rovers V West Bromwich Albion
Now the way the results were expected to go was:
Man U beat Portsmouth
Chelsea rolls over Barnsley
Boro beat Cardiff
WBA beat Bristol
The actuall results?
Portsmouth beat Man U
Barnsley beat Chelsea (who are added to Liverpool as their conquests)
Cardiff beat Boro
WBA thrash Bristol.
Now, this has certain fans in a tizzy.  For two reasons.
a) which foreign TV stations are going to bother buying the FA Cup final as none of the big four are left in?
b) who in Britain is going to watch the final when there is none of the big four in it?  It’s going to be boring.
(For those who don’t know, the big four are Man U, Chelsea, Arsenal and Liverpool.)
a) Are these people seriously thinking that these stations buy the FA Cup on a round by round basis?  Cos that’s a sensible way to do things.  Really. And the rest of my answer fits into…
b) They’ll be missing a game between two teams who really, really want it.  Last years FA Cup final was dull.  Extremely fucking dull.  And that was between the top two teams in the country.
Sorry about that.  Rant over.  *packs away soapbox*
More fun things.
I have created a nation on Facebook.  and Ihave the greatest armed forces known to man.  Straight from the description:
Military in Bloodyites is completely voluntary and is made up primarily of boy and girl scouts seeking leadership badges
Seriously.  That’s how every army in the world should be made up.
Wars could be decided by who has the best girl scout cookies.
You may remember me saying a few entries back about the graphic novel I’m creating with a friend.  Well, we not only have a main character, but we also have concept art for her.  My friend has given me permission to post this and I will be sending all feedback her way so, let me know what you think.  Here is Amy:

And from the same friend:
Zen Sarcasm
Words to live by…
THESE ARE GREAT Sayings

1. Do not walk behind me, for I may not lead. Do not walk ahead of me, for I may not follow. Do not walk beside me either. Just pretty much leave me the hell alone.
2. The journey of a thousand miles begins with a broken fan belt and leaky tire.
3. It’s always darkest before dawn. So if you’re going to steal your neighbor’s newspaper, that’s the time to do it.
4. Don’t be irreplaceable. If you can’t be replaced, you can’t be promoted.
5. Always remember that you’re unique. Just like everyone else.
6. Never test the depth of the water with both feet.
7. If you think nobody cares if you’re alive, try missing a couple of car payments.
8. Before you criticize someone, you should walk a mile in their shoes. That way, when you criticize them, you’re a mile away and you have their shoes.
9. If at first you don’t succeed, skydiving is not for you.
10. Give a man a fish and he will eat for a day. Teach him how to fish, and he will sit in a boat and drink beer all day.
11. If you lend someone $20 and never see that person again, it was probably worth it.
12. If you tell the truth, you don’t have to remember anything.
13. Some days you’re the bug; some days you’re the windshield.
14. Everyone seems normal until you get to know them.
15. The quickest way to double your money is to fold it in half and put it back in your pocket.
16. A closed mouth gathers no foot.
17. Duct tape is like ‘The Force’. It has a light side and a dark side, and it holds the universe together.
18. There are two theories to arguing with women. Neither one works.
19. Generally speaking, you aren’t learning much when your lips are moving.
20. Experience is something you don’t get until just after you need it.
21. Never miss a good chance to shut up.
22. Never, under any circumstances, take a sleeping pill and a laxative on the same night

1113,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/the-ten-moviegoing-commandments-3929910/,2008-03-09,The Ten Moviegoing Commandments,"

Posted on Thursday February 28, 2008, 10:56 by James Dyer
I am, I think its fair to say, what you could describe as a cinema fascist. For me a trip to the local multiplex isnt so much a night of enjoyment but an endless litany of irritations, injustices and insults perpetrated against my person by the general public. I suppose its an inevitable side effect of spending the better part of a decade being coddled by private studio screenings where were presented with nibbles, wine and the occasional Pret sandwich tray. Such screenings, where you’re often one of only a handful present, have become the norm in my mind, so you can imagine the horror when Im occasionally dropped headfirst into the howling, sticky sea of degradation and depravity that is your average fleapit performance. Frankly, it makes me want to have a shower. And then kill everyone in the room. And then have another one to wash the gore off my hands. An overreaction? Possibly, but why, I ask you, do people go to the cinema when they clearly have no interest in actually watching the movie?
But Im getting off track. Having been scarred by years of public cinemagoing as a civilian before finally finding solace at the bosom of Empire, i think it’s time that something was done to improve the cinemagoing experience. I propose that we all unite to draw up a list of cinemagoing commandments (enforceable by some kind of nasty biblical torture), to which anyone viewing a film in a public place must adhere. It should go something like this:
1. Thou shalt not have stupid trendy hair that sticketh up and obscureth my view
All cinema patrons should be required, on pain of buzz cut, to sport a sensible haircut whereby the hair itself stays flat upon the scalp. Regardless of how much you think you look like that muppet from McFly, I do not need to spend half the film trying to peer past congealing spires of hair gel thank you so very much. The same goes for headwear  caps off when you sit down. And no, I dont care if its street or cool or youve left the tags on to make it look like you stole it.
While not a commandment in its own right, a sub-directive of this should be something along the lines of thou shalt not sit bolt upright unlest thou sufferest from some kind of chiropractic condition. Headwear or no, cinema seat backs are high for a reason: youre meant to slouch. This is in part so you can enjoy the slobbish act of watching movies to the full but also so half the movie isnt projected onto the back of your bloody head. Heed. Doon.
2. Thou shalt not shout encouragement to yonder protagonists
Whats wrong with you? Its a movie. Its an entirely one-directional experience and Matt Damon neither needs nor is in any way able to hear your vocal support. If youre American then you recieve a grudging free pass on this as it seems to be an evolutionary trait caused by generations of watching Jerry Springer, which you’re all now powerless to resist. The rest of you keep it zipped, okay?
3. Thou shalt not use sugar-coated chocolates as rudimentary weapons of war
A year ago I was forced to sit through a public performance of Spider-Man 3 (which was unpleasant enough to begin with) only to be struck squarely in the head by some kind of heat-seeking M&M. All I can say is down with this sort of thing! Perhaps Im still scarred by an incident at the Harrow Granada in the late 80s when some muscled gorilla called Len came up and accused the 11-year-old me of doing something similar. I hadnt, but that didnt stop him from using my head as a knuckle warmer. The fact that his girlfriend later dragged him over to apologise did not make me feel a great deal better.
4. Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour’s cupholder
Your bag of Minstrels does not outrank mine and you will not use the cupholders on both sides of your seat no matter how many snack food items youre juggling. If you go both ways then some poor bugger is going to end up with a beverage perched precariously on his lap and thats just an accident waiting to happen. Cup goes in holder, sweets go in lap, its the natural order of things and woe betide any who seek to challenge it.
5. Thou shalt not skulk around the back of the screen wearing night vision goggles
Are you in Splinter Cell? No? Then what on Earth are you doing? You look like a tit. Yes, Im aware that the threat of movie piracy hangs above society like a headsmans axe and if Harry Potter 7 ends up on the Internet before it’s released in the cinema than the whole of reality will implode on itself, but do we really need the bloody SAS glaring at us throughout the feature? What are they going to do if they catch someone anyway? Drag them outside and put two in the back of their head? Ive got a word for you, its called OVERKILL.
6. Thou shalt not use the lavatory whilst the feature is in progress
No, I dont care if youve got a weak bladder, a nervous stomach or youre on bloody dialysis, there is no excuse for getting up in the middle of the film and thereby forcing your entire row to do the same while you shuffle off to the loo. Just sit there, hold it in and next time dont drink that four gallon bucket of Coke you indulgent fool.
7. Thou shalt not accept calls from thine drug dealer during the film
Admittedly this ones a tad specific but its nevertheless something I witnessed during a Sunday matinee screening of Fallen (dont ask) in 1998. Glossing over the imprudence of such an act given that the whole of special branch could have been downing popcorn in the back row, its also extremely annoying! That goes for any kind of phone conversation. If it rings you grab frantically at the offending pocket and fumble apologetically until you manage switch the thing off then sit really still for the next minute while hoping no one is staring at you. You do NOT even THINK about answering the accursed thing and catching up.
8. Thou shalt not purchase individually wrapped sweets on pain of torture
Anything that rustles is enough to provoke a sound beating but to intentionally purchase confectionary that requires crunching, crackling paper before every single mouthful is tantamount to a war crime. Do it at your peril and Ill see you in The Hague.
9. Thou shalt not talk amongst thyselves no matter how boring thou findest the movie
Just dont, okay? If youre not enjoying it then just leave  quietly. I once sat behind two people who nattered all the way through Schindlers List. Its about genocide for gods sake, have some bloody respect. If I told Ian Freer youd talked through one of Stevens movies hed have branded something I can’t print on this website across both your bloody foreheads.
Also, while we’re on the subject of noise, I’d like to add another sub-clause: though shalt not bray like a donkey. f its a comedy then by all means feel free to laugh  its actually encouraged. Do not, though, howl like some kind of lovesick baboon, thus eclipsing all other sound thats not currently broadcasting above 20 decibels. This is especially infuriating when what youre laughing at isnt actually supposed to be funny, or at least not funny enough to warrant Fanta dribbling from your nostrils.
10. Thou shalt not sit thyself next to or in front of me if the cinema is half empty
This is absolutely non-negotiable. I am not your mother and thus will at no point hold your hand during the movie if you get scared. Bearing this in mind you will not attempt to sit next to me, a complete stranger, when there are plenty of non-adjacent seats elsewhere. You will instead adhere to a minimum three seat buffer around my person at all times unless the cinema is sufficiently crowded that this proves impossible. Likewise you will not place your presumably non-translucent self directly between me and the screen unless all seats outside the direct field of my vision are currently occupied. Should you neglect to follow this directive then I reserve the right to place hard metal objects in any space around me that I see fit, regardless of whether said space is occupied by a part of your anatomy.
I’m sure there are more but it’s traditional to stop at ten so I’ll leave any further additions up to you. Go forth and preach the gospel! Let us spread the word among the heathens and turn the multiplexes back into the hallowed cathedrals of entertainment they were meant to be. And yes, feel free to burn any heretics who seek to defy you. Amen.
Source
Course, I’d change rule 7 to Thou shalt switch off thy mobile phone during the film.  Seriously.  If you’ve got a reason to keep your phone switched on then what the fuck are you doing watching the film in the first place?

1114,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/what-on-earth-is-42-3929909/,2008-03-06,What on earth is 42?,"
By Mark Vernon
It’s 30 years since Douglas Adams’ The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy made its debut on BBC radio, but its most famous mystery is still waiting to be resolved.
The radio series – which subsequently became both bestselling book, television series and film – traces the travels around the galaxy of Arthur Dent, after the earth is destroyed to make way for a “hyperspatial express route”.
Possibly the most famous line in the whole book is the “answer to life, the universe, and everything” given by the supercomputer, Deep Thought.
For seven and a half million years, this stupendously powerful, office-block of a machine had whirred. When it came to announcing what it had discovered, crowds had quite understandably gathered. “You aren’t going to like it,” Deep Thought warned. “Forty-two,” it said, with infinite majesty and calm.
Ever since, speculation has been rife as to what Adams meant. There is the “paperback line theory” – 42 apparently being the average number of lines on the page of a paperback book. Was Adams paying homage to the medium of his success?
Then there is the “Lewis Carroll theory” – Adams celebrating Carroll’s use of the number in Alice in Wonderland.
Numerical base 13
In the book, there is Rule 42 which says that anyone taller than a mile must leave the court immediately. That becomes a problem for Alice when she eats some mushrooms.
There is another theory that rests on a complex allusion to 42 in numerical base 13. It sparked Adams’ retort: “I don’t write jokes in base 13.”
Tragically, Douglas Adams died in 2001. So what does Stephen Fry, a close friend, voice of the audiobook, and possibly one of the most intelligent admirers of The Hitchhiker’s Guide think?
“Of course, it would be unfair for me to comment,” he confides. “Douglas told me in the strictest confidence exactly why 42. The answer is fascinating, extraordinary and, when you think hard about it, completely obvious. Nonetheless amazing for that.
“Remarkable really. But sadly I cannot share it with anyone and the secret must go with me to the grave. Pity, because it explains so much beyond the books. It really does explain the secret of life, the universe, and everything.”
But the notion that a computer could provide an answer to the meaning of life is ridiculous, explains Michael Hanlon, author of The Science of The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy.
Even if every existing atom were co-opted into a mind-bogglingly vast computational matrix, it still wouldn’t be able to calculate every possible permutation on a chess board, let alone anything truly complex.
Fundamental questions
There is still hope that science might come up with answers to the big questions. “Of all the ways of looking for meaning, science has answered the most questions so far,” Hanlon continues.
“It has triumphed at explaining many things. However, it hasn’t provided answers to the most fundamental questions like why we are here, what is the universe for. But just because it hasn’t yet, doesn’t mean it can’t or won’t.”
	In acting as if life has meaning, we will find, thank God, that it does
John Cottingham
Philosopher
Having said that, it is possible that questions of meaning are simply of a different sort to questions of matter, the physical world in which science has proven so powerful. If so, asking why there is something rather than nothing with mathematics might make no more sense than asking whether a triangle is happy or whether the rocks in the asteroid belt are friends.
Similarly, cosmologists like Stephen Hawking once thought physics would come to know the mind of God in a “theory of everything”. He now doubts that is possible.
“Though we haven’t run up against a class of questions that we couldn’t answer yet,” adds Hanlon. With fiendishly difficult phenomena, like consciousness, scientists have yet to exhaust all their theories. But could there be a serious side to the answer 42? Might there be method in Deep Thought’s madness?
Wise joke?
The answer can be interpreted in two ways. One is that it is a bad joke, implying that there simply is no answer, no meaning, no sense in the universe, and you would be no worse off if you jumped into the nearest black hole.
But the other interpretation is that the joke was wise. It shows that seeking numerical answers to questions of meaning is itself the problem. Digits, like a four and a two, can no more do it than a string of digits could represent the poetry of Shakespeare.
Shakespeare’s work was the product of a life, and a life lived to the full. Meaning too might only emerge from such fulsome engagement.
To put it another way, life is a gift. It is good. It flourishes in experiences like love, explains John Cottingham, professor of philosophy at the University of Reading, and author of On the Meaning of Life. He believes that philosophy can no more provide meaning than science can.
This is because life’s giftedness, its goodness and its loveliness are essentially spiritual qualities. They can be assessed by rational enquiry. But they cannot be accessed by the cool calculations of reason. They must be experienced.
To put it another way, when the poet William Blake urged us “to see a World in a Grain of Sand”, he was not suggesting anything literal. Rather, his words captured something of the world transfigured through beauty and meaning.
For Prof Cottingham, this is what it means to have faith. “For in acting as if life has meaning, we will find, thank God, that it does.”
Mark Vernon is the author of 42: Deep Thought on Life, the Universe, and Everything.

Films first:
I’ve spoken my piece and counted to three.
SisterMoon got this one, it’s Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?
There’s 30 million people here, and they all just let themselves die.
Both Oribeth and Peter_24601 correctly guessed that this is from Serenity.
Perhaps you’re the woman I never met.
Peter_24601 got this one as well.  Three Colours: Red.
An innocent prisoner will become more angry by the hour due to the injustice suffered. He will shout and rage. A guilty prisoner becomes more calm and quiet. Or he cries. He knows he’s there for a reason. The best way to establish guilt or innocence is non-stop interrogation.
No one took a stab at this one.  It’s from the wonderful German film The Lives Of Others.
If you value your life, come no further!
Peter_24601 yet again getting it right.  It’s from His Dark Materials: The golden Compass.
We gotta find ourselves a Smurfette.
No guesses for this quote from Donnie Darko either.
What am I? A schmuck on wheels?
This is from Goodfellas.  Peter_24601 got this one as well.
Cassius was right, the fault dear Brutus is not in our stars, but in ourselves
Fast ein Sarah guessed that this is from Julius Ceaser.  Kind of.  It’s Ed Murrow quoting Julius Ceaser in Good Night, And Good Luck.  (It’s only the second part of this one that’s from JC.)  Peter_24601 got it again.
A philosopher once asked, “Are we human because we gaze at the stars, or do we gaze at them because we are human?” Pointless, really…Do the stars gaze back?” Now *that’s* a question.
No guesses for Stardust.
Now that I’ve met you, would you object to never seeing me again?
Peter_24601 again.  It’s from Magnolia.
Nobody is entirely evil: it’s that circumstances that make them evil, or they don’t know they are doing evil.
No one got this one from the delightfully bonkers Delicatessen.
Goddamn FBI don’t respect nothin’.
Really surprised no one got this one.  The Godfather Pt 1.
TV now.  And very few people taking a shot at this one.
I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.
Oribeth got this one.  It’s from Dr Who.
No, it’s not… it’s time to kick your ass all the way back to hell!
And she got this one from Angel.  (Hat tip to TheMary who thought it could be Buffy.)
I am a lesbian. The reason I’m not attracted to you is because your genitals are on the outside.
No one guessed this one.  It is in fact from Wonderfalls.
I always prided myself on being an outsider… but now… I feel the need to connect with someone.
This one is from Dexter.
That’s fighting smart sir. Don’t get me wrong I give him a fair wage… if he lives.
Couple of guesses for Firefly, and I can understand that.  But it was in fact Heroes.
You know when you said it went well? Well, when you said well, did you mean shite?
Oribeth again correctly guessing it was from Spaced.  And no guesses for the last two.
Now, one of you has been coming in a little hot lately, a little too hot, a little, um – oh I don’t know, he’s-burning-up-the-deck-with-his-skids-because-he-just-can’t-pull-back-on-the-throttle hot. Now who is this speed demon, my prince?
This is from Battlestar Galactica.
She should stick around. Your whole campaign is like some Dr. Seuss nightmare – One Fish, Two Fish, Dead Fish, We Fought The Good Fight Fish. 
And this one is from The West Wing.
And finally.  Pinched from shesolovely, leave me a note saying I’m in and I’ll do the following:
1. I’ll respond with something random about you.
2. I’ll tell you what song/movie reminds me of you.
3. I’ll tell you something I don’t like about you (nothing too harsh.)
4. I’ll say something that only makes sense to you and me.
5. I’ll tell you my first memory of you.
6. I’ll tell you what animal you remind me of.
7. I’ll ask you something I’ve always wondered about you (be sure to answer!)
Have at it.

So, interview.
Turned up at the Riverside stadium all suited and booted (after realising that I hate wearing suits as there are not enough pockets for all my stuff) and was promptly given wrong directions to the interview.  But i finally found the place.
We started with a presentation about WH Smiths, which revealed that the company is over 200 years old having been formed in 1972.  No, I didn’t make a mistake, but I think the guy did.  I then had to fill out a mail redirection form for a “friend” and write him a note telling him what he needs to send off with the note.  All of which is clearly detailed on the form so apparently this friend can’t read.  So I’m not sure the note is a good idea either.
(What I’d write in the note in real life: here’s the form, here’s my address fill it out your fucking self you lazy bastard.  But I think that would have been frowned on.)
Then the maths test.  No calculators allowed but it was piss easy anyway.  Then a face to face interview.  I had been told that if I hadn’t heard within two days I hadn’t got the job.  But with the interview being on Thursday it would be either Friday or Monday.
Monday night, still no phone call.  Yesterday, the thanks-but-no-thanks letter arrived.  Bugger.
Still,randomly popping up in the dream of one of my favourites cheered me up no end.
I want this t-shirt
Apparently there was an earthquake in Britain Tuesday night.  Some of my friend felt it but I didn’t feel a damn thing.  Typical.  (Admittedly I was drunk and so therefore might have dismissed it as me being drunk.)
Didn’t get any sleep on Wednesday night.  I was about due for a completely sleep free night anyway, but it didn’t help that I wasn’t feeling well.  But I finalised my writing playlist and got cracking on book numero uno.  (I’m currently about halfway through chapter 2.1 (probably makes no sense to you, but I know what I’m on about)).
I’m also considering taking part in this years ScriptFrenzy!  I had fun with it last year (and won) and the fact that this year it’s number of pages and not a word count.  My script last year had a lot of filler just to get the word count up.  (Which reminds me findingsunshine, thought I could look forward to an email last weekend?  :¬p)

TV’s top 25 put-downs published
Insults by Captain Mainwaring and Lord Blackadder have been named among the top 25 put-downs in TV history, as chosen by the Radio Times magazine.
“Stupid Boy!” uttered by Dad’s Army’s Captain Mainwaring to Private Pike, is one of the lines in the list.
The selected Blackadder line was: “The eyes are open, the mouth moves, but Mr Brain has long since departed, hasn’t he, Percy?”
The list of put-downs covers the last 40 years from British and American TV.
* Basil Fawlty – Fawlty Towers. To Sybil: “Oh dear, what happened? Did you get entangled in the eiderdown again? Not enough cream in your eclair? Hmm? Or did you have to talk to all your friends for so long that you didn’t have time to perm your ears?”
* Mrs Merton – The Mrs Merton Show. To Debbie McGee: “So what first attracted you to the millionaire Paul Daniels?”
* Edmund Blackadder – Blackadder II. To Lord Percy: “The eyes are open, the mouth moves, but Mr Brain has long since departed, hasn’t he, Percy?”
* Roseanne Conner – Roseanne. To husband Dan: “Your idea of romance is popping the can away from my face.”
* Father Jack Hackett – Father Ted. “Drink! Feck! Arse! Girls!”
* Carla – Cheers. Cliff: “I’m ashamed God made me a man.” Carla: “I don’t think God’s doing a lot of bragging about it either.”
* Patsy Stone – Absolutely Fabulous. “One more facelift on this one and she’ll have a beard.”
* Jim Royle – The Royle Family. Nana: “Is this hat too far forward?” Jim: “No. We can still see your face.”
* Malcolm Tucker – The Thick Of It. To a junior minister: “All these hands all over the place! You were like a sweaty octopus trying to unhook a bra! It was like watching John Leslie at work!”
* Statler and Waldorf – The Muppet Show. Statler: “Wake up, you old fool, you slept through the show.” Waldorf: “Who’s a fool? You watched it.”
* Inspector Monkfish – The Fast Show. To a bereaved woman: “I realise this must be a very difficult time for you, so put your knickers on and go and make me a cup of tea.”
* No Offence – The Fast Show. “I notice you’re not wearing a wedding ring which, given your age, means you’re divorced or a lesbian.”
* Rupert Rigsby – Rising Damp. To lodger Alan, who complains his room is too cold to study in: “The only thing you study is your navel. You even shave lying down.”
* Nan – The Catherine Tate Show. Describing an encounter with an overweight hospital volunteer: “She said to me last time, ‘You look bored, Mrs Taylor. I’ve got three words for you: Barbara Taylor Bradford.’ So I said, ‘Yeah? I’ve got three words for you too: calorie controlled diet.”‘
* The Professor – The Mary Whitehouse Experience. “I have here a copy of your book, Origins of the Crimean War. It smells of poo.” “That’s because it’s been inside your mum’s bra.”
* Alf Garnett – Till Death Us Do Part. “You Scouse git!”
* Alexis Carrington – Dynasty. “I’m glad to see your father had your teeth fixed – if not your mouth.”
* JR Ewing – Dallas. “Ray never was comfortable eating with the family – we do use knives and forks.”
* Dr Perry Cox – Scrubs. Dr Elliot Reid: “I don’t think you understand the severity of the situation here. I am dangerously close to giving up men altogether.” Dr Cox: “Then on behalf of men everywhere – and I do mean everywhere, including the ones in little mud huts – let me be the first to say thanks and hallelujah.”
* Dr Gregory House – House. “You can think I’m wrong, but that’s no reason to stop thinking.”
* Gary Strang – Men Behaving Badly. “Let’s face it, Tony, the only way you’re gonna be in there is if you’re both marooned on a desert island and she eats a poisonous berry or a nut which makes her temporarily deaf, dumb, stupid, forgetful and desperate for sex.”
* Arnold Rimmer – Red Dwarf. “Look, we all have something to bring to this discussion. But I think from now on the thing you should bring is silence.”
* Larry David – Curb Your Enthusiasm. “Switzerland is a place where they don’t like to fight, so they get people to do their fighting for them while they ski and eat chocolate.”
* Sam Tyler – Life On Mars. To Gene Hunt: “I think you’ve forgotten who you’re talking to.” Sam: “An overweight, over-the-hill, nicotine-stained, borderline-alcoholic homophobe with a superiority complex and an unhealthy obsession with male bonding?”
* Captain Mainwaring – Dad’s Army. “You stupid boy!”

1121,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/fowl-eurovision-entry-for-ireland-3929902/,2008-02-23,Fowl Eurovision entry for Ireland,"
Eurovision Song Contest feathers may be ruffled by Ireland’s decision to be represented in May’s cross-continental competition by a puppet bird.
Dustin The Turkey was plucked from a raft of six finalists, winning a televised vote on Saturday night.
The cult figure’s gobbled rendition of Irelande Douze Pointe – a parody of the Eurovision voting system – secured his place at the top of the pecking order.
Dustin now aims to restore Irish pride battered by recent Eurovision failures.
But while Dustin beat off national opposition in broadcaster RTE’s Eurosong on Saturday, he now faces a pressure cooker environment at May’s Eurovision, where he will have to fight off competition from all over Europe.
Dustin time
Although it faced strong opposition from the likes of Dubliner Leona Daly’s Not Crazy After All and 17-year-old Liam Geddes’s Sometimes, Irelande Douze Points won over the viewers, who voted by phone and text in the competition.
Composed by Darren Smith and Simon Fine, the tune draws strongly on the campness of the Eurovision contest, which has become notorious in recent years for its tactical geopolitical voting.
“Shake your feathers and pop your beak, shake it to the west and to the east,” crooned Dustin in Limerick’s University Concert Hall.
“Wave Euro-hands and Euro-feet, wave them in the air to the turkey beat.”
Dustin will now go on to perform in Eurovision’s first semi-final in the Serbian capital Belgrade on 20 May and, if successful, will be aiming for the golden egg of glory in the final four days later.
Douze points?
But it won’t be Dustin’s first shot at the big time.
A turkey vulture with a thick north Dublin twang, he became a star of national broadcaster RTE’s The Den in 1990 alongside fellow television puppet stars Zig and Zag.
Dustin’s career took off and he was eventually given his own programme, Dustin’s Daily News.
He has a keen interest in politics and despite never officially standing, his name has appeared on ballot papers in the Republic of Ireland as a protest vote in elections.
But he has always had a talent for warbling, having already released 14 singles and six albums.
His last album – Bling When You’re Minging – was released in 2005 and featured a duet with Chris De Burgh.
Ireland has had a poor Eurovision run in recent years, despite having won the contest a record seven times.
The country’s 2007 entry, Dervish, came last.
Dustin will be hoping to change all that in Belgrade.

On a bit of a Wonderfalls kick.  I forgot how damn good that show was.
DAMN YOU FOX!
So I’m getting a sore throat.  Just in time for my job interview tomorrow.  Yay!
I’m just about ready for it.  Still to finish filling out the application form (which has kinda confuzzled me, they already have my CV), got what I’m wearing sorted out so I’m good to go.
Wish me luck.
Apart from that, not really been up to much.  But I’ve worked out that I’ve got a lot on my plate at the moment that I really should get working on:
Book Uno is ready to rock in my head.  I’ve finally figured out how to work it.
Book Dos has been put on the backburner as I thought I had it figured out but it turns out I really don’t.
VAA is in serious need of editing (mostly to get rid of the filler I had to add to win ScriptFrenzy).
My friends dissertation is not going to progress till saturday.
Fucked-up crime series needs to be totally redone due to me not backing up the work I had done before reformatting my hard drive before Chriasmas.  But I do have a title for the first and last episode.  (But not for the series itself).
A friend has asked me to read a story he’s writing.
And I’ve agreed to colaberate with another friend on a graphic novel set in an alternate universe Middlesbrough.  I’m writing, she’s doing the art.
So, busy Will.
Oh, and tonight is the total eclipse of the moon.  Hoping to get some pics of that.  (I may even bust out the Super 8.)
Finally, links:
Torchwood Babies!
Best review of colouring pencils ever!
And finally if you can read this and not have at least a lump in your throat, you’re quite possibly not even human.

Buffy The Vampire Slayer (film):
Ben Affleck appears in one scene as a basketball player.
In the original version of the script, Merrick committed suicide to escape being turned into a vampire by Lothos, who wanted to know the Slayer’s identity so he could dispatch with her.
The original script by Joss Whedon was heavily re-written to make the film “lighter”. In the original script, Buffy burns down the school gym that the dance is being held in, in an effort to destroy the vampires. In the television series (“Buffy the Vampire Slayer” (1997)) this fact is referred to several times, as the series is seen as a spin-off of the original, unproduced screenplay rather than this film.
Joss Whedon was so frustrated by how much of his vision was being mishandled and how much of it was being rewritten that he eventually left the set during production and never came back.
This was Hilary Swank’s first film.

Toy Story**:
First fully computer-generated full-length feature film. Each frame took 4 to 13 hours (depending on the complexity of the shot) of time on a RenderFarm consisting of 87 2-CPU SparcStation 20’s, 30 4-CPU Sparc-Station 20’s and a SparcServer 1000.
The animation team perfected the movement of the toy soldiers by gluing some sneakers to a sheet of wood and trying to walk around with them on.
The carpet texture in the hallway of Sid’s house is the same as the carpet texture in The Shining (1980).
The toolbox that Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) pushes off the milk crate bears the name “Binford Tools,” the name of the company which sponsors Allen’s character’s show in “Home Improvement” (1991).
In the scene where Woody is giving everyone warning to get a moving partner, the book “The Tin Toy” can be seen on the shelf behind him. This is the story “Toy Story” was based upon. Its author is listed as “Lasseter,” a reference to director John Lasseter.
The top of Sid’s backpack reads “Julie Macbarfle has cooties!”, a reference to camera manager Julie M. McDonald, who lobbied people to put her name in the film. “Juju’s house of food” is another reference to her.
Whenever a character’s eyes blink, they never blink together, but one at a time.
Billy Crystal was originally offered the chance to voice Buzz Lightyear, but declined. After seeing the finished film, he said the decision was the biggest mistake of his career. Upon learning this, Pixar offered Crystal the role of Mike in Monsters, Inc. (2001), which he readily accepted.
The filmmakers have indicated in interviews that the moving-van chase scene at the end of the film was partially inspired by the toy train chase scene from _Wallace and Gromit in The Wrong Trousers (1993)_ . The Pixar animators considered the toy train sequence to have set a standard for action which they had to surpass in this full-length computer animated film.

Alien: Reserection
Joss Whedon originally scripted the Newborn creature as a four-legged, eyeless, bone-white creature with red veins running along the sides of its head. It had an inner jaw, similar to the all the other aliens. It also had a pair of pincers on the sides of his head. These pincers were used to hold its prey still as it drained the prey of blood with its inner jaw. The creature was also larger, nearly the size of the queen alien. In later script revisions, the creature was changed into a “more believable” hybrid of human and alien.
Sigourney Weaver made the behind-the-back half-court basketball shot successfully after two weeks of basketball practice, tutored by a basketball coach. Her conversion rate during that two weeks was about one shot in from every six. When the day came to shoot the scene, director Jean-Pierre Jeunet wanted to have the ball dropped in from above, rather than wait for Weaver to sink the shot herself, which “would probably take about 200 takes”. Weaver insisted that the she could get the shot in herself, which she was finally allowed to do. She sunk the shot on the very first take, even though she was six feet further past the three-point line. Ron Perlman was completely stunned (and thoroughly impressed), and turned directly at the camera and broke character, saying, “Oh my God!” The editors looked at the shot and decided that there was “enough room to get the scissors in”. Weaver was excited about making the shot, but Jeunet was concerned that audiences would believe the shot to be faked due to the ball leaving the frame. Upon Weaver’s insistence, he kept the shot as it was. Weaver described the miracle shot as “one of the best moments in her life”, after her wedding day and the birth of her daughter, of course.
The genitals of the Newborn had to be digitally removed.
Joss Whedon went through five different versions of the final battle with the “Newborn” creature, the first four versions of which all took place on Earth in such settings as a hospital maternity ward, a giant junkyard, a snowy forest and cliffside, and a desert.
The Auriga interactive computer is named “Father.” In the original Alien (1979), the computer’s name was “Mother.” There are even compatible scenes where people yell at Mother or Father for not responding to them.
Elgyn’s spoken landing code for the Auriga is, of course, “EA-TM-E”.
Winona Ryder agreed to do this film even before reading the script. She stated that she “didn’t care if she died in the first scene”, she’d do it. Ryder claimed that then she could boast about being in an “Alien” movie to her younger brothers.
Danny Boyle was Fox’s first choice to direct. He turned it down to work on A Life Less Ordinary (1997).

Buffy The Vampire Slayer (TV):
Series star Sarah Michelle Gellar initially auditioned for the role of Cordelia Chase, and Charisma Carpenter, who plays Cordelia, auditioned for the role of Buffy. Others who auditioned for Buffy and got other roles include Julie Benz (Darla), Elizabeth Anne Allen (Amy Madison), Julia Lee (Anne) and Mercedes McNab (Harmony Kendall). Bianca Lawson, who played Kendra the Vampire Slayer in season 2, originally auditioned for the role of Cordelia.
Nathan Fillion (Caleb) originally auditioned for the role of Angel when the show was first being cast in late 1996.
Seth Green played Oz, the werewolf boyfriend of Alyson Hannigan. He also played her boyfriend in My Stepmother Is an Alien (1988).
Joss Whedon supplies the voice of the Mutant Enemy mascot which says “Grrr … Arrgh” heard at the end of almost every episode.
“Mutant Enemy”, Joss Whedon’s production company, was the name he gave to his first typewriter when he was 15. The logo was created in 20 minutes when he was told he had to have one.
The Summers’ Sunnydale address is 1630 Revello Drive.
Originally, Joss Whedon didn’t want either of Buffy’s parents to appear as characters on the show. Accepting that that could get complicated, he settled on just having her mother, Joyce, appear. Joyce ended up staying on the show for five seasons.
The character of Dawn was originally intended to have the power to speak to the dead. She was also supposed to be able to move objects with her mind. These powers were later dropped.
Before he was turned into a vampire, Spike’s name was William. Angel’s real name was Liam, which is the Irish version of the English/British William.
Buffy’s birthday was celebrated in the episode first aired on or near 19 January each year. In the first-year episode “I Robot, You Jane”, Malcolm brings up Buffy’s school records on his computer. In the first view, we see that Buffy was born on 24 October 1980, and that she is a sophomore. The second time we see Buffy’s records, her birthday is 6 May 1979, and she is a senior. Joss Whedon finally decreed Buffy’s birthday to be 19 January 1981.
Anthony Head tutored James Marsters in his London accent for Spike. In reality, Head’s accent is more like Spike’s than the clipped English tones that he sports in the show.
Series creator Joss Whedon wanted to do a musical episode as early as the first season, but the network wouldn’t allow him to. When the show switched networks after the fifth season, he was finally able to get his wish, resulting in the episode “Once More, With Feeling”.
Joss Whedon toyed with the idea of making Xander gay instead of Willow.
During Angel and Buffy’s first lovemaking scene, Joss Whedon and sound editor Cindy Rabideauprovided the heavy breathing, because they were too embarrassed to ask Sarah Michelle Gellar and David Boreanaz to do it.
The even numbered seasons (2, 4, and 6) each feature a Halloween episode – 2.06 “Halloween”, 4.04 “Fear Itself”, and 6.06 “All the way” – while the odd numbered seasons do not.
Joss Whedon is known to plan his season storylines years in advance. Clues to Dawn’s arrival can be found as early as the third season, but she doesn’t actually show up until the fifth.

Firefly:
Joss Whedon originally cast Rebecca Gayheart as Inara.
The cast preferred to use the ship’s lounge instead of a green room or other accommodations when waiting between shots.
The Alliance’s full title is the “Anglo-Sino Alliance”. Joss Whedon intended the Alliance to be the merger of the USA and China, the last of the world’s superpowers. (This is why many characters on the show sometimes speak Chinese.) The Alliance flag, seen in the original pilot episode, is a blending of the US and Chinese flags.
The cast had a running gag where they would yell Summer Glau’s name whenever they flubbed a line or messed up. It began after she forgot her line at the end of a particularly difficult scene. The gag continued through the filming of Serenity (2005).
All the Alliance officer and soldier uniforms are leftovers from Starship Troopers (1997).
Some of the weapons used in the series were present-day weapons, which were picked based on their somewhat futuristic look. No modifications were made by the prop department to either disguise them or make them more look more futuristic. Alliance soldiers are seen carrying Enfield L85 rifles, which have been standard issue in the British Army since the early 1980s. The Browncoats are seen using Heckler & Koch G36 rifles, which are standard issue in the German Army.
The DVDs of Firefly were flown up to the International Space Station by astronaut Steven Swanson on board the shuttle Atlantis during it’s June 2007 STS-117 mission.
Angel:
It was originally intended for Angel’s sidekick to be Whistler (Max Perlich) who appeared in two episodes of “Buffy the Vampire Slayer” (1997). But when the actor couldn’t commit to a series, the character of Doyle was created.
The girl with the electric powers, first appearing in episode 4.2 “Ground State”, is named Gwen Raiden (Alexa Davalos). Raiden is the Japanese god of lightning. The character named Raiden in Mortal Kombat (1995), with the powers of electricity, is also named after this mythological figure.
When Joss Whedon appeared as Numfar in the Pylean arc, it was kept top secret. The only ones that knew it was him were David Greenwalt, Tim Minear, David Boreanaz, and a few key makeup people.
Originally, there was going to be no Jasmine character in season four. Cordelia was going to be the “big bad.” Whedon had originally planned for the season to end with a battle between Angel and Evil Cordelia.
Andy Hallett holds the record for the actor who took the longest to become a regular. He guest starred in over 40 episodes during the second, third, and fourth seasons before finally being added to the main opening credits of the 14th episode in the fourth season.
The address for Angel Investigations at the old hotel is: 1481 Hyperion Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90026. Phone (213) 555-0162. Fax (213) 555-0163.
Liam/Angel was born in 1727 and turned into a vampire in 1753, as established in “The Prodigal” (1.15), and he counts 1753 as his birth year. Although he spent 100 years in a hell dimension due to Buffy’s actions in “Buffy the Vampire Slayer” (1997) episode “Becoming: Part 2” (2.22), he does not count those years as part of his lifespan and told Cordelia in “Dear Boy” (2.5) that he was 247. Allowing for aging and assuming that he survived “Not Fade Away” (5.22), he is now 253 years old.
By the end of the show’s run, Angel had lost and regained his soul a total of four times. The first time he lost his soul was when Darla made him a vampire in 1753. The first time he got his soul back was when the gypsy clan cursed him in 1898. The second time Angel lost his soul was when he and Buffy made love on her 17th birthday and he experienced a moment of pure bliss and total happiness (the condition of the curse was that Angel’s soul would be restored but he would lose it if he ever experienced a moment of pure happiness). The second time he regained his soul was when Willow performed the spell to restore it. The third time was when Rebecca slipped him a happy pill so he would relax in the episode, “Eternity”. That was only a temporary condition though and Angelus reverted back to Angel when the effects of the pill wore off. The final time he lost his soul was when a shaman took it. The final time he got his soul back was when, once again, Willow restored it.
In the beginning of the show’s first season, whenever Cordelia would answer the phone at Angel Investigations, she would say, “We help the hopeless.” That line was later changed to “We help the helpless.”

Serenity:
When the Operative reviews Mal’s file, it shows his birth date as 9/20/2468. 9/20/2002 is the day “Firefly” (2002) premiered. Coincidentally, 9/20/1968 is “Firefly” writer/producer Ben Edlund’s date of birth.
Although only a portion of the animated “Fruity Oaty Bar” commercial is visible in the movie, it was produced in its entirety and is visible as an “Easter Egg” on the DVD. Joss Whedon wanted the commercial to be as odd as possible and admits on the DVD that it is heavily inspired by the “Mr. Sparkle” advertisement from “The Simpsons” (1989) episode “In Marge We Trust.” The uncredited actor shown in the commercial and in the Easter Egg segment is Robert Michael Lee.
This is the first film to be released by Universal on HD-DVD (High Definition DVD).
One of the video clips playing on the monitors in Mr Universe’s base is the Blue Sun commercial from the “Firefly” (2002) episode “The Message”.
The key phrase, that Dr. Simon Tam uttered to put River to sleep, “Eta Kooram Nah Smech!” in Russian means literally “this is for hens to laugh”, meaning “this is very ridiculous”.
<BR>
The DVD of Serenity was flown up to the International Space Station by astronaut Steven Swanson on board the shuttle Atlantis during it’s June 2007 STS-117 mission.
Body count: 74
In his commentary on the DVD, Joss Whedon made specific mention that Chiwetel Ejiofor, ‘Nathan Filion’ , Summer Glau and Sean Maher all performed many of their own stunts. Summer Glau, in reality a trained dancer, used her dancing skills in River’s two fights – for the second, the cameraman, who was also a dancer, moved through a gap around the combatants in order to achieve the dynamic camera angles which appear in the movie.
According to the director commentary, Mal’s line “Faster would be better” was ad-libbed by Nathan Fillion when Joss Whedon told him to “say something Mal would say.”
According to the Q&A with Joss Whedon and the cast after the premiere at the Edinburgh International Film Festival, there were at least 20 separate takes of the final make-out scene between Simon and Kaylee in the engine room, with take #20 being the one used in the final cut.

*Like your shocked that I’m doing this one.
**Bet this one surprised you.  Joss did a rewrite and created the character Rex.  Which was enough to get him a screenwriter credit (and an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay).

Panic:
Getting a text message from the people you have a job interview with wishing you good luck for the interview, despite having been previously told it’s just over a week away.
Relief:
Getting a call from them apologising for sending the text in error.

1125,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/imdb-game-sorkin-edition-3929898/,2008-02-10,IMDB Game: Sorkin Edition,"
So, a few of my favourites have done this, so I’ve decided to give it a go as well.  The rules are you look up a favourite film/TV show on IMDB and quote random facts about it.
What I’ll be doing is setting it around a theme.  To start with, my favourite writers.  To start that, Aaron Sorkin.
A Few Good Men:
Tom Cruise’s Jack Nicholson impersonation (when his character is quoting Col. Jessup) was not scripted.
Wolfgang Bodison was working for Rob Reiner on A Few Good Men (1992) as a location scout when Reiner decided he was perfect for the part of Lance Corporal Harold Dawson. Reiner said he looked like a marine.
The word “sir” is used 164 times during the movie. That’s an average of once every 50 seconds.
The Aaron Sorkin trademark of showing two characters walking down a hallway toward a moving camera talking sidelong to one another (as seen in The American President (1995), “Sports Night” (1998) and “The West Wing” (1999)) originated on this movie. A scene between Kaffe and Ross was written as being set in an office, but Rob Reiner, in an effort to create more action on screen, suggested that it be changed so that they were walking down a hallway… and the rest is history.
Cameo: [Aaron Sorkin] the screenwriter appears as a lawyer in a bar talking to a woman about one of his cases.
The line: “You want me on that wall! You need me on that wall!” was originally written in the script as “…you want me on that wall. You need me there…” but was changed by either Jack Nicholson or Rob Reiner during production.
Screenwriter William Goldman did an uncredited re-write of the screenplay. Aaron Sorkin was so impressed by Goldman’s new dialog (as well as changes that tightened the story) that he re-wrote and re-published the play to incorporate the changes.

The American President:
The dialogue refers explicitly at one point to the films of Frank Capra. Capra’s grandson, Frank Capra III, was first assistant director of this film.
The telephone number President Shepherd gives Sydney to call him back (456-1414) is in fact the number to the White House (area code 202).
The Oval Office set was originally constructed for Dave (1993) and subsequently used for “The West Wing” (1999). Anna Deavere Smith has appeared in all 3 productions.
One of the few rare PG-13 movies allowed to keep its PG-13 rating despite the use of the word “fuck” three times (all within 15 minutes of each other), but none used in sexual context.
President ‘Bill Clinton’ and his staff granted permission for the cast and production design team to visit the White House on several occasions.
Camp David is strictly off-limits to the public and the media. The production designer used someone’s personal snapshots from the Nixon Era and a lot of imagination when designing the set.

The West Wing:
A Josiah Bartlett of New Hampshire was a member of the Second Continental Congress in 1776 and signed the Declaration of Independence. Martin Sheen’s character is supposed to be his descendant.
Martin Sheen was originally only scheduled to appear in four episodes per season. It was only after the pilot was filmed that it was decided to make him a regular cast member.
The show has a strong connection to the “Revenge of the Nerds” series of movies. Bradley Whitford, who plays Josh Lyman, played Roger in Revenge of the Nerds II: Nerds in Paradise (1987). Timothy Busfield, who played Danny Concannon in several episodes, was Arnold Poindexter in the first two “Revenge…” movies. Ted McGinley, who has played anchorman Mark Gottfried in several episodes, played Stan Gable in the first, third, and fourth “Revenge…” movies. James Hong, who played the Chinese ambassador in an episode, played Snotty in the second movie. John Goodman, who played President Glenallen Walken, was the football coach in Revenge of the Nerds (1984).
In “The Drop In”, Bartlet gives a speech to the Global Defense Council, a fictional environmental lobby group that was central to the plot of The American President (1995), also written by Aaron Sorkin.
The set is supposedly so realistic that Warner Brothers studio tour groups are not permitted inside the sound stages where the show is filmed due to White House security concerns. (Some exterior sets, including the South Portico, may be viewed on the tour.)
On the set of the series one day, Allison Janney was entertaining the cast and crew by lip-synching to an obscure spoken jazz piece called “The Jackal”, by Ronnie Jordan. Aaron Sorkin liked it so much that he wrote it into the next episode of the show (“Six Meetings Before Lunch”) as a ritual of C.J.’s.
This was the first American drama series to react to the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States. Aaron Sorkin wrote a special episode (“Isaac and Ishmael”) that was filmed and broadcast within only a couple of weeks. The episode, which featured the lead characters discussing a terrorist threat upon the US and being locked down inside the White House due to the name of a man on a Terrorist Watch List matching that of an (innocent) White House worker, was not considered part of “West Wing” continuity.
Leo’s “Big Block of Cheese” story is true. Andrew Jackson received an enormous block of cheese from the people of New York and, when he hadn’t touched it in two years, gave it to the people of D.C. to celebrate Washington’s birthday. They finished it in two hours.
The character of Mandy (played by Moira Kelly) was abandoned after the first season. Aaron Sorkin and Kelly both agreed that the character had run its course. However, Sorkin never explained on the show what happened to Mandy – the character just disappeared. This gave birth to the term “Mandyville”, a refrence to where characters go when they disappear from a series.
Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton wrote an open letter addressed to Josh Lyman when he suggested closing a military base in upstate New York on the show. In the same letter she praised Toby Ziegler for saving Social Security in an earlier episode.
Martin Sheen’s somewhat unusual way of putting his jacket on is caused by an injury to his arm sustained at his birth.
The blackboard in Josh Lyman’s office used to keep track of votes often features the names of real-life U.S. Senators.
The California assembly was adjourned by a San Francisco democrat for the purposes of mourning the death of Dolores Landingham, President Bartlett’s secretary in the first two series, when she died in a car accident. The actress Kathryn Joosten lived on.
According to an interview that he gave to The New York Times, executive producer Lawrence O’Donnell and his fellow writers had planned for Vinick to win the election until John Spencer’s sudden death in December 2005. After that, they decided that Santos losing both his running mate and the election would be too difficult for the audience to watch, and they changed the election’s outcome.
Right after President Bartlett spouts off a list of Bible quotes to Jenna Jacobs to illustrate their inapplicability, Sam Seaborn takes a crab puff from her. This is not an isolated gesture of stealing food; Leviticus 11:10 indicates that shellfish are an “abomination”, so Sam’s action in effect continues the President’s argument.

Studio 60 On The Sunset Strip:
The title of the show was originally “Studio 7 on the Sunset Strip”. The title was changed after it was discovered that there was a short-lived WB game show by the name of “Studio 7”.
Matthew Perry originally turned down the role of Matt Albie but Aaron Sorkin did not want to have anyone else play the part and apparently would not take “No” for an answer. Perry reconsidered and decided to jump on board.
Immediately above the countdown board in Matt’s office is a black-on-white strip bearing the legend “Time flies like an arrow, fruit flies like a banana. G. Marx”
The character of Harriet Hayes is loosely modeled after creator Aaron Sorkin’s former girlfriend, Kristin Chenoweth.

And finally: Best.  Protest.  EVER!

So I’ve watched Ashes To Ashes twice now, and there’s only one thing I can say:
The Gene Genie is back!
(And those of you who haven’t seen Life On Mars (and if not, you shouldhang your head in shame.  SHAME I TELLS YA! :¬p) won’t have a clue what I’m on about.)
It was really, really good.  Looking forward to the rest of the series.
Not really been up to much.  Agreed to help a friend of mine (who is a foreign student) type up her dissertation.  She is paying me for the work (d’you think I’d have to declare it to the DWP? doubt it) but I’d be willing to do it for nowt.  But I’m glad for the money.  I’m sick of being so skint I can’t even afford £6 for OD+.
Hopefully I’ll get this Post office job though.
Thanks to this I have discovered and fallen in love with the word cadaveric.  Seriously, I need to inculde that word in something I write cos it’s just amazingly cool.  Plus in setting up a songlist for typing the stuff for my friend I stumbled accross my ideal writing songlist.  At long last.
If I still had a desktop computer, I would seriously want one of these.  Cos they rock.
Remember the saga of my phone?  Well, it turns out that the replacement battery they sent me isn’t the compatable with my phone.  So I emailed them.  This is what I said:
Dear Sir/Madam,
At the very end of last year, I had a problem with my mobile phone.  This was, it wouldn’t start.  I phoned up and was told that someone woulde contact me within the next 24 hours.
24 hours later there was still no call.  So i called back, only to be told that I should have been advised to wait 48 hours.
So the next day, with still no call, I phone again.  Only to be told that someone had phoned me the day before.  (I’ve a very funny feeling they tried to phone me on my mobile.  Y’know, the broken one.)  The person I spoke to that time arranged for a replacement battery for the phone, as well as a replacement charger.  As I was in Aberdeen, but due to return to Middlesbrough soon, it would be sent to the later.
Get back to Middlesbrough and there is the new charger, but no battery.  Try the phone with the charger.  Nothing.  So I put the sim card for the phone into another phone I have and call back, to be assured that the replacement battery is indeed on it’s way.
One week leater, still no battery.  Phone back to be told there was no sign of the battery being ordered but hte person would order another one for me.  A couple of days later, it arrives.  I put it into the phone and plug it in to charge.
Over 24 hours later, it’s still charging and I still can’t switch on my phone.  I then phone back and a replacement handset is sent out to me.  I decide to keep the replacement battery just in case.
Imagine my surprise when I realise that the replacement battery is not a BQ50, like the one in my phone, but a BT50 which, according to this: http://www.motorola-shop.co.uk/accessories/bt50-battery/
is not compatable with my W375.
So, here is my question: do I return the battery to you, keep it as an unusual ornament or do you think Motorola would approve of me grafting a face and limbs onto it and teaching it to tap dance?  Might make me a bit of money, a tap dancing mobile phone battery.
Yours faithfully,
William Forbes
And this was their reply:
Hi William,
Thanks for your email to Virgin Mobile about the exchanged battery you received.
We’re sorry to hear that you seem to have been sent the wrong battery.
Don’t worry, we don’t require you to send it back. You can do as you wish with it, we’re sure Motorola won’t mind.
We hope your phone is now running correctly, please don’t hesitate to contact us back if this isn’t the case or if you do have any further questions or queries.
If there’s anything else we can help you with, just reply to this email. You can also give us a call on 789 from any Virgin Mobile phone  it’s just 10p, no matter how long you talk for. Or, you can call us on 0845 6000 789 from a fixed line phone. These calls are charged at local rate.
Kind regards,
Cole Talbot
Virgin Mobile 
Regertably, I’ve been informed that the science is not yet in place for my later proposal :¬(
Anyway, must dash (need to get food and phone the parentals).
Speak later.

Hello people.
Well, I finally got my laptop working again.  Had to factory reset it though.  I think I’ve reinstalled everything I need to and now it’s good to go!
Sort of.  It’s still being annoying at times.  But not as bad as it was.  (At it’s worse, windows explorer crashed whenever I tried to get into my documents.  As I obviously keep stuff in that folder (particularly stories I’m working on) this was not a good situation.  At all.)
I’m trying to type this quickly before going home for the first episode of Ashes To Ashes.  Life On Mars spin off baby!  Yeah!  (And bound to be better than Torchwood.  I miss my weekly dose of British sci-fi.)
Not much has been happening in my life.  Gone out a few times, messed about online, trying to relax before this interview.  Cos I need the job.  
I’m planning to try and get some more writing done tonight at some point.  I keep moaning about it, but it’s pointless doing so unless I actually bloody write.
And if anyone wants to read some of my stuff, you can find it here
And I thought I’d share a poem I found today with you lot:
The Typo Goblin
I am the Typo Goblin, my heart is made of flint,
My role in life is simply this: to keep you out of print.
I sneak into your manuscript and do my fiendish work,
Adding errors guaranteed to make you look a berk.
And then I cast the Careless spell: you say, Ah, what the heck!
And pop your script into the post without that final check.
At length some hapless editor receives your golden wit,
And after reading fifty words he writes it off as … unpublishable.
– Michael Shenton

1128,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/sharia-law-in-uk-is-unavoidable-3929895/,2008-02-06,Sharia law in UK is ‘unavoidable’,"
The Archbishop of Canterbury says the adoption of certain aspects of Sharia law in the UK “seems unavoidable”.
Dr Rowan Williams told Radio 4’s World at One that the UK has to “face up to the fact” that some of its citizens do not relate to the British legal system.
Dr Williams argues that adopting parts of Islamic Sharia law would help maintain social cohesion.
For example, Muslims could choose to have marital disputes or financial matters dealt with in a Sharia court.
He says Muslims should not have to choose between “the stark alternatives of cultural loyalty or state loyalty”.
In an exclusive interview with BBC correspondent Christopher Landau, ahead of a lecture to lawyers in London later on Monday, Dr Williams argues this relies on Sharia law being better understood. At the moment, he says “sensational reporting of opinion polls” clouds the issue.
He stresses that “nobody in their right mind would want to see in this country the kind of inhumanity that’s sometimes been associated with the practice of the law in some Islamic states; the extreme punishments, the attitudes to women as well”.
But Dr Williams says the argument that “there’s one law for everybody… I think that’s a bit of a danger”.
“There’s a place for finding what would be a constructive accommodation with some aspects of Muslim law, as we already do with some other aspects of religious law.”
Dr Williams adds: “What we don’t want either, is I think, a stand-off, where the law squares up to people’s religious consciences.”
“We don’t either want a situation where, because there’s no way of legally monitoring what communities do… people do what they like in private in such a way that that becomes another way of intensifying oppression inside a community.”
Multiculturalism ‘divisive’
His comments are likely to fuel the debate over multiculturalism in the UK.
Last month, one of Dr William’s colleagues, the Bishop of Rochester, said that non-Muslims may find it hard to live or work in some areas of the UK.
The Right Reverend Dr Michael Nazir-Ali said there was “hostility” in some areas and described the government’s multicultural policies as divisive.
He said there had been a worldwide resurgence of Islamic extremism, leading to young people growing up alienated from the country they lived in.
He has since received death threats and has been placed under police protection.

I actually think that this is a good idea.
Like Dr Williams says, the more extreme aspects of Sharia law (for example, stoning adulterers to death) shouldnever even be considered, but there are some aspects that could be worked in to British law.
What do you think?

© William Forbes 2008
The weather is bland.  Boring.  Its not extreme, bright sunshine, but at the same time its not blizzards and thunderbolts and lightning, very very frightening me either.  I like weather like this.  Especially for the job Im doing today.
I look at the device on my wrist to make sure that the time function has recalibrated itself properly.  I wonder whats taking him so long.  Then there is a small flash, only noticeable if you actually know what you are looking for.  And then he lands.  And immediately falls on his backside.  I like working with newbies.  So eager to please.  So enthusiastic.  And always, always unable to stay upright after their first trip.
I hold out my hand.  He grabs it and I help him up.
So, where do we need to go?  Whats the persons address? he asks.  As I said, so enthusiastic.
Calm down young un.  First we need something to eat.  This kind of trip can really take it out of a person.  Come on.  Theres a café down here.
We set off in the direction I motioned in.  I know that at some point there is a café in the direction were walking.  Thats one of the problems with time travel.
So, now youre wondering what Im on about.  So, here it is.  Were from the future.  Some scientists, who are also huge Trek fans, decided to see if they could finally build a teleporter that could send more than just light.  And, to everyones surprise (especially theirs), they actually managed it.
But there was more.  In addition to moving people through space, it turns out it could also transport them through time.  There was a lot of debate about how to utilise this ability.  There were those, naturally, who wanted to use it to clean up on the stock markets, the lottery, etc.  That was dismissed by the creators who wouldnt allow it to be used for personal gain.  (Trekkies, remember?)  So eventually, in the interests of the public good, us.
We dont actually have an official designation but for all intents and purposes were time cops.  The way it works is thus: we go back in time and find people who will be convicted of crimes in our time.  We then find them in the past and try and convince them not to do what they are going to do.  Kinda like precogs in Minority Report only, not.  (We did actually try something similar using precogs.  Didnt work.  Do you know how cryptic their clues are?  The most infamous case was when we were told how the proceeds from a huge bank job were to be spent.  Nothing about the crime itself, nothing about who was doing the spending.  The programme was stopped soon after.)
That was how it started when we needed to arrange to be taken back from where we were dropped off.  But then the technology got smaller, we have the personal wrist ports and now, if we need to, we simply kidnap the person, take them back to the future, educate them and return them to their time line after the crime they were convicted of had taken place.
Admittedly that course of action is a last resort as it is in a grey area ethically.  We do alright.  Not a huge enough success rate so that the powers that be can boast about our unit Keeping Citizens Safe (god, I hate that catchphrase) but not so badly that they have ever threatened to cancel the programme and/or pull our funding.
Thankfully we were right and we arrive at the café.  We walk in and consult the menu.  Shortly, a waitress approaches us to take our order.  I get a full English breakfast with tea.  Aiden orders fish and chips with juice.
So, tell me about where we are, Aiden says.
I consult the port.  Middlesbrough, England, 2012.  Olympic games in London in a months time.  The local football team have just won something called the UEFA Cup.  I rack my brains for any more information.  Yeah.  Marijuana is still illegal and the ban on smoking in public places is still in force.  Itll be rescinded next year.
Theres something I still dont understand.  If what were doing here is preventing crime, why is there still crime in our time?
Typical newbies question.  Youll learn this quickly Aiden.  We dont have the personnel or the resources to prevent all crime.  So we stop the big things from happening and the lesser crimes are fine.  Besides, a totally crime free society is simply not possible.
So, why dont we use this ability to stop major events?  9/11, the three World wars, things like that.
They did think of doing something like that.  So, it was tried on a smaller scale with Waco and David Koresh.  That would have finished differently if we hadnt intervened.  I dont say any more.  I was at that trip and just thinking about what we had to do brings me out in a cold sweat.
The waitress comes back with our food and drinks.  We both start eating.  There is silence while we do so.
Then Aiden speaks.  See what you mean about the trip making me hungry.  So, changing the big things isnt a good idea?
Exactly.  Besides, the things that you mentioned so fundamentally changed the world that, if we did stop them happening, we have no idea what it would do to our time.  We might actually end up phasing ourselves out of existence.  Then the event cant be stopped.  And then we would exist again.  To stop the event.  The result is a huge logic loop and just thinking about it gives people a headache.
But what were doing now doesnt?
I point at him with my fork.  Exactly.  I finish my tea and start twirling a pen in my fingers.  Its such a small thing that in the grand scheme of things it doesnt actually make a difference.
So, Aiden enquires, having finished eating himself, Who are we here for?
I open up my jacket and reach into the pouch sewn into the lining.  From there I pull out two identical files and hand one to Aiden.  I open the other one and start reading.  Joe McInnes.  Currently 10 years old.  Within 5 years will start the descent into crime.  By the time hes stopped and incarcerated, he will have done everything short of murder and rape.  I look at the name again.  I have a funny feeling about this one, but I cant quite put my finger on it.
I shake my head, trying to get rid of this feeling.  Aiden looks up at me.  You alright?
Yeah, I respond.  Just got a strange feeling about this one.
So, how do we do this?
Ah, I say.  Now then, thats the million dollar question.  Weve tried every approach we can think of from impersonating what they know of to be police officers to telling the truth.  Nothing works.  So, if you can answer that question youre a smarter person than anyone in the department.
So how about getting the local police force involved?
We tried that.  While they appreciated our efforts into the protect side of protect and serve, they believe in innocent until proven guilty.
Even though we know them to be guilty?
I warm to the subject.  Even so, there is still no crime for the person to be guilty of yet.  So, how can someone be guilty of a crime that they will commit?  Plus, I leave unspoken, theyre not happy about the whole potential kidnapping portion of the job.  Secretly, I think theyre jealous and theyd love to be able to do what we do.  So, we have to play it by ear.
The waitresscomes over and I pay for the meals.  Shall we?
.
We stand outside the house, about to knock on the door to go in.  I still cant shake this strange feeling I have.  Ive never felt this before on any of the missions.  I nod to Aiden and he knocks on the door.  Usually I like to do that but, as its his first trip, why not treat the lad.
The door opens and a woman opens it.  She is in her late thirties but looks slightly older.  Yes? she says.
Hello, I respond.  We were wondering if we could have a word with Joe?
Jo?  There are two strange men here to see you, the woman shouts, half over her shoulder into the house.
Its OK mam.  Let them in.  Im expecting them.  Something about the voice intensifies the inexplicable feeling I have.  And its not that the voice is, unexpectedly, female.
The woman steps to one side and indicates where the kitchen is.  Aiden and I walk through and as we walk through the door I stop.  Thats what the feeling is.  Someone lied to us.
Jo McInnes is not a ten-year-old male.  Though she is only about 15 in this time, she is unmistakable.  She is one of the most powerful precogs we had, and now, we think, she has gone rogue.  And she is sitting at the kitchen table, typing away on a laptop.
Aiden, Dennis.  Sit down.  We sit at the table as Jo stands up.  Dennis, you like tea, white one sugar.  Aiden, you prefer juice.  She gets us both drinks as I stare at her and Aiden sits with his mouth wide open.
So, then, I start.  I suppose you know why were here?
Yup.  And Ill tell you now, it wont work.  New bloke here doesnt know, but you do, exactly how powerful I am.  My powers are just blossoming and Ive discovered I can see potential timelines as well.  Wanna know what happens if you succeed in taking me away from here?
I think about this as I stare into my tea.  Aiden no longer has his mouth open but there is a rabbit caught in headlights look on his face.  Jo is lighting a cigarette.  I finally decide on my answer.  Try me.
OK.  All that you have against me is pretty circumstantial evidence, from a few criminals who have merely suggested a precogs involvement in the planning of their crime.  You didnt even know before walking through that door that it was a female you were here to see, which means that someone has lied to you.  Despite this, you are going to try and convince me that a life of crime is not what I want.  You will fail and kidnap me.  Youll return me after the crimes I am supposed to have helped commit have been committed but, not only will I be a fifteen year old girl out of time, but Ill have revenge in mind.  Ill go to what you think Im up to anyway, but things will increase in scale.  As I can see all possible futures, youll never be able to stop me and, eventually, everything will descend into chaos.  And I know that you agree with what Im saying as youre just about to leave.
I press a few buttons on my port and look at Aiden.  You have the new co-ordinates.  Time to go.
We leave.
.
Jos mother walks into the kitchen.  Where have those two men gone?
Dont worry mam, they wont be back.

…2008 State of the Union Address
Date 2008/1/27 15:44:46 | Topic: Politics
By Ion Zwitter, Avant News Editor
Washington, D.C., January 28, 2008
In a surprise development that some pundits are already terming unprecedented, President George W. Bush, who was scheduled to deliver his final State of the Union address tonight, remained silent throughout the entire proceeding.
I think that’s more or less unprecedented, don’t you think, Lou? Wolf Blitzer, host of CNN’s Situation Room, said to CNN’s Lou Dobbs Tonight anchor Lou Dobbs after President Bush had been standing silently at the podium for over 10 minutes.
I’d say it was unprecedented, Wolf, Mr. Dobbs replied. I don’t recall any precedent for it, anyway. Mr. Blitzer enthusiastically concurred.
According to several political analysts and numerous members of the public who had tuned in to the State of the Union address in order to participate in the popular State of the Union drinking game, President Bush began the speech more or less as one might expect, albeit slightly unconventionally.
He started off kind of informally, Chet Trouty, a sophomore at American University in Washington, DC, who had been looking forward to the State of the Union drinking game for several days, said, with something like ‘howdy Congress, aloha American people, etcetera etcetera’. But then he kind of looked around the room, then he looked at the teleprompter, then his shoulders sort of sagged. I ended the evening stone cold sober.
You know, I don’t really feel much like saying anything tonight, President Bush reportedly said. He then turned to Vice President Cheney and asked, Do you have anything you want to say, Dick? Vice President Dick Cheney reportedly coughed and looked away, which President Bush apparently interpreted as implying that Mr. Cheney did not have anything much he wanted to say, either.
It’s very peculiar, Jeremy Brigham, a political scientist at the Brookings Institution, said. I mean, one normally expects a president not to say anything during a State of the Union address, and also not to really mean anything that they are saying. But when they’re not saying anything, they’re usually at least reading the words on the teleprompter and saying them, if you know what I mean. But to actually not say anything while you’re not saying anything is, I think, a first.
Analysts had originally predicted President Bush would pay lip service to such themes as the economy, terrorism, the war in Iraq, energy, the economic stimulus package, unemployment, gay marriage, space exploration, and so on, with the year’s wild card theme open to widespread debate.
Human-animal hybrids and steroid use in major league baseball, two recent entries, kind of threw us all for a loop, Kyle Pinochle, a pundit with The American Political Sniffer, said. At this point we didn’t have any idea what to expect for the wild card. My money was on deregulation of the pasties industry, which was Cheney’s pick. You know, like strippers use. ‘Nothing at all’, though, wasn’t on anyone’s radar.
Sigrid Johansson, a Minnesota resident who is hearing-impaired, said, The sign language translator signed a few times in her little inset bubble, as usual, but then her arms just kind of fell limply to her side. After a while, she sort of dozed off. It was weird.
After roughly 45 minutes of silence, President Bush concluded the 2008 State of the Union address, his final major message to the American people, by turning to Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice and whispering I think I may need a bathroom break. Is this possible? He then abruptly turned from the podium and exited the room. He did not return, and his location remains unknown.
It’s certainly an unexpected way for President Bush to try to put a final veneer on his questionable legacy, Mr. Pinochle said. And yet, in a way, strangely appropriate.

So, what’s been happening in my world lately?
Went out for a few drinks on my birthday with some friends.  Bumped into my ex, but didn’t speak to her.  Had a couple of drinks, sang Life On Mars (they were doing a charity singstar thingy) and then moved somewhere else as one person in the group couldn’t drink in the union as she didn’t have proof of age.  Had a couple more drinks, got some food and went home.
Had quite a lazy time of it recently.  Just been messing about online, stuff like that.
I finally got started on the novel I’ve been planning for a month or two on Saturday.  I’ve taken to writing in the pub (usually the union).  For some reason it seems to help me concentrate.  (And, no, it’s not just the acomahol.)  So far I’ve only got chapter one written, but I feel quite good about it so far.  Which, for those who know what I’m like about stuff I write, meens that it’s good.
When I get up to about chapter seven, I’ll be asking for folk to read it, give me feedback, what works, etc.  So look out for a begging entry about that soon.
(Which reminds me.  Ori, findingsunshine, I’m fairly certain I emailed you copies of The Vampire Apocolypse Articles a while back for critique and I still haven’t heard anything back from you guys.  I mean, take as long as you want but still… :¬p)
Bloody job center is determined to annoy me.  They have now decided that my signing time has been pushed back 10 minutes.  But I still have to report at the same time.  I’m supposed to spend 10 minutes on the job point looking for work.  Except, whenever I have used to job point I’ve only been on for about 3 – 4 minutes and most of that is setting up the job parameters.  Also, I check the job center website every day.  So, what’s the bloody point?  I’ll probably spend most of the time sitting reading, which means I’ll probably get into shit for not using the job point.
Never mind.  That could soon all be over.  The main Post Office in town is moving into the branch of WH Smith, and they’re advertising for counter staff.  Thinking nothing ventured, nothing gained, I applied and promptly thought I had no chance.  Until I got a phone call from them today wanting to ask some questions.  The guy must have liked the responses I gave, cos I’ve been invited to a three hour thing on Feb 21st.  This will include a presentation, a test and an interview.  Suppose I’d better look out my suit.  Oh, and new shoes might be an idea as well.
Photos!
First two are from my birthday night out:

Me singing Life On Mars on Singstar.

The four must-get-beers!  L – R: Stuart, Chris, Tim, Me.
And now the rest of them:

Cool stuff.  This is one one house on my walk into town.

And this is on the place next door.

I walk past this place all the time but never noticed this till a friend pointed it out.  Spot the mistake.

My friend Stuart, lighting himself with the flash on his cameraphone.  (It’s the one problem with my camera.  No flash.)

L – R: Stuart, Jemma, Chris.

Kev and Nikki.  The lovely people who put put up with put me up during the summer.  Kev also cropped the pic of my ex and Amy so my ex was no longer in it.

Jemma, looking gorgeous as always.

Herbie!  Though admittedly this would look a lot cooler if it was a classic bug and not one of the modern monstrosities.

Chris and Stuart, messing about at the quiz.

Chris, wearing my friend Emma’s hat.

Me wearing the hat I won to celebrate Australia Day on Friday.  (And yes, I know that Australia Day was actually Sunday.  But this is the union that quite regularly offers anything but Guiness on promotion on St Patricks Day.  Besides, it’s not as if there was anything British that could have been celebrated on Friday, is it *coughBurnsNightcough*)
And, because one of my favourites demanded proof that this happened:

Me in a kilt.

*EDIT*  I am possibly far too excited that I’m three minutes away from being able to watch the new version of American Gladiators.

I was plannin to write a proper update here, complete with loads of pics.
But my computer is being a son of a bitch at the moment.  It’s running incredibly slow.  As a result, I’m having problems uploading the pics to either photobucket or flickr.
So, it’ll probably be tomorrow, when I can put them on my old mp3 player and use one of the lrc computers.
To add to the problems, I’ve just had to reinstall firefox as it kept crashing on me.

All these taken from here.  (My comments in itallics.)
I am a bit troubled. I believe my son has a girlfriend, because she left a dirty magazine with men in it under his bed. My son is only 16 and I really don’t think he’s ready to date yet. What’s worse is that he’s sneaking some girl to his room behind my back. I need help, God! I want my son to stop being so secretive!

Yeah.  This is going to be my new MSN screen name.  really not much to add
What is called ‘Science’ today and ‘scientists’ consist of the same old gang of witch doctors, sorcerers, tellers of tales, the ‘Priest-Entertainers’ for the common people. ‘Science’ consists of a weird, way-out occult concoction of jibberish theory-theology… nothing good has ever come from ‘science’ — In fact, technology is not in any way related to the web of idiotic scientific theory. ALL inventors have been anti-science. The Wright brothers said: “Science theory held us up for years. When we threw out all science, started from experiment and experience, then we invented the airplane.” By the way, airplanes all fly level on this Plane earth!
The Fact the Earth is Flat is not my opinion, it is a Proved Fact! While all we need to know is that the Bible says the Earth is flat (Is.40:22, Ez.7:2, Dn.2:35; 4:10-11,20, Mt.4:8)… but for a second can you imagine what these so-called ‘scientists would have us believe — If the earth really was round, that would mean there arre people who are HANGING DOWN, HEAD DOWNWARDS while we are standing head up? But since the theory allows to travel to those parts of the earth where the people are said to hand head downward, and still to fancy ourselves to be heads upwards, and our friends whom we have left behind us to be heads downwards! LOL! What foolishness! TheWHOLE THING IS A MYTH – A DREAM – A DELUSION – and a snare, and, instead of there being any evidence at all in this direction to substantiate this popular theory, it is plain proof that the Earth is Not A Globe!
Also, be sure to know the Sun and Moon are about 3,000 miles away are both 32 miles across. The Planets are ‘tiny.’ Sun and Moon do Move, earth does NOT move, whirl, spin or gyrate (1 Sam.2:8, 1 Chr.16:30; Job 9:6, 38:4-6; Ps.96:10, 104:5, Is.13:10, Mic.6:2). Australians do NOT hang by their feet under the world… this is a FACT, not a theory! Also a Fact the Spinning, Whirling, Gyrating Ball World Planet, Globe Idea is Entirely 100% now and at all times in the Past, a RELIGIOUS DOCTRINE… a Blind Dogmatic Article of Faith in the Religion for the Blind unreasoning beast of prey. No earthly reason for a Sane, Upright Member of the Elite True Christians to subscribe to it. Also a Fact, today the Elite of Earth ALL live on the Flat World. Only the illogical, unreasoning “herd”… prefers the way-out occult weird theology of the old Greek superstitution earth a spinning ball! Both Copernecious and Newton, the inventors of the “modern” superstitions (400 year OLD modern) have said: “It is not possible for a Sane reasonable person to ever really believe these Theories.” Thus sayeth Newton-Copernecious. What sayeth THOU?

If the Bible is wrong when it tells us it is infallible, then it contradicts itself. If it contradicts itself, then it is unreliable. If it is unreliable, then our faith is totally shattered and Christianity is a lie. You need to seriously reconsider your logic.

Hence one of my biggest issues with fundies.
Just imagine vast fields of our sisters in Christ — sisters brain damaged and comatosed, never to mentally return to this Earth full of sin — inserted into pods that are themselves connected to a myriad of wires and hydraulic tubes (I know, it sounds exactly like the Matrix, and I freely admit, although it’s certainly a very evil movie, some of the imagery is inspiring and inspired this post). The pods will be the most comfortable places on Earth, playing soothing music like Bible hymns and Mozart, their insides like a massage chair and covered in silk. A few intruding wires and tubes will, of course, have to connect to the women inside the pods to monitor their temperature and overall health, as well as the babies’ of those that are pregnant. And of course there will be one tube reserved for the insertion of a man’s seed whenever the women are at their most fertile. And only the best semen will be used. I haven’t quite settled on a selection process yet, but I’m thinking some sort of Christian council could perhaps vote on the man who is honorable and moral enough to breed generations of these children. Perhaps one man won’t be enough, for a little bit of diversity is always good. We should, therefore, most likely have a multitude of different men, one of each race. When the children are born, they can be sent off to special adoption centers, where they can be delivered to good Christian parents who are unable to themselves breed. Those that may be left over can be raised in God, brought up in Christian schools, where prayers are said thrice daily (at least), and in the summer, they can be sent to Jesus camp. If the schools are as good as I envision, then these children will make the perfect leaders for our future. But not just leaders, for if this idea is near as good as I am thinking, we will breed enough of these children to one day make up a huge percentage of our population, such that they can elect only the most Christian of people to the government. So even those that are not the brightest and best can contribute to God in some way.

Someone get this person in touch with a big studio.  That’s more imaginative than most films today!
Masturbation can sometimes be wrong and it can sometimes not. If you masturbate thinking about how pretty the flowers are and how you want a puppy, essentially that’s not wrong. But most times, that is not the case. I believe that when one masturbates a high percentage of the time they are fantasizing about a sexual partner therefore making masturbation lust. Lust, as the Bible states, is a sin. But masturbation is something that people in general should stay away from because it’s hard not to lust whilst doing it.
Ben Jamin A Foote (Lansing / East Lansing, MI), Facebook [Comments (98)] [2008-Jan-16] 
Yeah, but masturbating while thinking of flowers or puppies is just, well, ever so slightly fucking creepy.  Just the mere thought of it makes me need this:

And I’m not going to snark about this last one as it’s absolutely fucking tragic:
Just recently my son Bobby came out to me. I had been worried for awhile. His teachers said most of his grades were slipping and he seemed depressed and withdrawn.
Bobby said he’d been hiding it for awhile because he was afraid I would reject him. I sat him down and told him that I loved him and that God loved him, but that his salvation was in danger if he did not resist his unnatural tempations. I told him how being gay would mean he would live a shorter life, and that if he couldnt change his orientation he could be celibate like most the ex-gays are. He started crying saying something along the lines of “I knew you wouldnt understand! You’re just like everyone else!” before running to his room and slamming the door.
What did I do wrong? I dont want to lose my son, but I fear I already have. I talked it over with his therapist, who had the ludicrous idea that homosexuality was unchangable and that trying to repress could lead to lots of psychological damage (I’ve dropped him and will try to be finding another therapist with more moral beliefs). I wouldnt be surprised if he’s the one who’s feeding my son all the homosexual propaganda about how its ‘ok’ to be gay. That, or how homosexuality has engulfed the media, making it seem ‘cool’ and ‘hip’ and how they were just another oppressed minority. You didnt have to worry about seeing two men making out on tv at my age! I dont want to sound like a fanatic, but Im worried what other effects will come out of this increasingly secular, immoral society obsessed with filth.
Am I too late? Or is it possible to save my son

WARNING: the following rant is about the TV series Torchwood.  As such, it contains spoilers for series 1, the first episode of series 2, Dr Who (through to and including Voyage Of The Damned) and a couple of episodes of Life On Mars (though those bits might be only slightly spoileriffic).  If you do not wish to be spoiled for these programmes, look away now.  Seriously, go for it.  There’s a lot of good writers on this site.  Or even read the entry before this one.  It has the nominations for worst film of the year.  So, it should help you decide what to avoid when you next go to Blockbuster.

So, last week saw the first episode of the second series of Torchwood.  Not having a TV anymore, I got it on Thursday from the BBC iPlayer.  And I won’t be bothering anymore.
I’ve decided it’s not worth the heartbreak.
Torchwood is infuriatingly inconsistant.  In the first series, it had fantastic episodes.  The first episode was brilliant, as is typical for a Russell T Davies series opener.  Seriously, the guy can’t not write a decent opening episode.
Shame he then decided to hand the show over to Chris Chibnall.
See, everyone assumes that because RTD is in charge of Dr Who, and because Torchwood is a spin off from Dr Who, that RTD is also in charge of that.  He’s not.  Chibnall is.  And he can’t write sci-fi.
He is a good writer.  The two episodes of Life On Mars he wrote (one for series one, one for series two, both about ploice corruption) are amongst my favourite episodes of that show.  And they have very little to do with the time travel part of the show.
But this is also the guy who worte 42.  The real time episode of Dr Who that, erm, wasn’t in real time.  Seriously.  When your big countdown clock shows 10 minutes laft, there are 15 minutes laft in the episode and they manage to stop it just before the end of the episode, that’s not real time.  When you have a scene, and the next scene is something that happened elsewhere at the same time, that IS NOT real time.
He also wrote four episodes of Torchwood series one.  Day One (which wasn’t too bad, even if it was a rip off of the second episode of Angel), End Of Days (ditto, minus the Angel bit), Cyberwoman and Countrycide.
The two most derided episodes of the show in series one.  Where not only were the stories bad, but the camerawork was so shoddy that if I had handed those epiodes in as a college assignment, I would have got a severe bollocking.  And let’s not forget the fact that Cyberwoman completely ignored established events and continuity.
The poor continuity faries must be down the pub, getting drunk and asking “Torchwood.  Why hast thou forsaken us?”  Dr Who loves it’s continuity.  Even if it is something as simple as London being deserted in Voyage Of The Damned because everyone is scared of another alien attack.
But Torchwood seems to think that it is above continuity.  At the end of End Of Days, it is implied that the TARDIS came into the Hub and picked up Captain Jack.  Yet in Utopia, the captain is seen chasing after the TARDIS.  Yes, it’s possible that Jack heard the engines and took off, but have you seen what it takes to get into and out of the Hub?
Then, at the end of The Last Of The Timelords, The Doctor drops Jack off directly above the Hub.  At the begining of Kiss, Kiss, Bang, Bang Jack discovers the team after having somehow tracked them down while working on a case.  (And remember, The Doctor had disabled Jacks wrist computer thingy.)
While we’re at it.  In Jacks absense, Gwen took over the running of Torchwood.  Really, Mr Chibnall?  Gwen?  You sure that the rest of the team would follow the person with least seniority?  Not, say, Ianto (give him something to do instead of, well, what exactly is it that he does there?).
Torchwood is supposed to be a top secret organisation.  Yet the police all know them (apart from, rather conveniently, Gwen’s boyfriend), they drive around in a great big fuck off 4×4 with lights in the windscreen and their name plastered all over it.  And then Jack turns up somewhere in a bright red convertable.  Admittedly, I’ve never been to Cardiff, but I somehow doubt that red convertables are most peoples car of choice there.
And while we’re on the subject.  The people of Cardiff are portrayed as being oblivious to aliens.  Yet a being with a goldfish head is seen driving said convertable and no-one asks questions?  Maybe it is more normal there than I first thought.
Then we have the episodes big guest name star.  James Marsters.  I’m wondering.  Did they cast him because the role was a virtual carbon copy of Spike?  Or did they make the character the way he was because they cast Marsters?  Cos the problem with that is you immediately invite comparisons with the original.  And there’s no way Torchwood ever wins that argument.
So, I’m done with the series.  Bad sci-fi is one thing.  But when you know that a show can be good, when it’s proven how amazing it can be (Everythign Changes, the aforementioned opening episode, Small Worlds and They Keep Killing Suzie which are incredibly dark, Captain Jack Harkness which is one of the best time travel episodes of any show ever with an amazingly heartbreaking ending) and yet it seems to be, most of the time, good at best (Out Of Time good idea bad execution, Combat where all I was waiting for was Tyler Durden to say “The first rule of alien fight club is you don’t talk about alien fight club”, the aforementioned Chibnall episodes) it breaks my heart.
Some will say that the show is cheesy or camp.  Sorry, but it’s supposed to be the serious one from the Dr Who universe.  And adult, which they seem to equate with loads of swearing n shagging.  Cos a serious, dark, adult sci-fi and fantasy show would never work.  Except Angel.  And Battlestar Galactica.  Oh, and The X-Files for a lot of it’s run.  And Ultraviolet.  Can’t forget Qatermass and Blakes Seven.  And possibly The Twilight Zone.  Apart from them it’ll never work, so why even try?  (Never mind that one of the best episodes of series one was incredibly dark.)
I’ll watch the two episodes with Martha in them, cos she rocks and it’ll make up for not having her in the whole of the next series of Dr Who.  (And if someone could let me know when they air, I’d appreciate it.)  Apart from that?  Give me a call when Chibnall has been replaced by someone good.

Lohans KILLED ME, Murphys NORBIT, Sandlers CHUCK & LARRY Lead 28th RAZZIE® Awards Race
Eddie Sets a New Worst Achievement Record with 5 Nods in a Single Year
In an awards season where the top-dollar ceremonies are all quaking in their boots wondering what stars (if any) will show up for their events, the one award show where the stars never show up is left wondering what all the fuss is about: As unaffected by the WGA writers strike as they are unconcerned about the massive star egos they poke fun at year-after-year, the Golden Raspberry Awards® plan to forge ahead with their annual insult-fest whether The 80th Annual Academy Awards® (aka The Giving Out of the Little Gold Naked Men) go on or not. Scheduled for 10am/PST on Saturday, February 23 at Magicopolis in Santa Monica (the day before this yearsOscars® might be held) The 28th Annual RAZZIE® Awards promise to be a real horse race. Voters for Hollywoods least-coveted trophy wound up putting three of their five Worst Picture nominees within one nod of each other, meaning anyone on this years List of Berry Bad Movies could go home with the bulk of the gold-spray-painted, $4.89 statuettes that signify their winners stank.
Topping the field with 9 nominations is I KNOW WHO KILLED ME, a Lindsay Lohan vehicle that proved as dangerous for its star as any car she ever ran off the road. An oddball cross-breeding of the HOSTEL/SAW genre of teen torture porn with elements of the old PATTY DUKE SHOW, I KNOW stars Lohan as psychically connected twins. KILLED ME copped nominations as 2007s Worst Picture, Worst Screenplay, Worst Director and Worst Screen Couple (Lohan appearing opposite herself). It also pulled off the feat of the first ever double Worst Actress nod: Lohan is individually listed for each of the two characters she so lamely portrays. But last years Oscar® loser Eddie Murphy managed to steal Lohans thunder by garnering himself a record-setting FIVE nominations in a single year. The Latex-laden, nearly laugh-free comedy NORBIT, in which Murphy plays three distinct (and decidedly stinky) characters won Eddie a chance to take home trophies for Worst Supporting Actor (as the Asian character Mr. Wong) Worst Supporting Actress (as the hideous 400 pound harpy Rasputia) and Worst Actor (as the title character) as well as having Murphy compete alongside himself for Worst Screen Couple. For having co-written the misbegotten mess, Eddie is also a Worst Screenplay nominee. Tying with NORBITs total of 8 nominations, and rounding out the Trifecta of the Truly Terrible, is 1999 Worst Actor winner Adam Sandlers gag-inducing gay romp I NOW PRONOUNCE YOU CHUCK & LARRY, the plot of which has Sandler and co-star Kevin James as New York firemen who pretend to be a married gay couple to scam medical benefits for James. In addition to Worst Picture, I NOW PRONOUNCE was pronounced a contender for Worst Actor (Sandler) Worst Supporting Actor (James) Worst Supporting Actress (Jessica Biel) and Worst Screen Couple (Sandler and EITHER James OR Biel).  Rounding out the Worst Picture field are the BFF B.O. bomb BRATZ and the duddy sequel DADDY DAY CAMP. Other well-known names getting their share of blame in this years RAZZIE® competition include former Oscar winners Cuba Gooding Jr. (Worst Actor for both DADDY DAY CAMP and NORBIT) Diane Keaton (Worst Actress for BECAUSE I SAID SO) and Jon Voight (Worst Supporting Actor for 4 titles, including BRATZ). Links to the complete list of this year’s RAZZIE® contenders appear in the left column of this page.
Nominees were determined by mailing ballots to 747 voters in 44 U.S. states and 18 foreign countries. The RAZZIES® were created in 1980 as a logical antidote to Tinsel Towns annual glut of self-congratulations by John Wilson, author of EVERYTHING I KNOW I LEARNED AT THE MOVIES and THE OFFICIAL RAZZIE® MOVIE GUIDE.  For more information on the awards history, or to arrange an interview with Wilson, please visit http://www.razzies.com or contact HeadRAZZberry@razzies.com

…Might Temper the Real Thing
By PETER S. GOODMAN
NEW ORLEANS  Are movies like Hannibal and the remake of Halloween, which serve up murder and mutilation as routine fare, actually making the nation safer?
A paper presented by two researchers over the weekend to the annual meeting of the American Economic Association here challenges the conventional wisdom, concluding that violent films prevent violent crime by attracting would-be assailants and keeping them cloistered in darkened, alcohol-free environs.
Instead of fueling up at bars and then roaming around looking for trouble, potential criminals pass the prime hours for mayhem eating popcorn and watching celluloid villains slay in their stead.
Youre taking a lot of violent people off the streets and putting them inside movie theaters, said one of the authors of the study, Gordon Dahl, an economist at the University of California, San Diego. In the short run, if you take away violent movies, youre going to increase violent crime.
Professor Dahl and the papers other author, Stefano DellaVigna, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, attach precise numbers to their argument: Over the last decade, they say, the showing of violent films in the United States has decreased assaults by an average of about 1,000 a weekend, or 52,000 a year.
Crime is not merely delayed until after the credits run, they say. On the Monday and Tuesday after packed weekend showings of violent films, no spike in violent crime emerges to compensate for the peaceful hours at the movies. Even a few weeks later, there is no evidence of a compensating resurgence, they say.
The findings in their paper are part of a recent wave of economic research in what might be called the freakonomics era. Practitioners of the dismal science are transcending traditional subjects like labor and markets, and are now crunching numbers to evaluate matters like cheating among sumo wrestlers or the effects of a crackdown on cocaine.
In this case, the authors have waded into a long-simmering debate about media violence, with their findings likely to attract controversy: Their conclusion seems to collide with the research of psychologists, which has fed concerns by parents and policy makers that brutal imagery in films, video games and other media sows aggression in American life by rendering viewers insensitive to horrific acts.
There are hundreds of studies done by numerous research groups around the world that show that media violence exposure increases aggressive behavior, said Craig A. Anderson, a psychologist and director of the Center for the Study of Violence at Iowa State University. People learn from every experience in life, and that learning occurs at a very basic level of brain function.
The studys authors acknowledge that their research does not refute and in fact lends credence to the findings of laboratory studies. Neither does it address the long-term effects of exposure to violent media, an influence they view as pernicious.
Rather, the research uses a decade of national crime reports, cinema ratings and movie audience data to examine what has happened to rates of violent crime during and immediately after violent films are shown.
Though such films may indeed stimulate a greater tendency toward aggression in audiences, Professor Dahl offers a rejoinder much favored by economists: Compared to what?
Young men are the most likely to commit violent crimes. In opting to see a movie  even one featuring, say, gang rape or chain-saw amputation  they forgo activities that have a greater tendency to encourage mayhem, like drinking and drug use.
Economics is about choice, Professor Dahl said. What would these people have done if they had not chosen to go and see a movie? Whatever they would have done would have had a greater tendency to involve alcohol. If you can incapacitate a large group of potentially violent people, thats a good thing.
Professor DellaVigna added, Its not as if these people watching violent movies would otherwise be home reading a book.
But critics of violent media worry that the study, with its focus on immediate effects, could distract policy makers from troubling signs of long-term harm to society and leave parents thinking that violent films may be the least bad way for their adolescent children to occupy leisure hours.
The studys premise strikes me as somewhat goofy, said Melissa Henson, senior director of programs at the Parents Television Council, a media watchdog based in Los Angeles. Id hate for people to walk away with the message that, Oh, I ought to send my son to watch violent movies so they wont go out and drink or do drugs and commit violent crime. What about going to the Y.M.C.A. and playing basketball, or after-school activities?
Professor Dahl seems an unlikely advocate for the crime-snuffing potential of sadistic cinema. A Mormon, he forbids his four children from watching violent films. He recently purchased a DVD player that strips out brutal or sexual images. He eschews violent films himself, professing discomfort even with Schindlers List, the epic portrayal of the Holocaust.
I dont like how I feel when I watch them, he said.
Yet his rejection of violent media was, in a sense, the spark for his inquiry.
In 2005, he and his wife, Katherine, concerned about their childrens viewing, consulted a Web site, kids-in-mind.com, that rates films for violence, sexual content and profanity. Professor Dahl was then working on another project employing a national database of crime reports. He wondered: Could one combine the movie ratings with the crime data and the numbers of people seeing films to explore how crime rates change with exposure to violent movies?
Analyzing the data, the authors found that on days with a high audience for violent movies, violent crime is lower.
From 6 p.m. to midnight on weekends  when the largest numbers of people are in theaters  violent crimes decreased 1.3 percent for every million people watching a strongly violent movie, the study found. Violent crimes dropped 1.1 percent for every million seeing a mildly violent film.
In the hours after theaters close  from midnight to 6 a.m. the next day  violent crimes dropped 1.9 percent for every million people at a strongly violent movie, and by 2.1 percent for every million at mildly violent film. Strikingly, the data shows that crimes also drop, though not by as much, when large audiences see nonviolent films that young men find appealing.
In other words, Professor Dahl suggested, Hollywood could help cut crime in more palatable fashion by cutting out the gore while making movies that still attract male teenagers and 20-somethings.
We need more Adam Sandler movies, he said. Even though Im not a big fan of Adam Sandler, thats the implication.

Not had too bad a day so far.  Planning to meet up with some friends in the union later for a few drinks.  There may even be a cute girl there.
OK then, there will be a cute girl there.  Don’t stand a chance like but still.
But at least I’m in a better mood than I was last year.  Which is good.
Will write a proper update later.  Also need to write my Torchwood rant (that’ll probably be tomorrow).  Just thought I’d write an entry marking the day.

1141,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/fun-weekend-edit-3929882/,2008-01-13,Fun weekend.  *EDIT*,"
Saturday, after getting kicked out of the library, I headed over to the union to see if anyone I knew was there.
One friend was and he bought me a drink.  We chatted for a bit, he asked me to guard his drink and promptly disappeared.  Though he did leave me with most of a pint.  Yay!
So, I went and sat with another couple of frends and a cute girl.  We chatted, had a laugh, sang some Beautiful South songs and Birdhouse In Your Soul and just generally had a great time.  I left early as I was hungry.  As I left, the cute girl asked for my myspace details so she could add me as a friend.  Went home, watched stuff on my laptop and got to sleep about 5am.
Next day, was woken at about 3pm by a text message from a friend asking if i wanted to go for a quick drink.  Met up with her, messed about online while she looked stuff up and then headed to the union.
It was supposed to be for only a couple of hours but it ended up being a session.  We took the piss out of some random idiots who for a while now seem to find it funny to constantly shout my name whenever they see me, took the piss out of Newcastle FC and just had a blast.  I believe that the words “I would make a fantastic gay guy if I wasn’t straight” issued forth from my lips at some point in time.  It was one of those sessions.
Went home, watched some wrestling and Top gear.  I also tried to write, but it just wasn’t happening :¬(
Seriously, I need to do something, anything to get rid of this damn writers block.  It’s starting to really annoy me now.
And today’s been really boring.  Signed on, wandered round town, phoned Virgin mobile about the replacement battery for my mobile phone (re-ordered, can take up to 7 working days, but the bloke I spoke to said that his replacement battery took about 5) and came online.

*EDIT*
Now I’m slightly worried.  When I was wondering round town this morning, I had a tight feeling in my chest and felt like I was going to collapse.  When I was wondering round town this evening, I had a sharp pain on the right hand side of my body (which was probably just a stitch) and I felt like I was going to collapse.  It’s probably just a lack of sleep.
Also, I’ve decided to email my cv to a few agencies.  It’s about time I got serious about getting some decent money.  Not as serious as these people though:
 Pensioner jailed for ‘£2.4m’ scam
A pensioner has been jailed for five years for masterminding a benefits scam worth as much as £2.4m.
Jean Hutchinson, 65, ran an office hidden behind a secret door at the back of her bedroom wardrobe in her flat in Maida Vale, west London.
She scoured newspapers to find people who had emigrated before using their identities to claim benefits, Blackfriars Crown Court heard.
Hutchinson pleaded guilty to conspiring to defraud between 1996 and 2006.
‘Criminal enterprise’
With the help of a cousin and lax information controls, she was able to amass a seven-figure fortune from false benefit claims, before ploughing the cash into property and shares.
A five-month surveillance operation was launched by the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) after they discovered the “highly profitable” scam.
Investigators found a hidden doorway leading to a fully equipped “headquarters” where thousands of documents, neatly filed and cross-referenced, were found.
“The fact that the fraudsters found it necessary to construct what was effectively an archive of the fraud indicates the sheer scale of their criminal enterprise,” said Anuja Dhir, prosecuting.
Hutchinson’s cousin, Ralph Dale, 63, of Halifax, West Yorkshire, was jailed for four years after pleading guilty to conspiracy to defraud.
Passing sentence, Judge Deva Pillay said their crimes allowed them to accrue “what can only be described as extraordinary amounts of money”.
The judge said: “The Crown’s case, which is substantially supported by vast amounts of incontrovertible evidence, discloses that over a 13-year period you both – and I have no doubt with the connivance of others not before this court – defrauded the Department of Work and Pensions and various local authorities out of sums said to be in excess of £2.4 million by falsely claiming various state-funded benefits.
“Upon the basis of pleas tendered by each of you, the prosecution now estimate, over the 10 years for which each of you appear to accept responsibility, some £1.8m of public money was handed over to you and your accomplices.
“That equates to a staggering £180,000 per annum,” she said.
After the case, anti-fraud minister James Plaskitt said: “These defendants thought they could keep their benefit fraud locked out of sight but thanks to our determined fraud investigators their deception had been uncovered and terminated with immediate effect.”

Pensioners.  Freaking pensioners.  Mind you, it’s not as if they don’t have the time to keep on top of things.
I’ve also decided to shelve the novel I was working on, and try another one.  Was going to wait until I had time to do a bit of research for this one, but I’ve decided to just pull the trigger now.
Wish me luck.

…but at least life in Boro is never boring:
 Men held over suspicious package
A suspicious package dumped outside a shopping centre on Teesside has been detonated in a controlled explosion.
Police were called to Middlesbrough Mall Shopping Centre on Friday after three men said they had a bomb.
Armed officers arrived within minutes and arrested the men, who had dropped a carrier bag outside the centre.
Bomb disposal experts from Cattrick carried out a controlled explosion. Police do not believe there was an explosive device inside the bag.
Officers were also investigating a second bomb threat at Middlesbrough bus station in Newport Road.
But after a search involving sniffer dogs nothing was found.
The three arrested men, all in their 20s, were being questioned by police.

I hate never being able to remember my dreams.  I know I came up with a good story idea last night, but now I can’t sodding well remember it.  Grrr!
I’ve also got myself strangely sddicted to Degrassi: TNG, even though I’ve only seen season 1 (I watched the whole season straight through in one sitting).  Guess I just have a weird thing for Canadian melodrama.
Or maybe I just have a weird thing for girls who say aboot.
Apart from that, not much happening with me, so I’ll sign off here.

This is actually an amalgam of about three different entries.  Y’see, I tend to think “I’ll read my favourites, leave notes (where applicable), check the boards, see what’s been put into the politics circle, then write an entry.”  The problem with that is by the time I get round to writing said entry, I have to leave the LRC.
So, here we go:
Had a bit of excitement on Friday.  I was walking up the street with my mu on our way to pick up the super 8 film we had ordered when a bus pulled up at a stop, opened it’s doors and someone came flying out followed by another bloke who was seriously laying into him.  I didn’t think too much about it, confident that the driver would radio for the police.  Until I realised something.  The person throwing the punches was the driver.  So my mum lent me her mobile phone (my one being broken) and I called the police.  Waited for them to turn up, gave them our detaails and went on our merry way.
Got the film, wondered round town for a bit, went home.  Tried out the camera, which seems to be working and then my dad asks if I want it.
I’ve already got a super 8 camera, but as this one is slightly better, i said hell yeah!
If you remember, this is my old camera:

And this is the new one:


And that’s the big assed case I had to drag down to Boro with me.  Along with my clothes bag, my backpack and my laptop case.  That was fun.
Saturday saw me get up at 7:30, make my way into town and onto a coach for the Falkirk – Aberdeen game.  We stopped at the British Legion for a few drinks and some food before the game and had a bit of banter with the locals.  We then went to Falkirk Staduim.  And I’m considering suing Falkirk FC for breach of the Trades Description Act.  Seriously.  The “stadium” had a large stand for the home fans, a smaller stand for us, a seating area less impresive then the one at the Bremar Gathering, again for home fans (it was so small that a couple of balls flew straight over it) and, erm, that was it.
Took part in a minutes applause for Phil O’Donnell and then the game itself.  Which wasn’t very good.  Seriously, Aberdeen were shockingly bad.  No midfield whatsoever.
Back to Aberdeen, round to my sister and BIL’s for a bit of a party and eventually got home about 2:45am.
Sunday didn’t really do much apart from take tia for a long walk.  This was supposed to help her burn off some energy, but it didn’t quite work.
Monday, up early, finish packing then onto the train.  Aberdeen – Edinburgh, no problem.  Got on the train in Edinburgh to discover that since National Express took over the east cost line from GNER they had introduced free wifi internet access for everyone.  Shame it wasn’t very fast.  Darlington to Boro, usual problems with my bags and then home.
The new charger for my phone had arrived but not the new battery.  Fucksocks.  Still waiting for that.  Phoned Virgin mobile, have been assured that it’s been sent.  Phoned home to let mum know I got back safely.  Phoned my friend Lewis, had a shower and headed to the union via a shop for some baccy.  Saw a Cleveland Police mobile unit outside a  house which had been roped off.  Thought something serious had happened.  And I was right:
 Two die after ‘domestic incident’
The deaths of a man and a woman in a house on Teesside appeared to be the result of a domestic incident which had a “tragic ending”, police have said.
Father-of-four Paul McGill, 39, was found hanged in a bedroom at Portman Street in Middlesbrough on Friday.
Diane Lamming, 38, also found at the property, died after suffering severe head injuries, police said.
A Cleveland Police spokeswoman appealed for witness, but said no-one else was being sought over the deaths.
Officers were alerted on Friday morning by a workman who had called at the property.
‘Terrible and tragic’
Mr McGill and Ms Lamming, a mother of three, were both pronounced dead at the scene.
A force spokesman said: “We now know Ms Lamming died from severe head injuries and Mr McGill from asphyxiation through hanging.
“The appears to be a domestic-type incident which has had a terrible and tragic ending.”
He said relatives of the pair had been informed of their deaths.
Mr McGill’s family described him as a “loving and caring son and brother, a father to four beautiful children”.
“Everyone liked his cheeky and caring nature. He will be missed by everyone who knew him,” they added.
Ms Lamming was mother to two sons and a daughter, aged between 11 and 21.

Yeah, like I said, right round the corner from the house.
Went to the union, caught up with friends and took part in the quiz, where we came fourth.
And nothing much has happened since then.  Apart from talking to two rather cute girls in the union Tuesday night while reading Hannibal Rising.
(Which reminds me, need to write another couple of reviews for 12 in Twelve.)
And, in the spirit of this entry I thought I’d record here, for posterity, the first note I was left for every month last year.  Enjoy.

I’ve seen a few different versions of this floating around ODland, but as this was the first one I saw, it’s the one I’m doing.
The first sentance of the first entry of every month last year:
January:
Hundreds of protesters in France have rung in the New Year by holding a light-hearted march against it. 
Febuary:
So, on Monday night, I got home after the quiz and decided to watch me some Angel.
March:
Just days after former Vice President Al Gore received an Academy Award for his global warming documentary An Inconvenient Truth, the United States Supreme Court handed Mr. Gore a stunning reversal, stripping him of his Oscar and awarding it to President George W. Bush instead. 
April:
This weeks theme question is:
May:
So, for various reasons, my hair has grown quite long.
June:
Well, actually, it’s been on since Friday.
July:
Yup folks, ScriptFrenzy! is now officially over.

1145,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/my-favourite-place-on-earth-editx2-3929878/,2008-01-02,My favourite place on Earth *EDITX2*,"
Yesterday I had a very, very relaxing day as I went with my parents to visit my gran.  She lives in a very, very small village called Sandhaven.  It’s about an hour drive away from Aberdeen.  Here it is if anyone is interested.
After we’d been there for about an hour I went for a wonder round and was suddenly struck by something.  I love the place.  As my entry title says, it’s my favourite place in the world.
There’s not much to do, and I doubt if I’d be able to live there on a permanent basis, but it’s a good place to relax and unwind.  In fact, before I moved to Middlesbrough, I would occasionally book a weekend of work and head up there for a few days.
It is a two pub, one shop village.  There’s something nice about the fact that you have to make sure you have enough supplies for the night befre the shop shuts or that’s it till the next day.  Indeed, before when I went there, I couldn’t even be reached on my mobile as I didn’t get a signal.
I would spend some time with family, relax and unwind.  It’s absolute bliss.
And now for some pics:

I’ve fished in this harbour before.  Hell, I’ve swam in that harbour before.  Trust me, brass monkeys don’t even stand a chance.



Me, my brother, my sister and my cousins used to play on these rocks all the time.  Incredible to think of it now, most modern parents wouldn’t dream of letting their kids play there, but as long as we wrapped up warm, off we would go.

The neighbouring village of Pittulie.  That’s not the main road into the village.  That road literally is the village.

Yeah, I’m aware that the pics aren’t working.  Unfortunately, I can’t get into photobucket to solve it.

2007 SPECIAL!
Yup that’s right, I’m about to answer the questions you asked about my year in 2007.  So, let’s get right to it.
First up was findingsunshine:
Did you make any resolutions for yourself this year? I’m guessing you’re probably one of those people who doesn’t make resolutions; so am I, but I still made one secretly in my head. Did you do that? And if so, did it stick?
Nope, no resolutions.  If I want to change something in my life I’ll change it, no matter what time of year it is.
What action taken by your government most affected you this year?
The ban on smoking in public places.  As a smoker, this could be the only response.
What did you expect to happen in 2007 that didn’t?
Finishing college and graduating.
What DID happen that you weren’t expecting?
Again, this one’s a no brainer.  Finding that picture of my ex and my daughter.
What changed about you this year?
Not much.  Grew my hair long…
What would you like to change about yourself next year?
Get a job.  That’s about it.
Do you like fireworks on NYE or are they overrated?
They don’t really do fireworks on NYE in Aberdeen.
Next was Kaly:
What types of things fed your spirit best in 2007?
Good films, good TV (my pick of the best in 2007?  Pushing Daisies, The Sarah Jane Adventures, Dr Who, Life, chuck, Reaper and Life On Mars), good friends.
What was the biggest challenge to your spirit?
Being homeless.
Did you travel anywhere we’d love to hear about (maybe again)?
Nope, unfortunately.
If you set some specific goals for the year (that you care to share), did you meet them? Why or why not?
I didn’t set any specific goals this year.
Did events in the world serve to make you more optimistic about our future o this planet, or less?
Slightly more optomistic.  But only slightly.
Do you remember any funny jokes from this past year?
Not really, no.
Can you name one moment of pure wonder you experienced?
At my friends daughters christening, when the baby was crying throughout the service, stopped when handed over to the minister.
What song sticks in your head most for the year?
Such Great Heights by Iron and Wine.
Given the chance to change five things from the past year, what would they be?
Nothing.  Everything that happened did so for a reason.
Following closely on Kaly’s heels was The Mary:
What was the happiest moment?
This may sound strange, but finding out about my daughter.  It’s information that I’ve been after for the past 9.5 years so, yeah.  That.
Who did you not see much of this year?
My friend Lewis.
Did you ever wish you were somewhere else, and if so, where?
Not particularly.  There were days where I wished I was anywhere else but where I was, but that was more of a frustration thing.
If you could choose one word to describe the entire year, what would it be?
Bizarre.
Name three songs that you could associate with 2007.
Such Great Heights by Iron and Wine,
Flurescent Adolescent by Arctic Monkeys,
Birdhouse In Your Soul by They Might Be Giants.
Winning question of the entry by a country mile is Krud:
What event in 2007 caused you to think with baffled amusement, “I live in a world where that just happened…”?
All the press coverage of Anna Nicoles death.  Either that or the England fans, having just been drawn against Croatia in the World Cup qualifiers, claiming that they’ll qualify top of the group easily because Croatia were the easiest of the top seeded teams.  Conveniently forgetting that croatia had beaten them twice in the Euro 2008 qualifiers.
Karma Girl did ask more questions than this, but this was the only one about 2007.  So I’ll answer the others later:
Which Australian did you want to snog the most in 2007? (Hint: If it’s not me, I hate you.)
Well, you see, it was you.  But then I found out that you are apparently an amazing kisser and, well, see the note I left you re:imploding universes and strawberry noses :¬p
AnotherGirl had a couple of questions:
Question: how do you think your life in 2007 will influence your choices in 2008?
I really don’t know.  I tend to discover these things as they happen.
Question: what was the best day in all of ’07? / what was the worst?
Best day: see answer to The Mary’s first question.  Worst day: the day I was made homeless.
And shesolovely finishes things off:
Who did you feel most connection with in 2007?
Probably my friend Emma.
What changed the most for you in 2007?
Lots of things.  I think the biggest was my outlook on life.
Best book you read in 2007?
I’m probably going to surprise you lot here.  You’ll be expecting me to say Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.  And it is a brilliant book.  But the best book I read lat year was actually Darkly Dreaming Dexter by Jeff Lindsay.  i got it after watching most of the TV series and it was not as good as I thought it would be.  It was better.  All of the characters are well thought out and Dexter himself is an amazing, if slightly surreal narrator and protagonist.
So, there we have it.  And I might repeat this particular exercise in 12 months, but the next regularly scheduled Peoples Interview is in a mere 78 entries.  But I will, as usual, give you plenty of warning.
Happy new year!

1147,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/sex-dvds-show-malaysian-minister-3929876/,2007-12-31,Sex DVDs show Malaysian minister,"
Malaysian Health Minister Chua Soi Lek has admitted that he is the man who features in two widely circulated DVDs of an unmarried couple having sex.
He said he had apologised to the prime minister and other ruling party leaders but would not resign, and his own wife and children had accepted his apology.
Mr Chua said he had taken no part in the making of the DVD recordings, one of them said to be almost an hour long.
The video is CCTV footage taken in a hotel, according to one newspaper.
It is the latest in a series of difficulties to confront the administration of Prime Minister Abdullah Badawi, who is expected to call an election in the coming weeks.
According to Malaysia’s Star newspaper, copies of the DVDs were initially left at various locations in the town of Muar, in Johor State, on Saturday “for people to pick up”.
‘It was me’
Mr Chua made his admission hours after the Star reported that the two DVDs were being widely distributed in Johor, his home state.
“I am the man in the tape,” Mr Chua, 60, told reporters.
“The girl is a personal friend.”
“I would like to emphasise I did not make the tape myself,” he added.
“Who [did] this is not important. What is most important is that my family, wife and children have accepted my apology.”
According to the Star, the DVDs are believed to be CCTV recordings made in a hotel suite. The hotel and the date are reportedly unknown.
As health minister, Mr Chua has advocated giving out free condoms to reduce the spread of HIV, in the face of religious opposition.

1148,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/stuff-1413-3929875/,2007-12-30,Stuff,"
First of all, camera!
Yup I do now have a new digital camera.  I found one in it’s box in the dining room, was having a look at the spec on the box and my mum asked if I wanted it as an early birthday present.  i said yes.  This is some sort of super camera.  It has:
Still camera,
video camera (with sound),
ebook reader,
voice recorder,
MP3 player and
20 built in computer games.
Admittedly, it only has a 64 meg memory, but that’ll change when i get a memory card for it.
When I get back down the road and get access to my tripod, I’ll post another video entry but, in the mean time, here is the first picture I took on it:

(Course it’s of my current shadow Tia, in this house it would not be of anything else.)
I’d take a picture of the actual camera using my phone, but it’s not switching on at the moment.  Technology has decided not to like me just now, apparently.  I’m waiting on a call back from Virgin Mobile about it.
I’ll be answering your questions tomorrow so this is your last chance.  I’ll repeat again, at the moment I’m looking for questions soley about my 2007.  Some people have been asking general questions, so what I’ll do is keep them for my next regularly scheduled Q&A session.
Got a shock on Saturday when I went to check the football results and discovered that Phil O’Donnell died after collapsing on the pitch during the Motherwell – Dundee Utd game.  He was 35.  Kinda puts things into perspective when something like that happened.  thus far 3 games have been cancelled tomorrow (including the Old Firm game (O’Donnell played for Celtic)) and one game on Saturday.  If it were up to me, all SPL games would be cancelled tomorrow, but it’s not.
Apart from that, not much happening in my world.  I’ll go, but I’d like to wish you all a very happy New Year and thank you all for the support you’ve given me through what was a very, very difficult 12 months.
Seriously, you guys rock.

1149,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/thank-you-970-3929874/,2007-12-28,Thank you,"
Seriously, thanks to all of you for the responses to yesterday’s edit.
It’s kinda bizarre that the last thing I said before the end of my last entry (apart from asking for questions, which I’m still looking for) was saying that the only way this year could get worse was to contract an STD.
Well, not quite a turn for the worse, but more for the weird.  I’ve still to decide what’s happening from here, except that I know what my next tattoo is (my daughter’s name in the inside of my wrist).
I’ve tried friending my ex on facebook and may try on myspace, but if I’ve had no response from her by Monday, I’m going to email her.
But at least I’ve got this far.
The Pushing Daisies quote I posted last night was good, but I want to post the full thing for posterity:
EMERSON:  Oh, I understand better than you think.  You feel like you — like you 
messed up, like you just lost the only person who ever meant anything to you.  
Part of you feels like it’s for the best, and like maybe you never even deserved 
her in the first place.
NED:  Oh-kay, maybe you understand, but there’s something I can do to get Chuck 
back.  I can give her back her father, if only to say goodbye.
EMERSON:  The relationship between a father and his daughter is tenuous.  It’s 
very fragile.  It could take a lifetime to sort out all the issues there.  And, 
what?  You think you can just “happily ever after” it after one minute?  Man, 
you a dreamer.
NED:  And you’re a cynic.
EMERSON:  I’m a father.
(Neds jaw drops.)  
NED:  As in a priest?
EMERSON:  As in a man with a daughter.
Please leave your questions about my 2007 for Tuesday.  Please.

So, here’s a thing.
I was informed earlier in the month that my contribution based JSA would run out on the 18th.  Not wanting things to be dragged out over the holidays, I immediately went to James Cook House, filled out the form in question and handed it in.
When I went to my 6 month interview, I asked if everything had been sorted, and was assured that it was.  I came home happy with the situation.
I was due to get a payment yesterday.  So, in desperate need for tobacco (those readers of mine who smoke will understand) I headed into town as my money usually goes in at midnight.
And sure enough it was.  All £16.90 of it.
Course, 2 weeks money is more like £114.
So, i took out £10 and also got a ministatement.  It wasn’t a problem with the maching.  It really was £16.90 that had been put into my account.
I came back to the flat and worked it out with the calculator.  The money i got was the last 2 days of my contribution based JSA.
Fucksocks.
So, I phoned them today.  Turns out that my reward for being dilligent and getting the form filled out quickly and in advance was that it was put into the pending file, where it was supposed to be dealt with two days before the contribution based JSA ran out, and promptly forgot about it.
Even better, if they couldn’t find my original form I’d have to fill out another one.  Thankfully they did and I’m getting my money tomorrow afternoon.
Seriously, I don’t think this year could get any worse.  Well, I could get a STD.  Even then, at least I’ll have got laid.
BTW, still looking for questions for the The Peoples Interview: williamthebloody 2007 special.  I’m hoping to post it on Hogmany, but I can’t if I don’t have any questions.
Will
*EDIT*
And it’s big.  Giant, enormous big.
Remember this entry?
Well, on a whim, I decided to search facebook to see if I could find the ex in question.  With a bit of searching, I found someone I thought was her.  After a bit more electronic messing about, I was able to see the profile and find a link to her myspace page.  Still wasn’t able to confirm it was her as there were no actual pictures of her on the facebook page.  Or in her pics on myspace.
But I read her myspace blog.  And there were pics of her for an article that appeared in the local paper.  And her daughter.  Who was named.  So, I now know what daughter looks like and what her name is.  For the first time.  In eight years.
Ladies and gentlemen, i present to you my ex girlfriend.  And my daughter, Amy:

I am shaking.  Actually, physically shaking.  This is huge.  Fucking huge.  I don’t think anyone reading this can know exactly what this means to me.
And the funny thing?  I just yesterday watched the last pre-strike episode of Pushing Daisies and the following dialogue was included:
Emerson: The relationship between a father and his daughter is tenuous. It’s very fragile. It could take a life time to sort out all the issues there. And what you think? You can just all “happily ever after” after just one minute? Man, you a dreamer.
Emerson: I’m a father.
Ned: As in a priest?
Emerson: As in a man… with a daughter.
Thank FSM I get my money tomorrow, cos I’ll need a stiff drink or 10.

I’m just waiting for my younger brother to come ans pick me up to take me to the perental units for pressies and Chrimbo dinner.
So I thought I’d wish you all the best of the day, whether or not you celebrate christmas.
Will update later with a list of stuff what I got (though I do know a camera of some description is involved).
And don’t forget I’m still looking for your questions about my 2007 for a special Q&A entry.
Later!
Will
*EDIT*
So, I was wrong about the camera, which is a surprise, cos I’m sure my mum said something about me getting a camera for my Christmas.  I did get the following:
Parents: A t shirt and £30.
Brother: A book of amusing music quotes.
Santa: A bottle of Spitfire ale (annoying as I don’t drink ale), 5 pairs of socks (much needed), some smelly stuff, sweets, fruit and a zippo style lighter with the Saltire on it.
I’ll get my pressies from sister and BIL when they return from holiday.
I’m currently sat here with a vodka and coke (run out of lager) watching the Top Gear Polar Special.  Going into town after that to try and find somewhere that’s open for a cheeky pint (or 5).  Watched the Dr Who special which was good save one extremely cheesy moment.  I’m currently downloading through the wonder of the BBC iPlayer (can also get the Queens speach if I want (but I don’t)).
I’ll stop boring you now.  Hope Santa was good to you lot.

I’m flatsitting for my sister and brother in law at the moment.  And, as a result, I’m not being followed around by a large black shadow.
My mums dog Tia has taken to following me all round the house.  And that’s not all she’s taken to doing.  Hence the reason my MSN name at the moment is:
No, Tia, I am not made of dog food!
As well as flat sitting I’m looking after their pet budgie Kylie.  Who’s been fine so far.  Although she has discovered that with me flatsitting, she now has a new perch:

And as that pic shows, my laptop is working again.  Huzzah!  Now to work on my letter of complaint.
Tomorrow I’m using my BIL’s season ticket to go and watch the mighty Dons, fresh from their victory demolision of FC copenhagen take on Rangers.  And I’m going to be going to my first away game against Falkirk.  The ticket is my birthday pressie from my folks and the bus ticket is my pressie from my sister and BIL.  Yay!
I know there was something else I was going to say, but I can’t remember it.  So I’ll go.

Oh, actually, that was it.  It’s become a bit of a tradition for me to do a year end survey every December.  But I can’t be bothered this year.  So, ask me questions about my 2007.  Anything you want to know (but only about the past year please) and I’ll answer them probably about Hogmany.
And now I really am done.

Previously on Broken Laptops:
After being messed about for the best part of the week, I finally find out that the places I need to take my laptop are miles away and I will not be able to get it seen to until after the warranty runs out.  Which I’d then have to pay for.
So, after getting kicked out of the LRC on Tuesday, I went for a pint.  And it was there that I decided that the best thing to do was get the details of a HP authorised place in Aberdeen and just go there.
So I found the place, looked them up on google maps, printed out the invoice from ebuyer (to prove that it is still in warranty) and off I set.  After a one and a half hour walk I ask them to help me.
Guess who’s website is in urgent need of an update?
The company in question lost their contract with HP earlier in the year.  Fucksocks!
So, back home I plod and straight on the phone to HP tech (no pissing about in online chats this time)  and gave a brief version of what was happening.
I now want you, gentle readers, to try and picture my face when I hear the following words…
“I can order a replacement cable to be sent out to you.”
Yeahbuwhatthefuck?  I was assured that going to a HP approved place to get them to look at it was the only way to get it sorted.
Anyhoo, the replacement cable is on route and, as soon as the problem is fixed, so will my email of complaint be.  Directly to Mark Hurd, CEO of HP.  (Cos there’s a form on the website where I can do that.)
On a lighter note, a joke for y’all:
One Christmas a long time ago Santa Claus had problems. Four of his elves were sick so Santa got behind schedule. Then Mrs Claus told Santa that her Mum was coming to visit; this stressed Santa even more. He went to see his reindeer and found that three of them were about to give birth. More stress. Then when he began to load the sleigh he dropped the toy bag and scattered the toys.
Santa went into the house for a shot of whisky but the elves had drunk him dry.
Just then the doorbell rang and Santa cussed on his way to the door. There was a little angel with a big Christmas tree. “Merry Christmas Santa, said the angel, Isn’t it a lovely day? I have a beautiful tree for you. Where would you like me to stick it?
Thus began the tradition of the angel on top of the Christmas tree.
Will
*EDIT*
The replacement adaptor arrived today and my laptop is now working.  Huzzah!

    NEW LINE AND MGM TO CO-PRODUCE AND SHARE WORLDWIDE DISTRIBUTION RIGHTS
    PETER JACKSON AND FRAN WALSH TO EXECUTIVE PRODUCE TWO FILMS BASED ON THE HOBBIT
    Los Angeles, CA (Tuesday, December 18, 2007) Academy Award-winning filmmaker Peter Jackson; Harry Sloan, Chairman and CEO, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios Inc. (MGM); Bob Shaye and Michael Lynne, Co-Chairmen and Co-CEOs of New Line Cinema have jointly announced today that they have entered into the following series of agreements:

    * Peter Jackson and Fran Walsh will serve as Executive Producers of two films based on The Hobbit. New Line will manage the production of the films, which will be shot simultaneously.
    * Peter Jackson and New Line have settled all litigation relating to the Lord of the Rings (LOTR) Trilogy.
    Said Peter Jackson, Im very pleased that weve been able to put our differences behind us, so that we may begin a new chapter with our old friends at New Line. The Lord of the Rings is a legacy we proudly share with Bob and Michael, and together, we share that legacy with millions of loyal fans all over the world. We are delighted to continue our journey through Middle Earth. I also want to thank Harry Sloan and our new friends at MGM for helping us find the common ground necessary to continue that journey.
    Peter Jackson has proven himself as the filmmaker who can bring the extraordinary imagination of Tolkien to life and we full heartedly agree with the fans worldwide who know he should be making The Hobbit, said Sloan, MGMs Chairman and CEO. Now that we are all in agreement on The Hobbit, we can focus on assembling the production team that will capture this phenomenal tale on film.
    Bob Shaye, New Line Co-Chairman and Co-CEO comments, We are very pleased we have been able to resolve our differences, and that Peter and Fran will be actively and creatively involved with The Hobbit movies. We know they will bring the same passion, care and talent to these films that they so ably accomplished with The Lord of the Rings Trilogy.
    Peter is a visionary filmmaker, and he broke new ground with The Lord of the Rings, notes Michael Lynne, New Line Co-Chairman and Co-CEO. Were delighted hes back for The Hobbit films and that the Tolkien saga will continue with his imprint. We greatly appreciate the efforts of Harry Sloan, who has been instrumental in helping us reach our new accord.
    The two Hobbit films  The Hobbit and its sequel  are scheduled to be shot simultaneously, with pre-production beginning as soon as possible. Principal photography is tentatively set for a 2009 start, with the intention of The Hobbit release slated for 2010 and its sequel the following year, in 2011.
    The Oscar-winning, critically-acclaimed LOTR Trilogy grossed nearly $3 billion worldwide at the box-office. In 2003, Return of the King swept the Academy Awards, winning all of the eleven categories in which it was nominated, including Best Picture  the first ever Best Picture win for a fantasy film. The Trilogys production was also unprecedented at the time.

Previously in the saga of the laptop:
I discover the problem and report it to HP
HP gives some really stupid advice and I contact the place I bought it from
And then I screw up
So I got a response from ebuyer today.  This is what they said:
 Dear Customer
Please contact Hp again on this number 08708422339
Tell them where you bought it from ie us.
We have an agreement with them to send out new power supplies.
Hope this helps so this shall be rejected.
Regards
Ebuyer Tech

So, not having enough credit on my phone I emailed HP tech support to ask them to help me solve the problem.  Turns out they can’t help me as all tech support emails go to America.
So, now I’m going to have to go back into a live tech chat with someone, where i’ll probably be told the same thing I’ve been told up to now.
Is it too much to ask that they do their fucking job and get my laptop working again?  Do you think if I try begging they will help?
Will
So, I’ve started the live chat session.  This is what I have said the problem is:
Make yourself comfortable while I relate to you the saga of the broken laptop.
In the early hours of Thursday 13th December 2007, your humble narrator discovered that his laptop was not recognising the fact that the AC adaptor had been plugged in and insisted on remaining on battery power. This, obviously, was not good.
And so, I emailed HP technical support only to get a message that the email system was down.  As such, I entered into an active chat session concerning the problem.  During said chat, I was asked if I had tried using the adaptor from another HP laptop.  I replied in the negative as I did not have access to another HP laptop.  I was advised to try this and given a link to search for a relevant retailer.
The very next day I took my laptop to said retailer, only to be advised that I needed to take it to the place where I purchased said laptop.  Problem was, I bought it online.  Back to the internet went I to contact ebuyer.com, the fine website where I purchased my laptop, and filled out a return claim.  While checking my email, I discovered that the email I had originally sent to HP had, in fact got through and that, as well as the suggestion I had originally recieved, I was also advised to try something involving haveing the laptop switched on.  Hard to try with a completely dead battery and no means of recharging it.
Fast forward to Tuesday 18th December 2007, henceforthto known as today.  ebuyer finally got back to me to inform me, and I quote:
Please contact Hp again on this number 08708422339
Tell them where you bought it from ie us.
We have an agreement with them to send out new power supplies.
Not having enough credit on my mobile phone, nor having a landline, to call said number I responded to the email I had been sent explaining the situation.  I then recieved an email back advising me that all HP tech support emails go through America and that they could not help.  They suggested I either phone tech support (not possible for the reasons given above) or try this route.
So, I am asking, nay begging you, to please do something to get my laptop back up and running.
Yeah.  It was either that or righteous indignation and fury.
Will
*SON OF THE EDIT*
I’m now being told I have to go to Hartlepool or the arse end of Stockton to get the problem sorted.  Rather convieniently (due to me getting a train home tomorrow afternoon) the only time I will be able to do this is 2 days before my birthday.  After the 12 month warranty runs out.
ARGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Will
*DAUGHTER OF THE EDIT*
Now they’re telling me that, as it’ll be outwith the warranty, I’ll have to pay for the repair if I leave it.  My only other option is to go along tomorrow and pray everything is done in time so I can still catch my train.

The details of 3 million candidates for the driving theory test have gone missing, the BBC understands.
The loss took place when the hard drive of a computer belonging to a private contractor to the driving standards agency went missing in the US.
Transport Secretary Ruth Kelly is due to give details to MPs at about 1730.
It is the latest in a series of data losses since HM Revenue and Customs lost discs holding 25m people’s data, including bank account details.
Chancellor Alistair Darling has been given an interim report into that loss, but said conclusions would be outlined in a full report out next year.
The head of HMRC, and its data security chief, are also to be probed by MPs.
The two Child Benefit discs that went missing in October contained names, dates of birth, bank and address details.
They were lost when a junior official at HM Revenue and Customs in Tyne and Wear sent them by courier unregistered and unencrypted, to the National Audit Office in London – but they did not arrive.
It is believed police think the discs may have accidentally been thrown out as rubbish.
Officers have visited several tips around London to check what waste was delivered there.
A large scale hunt for the discs has failed to find them.
The government has apologised and said there was no evidence the discs had fallen into the wrong hands.
But millions of families have been told to be on alert for fraudsters using their details, stored on the discs.
Data security grilling
Mr Darling said some other missing discs would also be looked at as part the inquiry by Mr Poynter, UK chairman at PriceWaterhouseCoopers.
A full version of the report is expected by spring 2008.
He also gave details of an interim report from Cabinet Secretary Gus O’Donnell into data security across the whole of Government.
It has been suggested by the transport department that the latest DVLA data loss had emerged as a result of the review by Sir Gus.
While Ms Kelly gives details of the new data loss to the Commons at 1730, MPs on the public accounts committee will grill David Hartnett, acting chairman of HMRC, and Nick Lodge, HMRC’s director of data security about the loss of the child benefit disc.

Add this to the lost CD’s and the fact that the wrong personal details were put on letters apologising for losing the data and it seems that the government just can’t catch a break on data security.

I’ll have to write this by hand (it feels like a novel, not a script) but at least I’ll have something to do on the train journey home.
I’m optimistic about this one.
Fingers crossed.

Was wondering why it was taking so long for ebuyer to get back in touch about my laptop.  Then I discovered that I actually hadn’t submitted the return thing properly…

Got the following advice from HP about the problem with my laptop:
3. Please perform a dry boot and check if the notebook powers ON. Steps for the same are given below:
i. Ensure you bring the unit to minimum configuration.
ii. Disable all the external devices including the battery and the AC adapter.
iii. Press and hold the power button for 10 seconds.
iv. Now boot the notebook with AC power only. 
Course, the problem is that the battery is completely dead, so I can’t even power it up!
In the meantime I am waiting for the folk I bought it from to let me know about returning it to them.  Grrr!
So, what was the worse bit of advice you were ever given?

I’ve been requested to write an update entry.  So, here we are.
Didn’t quite manage to get the rent problems sorted out, but that’s because housing benefits aren’t paying as much as I thought towards my rent.  So I’ve got more bloody forms to fill out about that.
Grrr!
Finally booked my train ticket home last week.  The cheapest train I could get means that I have to suffer about 5 hours without a cigarette, due to not having any changes.  I’m thinking nicotine gum may well be used.
And I need to repot Otaku behore he goes to my friends who have agreed to look after him while I’m away.
Apart from that, not been up to much.  Went to see The Golden Compass (expect a review soon).  I’ve abandoned the job hunt untill after I get back in the New Year.  So, yeah, mostly been messing about online, where I discovered thing like this:

Senior Australian lawyers are appealing against a judge’s decision to allow nine Aborigine males to walk free from court after admitting rape.
Queensland Attorney General Kerry Shine labelled the ruling unacceptable and “manifestly inadequate”.
The nine males were given non-custodial sentences for raping a 10-year-old girl in an Aboriginal settlement in 2005.
The judge provoked widespread anger by commenting that the girl had “probably agreed to have sex” with the gang.
‘Mystifying’ decision
Mr Shine said he did not see the relevance of Judge Sarah Bradley’s comments, made during sentencing in Cairns in October.
“Any child under the age of 12 cannot legally give consent to sexual intercourse, so the relevance of the judge’s remark mystifies me,” he said.
Six juveniles were placed on probation after pleading guilty to the rape of the girl, in the settlement of Aurukun in northern Queensland.
Three older men received suspended sentences, but none was sent to prison.
Australia’s newly-elected Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said he was horrified by the case and appalled at the judgement.
State officials have announced a review of all sex abuse verdicts in Aboriginal Queensland over the past two years.

By Malcolm Brabant
BBC News, Patras
A legal battle is under way in the western Greek city of Patras over a parrot that is facing a $650 (£320; 444 euros) parking ticket.
The local council says his perch is illegally parked and is obstructing drivers because it partially blocks a metered parking space.
Coco the parrot’s owner, Lambros Michalopoulos, says the bird will die if it has to move back inside.
Neither side is backing down so now the dispute is going to the courts.
‘Sociable creature’
With his multi-coloured Amazonian plumage and extrovert personality, Coco has, for 18 years, been something of a mascot in this busy port city, with narrow streets and precious few parking places.
His small perch occupies part of a metered zone and under the zero tolerance rules, the local police have ordered Mr Michalopoulos to pay a heavy fine.
The pet shop owner says he has ignored the authorities because if Coco goes back inside the store permanently the macaw will die because he is a sociable creature who enjoys being with people.
Patras’s Deputy Mayor Spiros Demartinos is embarrassed that Coco’s plight is attracting international attention.
He would prefer to talk about the city’s ambitious plans to use parking revenue for funding bicycle lanes and pedestrian zones.
“Is it bureaucratic to be concerned about the parrot’s safety?” he asks.
“The parrot’s security is of paramount concern to the council.”
Both sides are refusing to back down and so the dispute is heading to the palace of justice.
Coco’s owner is hoping that the case will be laughed out of court.

Dec 5 2007 By Gordon Currie
A DRUNKEN pianist who fell asleep during a theatre production of The Steamie ended up behind bars.
The play descended into farce when Christine Aston was found asleep.
After being woken up, she drove the five miles to her home but was arrested when police later called round and gave her a breath test.
Aston, who already has one conviction for drink-driving, spent last weekend in cells and is facing a ban when she returns to court today.
She was playing on Saturday for Perth Drama Club’s production of the play about Glasgow in the 1950s.
But proceedings at the Upper Springland Theatre ground to a halt when Aston, 44, missed her cue.
An audience member said: “The music had been a bit iffy to say the least.
“Eventually, the music died altogether and there was an awkward silence.
“Somebody went over to see what was wrong. She was face down on the piano and fast asleep. She was woken up and taken outside for some fresh air.
“She was supposed to have a cup of coffee and sober up while the cast explained what had happened.
“But it seems that she decided to just get in her car and drive home. Someone must have called the police.
“I just felt sorry for the rest of the drama club because they were embarrassed by the whole thing.”
When Aston was breathalysed at her home in nearby St Madoes, she was found to be more than double the drink-drive limit.
She spent the rest of the weekend in police cells.
On Monday, she appeared at Perth Sheriff Court, where she admitted drink-driving and was given an interim ban pending sentencing today.

First of all, I regret to inform everyone that I didn’t hear back from Channel 4.  Grrr!  But I am still going to work on the series I created as I think it’s a good idea and certainly not like anything I’ve seen on TV before.
So, I’m going home soon for the holidays.  Also on the cards is a little house/budgie sitting for my sister and brother in law.  Have just emailed to say when I’ll be back and that I’ll be able to watch the next Aberdeen UEFA cup game.  Got a reply saying that my brother in law is going to leave his season ticket for me so I can go and watch the Rangers game.  Score!
I’ve made the decision that in the new year I’m going to try and make another short film, as I really need to get something made.  I’m not going to use any existing scripts cos I also want to try and write something completely new.  We’ll see how things go.
What else?  Oh, yes, for the first time since ’99 (not including break ins) I no longer own a TV.  I sold it last week.  Thing is, I didn’t even have the damn thing set up.  Everything I watch I download so, yeah, I sold it.  It’s actually kind of liberating listening to my friends moan about having to run home to watch a particular show and knowing I don’t have that problem.
Not sure how I’ll survive with this weeks Heroes and Pushing Daisies being the last ones made before the srike was called (though thankfully, both episodes can work as a season finale if need be, from what I’ve heard).  It’s about to get interesting on American TV.  I’ll probably catch up with shows I have slipped back on (mostly House, Life, Chuck and Reaper).
Next entry will be another 12 in Twelve review.  Watch out for it.
Argued with my landlord about money I’m owe him.  It’s further complicated by the fact that neither of us has recieved anything else from housing benefits.  Also, found out about my JSA payments over the holidays, and it’s slightly confuzzling.  But then the DWP never believed in making life easy for me :¬D
And now I’m going to go.  Before I do:
Strange Japanese santas!
And it’s not just the writers who are on strike:
And now I will go.

Watching Euro 2008 unfold in Austria and Switzerland has suddenly lost its appeal to fans of the home nations. So what else will there be to do next June?
At 9.31pm on Wednesday, June 2008 looked pretty sorted for England football fans.
Barbecues, pub time, nights in front of the telly watching the Three Lions lose on penalties. Maybe a trip to Austria and catch a couple of games before the miserable, dispiriting exit.
But then Mladen Petric fired in Croatia’s winner from 25 yards and those three summer weeks suddenly screamed “VACANT”.
It’s the same for the rest of the British Isles, which is providing no team at a major football tournament for the first time since 1984.
As this sad news sinks in, many fans will think the summer is cancelled, but don’t lose heart.
1. See England players perform with passion, skill and tactical nous by watching their clubs’ 2007-8 videos, while Scottish and Northern Irish fans reflect on spirited campaigns.
2. Salute Steve McClaren – the Daily Mail-christened “Wally with the Brolly” – by showing off your umbrella at a rain-soaked, Murray-laden Wimbledon.
3. Join the former England boss on a summer tour promoting his autobiography, Mac the Life. The final chapter details his astonishing transformation from FA reject to the saviour of Derby County, taking them from the bottom at Christmas to their first Premiership title as champions.
4. Go to Austria and Switzerland anyway on an alpine yodelling trip or Sound of Music tour. The home of Maria and the Von Trapps will surely be a better place without England fans playing Dam Busters in the street. And if the football happens to be on telly in a bar, cheer a Premiership club. They’re well represented, except for Spurs, which has practised the misguided policy of buying English.
5. Bask in the glow of Eurovision Song Contest glory. With no football to distract the nation, it’s the chance to unite behind the British entry in Belgrade at the end of May. Terry Venables has got nothing on and he owes England fans, so maybe he could reprise his famous England Crazy, that reached number 46 in 2002. Or I Did It His Way?
6. Witness the great migration of the Wildebeest across the Serengeti. England fans will be well used to seeing hairy lumps lumbering across bumpy terrain after Wednesday’s static display on an uneven Wembley pitch.
7. Watch other sports. Who needs Euro 2008 when there’s Lewis Hamilton storming through his second Formula One season, a Rugby League World Cup and an England Test series against New Zealand? The Olympics in Beijing will be just round the corner, starting with football on 6 August, and the squash world championships in Manchester in October will showcase top British talent such as Nick Matthew and Tania Bailey. (And 2009 is the big year for sport anyway, with the Ashes series at home, the Twenty20 World Cup and a Lions tour to South Africa.)
8. Get in touch with your inner self in the Lost Vagueness field at Glastonbury. It has a reputation as the most anarchic and warped place at the festival, so any references to the Euro 2008 final happening the same weekend will be few and far between. Stay there long enough and one could be convinced that Scotland/Wales/Northern Ireland/England (delete as applicable) has won the thing.
9. Follow the selection process for the new England manager. It will still be unfolding eight months from now and remains a fine spectator sport. One by one the best candidates will drop out as their involvement in FA talks is leaked while they’re trying to win 2008.
10. See a European tournament that matters. There’s the European Brass Band Championships in Norway, the Euro 2008 handball champs, also in Norway, the European figure skating championships in Croatia and the European Kendo Championships in Finland.

Somehow don’t think old Shakey ever actually said anything like this, but it’s nice to dream.

Ahh, The Princess Bride.  Amazing book and film.

I tend to think this a lot as well.  Usually leads to me needing the brain bleach.

Yup, it’s that time again, where I answer your questions.  so, let’s get to it.
shesolovely starts us off:
Longest relationship?
Just under 2 years.  That’s the one who dumped me on Christmas Day :¬(
What are you looking for in a future girlfriend?
Someone who’ll put up with the strangeness that is me.  And not try to get me to quit smoking.
Weirdest thing you eat?
Probably toast with ketchup on it.
… or have eaten?
I’ve eaten phesant, that’s probably the strangest thing.  Except for the time I was in Spain and could have had potato salad with my breakfast.  (Yes, it’s true.  No, I didn’t.)
how often do you clean the lint out of your belly button?
Whenever I notice it needs cleaning.
A cow can eat up 30 m cubic of grass in 3 weeks, how long does it need to clear up 60m cubic of grass? 
I know that this will be wrong, but 6 weeks?
Next, findingsunshine had a question for me.  Or ten…:
* could you date/sleep with someone with the same name as your mum?
Don’t see why not.  I certainly wouldn’t find it creepy or anything.
* what art form other than writing do you wish you had great skills in?
I wish I could draw.  Not to the level of Picasso or Da Vinci, but enough so that my storyboards didn’t look like crap.
* when are you going to do another video entry? ( I like those)
I like making them.  My original plan for this entry was to do it as a video entry.  Alas, my camcorder got nicked, so I no longer have the equipment needed for video entries :¬(  Sorry.
* what is your best pick up line?
Don’t actually have one.  I’m the one that the lines are usually used on.  (A couple that have actually worked are Are you a serial killer? and Why do you look so evil?)
* do you care that Dumbledore was gay? Are you annoyed by those who are outraged?
I really don’t care one way or the other.  The people who are outraged don’t anny me.  Actually, I find their outrage kinda amusing.
* when you write, do you prefer typing or hand writing (or something else?)
For first drafts, I prefer handwriting on narrow lined paper using one of those mechanical pencils (or clicky pencils as I call them).
* what is your favourite song at the moment?
Don’t really have one, actually.
* do you have a soundtrack for your life? (ie: are there songs that represent important change sin your life?)
Can’t say I have.  Sorry.
* what did your primary school uniform look like?
Now you’re asking.  White, blue or grey shirt, grey or black trousers, grey or black jumper, tie (really can’t remember the colours of my primary school tie.  But it has been almost 20 years since I was in primary school.)
* who is the best fictional “bad guy” and why?
I’d have to go with the Operative from Serenity.  Because he knew exactly what he was but believed he was in the right.
* do you find it easy to lie?
Not particularly, no.
* how would you torture someone for information?
Really don’t know about this one.  Though the music of Britney Spears would be involved somehow.
* what “general hygiene” task do you hate doing the most?
Shaving.  Hence the beard.
* can you do a handstand?
Nope.
* do you notice the smell of a girl’s shampoo? If so, would a bad smelling shampoo on a hot girl turn you off?
I don’t particularly notice these things, no.  (Unless it’s something like mint scented shampoo.)
Next up was Oribeth:
What’s your favourite book?
I have a few favourite books.  But the one I’m most obsessed with is The Rule Of Four by Ian Cauldwell and Dustin thomason.
What’s your favourite song?
Again I have a few.  The one I’ve got as my ringtone (which is as good a way as any to answer this) is Down In The River by Allison Krauss (from the O Brother, Where Art Thou? soundtrack).
What’s your favourite meal to cook? To eat?
To cook would be spaghetti bolognaise (I make the sauce from scratch).  To eat would be chicken parmisan.
Who is your favourite Doctor? Why?
I’d have to go with Sylvester McCoy because he is my Doctor (the problems with his run was the BBC having given up on the show).
Is there any celebrity that you would have a one-night stand with?
Too many to list.
Would you date a girl you werent physically attracted to?
I probably would, yes.
If you had to lose one of your senses, which would it be and why?
Probably touch.  It’s the one I’d miss the least.
What quote do you think sums up how you feel about life?
I love deadlines. I love the whooshing noise they make as they go by.
Douglas Adams.
What are 5 things that you really like about yourself?
My sense of humour.  My hair (now that I actually have managed to grow it long).  My tattoo.  My taste in films.  My friends.
Following that, we have Zaphod:
Who is your favorite favorite who begins with a Z?
Zephenia.  Only kidding.  This is a trick question as I only have one favourite who’s name begins with a Z.  However I will say that he is a hoopy frood who really knows where his towel is.  Even if he does make me jealous writing about all the blowjobs he gets.
What is the greatest album of all time?
This is a tough one, but my answer might surprise you.  I’ts The holy Bible by the Manic Street Preachers.  Their last album before Richey disappeared, if you haven’t heard it yet, hunt it donw.  I promise you won’t be disappointed.
If you had a time and space machine and it could take you to any five concerts in history, who would you go see?
1) The Beatles rooftop gig.
2) The very first Glastonbury.
3) Pink Floyd The Wall concert.
4) Live Aid
5) Any Hendricks gig.
Aside from OpenDiary, what is the first website you look at each day? 
Either Facebook, the BBC News site or the wrestling news section of 411mania.com
And last, but by no means least, we have The Mary:
i’d like to know if you think (and stop me if i’ve asked before) that buffy was just crazy and living in her own little fantasy world the entire series, OR if it were all real?
I think it was real.
If you could make a movie about anything, what would it be?
I’m not entirely sure.  I don’t have any subjects I’d particularly want to write about.
The same goes for a comic, a book, and a play.
As does my answer.
Have you ever done something you thought you would never do, and upon reflection, realized you probably should never have done it?
Not as far as I can recall, no.
Are you happy with your current standing in life, regardless of how materialistically bad it may seem?
Wouldn’t mind getting into the filmmaking industry but, apart from that, yes.
Is there anything in your past you regret?
A few things.  Which shall remain secret.
Would you change it if you could?
Yes.
What traits and features would you like in a woman? Be as detailed as you like, you’re describing your dream woman.
Green eyes, red hair, as big a geek as me.
If it turned out tomorrow that God exists, would you start being a Christian/Muslim/Jew? Why or why not?
No.  Because I think it would be slightly hypocritical.
What is your very favorite Buffy/Firefly episode?
Buffy: The Gift (not just my favourite Buffy episode but the best hour of TV I have ever seen.  Ever.)
Firefly: Out Of Gas (how the hell Tim Minear managed to keep three different timelines straight in his head, I’ve no idea.)
What would make you eternally happy right now?
Getting a job as a screenwriter.  And getting laid (it’s been a while).
Do you believe a person can change who they are?
Yes, but only if they really want to.
What could just break you, right now?
Dunno, really.
Do you want that love that are talked about in storybooks?
Yes, but I don’t think it’ll happen.
Think of one item you would love to have. Now, would you still want it if it meant you could never see 
A new camcorder.  But as I need to be able to see to use it, the answer to the second part is no.
And that’s your lot.  But I am open to suggestions for a new name for these entries, as the one I’m using has got boring over the years.  So let me know what you suggest.
Will

Yes, yes, I know I’m a little late with my October reviews.  I’m also posting this here, as I don’t have the password for the Twelve in 12 diary.  So, here I go.
Review for October:
The Men Who Stare At Goats
Author: Jon Ronson
Pages: 240
Factual
This book starts with Major Stubblebine who runs at the wall of his office and, as he doesn’t expect, bounces straight off.  He is, of course, trying to run through the wall, figuring that it should be easy as both he and the wall are made up of atoms which are mostly made up of space.
With this story, Ronson starts to take us through the story of the black ops part of the US Army.  Disbanded in the ’80’s, it’s making a comeback to help win the war on terror.
Amongst the ideas mentioned in the book is the fact that the Army at one point kept debleated goats.  Not just so that the soldiers could practice emergency medical surgery on them, but so that they could try to stop the goats hearts just by staring at them.  In fact, Ronson meets a man who claims to have done just that.  (The goats were debleated to keep them secret.)
Throughout the investigation Ronson details incidents involving Abu Ghraib, Halle Bopp comet and the Heavens Gate cult and a psycic war with General Norriega.  He sometimes goes from the surreal (sitting with a songwriter from Sesame Street and his agent as they work out how much royalties the US Army might owe him for playing his songs on an endless loop for hours at a time) to the heartbreaking (the press conference held by a man convinced that his father was killed because of his involvement in MK ULTRA).
Throughout the book, ronson approaches the subject with a strange combination of open mindedness and just a hint of cynicism.  Read the book with the same mindset and you will enjoy it.
Review for November:
The Beach
Author: Alex Garland
Pages: 448
Fiction (not entirely sure which category it should go under apart from that)
Richard has just landed in Bangkok as part of a backpacking holiday in Thailand.  After a strange conversation with the person in the room next to him (who promptly kills himself), he is given a map to a travelling urban legend.  A secret beach, well off the beaten track, where a select number of travellers live in complete isolation.
Richard sets off to find it, accompanied by a French couple, and discover that it does actually exist.  But what he finds there is more than he bargained for…
The Beach is Garlands first novel (he has since released two more, as well as writing a couple of films) and it is as confident and self assured a debut as I’ve ever read.  It moves along at a furious pace and it is easy to see that Garland has experience in backpacking.  The book twists on itself about halfway through and this, while slightly unsettling, is what makes it so good.  (It is also a device that Garland has continued to use, successfully on the most part.)
Richard is a compelling narrator, with the premise being that he’s writing the book after the events it portrays as a catharcic exercise.  He is not quite sympathetic, especially when it comes to a few of his actions near the end of the book.  It is also quite nice that while Richard is in love in the book, this love is unrequited as it makes a nice change from the norm.  (This is one of the problems I have with the film version.  One of many.)
All in all, I cannot recommend this book highly enough.
Personal note:
I know I said I was going to answer your questions today, but I’m not really in the mood.  So, should anyone wish to ask any more, you now have till Tuesday.

Just a placeholder entry till I can update properly.  Thought you lot might like to know that tonight I get my hair cut.
Oh, and don’t forget:

And I’m still looking for questions.
Will
*EDIT* Finally, I get round to writing a proper entry.
The haircutting didn’t take place, for reasons I’m not sure about (as I’ve never actually been told).
I haven’t really been up to much recently, usually just hanging out with friends in the union (hence the reason I’ve not been updating/noting much recently).
I didn’t make it through to the next round of the Red Planet Productions competition :¬(.  But it did help me win a free script review!  Someone who runs a script reading service ran a competition on her blog to guess how many entries there would be.  My guess was 2142.  (Had to get 42 in there.)  The answer was 2100.  So I won.  Yay!
I’m slightly upset about the RPP comp itself, but with that many entries, I can’t be too upset.  I’ve decided to enter the Channel 4 Pilot comp.  So now all I need is a script and an idea for a series.
Still jobless.  Being permanently skint sucks.
Spent most of my time online recently, I’ve been reading about the WGA strike.  If you’re not sure where I stand on this, please check out my diary pic.
Went to a pub to watch Middlesbrough play on a dodgy TV station.  There was some excitement amongst my friends when they realised that one of the Boro defenders was also there watching the game.  (He’s injured at the moment, which is why he wasn’t playing.)
Was planning to watch Children in Need tomorrow night so I could see Time Crash, which is a Dr Who short (kinda like the Pudsey cutaway a couple of years ago) which features a meeting between the Tenth Doctor and the Fifth Doctor.  But then I rememebred I’m going to see Dr Strangelove as part of the World and Art House Cinema Society (last weeks film was Badlands) so I guess I’ll watch it online instead.
Questions.  The entry after the next one will be my 1300th entry.  But my next entry will be my Twelve in 12 reviews for October (cos I kinda neglected to do them before and I didn’t get sent the mailout with the new password) so this is my last chance to ask you for questions.  You should know the drill by now.
I was thinking about answering the questions on Saturday while listening to commentary from the Aberdeen game, but then I realised that Scotland are playing Italy on Saturday, so I’ll be watching that instead.  So I’ll be answering the questions on Sunday.  So, you have until then to submit questions, if you haven’t done so already.  (And even if you have and you want to ask more.)
I’ll stop boring you lot now.
Will

How did the US come to invade Iraq with no post-war plan for governing Iraq – and how much did Tony Blair know of the matter? John Ware reports in the first of two articles linked to a new TV series.
“Iraq will be better,” declared Tony Blair five days after the fall of Saddam.
“Better for the region, better for the world, better, above all, for the Iraqi people.”
That contrasts starkly with the 100,000 or so civilians dead, four million refuges inside and outside Iraq, 4,141 coalition solders who have died and the cost to the UK of well in excess of £5bn.
Yet it’s now clear that Mr Blair knew before the invasion that America’s planning for post-war recovery was woefully inadequate – and so was Britain’s.
There was no properly worked out strategy for the key longer term objective of transforming it into a stable, prosperous nation that the Blair-Bush vision held out.
‘Tearing his hair out’
We know this because Lady [Sally] Morgan, Mr Blair’s former political secretary, has said he was “tearing his hair out”, and his former foreign affairs adviser Sir David Manning has said he was “very exercised about it”.
The fact that Mr Blair feared the invasion aftermath might be heading for disaster is potentially more damaging to his reputation than his decision to put the full weight of his office behind the intelligence that Saddam had weapons of mass destruction. For that he had cover from the Secret Intelligence Service.
What, then, is his defence to the charge that he recklessly continued with the invasion?
His friends and advisers say his frustration stemmed from his inability to influence the Pentagon, under Donald Rumsfeld, on post-war planning.
The hawkish defence secretary had required his generals to give America a “lite” footprint – a small invasion force that could be rapidly withdrawn afterwards.
Does this defence stack up?
It suggests that Mr Blair’s “hair tearing” did not begin until 20 January 2003 – just eight weeks before the invasion.
It was only then that Mr Rumsfeld was put in charge of post-war planning, with a presidential directive establishing a reconstruction unit in the Department of Defense.
Dangerously late
Considering that the American General George C Marshall was given three-and-a-half years to plan the reconstruction of Germany after World War II, that’s leaving things dangerously late.
So why wasn’t Mr Blair “tearing his hair out” long before 20 January 2003?
Sir David Manning, recently retired ambassador to Washington, says neither he nor Blair “had any sense that the Department of Defence was going to take over the running of the country.”
Until then, says Sir David, the president had assured them both that the State Department under the moderate Colin Powell would do this.
There had been “plans made and deployed by the State Department”.
“It’s hard to know what happened.”
Yet the State Department’s work was “never intended as a post-war plan,” says Ryan Crocker, American ambassador to Iraq.
It was instead a series of expert study groups whose purpose was to engage Iraqi Americans in thinking about their country’s future.
Far from believing the State Department would be in charge of reconstruction, the challenge to the British government throughout 2002 was to find out who would get the job.
‘Black hole’ in planning
A year before the invasion – on the eve of the first Blair-Bush Iraq summit in April 2002 – Sir Christopher Meyer, then British ambassador in Washington, says he urged Mr Blair to “above all start getting them to focus on what next if and when we drive Saddam from office”.
Again, in early September, he warned Mr Blair that “planning for the aftermath is a blind spot. I remember thinking to myself: ‘We’re nowhere on this.'”
Then a few weeks later Sir Christopher says he “upped the volume” to a warning that “there was a black hole in American planning for the aftermath”.
If Mr Blair was tearing his hair out, it does not seem to have happened when it mattered – throughout 2002 – when there was still time to put together a practical plan.
I’m told that three months before the invasion, the Chief of the Defence Staff Admiral Boyce warned the Pentagon they would be “lucky to get six hours worth of flowers and roses” because liberation would soon turn to occupation.
There were no plans to fill the inevitable vacuum after regime change with a large scale development programme delivering quick wins to show Iraqis that things would be better.
So criminals and insurgents quickly poured into it and have been there ever since.
The charge Mr Blair may have to address in any future inquiry is that he never investigated the risks diligently.
Abandoned principle
There is little evidence that Whitehall performed any better than the Americans in putting together their own reconstruction plans for southern Iraq, for which they had responsibility.
As in Washington, a planning unit was not set up in London until eight weeks before the invasion.
Specialists like engineers to help with water, power and other basic services were very late in being lined up.
Sir Hilary Synnott, who later took charge of the Coalition Provisional Authority office in Basra, says: “I simply wasn’t aware of any planning in relation to the civilian aspects of Basra.
“My first challenge was to find a computer.”
And that was July – three months after the invasion.
In the rush to war, and in the blur of ideology, both capitals abandoned a principle that has been an iron law of warfare since Napoleon: Never take the first step without planning for what comes afterwards.
In a second article on Monday, John Ware reveals the extent of the mismanagement of the occupation of Iraq since the war.

1175,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/is-it-ok-for-disabled-people-to-go-to-brothels-3929824/,2007-10-22,Is it OK for disabled people to go to brothels?,"
By Finlo Rohrer
BBC News Magazine
We live in a society saturated with sex, but disabled people can often feel they’ve not been invited to the party. Some feel prostitution might provide the answer. But is visiting a brothel the right thing to do?
Taking your first steps. Riding a bike. Your first kiss. The first time you have sex. All standard rites of passage for anyone growing up in much of the world.
But what if you never took your first step? What if you couldn’t ride a bike? What if the disability you were born with distanced you socially? What if there never was a first time?
Asta Philpot, 25, is a confident, extroverted person, similar to many other British men in their 20s. But he was born with arthogryposis, a condition that severely limits the movement in his limbs.
“Are you having a nice night?” is a line Asta is used to hearing, delivered by women in pubs and clubs throughout his adult life. There often seems to be a patronising undertone. Flirting isn’t easy when you can’t move.
Last year, he chose to lose his virginity in a licensed Spanish brothel. This year he took two other disabled men on a bus trip to the same brothel, filmed by BBC’s One Life.
“When I was younger I had a friend and we always used to talk about relationships. He had muscular dystrophy and passed away without having a sexual experience. Why should people struggle for that experience?”, Asta says.
Skewed view
This is the decade when discrimination against disabled people is finally being tackled in the UK, but while the law can open up a workplace or install a ramp, it is never easy to change what is in people’s minds. And there are many people who would shy away from a relationship with a disabled person.
“I’ve been out to pubs and clubs, you see people with each other. Then they go off home. But people look at disabled people as not being able to have a relationship.”
Society has a difficulty with disabled people and sex, Asta suggests. Television, and particularly films, doesn’t like to present people in wheelchairs in romantic scenarios. As objects of pity, or as exemplars of an inspirational fight against adversity maybe. But when was the last time you saw a disabled person playing the run-of-the-mill romantic lead?
To Asta, the situation is stark. Sexual experiences are a vital part of life. They are hard to come by. And visiting a brothel is the right course of action, he thinks.
“I feel more confident with girls. I’m totally for it. Not one regret. Disabled people are so sheltered and protected, in an institutionalised forcefield.”
He believes in legalised prostitution, a view that many across society will not share but that appears to have currency within the “disabled community”.
Moral issue
A survey for the Disability Now website in 2005 suggested that 75% of disabled people believed in the legalisation of prostitution, with 62.5% of men and 19.2% of women saying they would use trained sex workers. It’s a situation that exists in the Netherlands where a voluntary group provides just such a service for disabled people. Most clients pay for it themselves but some local authorities subsidise the service.
There is also a group within the UK attempting to put disabled people in touch with suitable prostitutes, but there are those for whom visiting a brothel is morally wrong.
Anna Bowden, of Eaves, a group that helps vulnerable women, including those who have been trafficked into prostitution, recognises that disabled people face “a very difficult situation”.
“Obviously I don’t think the answer is perpetuating a form of violence against women. We reject the view that men have a right to sex.”
But the notion that visiting a prostitute is intrinsically wrong is not shared by all. Cari Mitchell, of the English Collective of Prostitutes, make no distinction between disabled and non-disabled.
“Prostitution is consenting sex between adults. There’s nothing uniquely degrading about prostitution except that it is criminalised,” she says. “Men with disabilities going to a brothel is no different to any other men. They have the same needs as anybody else and should be entitled to the same access to paying for sex… as anybody else.”
But counselling psychologist Simon Parritt, the author of the 2005 Disability Now survey, says it is difficult to see brothels as the answer.
“I think everybody has the right to a sexual identity,” he says. “I don’t think everybody has the right to sex with another person. That involves somebody else’s rights.”
Sexual exclusion
And in the eyes of some, he says, the Netherlands approach risks “ghettoising”, with disabled people regarded “as something so different they need some kind if specialised charity sex”.
But it is clear that many disabled people in the UK face sexual exclusion.
“The process of learning from experience is limited. When you get to 15-16 you may go out clubbing. The gap between you and your peer group becomes particularly big. Sexual and relationship skills get left behind,” Mr Parritt says.
And he has first-hand experience of people’s attitudes. Some years ago he placed identical person ads, one mentioning that he was disabled, one not mentioning. The advert that mentioned his disability drew the better quality of responses but they were vastly fewer in number than the advert that did not mention his disability.
“People end up in their mid 20s and later not having had any kind of sexual experience. The right kind of experience gives you confidence.”
Confidence is one of the things Asta was seeking. He thinks he has found it.
Asta Philpot’s story is told in One Life: For One Night Only at 2240 BST on BBC One on Wednesday 24 October.

So, my wrists and forearms are hurting.  Really hurting.  Plus, it’s hard for me to grip or lift anything.  (Even my laptop and rolling cigarettes are difficult.)  So, I’m going to go to the doctor tomorrow and make an appointment.  First time I’ve been to a doctors in about 10 years.  Maybe more.
This is going to be a random entry.
Current TV loves:
Flight Of The Conchords,
Life,
Chuck,
Reaper.
Current TV obsessions:
Pushing Daisies.  It’s amazing.  I want to marry it and have have little half human, half Pushing Daisies babies.  Seriously.  Go.  watch it.  Now!
Am having trouble getting to sleep again.  So, the past couple of nights, I’ve been making my way through The West Wing season 1 and 2.  I forgot how good an actor John Spencer was (RIP).  And I get to play the end credits game again.  Yay!
The Eulogy song (not for the easily offended):

That reminds me.  Might do a Charlie Brooker based youtubage entry soon.  That might be good.
Otaku is fine.  I’m a bit worried that he might need repotting soon, though.  I’m going to stick him outside for a day or two soon.
Can’t remember what else I was going to say.
Oh, yes.  Don’t forget that I’m still looking for questions for my 1300th entry.
Who honestly cares if Dumbledore is gay?  Does it really change the character that much?
Need to speak to landlord as the boiler has broken down.  Again.  Actually, this time it’s worse.  Normally, when you switch it on, it tries to start up three times before the safety light comes on.  Now, it’s not even doing that.  And my room is frakking freezing.  What is it with me and heating that doesn’t work during winter?
This is quite interesting.  The top ten banned books of the 20th century.  Quite interesting.
That reminds me, still need to write my first Twelve for 12 review.  Get that done over the next couple of days.
And that’s about it for me.
Will
P.S.  There is an explanation for my title, but I’m not telling you what it is :¬p
*EDIT* I’m going to the doctors at 9am on Wednesday.  Yay!  Especially as when I got home last night I made pasta in sauce and had problems lifting the plate :¬(
In the meantime: Embarassing film posters AND interesting homes.

I know I owe you lot a proper update.  But I don’t have time just now.  It’ll probably be tomorrow.  But said update will include:
-The amazing new sport of giro chasing!
-Football!
-New arboreal decorations!
-Football!
-A further request for questions!
-Music!
And, not forgetting:
-Football!
Will
*EDIT*
And here is the proper entry.  I’ll go through things as they are listed above.
Giro chasing!
Due to me not having a bank account, I get my JSA as a girocheque.  Because we’ve had a few postal strikes lately, my last giro was sent to my nearest post office.  Great! thinks I, that’ll be the one where I usually cash my giro.  So, went there on Wednesday.  No sign of it.  Kept going back, still no sign.
Left it till Thursday.  Found out that it wasn’t actually my closest post office.  So, of to the other one.  They had it.  But I needed proof of ID and proof of address.  I had the former, but not the later having not been aware I even needed it.  Back to the house, pick up a letter, back to the post office and finally got my money.  Yay!
And now I do have a bank account, so that will not happen again.
Football!
I managed to watch the Dnipro – Aberdeen game in the union after an argument with the venue manager.  Think i scared someone when we scored and died about a million deaths in the last 15 minutes, but we got the result we needed and qualified for the group stages.  Yay!
New arboreal decorations!
Also on Thursday I, volunterally, walked for about half an hour.  A supermarket chain in Britain were seeling bonsai trees for £4, and I’d wanted one for ages.  It took a bit of walking (as I’ve already said) but I got one.  Then I was trying to decide on a name for him.  (Yes, my bonsai tree is male, deal with it.)  After having rejected the suggestions of Bonnie, Hiro, Rommel and Auchwitch I finally settled on one.
So without further ado, I present to you Otaku:

Football!
Last Tuesday was the draw for the group stages of the UEFA Cup.  Aberdeen’s group are:
Athletico Madrid,
Panathanikos,
Locomotiv Moscow and
FC Copenhagen.
Some hillarity ensues when a collection of Aberdeen fans, so convinced that they know this will be an away game, book themselves onto non-refundable cheap flights to Copenhagen.  So, they know they’ll be there for one of the games.
It’s just a shame that the team are going to be in Madrid on that day.
Questions!
It’s coming up to my 1300th entry.  Which means I’ll be answering your questions.  But first, I need some questions.  So, get asking.
Music!
The new Radiohead album is cool.  That is all.
Football!
Watched the Scotland – Ukraine game on Saturday after discovering that the union was actually showing it (seeing as they had the amazing tactic of, y’know, not actually telling anyone).  Scotland were amazing (as usual).  Now, all we need are four more points from our last two games to qualify for Austria/Switzerland.  And that’s a position i never thought we’d be in when the draw was made.

I’ll explain the title later on in this entry.
So,I had an interview at the job center today.  [sarcasm]Yay![/sarcasm]  It wasn’t too bad.  They can now recommend jobs to me that are further away from the house (up to 90 mins door to door) and I’ve to sign on weekly instead of fortnightly for the next six weeks.  Joy.
They also did this thing that told me that, including working tax credits I’ll be better off off financially than I am now.  No shit Sherlock!  I’m fairly sure my friends 18 month old kid could have told you that.
You can just tell that I like dealing with that place, can’t you?  (No offence to those who work for the DWP.)
I found out about this last night and I’m planning to enter.
For those of you who can’t be bothered clicking through, it’s a competition for Channel 4 in which the prize is that a half hour pilot will be made of a script with the possibility of it becoming a full series.  Not to mention that chance to work with a proper production company for 8 weeks.  But I might have to email them to clarify something.  One part of the website says this about the training:
“They will then be hot-housed in one of three Scottish independent production companies, where mentoring producers and Channel 4 script editors will help them develop their series idea and complete a first draft script.”
But then elsewhere it says:
“During the eight weeks training, you’ll need to spend time working on your script. We realise that you might have other commitments, and this writing may need to be done in whatever spare time you have.”
Now, I’m fairly certian that it means that I’ll have to relocate to whereever the production company is based.  But it does also seem to suggest that it might not be necessary.  Depending which it is will determine which location I put down as my first choice.  The companies are based in Glasgow and Cromarty.  Glasgow would be easier to hop on the train to if I only need to be there occasionally.  But if I need to relocate, Cromarty is closest to Aberdeen.  Which means that I could possibly put my stuff into storage, stay at a B&B during the week and head home at the weekend.  We’ll see.  Either way, wish me luck.
The title.  I discovered (thanks to the wonderful folk at I Am Bored) the one and only Church Of The Latter Day Dude.  And the first thing I found on the site?  Allowed me to get this:



So, maybe not like, totally worship me.  But I could totally conduct a wedding, a bris or even a pet spraying service in most places in America.
And anyone who is shocked that I ordained myself obviously hasn’t been reading this diary for long.  (Though, in fairness, it has been a while since I last did this.
I’ve also signed up for Twelve in 12.  Read at least one book a month for a whole year.  I think I can manage that.  My current plan is to read and review books that, it seems to me, not many people have heard of.
Video goodness for you:
HARRY POTTER IN THE HOOD
Add to My Profile | More Videos
Hee!
Oh, and Heroes fans, if you knwo what to look for on youtube you’ll be able to find videos made by Adrian Passar.
I think that’s everything.
No!  Wait!  What’s that coming over the hill?  (Is it a monster?  Is it a monster?)
This is entry number 1291.  Which means that in 9 entries time it’ll be entry 1300.  So, the floor is open for questions.  Have at it.
Now I’m done.
Toodle pip, chaps and chapessess.

Ahhh, gotta love the subject lines for spam emails.
So, after a week of waiting for Three mobile to phone me back about the interview, I decided to call them again.  This time I spoke to an honest to goodness human and made an appointment.  It’s going to be 9:40am on Wednesday.  Wish me luck.
Managed to watch the Aberdeen game on Thursday.  After arguing with someone about them not showing the second half so they could put something up for an event that wasn’t due to start for another 2 hours.  I think i scared someone when Aberdeen scored, died about a million deaths after Dnipro equalised and went ballistic after the final whistle.
We got the result we needed.  Yay!
Came home after a few more drinks and came online.  Checked my email and found out I’d been invited to join a facebook group.  But I thought I was halucinating when I saw the name of the group.  So I pulled up in another tab.  Turns out I wasn’t halucinating.
I have my very own facebook group!
Course I became a member.  After 5 minutes of hysterical laughter, intercut with me pointing at the scream and saying wither “I have my own facebook group!” or “How cool is this!”
And haven’t really done much the past two days.  Got an interview with the jobcenter on Monday and then get paid on Wednesday.  So I’ll finally be able to change the oil in my deep fat fryer.  And get my bonsai tree.  if the place still has any left.
Oh, get your thinking caps on, cos in 2 entries time I’ll start taking questions for my 1300th entry.
And with that, I’m away to watch some season 1 West Wing.
Toodle pip chap and chapesses!

1181,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/gay-bomb-scoops-ig-nobel-award-3929815/,2007-10-04,‘Gay bomb’ scoops Ig Nobel award,"
Pioneering research into a “gay bomb” that makes enemy troops “sexually irresistible” to each other has scooped one of this year’s Ig Nobel Prizes.
Other winners included work on treating hamster jetlag with impotency drugs, extracting vanilla from cow dung, and the side-effects of sword swallowing.
The awards, founded in 1991, mark achievements that “first make people laugh, and then make them think”.
The prize ceremony took place at Harvard University, US.
Genuine Nobel Laureates handed out the much-coveted awards to the winners, who took away no cash, but instead received a handmade prize, a certificate, and, of course, the glory of such an illustrious win.
Sword effects
Dan Meyer, executive director of Sword Swallowing Association International and an author of the British Medical Journal paper Sword Swallowing and its Side-Effects, said: “I was surprised and extremely honoured when I found out I was not only nominated for an Ig Nobel prize but that I had won it. I couldn’t believe it.”
He told the BBC News website that the study revealed that when professional sword swallowers ingested a single sword very carefully, it did not do much harm, but swallowing many swords, strangely shaped blades, or being distracted when swallowing, could cause injury.
The findings also suggested that sword swallowers should not swallow swords if they already had a sore throat, he said.
Unfortunately, said the organisers, nobody from the US military who carried out the research on chemicals that could prompt homosexual dalliances amongst rival troops (a research project called Harassing, Annoying and “Bad Guy” Identifying Chemicals) attended the ceremony because the study’s authors could not be tracked down.
Real research
The Ig Nobel Prizes were created by the Annals of Improbable Research (AIR), a science magazine.
The awards, now in their 17th year, are intended to “celebrate the unusual, honour the imaginative – and spur people’s interest in science, medicine and technology”.
Marc Abrahams, the editor of AIR, told the BBC News website: “When I became the editor of a science magazine, suddenly I was meeting all kinds of people who had done things that were hard to describe, and for the most part, nobody had ever heard of.
“For some of them, it seemed a great shame that nobody would give them any kind of recognition, and that was what really led to the birth of the Ig Nobels.”
Like their more sober counterpart, the Nobel Prizes, the Ig Nobels are split into several categories and all research is real and published.
2007 Ig Nobel Winners
Medicine – Brain Witcombe, of Gloucestershire Royal NHS Foundation Trust, UK, and Dan Meyer for their probing work on the health consequences of swallowing a sword.
Physics – A US-Chile team who ironed out the problem of how sheets become wrinkled.
Biology – Dr Johanna van Bronswijk of the Netherlands for carrying out a creepy crawly census of all of the mites, insects, spiders, ferns and fungi that share our beds.
Chemistry – Mayu Yamamoto, from Japan, for developing a method to extract vanilla fragrance and flavouring from cow dung.
Linguistics – A University of Barcelona team for showing that rats are unable to tell the difference between a person speaking Japanese backwards and somebody speaking Dutch backwards.
Literature – Glenda Browne of Blue Mountains, Australia, for her study of the word “the”, and how it can flummox those trying to put things into alphabetical order.
Peace – The US Air Force Wright Laboratory for instigating research and development on a chemical weapon that would provoke widespread homosexual behaviour among enemy troops.
Nutrition – Brian Wansink of Cornell University for investigating the limits of human appetite by feeding volunteers a self-refilling, “bottomless” bowl of soup.
Economics – Kuo Cheng Hsieh of Taiwan for patenting a device that can catch bank robbers by dropping a net over them.
Aviation – A National University of Quilmes, Argentina, team for discovering that impotency drugs can help hamsters to recover from jet lag.

And i shall never use the word peeps ever again.
So, what’s been happening in Willworld?
I applied online for a job with Three mobile.  Got an email back offering me a telephone interview.  Yay!
Though, bizarrely, in the email they said they liked my writing.  Which is weird considering the only thing I’ve written which they’ve read is my CV.  Which is the most boring, businesslike thing I’ve ever written.  Strange.
I did dye my hair on Sunday.  I decided to go black, seeing as I’ve gone blond before.
My old hair:

My new hair:

And, yes, I am topless in that pic.
Had a visit from housing benefits today about my claim.  Got myself ass worried about it and it took about 5 minutes.  Dunno what I was stressing about, really.  Should get a final decision in about a fortnight.
Currently getting my ass kicked in about three different scrabulous games on Facebook.  If you want to add me as a freind over there, go here.
Also planning to get a new tattoo.  Got three designs I’m thinking of (conditional on how much they cost).  And they are…

The Angel Investigations logo.

My name as a barcode.

My date of birth as a barcode.
I’m probably going to go with the later one as I’ve been thinking about that for a while now.
And, that’s about it from me and my boring ass life.  Some links for you.
Internet safety tips.
Geeky science tattoos.
And:
What kind of lover are you?
Commited Lover
You are willing to go above and beyond to keep your love beautiful, and strong! You are quite risky to keep the love of your life protected. One of the many things your lover see’s about you is that you are loyal.

So, as you guys know, I’ve been growing my hair long.
One side effect of this is that it’s two different colours.  Blond at the ends and dark brown for the rest.
Anyway, I’ve decided it all need to be one colour.  Which colour is up to you.

1184,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/god-apparently-responds-to-lawsuit-3929808/,2007-09-24,‘God’ apparently responds to lawsuit,"
By NATE JENKINS, Associated Press WriterFri Sep 21, 4:17 PM ET
A legislator who filed a lawsuit against God has gotten something he might not have expected: a response. One of two court filings from “God” came Wednesday under otherworldly circumstances, according to John Friend, clerk of the Douglas County District Court in Omaha.
“This one miraculously appeared on the counter. It just all of a sudden was here  poof!” Friend said.
State Sen. Ernie Chambers of Omaha sued God last week, seeking a permanent injunction against the Almighty for making terroristic threats, inspiring fear and causing “widespread death, destruction and terrorization of millions upon millions of the Earth’s inhabitants.”
Chambers, a self-proclaimed agnostic who often criticizes Christians, said his filing was triggered by a federal lawsuit he considers frivolous. He said he’s trying to makes the point that anybody can sue anybody.
Not so, says “God.” His response argues that the defendant is immune from some earthly laws and the court lacks jurisdiction.
It adds that blaming God for human oppression and suffering misses an important point.
“I created man and woman with free will and next to the promise of immortal life, free will is my greatest gift to you,” according to the response, as read by Friend.
There was no contact information on the filing, although St. Michael the Archangel is listed as a witness, Friend said.
A second response from “God” disputing Chambers’ allegations lists a phone number for a Corpus Christi law office. A message left for that office was not immediately returned Thursday.
Attempts to reach Chambers by phone and at his Capitol office Thursday were unsuccessful.

1185,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/judge-blasts-kyle-show-as-trash-3929805/,2007-09-24,Judge blasts Kyle show as ‘trash’,"
A judge has branded The Jeremy Kyle Show “a form of human bear-baiting” at a court case in Manchester.
District Judge Alan Berg said the ITV1 daytime programme was “trash” and existed to “titillate bored members of the public with nothing better to do”.
The judge made the comments while sentencing one of the show’s guests, who head-butted his love rival during filming earlier this year.
He added that the show’s makers were partly to blame for the attack.
He added that producers had persisted in contacting David Stainforth from Chesterfield to persuade him to make an appearance on the show.
‘Limited intellects’
During a recording on 16 May, Stainforth lashed out at bus driver Larry Mahoney, who had begun an affair with his wife Jennifer after moving into their home as a lodger.
Stainforth told the court he had initially been reluctant to appear on the show, but changed his mind after being told his wife was considering a reconciliation.
The 45-year-old was ordered to pay a £300 fine and costs at the hearing in Manchester Magistrates’ Court.
In his sentencing, Judge Berg was reported in the Manchester Evening News as saying: “I have had the misfortune, very recently, of watching The Jeremy Kyle Show.
“It seems to me that the purpose of this show is to effect a morbid and depressing display of dysfunctional people whose lives are in turmoil.”
He added that it was “human bear-baiting which goes under the guise of entertainment”.
“It should not surprise anyone that these people, some of whom have limited intellects, become aggressive with each other.
“This type of incident is exactly what the producers want. These self-righteous individuals should be in the dock with you. They pretend there is some kind of virtue in putting out a show like this,” said Judge Berg.
A spokeswoman for ITV said: “We do not recognise the district judge’s description of our programme, or his opinion of the viewing public and the people who choose to take part in our programme in an effort to resolve their problems.”

Thank fuck someone has ahd the guts to say it.
While I’m not a big fan of talk shows, and am of the opinion that all they are doing is making money from the misery of others and encouragng people to reveal things on TV that should be kept private, I have to admit that Jeremy Kyle is the worst of the lot.  The guy is nothing more than a bully belittling guests for having opinions that do not match with his own.  Why these shows exist in the first place is beyond me.  How anyone can imagine for a second that Kyle is a good person to be presenting one is something I will never understand.  How people can lower themselves to even appear on the show is even more unfathomable.
These talk shows are bottom feeder television and Kyle is the lowest of the lot.

PAUL AMES
The Associated Press
VIRGINIA MAYO

Shown on a computer screen is the Belgian site of ebay which highlights the country of Belgium for sale with a bid of euro10 million (US$ 13.8 million) in Belgium, Tuesday Sept. 18, 2007. Hidden among the porcelain fox hounds and Burberry tablecloths on sale at eBay.be this week was an unusual item
BRUSSELS, Belgium – Hidden among the porcelain fox hounds and Burberry tablecloths on sale at eBay.be this week was an unusual item: “For Sale: Belgium, a Kingdom in three parts … free premium: the king and his court (costs not included).”
The odd ad was posted by one disgruntled Belgian in protest at his country’s political crisis which reached a 100-day landmark Tuesday with no end in sight to the squabbling between Flemish and Walloon politicians.
“I wanted to attract attention,” said Gerrit Six, the teacher and former journalist who posted the ad. “You almost have to throw rock through a window to get attention for Belgium.”
Six placed the advertisement on Saturday, offering free delivery, but pointing out that the country was coming secondhand and that potential buyers would have to take on over $300 billion (euro220 billion) in national debt.
Like many of Belgium’s 10 million citizens, Six is exasperated that the power struggle between the county’s French- or Dutch-speaking political parties has left Belgium in political limbo since June 10 elections.
Demands for more autonomy from the Dutch-speaking Flemish are resisted by the French-speaking Walloons, making it impossible to form a government coalition and triggering concern the kingdom is on the verge of a breakup.
Six decided to vent his frustration through the Internet ad.
“My proposal was to make it clear that Belgium was valuable, it’s a masterpiece and we have to keep it,” he told Associated Press Television News. “It’s my country and I’m taking care of it, and with me are millions of Belgians.”
Six’ idea got a mixed reaction on the streets of Brussels.
“Very funny, typical Belgian humor,” said Anne Graux. “It’s ridiculous,” snapped Nathalie Ginot, a Brussels resident who had her own pragmatic solution to Belgium’s woes. “We think it would be good to split Belgium into the three and make Brussels a tax-haven, a capital exempt from all taxes,” she said hopefully.
Six vaunted Belgium’s attractions to potential buyers from art nouveau architecture to the headquarters of NATO and the European Union and some great beers. But he also warned of the pitfalls of taking on the cacophonous mix of Flemish nationalists, Walloon Socialists and the mayors of all 19 Brussels’ boroughs.
EBay was happy to take Six’ advertisement.
“It was a really fun listing made by a Belgian,” Peter Burin, PR manager of eBay Belgium. “This person, in a very funny way, reminded the Belgians what a great country Belgium actually is and it would be a shame to sell it.”
However, the company decided to pull the add Tuesday after receiving a bid of euro10 million ($14 million)
“We decided to take it down, just to avoid confusion,” he told APTN.

Watched the Aberdeen game earlier on.  First European game in five years and it was a 0 – 0 draw.  We should have won it, with all the chances we had.  And at least we didn’t concede an away goal.  Which is always good.
Finally got my hands on a decent version of Premiere Pro.  Just in time to enter this.  OK, so there’s no actual prize, but it should be fun.  I’ll post my completed trailer here once I’ve done.
Apart from that, haven’t been up to much.  Mainly messing about online.
Also added a load of stuff to my hotornot hot list.  Now, I know that people complain about some of the interests on OD so, for amusement, here are some of the genuine hot list items from hotornot:

University of Florida Student Arrested, Tasered at Kerry Forum After Asking About Election
The Associated Press
GAINESVILLE, Fla.
A University of Florida student was Tasered and arrested after trying angrily and repeatedly to ask U.S. Senator John Kerry about the 2004 election and other subjects during a campus forum. Tuesday morning, a judge ordered the student released from jail on his own recognizance.
Videos of Monday’s incident posted on several Web sites show officers pulling Andrew Meyer, 21, away from the microphone after he asks Kerry about impeaching President Bush and whether he and Bush were both members of the secret society Skull and Bones at Yale University.
“He apparently asked several questions he went on for quite awhile then he was asked to stop,” university spokesman Steve Orlando said. “He had used his allotted time. His microphone was cut off, then he became upset.”
As two officers take Meyer by the arms, Kerry, D-Mass., can be heard saying, “That’s alright, let me answer his question.” Audience members applaud, and Meyer struggles for several seconds as up to four officers try to remove him from the room.
Meyer screams for help and asks “What did I do?” as he tries to break away from officers. He is forced to the ground and officers order him to stop resisting.
As Kerry tells the audience he will answer the student’s “very important question,” Meyer yells at the officers to release him, crying out, “Don’t Tase me, bro,” just before he is shocked by the Taser. He is then led from the room, screaming, “What did I do?”
Meyer was arrested on charges of resisting an officer and disturbing the peace, according to Alachua County jail records, but the State Attorney’s Office had yet to make the formal charging decision. Police recommended charges of resisting arrest with violence, a felony, and disturbing the peace and interfering with school administrative functions, a misdemeanor.
On Tuesday, Mayer was ordered released from jail on his own recognizance. Attorney Robert Griscti, who represented him, did not return messages seeking comment.
Orlando said university police would conduct an internal investigation.
“The police department does have a standard procedure for when they use force, including when they use a Taser,” Orlando said. “That is what the internal investigation would address whether the proper procedures were followed, whether the officers acted appropriately.”

Broadway show featuring The Smiths man’s songs planned
06.Sep.07 11:25am
A ‘We Will Rock You’-style musical based on Morrissey’s songs is currently in the works.
The idea has been conceived by Thomas Lennon and Robert Ben Garant, who both starred in ‘Reno 911!’ and wrote the movies ‘Night at the Museum’ and ‘Balls Of Fury’.
Lennon told New York Metro: “I have an outline in my head, like ‘Mamma Mia’- type musical but with them music of Morrissey called ‘I’ve Changed My Plea To Guilty’. It’s for a very diehard set of fans.”
It is not clear when the musical will open.

Paddington Bear is to make his movie debut in a live-action film comedy.
David Heyman, producer of the Harry Potter movie franchise, will produce the first cinema adaptation of Michael Bond’s classic children’s stories.
“I love Paddington’s unique take on life,” he said. “He is a great comic creation.” Hamish McColl, writer of Mr Bean’s Holiday, will pen the script.
The cartoon Paddington can currently be seen in a TV advert swapping his usual marmalade sandwich for Marmite.
Paddington – named after the London railway station where he was found – made his first appearance in book form in 1958.
‘Ageless classic’
“Michael Bond’s Paddington books have such wit, wonder and charm,” said Heyman, who will make the film for Harry Potter studio Warner Bros.
“Essentially Paddington’s story is that of an immigrant (bear) arriving in London and trying to find a home and a family.”
Warner Bros president of production Jeff Robinov said: “We’re eager to collaborate once again with David… on this ageless classic.”
Bond, a former BBC cameraman, wrote 11 Paddington books in all between 1958 and 1979.
The bear’s misadventures spawned a popular BBC animated series, narrated by Sir Michael Hordern.
Casting details and release dates for the film have yet to be announced.

Led Zeppelin confirm reunion gig
The surviving members of legendary rock group Led Zeppelin are to reform for a star-studded tribute concert in London.
Singer Robert Plant, guitarist Jimmy Page and bassist John Paul Jones will play at the show to remember the late Atlantic Records founder Ahmet Ertegun.
The one-off concert, the trio’s first performance for 19 years, will take place at the O2 arena on 26 November.
Tickets will cost £125 and be allocated by ballot. Pete Townshend, Bill Wyman and Paolo Nutini will also perform.
Ertegun, who signed Led Zeppelin in 1968, died last year.
The place of Led Zeppelin drummer John Bonham, who died in 1980, will be taken by his son Jason.
Plant said: “During the Zeppelin years, Ahmet Ertegun was a major foundation of solidarity and accord.
“For us, he was Atlantic Records and remained a close friend and conspirator. This performance stands alone as a tribute to the work and life of a longstanding friend.”
The news is likely to spark a huge rush for tickets as devoted fans scramble to get into what could be the band’s last show.
Tickets will only be available to those who register on a dedicated website, ahmettribute.com, and will be limited to two successful applications per household.
With their pounding, blues-influenced anthems and explosive stadium shows, Led Zeppelin paved the way for artists across the worlds of heavy metal and alternative rock.
Their best-known songs include Stairway to Heaven, Whole Lotta Love, Rock and Roll, Kashmir and Communication Breakdown – although they never released singles in the UK.
Led Zeppelin’s last full concert was in Berlin in July 1980 – two months before John Bonham died.
‘Whole set’
Page, Plant and Jones performed at Live Aid five years later, and also get back together at a concert to celebrate the 40th anniversary of Atlantic Records in 1988.
But a rift between Jones and the other two band members opened after Page and Plant started working together without him in the 1990s.
Rumours of a reconciliation surfaced several years ago, leading to speculation about a reunion.
Harvey Goldsmith, who is promoting the concert, said that he had originally asked the three band members to play a 30-minute set.
“Jason Bonham became part of the catalyst, and they did a week’s rehearsal,” he said. “We had a meeting and Robert turned around and said we’re not going to do 30 minutes, we’re doing to do a whole set.”
“It’s a day I never thought would come,” said Dave Lewis, editor of Led Zeppelin fan magazine Tight But Loose. “The four people on stage in 2007 – wake me up, I’m dreaming!”
The concert coincides with the release of a new two-CD best of compilation, Mothership, on 13 November.
Profits from the show will go towards scholarships in Ertegun’s name in UK, the USA and Turkey, the country of his birth.
His wife Mica said: “He would be very proud that Led Zeppelin have chosen to reunite and headline a benefit concert in his name featuring so many of his friends.
Goldsmith said Ertegun “became a friend and was my mentor”.
“Our industry deeply misses such a giant of music,” he said. “It is a fitting tribute that these great artists have all come together to perform in his memory.”
He also warned that tickets being sold on the black market would be cancelled.
Paolo Nutini, Ertegun’s last UK signing, went on to score a hit album last year.
“He touched my life with his amazing personality and opened a few doors when I was starting my career,” he said.
“He was a special guy, a real gentleman and it’s such a shame he’s gone but a massive tribute that all his music lives on – and will do forever.”

So I got my new digital camera today.  (And my mum stuck £20 in with it which was much needed.  Thanks mum!)  So, here are some pics.

The first pic I took with it, to check it was actually working.  This is now a part of the University of Teesside, but it used to be a school.  Back in the day, the boys side of the school was on the right of the clock tower and the girls part was on the left.  Though that’s no longer there.  By all accounts, the girls part was a lot smaller.

Extreme close up or (ECU) of my face.  Testing both the timer on the camera and the quality of photo’s taken indoors (due to their being no flash).

And this is the case my camera came in.  It felt like I should have had it chained to my wrist.  Also in pic, a nice refreshing pint.
Not bad quality for a freebie, eh?
Now I’m away for another couple of nice, refreshing pints.

Oh, there’s great fun over on slashdot about the iPhone.  Basically, Apple had a huge presentation the other day where they announced new iPod classic, new look nano, iPod touch, wireless iTunes, a strange hookup with Starbucks and ringtones through iTunes.
Oh, and their discontinuing the 4 gig iphone and cutting the price of the 8 gig one by $200.
Cue much whining from the sad acts people who cued for days to get it when it was first released.  Seriously, I don’t think France makes the amount of cheese you would have needed to accompany it.
They moan on blogs (and on sites like slashdot), they write open letters and they email Steve Jobs personally.
So, he decided that he is going to give everyone who hasn’t already got a rebate of some type (credit card refund, etc) a $100 dollar credit for either iTunes or their nearest Apple store.
Now, remember, the product itself didn’t come with any sort of price guarentee.  He didn’t need to do this.  But he did.  And the reaction?
Some are pleased, realising that Jobs didn’t actually need to do anything.  Some are still pissed, say they’ll never buy an Apple product again unless they get a full refund of the $200.
Oh, and the tin hat brigade out in full force, saying that the whole thing is nowt but a huge marketing ploy (second comment down).
Ahh, Britney.  Britney, Britney, Britney.  You will find below her performance at the VMA’s (and yes, I’m aware that there’s some humour in MTV dishing out music video awards nowadays).

Watch the video above.  Ignore the fact that it is by far the worst song she’s ever recorded (and I’m not a Britney fan by any means and have hayed every song she’s released) and realise one glaring thing.
She’s pissed.  Or stoned.  It has to be one or the other cos there is absolutely no way that she’s sober.  And that is her career over.  She ain’t coming back from that.

A police operation to covertly follow a Central Otago man came to an abrupt halt this week when the man found tracking devices planted in his car, ripped them out and listed them for sale on Trade Me.
Ralph Williams, of Cromwell, said he found the devices last week in his daughter’s car, which he uses, and in his flatmate’s car after the cars were seized by police and taken away for investigation.
Police have neither confirmed nor denied they placed the devices.
Williams said a cellphone sim card in one of the devices appeared to transmit messages to the mobile phone of Detective Sergeant Derek Shaw, of the Central Otago CIB.
Williams provided The Press with emails from Shaw saying: “If you have got something of ours it would be good to get it back. You can call me and I can come meet you.”
Williams said he found the devices concealed behind panels in the passenger-side footwells of the cars. They were marked with the name Trimble, an international company that produces GPS location devices.
Williams took apart one of the devices and found a sim card, which he put into a cellphone. He found the device was sending location text messages to Shaw’s mobile number.
Williams placed one of the devices on Trade Me with a price of $250.
The ad read: “Used government covert surveillance tracking. No police to bid on this.”
A Trade Me spokesman said the listing was removed yesterday afternoon “at the request of the New Zealand Police”.
Williams said the cars were seized for investigation after an unmarked police car was torched in Alexandra in July.
The investigation produced nothing on Williams, but when the cars were returned he contacted police because the cars were not running well, and he asked if they had left something behind.
Shaw emailed: “Can’t immediately think of anything we would have left … Like what …?????”
Williams said he and Shaw then spoke on the phone, with Shaw telling him the devices were valuable and should be returned.
Shaw then emailed repeatedly asking for “the stuff” back.
When contacted by The Press, Shaw declined to comment other than to say: “Police use a variety of legitimate investigation techniques when investigating serious crime. However, it is not the policy of the police to comment on those techniques or other operational matters.”
Shaw would not say whether a warrant had been obtained for the devices. The Summary Proceedings Act, which covers tracking devices, says a warrant should be obtained for a tracking device but an officer can install one without a warrant if there is not time and the officer believes a judge would issue a warrant.
Williams said he did not know why police were interested in him. He spent two years in jail “20 years ago” for selling marijuana to an undercover policeman, but had no convictions since then.
Williams said the devices were not hard to find and he described the operation as “a bumbling attempt” by “weirdos”.
New Zealand Civil Liberties Council chairman Michael Bott said the affair had “shades of (George Orwell’s) Nineteen Eighty-four”, as well as “shades of the Keystone Kops”.

The most senior US commander in Iraq has said that progress in bringing security to the country had been uneven and in some cases disappointing.
In a letter to troops, General David Petraeus said Iraq’s political leaders had not made the gains hoped for under the US troop “surge” strategy.
But he said US forces had achieved “tactical momentum” against insurgents in several areas of Iraq.
Gen Petraeus is to deliver his war assessment to Congress on Monday.
In the letter posted on his Baghdad command’s website, Gen Petraeus said this summer was supposed to be a time of “tangible political progress” but “it has not worked out as we hoped”.
He thanked the troops for their contributions to the counter-insurgency fight.
“I will go before Congress conscious of the strain on our forces, the sacrifices that you and your families are making, the gains we have made in Iraq,” he wrote.
A record 168,000 US troops are now in Iraq after 30,000 arrived in the surge, which started in February 2007 and was completed in mid-June.
‘Risk averse’
Earlier on Thursday US media reported that Gen Petraeus was considering cutting soldier numbers in Iraq by about 4,000.
He may withdraw one brigade if it does not threaten “recent gains” made by US forces since the troop surge, US government and military officials told the New York Times.
He “is worried about risk, and all things being equal he’d like to keep as much as he could for as long as he could”, a senior military officer told the newspaper.
The administration’s clear hope is that the promise of some reductions will be enough to ease pressure for deeper cuts, correspondents say.
Democrats in Congress have long been pushing for a reduction in troop numbers in Iraq.
On Thursday they seized on a report from a key US security commission recommending a cut in troop numbers by early 2008.
Mr Bush, who decides on troop numbers in Iraq, has said he will follow advice from commanders on the ground, rather than bowing to political pressure, to make his decision.
Correspondents say next week will be critical, with the debate building on whether US troops should stay or leave.

1201,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/pilot-guide-3929779/,2007-09-07,Pilot guide!,"
So, it’s coming up to the start of the new TV season in the States.  But some of the pilot episodes of the new shows have been leaked to the intertubes.  And I’ve got ’em.
So here is Will’s guide to new shows!
(The list is in no particular order then alphabetical.  After the show name will be the network the show is on then the start date.)
Bionic Woman, NBC, Sept 26th
Reimagining of, well, The Bionic Woman.  The person behind this is David Eick, one of the Executive Prodicers responsible for Battlestar Galactica’s reboot.  Jamie Summers (Michelle Ryan) is a 24 year old bar tender who is involved in a serious car crash with her boyfriend.  He saves her life by getting bionic parts attached to replace those ruined.  She discovers this and the fact that they want to use her for military purposes.  There’s also the matter of the first bionic woman (Katee Sackhoff).
The good:
As you would expect from one of the guys behind BSG, the action is amazing (particularly the big fight scene at the end between Sackoff and Ryan.  It’s better than a lot of film fight scenes) and there is just enough intrigue to keep people interested.  And Ryan proves that she actually can act with a nuanced performance.
The bad:
Sackhoff’s character is basically Starbuck with some modifications.  And the pilot has been refilmed so that the sister of Jamie is a) older, b) a computer geek and c) no longer deaf, changes which I don’t think are needed as the character was different to so many seen on TV.  Also, Jamie adjusts too well to having her new powers for my liking.
So, how’ll it do?:
Well, there’ll be a fair amount of crossover BSG fans, if not for Eick then for Sackhoff.  I can’t imagine there’ll be many fans of the original tuning in (though I may be wrong).  Wednesday night aren’t the worst of nights however I think that NBC might be missing a trick not broadcasting it after Heroes on a Monday night. 
Chuck, NBC, Sept 24th
Co-created by Josh Shwartz (creator of the OC) and directed by McG (who inflicted Charlies Angels 1 and 2 on the world).  Don’t let that put you off however.  Chuck (Zachary Levi) is a twentysomething who opens an email attachment from his old college roommate, only to have a load of CIA and NSA images downloaded into his mind, encrypted into pictures.  An agent from both agencies (Yvonne Strzechowski and Adam baldwin respectively) is sent to retrieve the information and end up being Chuck’s bodyguards.
The good:
Chuck is a likeable enough character (the scene where he helps someone who forgot to tape his daughters ballet recital is incredibly sweet) and there’s a refreshing lack of technobabble.  There’s also a fair amount of comedy and Adam Baldwin can actually bring the funny.
The bad:
I know the main character is a geek (he works for the Nerd Herd, the destruction of a Mac is treated like a serious death) but, for the love of Bob, does he have to be shy around women?  Cos we haven’t seen that before.  And I’m wondering how long they can keep the randomly imagining thing going as well.
So, how’ll it do?:
It has the chance to do really well.  The main problem it has is that it is going to be the lead in for Heroes, which’ll put a lot of pressure on it, ratings wise.
Pushing Daisies, ABC, Oct 3rd
Created by Bryan Fuller (who gave us Dead Like Me and Pushing Daisies) and directed by Barry Sonnenfeld (the second big name director to direct a pilot) the show centers around Ned (Lee Pace), a pie maker with a remarkable gift.  He can bring people back to life.  But there are a couple of rules.  If he touches the person again, they die, this time for good.  And if he doesn’t do so within a minute, someone else dies.  He teams up with a private detective called Emerson (Chi McBride) figuring it’s easy to collect the reward on murders if the victim can name them.  One such victim is Chuck (Anna Friel) who was Ned’s first love.  But he can’t bring himself to kill her again.
The good:
This is the show that everyone is raving about, and with good reason.  Funny (the conversation about what to call the recently returned is genius), and smart.  Ned is infused with an inherant sweetness as someone who shuns human contact due to his powers. And the relationship between him and Chuck is incredibly tender (I defy you not to be moved with their gesture at the end of the episode).  An amazing show.
The bad:
The only thing I can think of is the narrator (Jim Dale, who does the American Harry Potter audiobooks) gives peoples ages down to the second, which could get very annoying very quickly.
So, how’ll it do?:
As you can imagine, a show like this is quirky.  So it may be a bit too quirky for a lot of peoples tastes.  Thankfully this is on ABC, which gives shows a chance and not Fox.  Deserves to be a huge hit, but may well end up as a cult classic.
Reaper, The CW, Sept 25th
The pilot is directed by Kevin Smith (yes, that one).  Sam Bret Harrison) Turns 21.  All his life he wonders why his parents gave him an easy ride.  Then he finds out that his parents sold his soul to the Devil (Ray Wise) before he was born.  Sam has to help the devil out by finding escaped souls and sending them back to Hell.
The good:
Sam is an engaging enough character, but the standout is his best friend Sock (Taylor Labine) who is very much like Randall from the Clerks films.  Much like the fact that the Devil gets the best tunes, he also gets the best lines (“Drop of your fugative, renew your licence.  I’m all about the perks.”) and Wise is amazing in the role.  And, it’s genuinely funny, which doesn’t hurt.
The bad:
Like Chuck, it’s easy to see how this one could run out of steam, both with the capturing the demons bit and the method of capturing them.  The slacker with a mission thing could get quite old fast as well.
So, how’ll it do?
It’s a lot like Clerks, if Cerks featured escaped demons (probably why Snith agreed to direct the pilot in the first place) so it should attract a lot of those fans.  The fact that it’s on the CW may or may not hurt it.  And the Supernatural fans were talking about boycotting it (cos thats should be the only demon hunting show on TV damnit!) but I don’t think that’ll make a huge impact.
The Sarah Connor Chronicles Fox, Sometime early 2008
Slotting in between Terminators 2 and 3, this show features Sarah Connors (Lena Headey) and her son John (Thomas Dekker) still running from terminators.  After one tracks them down they escape with the help of Cameron (Summer Glau), a terminator sent to help them, into the year 2007.
The good:
Headle is good as Sarah and Dekker follows his amazing performance in Heroes (he played Zach, Claires gay friend) with another fantastic performance.  The effects are, as one would expect, good and the idea of moving to a different year is surprisingly original.
The bad:
While Summer Glau is a good actress, her character is not too far removed from River in Firefly/Serenity and can be distracting if you’re a fan of that show/film, like I am.  Some of the dialogue is cheesy.  And they are reshooting part of this to take out a school shooting.  Problem is, that scene is integral to introducing Connor (yes, the name is an homage to James Cameron) and I’m left wondering how thry’re going to pull it off.
So, how’ll it do?:
Obviously, this is the one with the biggest franchise name.  But, are there enough Terminator fans to keep it going?  Personally, I’m not sure, so the biggest challenge for it is to win over people who aren’t fans of the films.  I’m one of those and I enjoyed it so it may have a chance.  The fact that it was supposed to start soon and was moved to midseason isn’t the best sign in the world.  Oh, and it’s on Fox.  Which means that if it doen’t do as well as thy would like straight off the blocks it’ll get cancelled (see Drive).  And with it having such a huge franchise name, expectations for this will likely be higher than other shows.
So, there you have it.  My look at new shows that, *ahem* fell off the back of a server.

I stare at these four walls.  I can tell you the size, shape and exact location crack and pinhole in here.  The reason I can do that is because Ive seen them about a million times.
I could always get more pictures to put up in here.  But that would mean leaving.  And I cant do that.  I just cant.  Its not happening.
I lie on the bed and stare at the ceiling.  It makes a change from the wall, but not by much.  I light a cigarette and realise that Im almost out.  Im almost out of food as well.
I could phone someone and ask me to get stuff for me.  Except they wont.  Theyve got sick of it and are refusing to even take my calls.  They all say the same thing, why dont you just go yourself?
Because theyre out there.  Im not sure why theyre after me, or what they want.  But theyre out there.  Watching me.  Recording my every move.  Theyve tapped into the CCTV network.  Even then, their agents follow me around, noting down my every move in their notepads.  Taking photos.
Thats why my friends will no longer help me.  They want to starve me out.  They know Im onto them.  They got onto the local takeout place as well.  I know they cant observe me when Im in the house.  But just to be sure, I stay in my room.
They know Im different.  They know Im not like anyone else.  And they want me.  For what means, I honestly dont know.  But Im guessing theyre not good.
Getting hungry.  Ill go and see what food I do have.  But I know its not much.  Im still not going out.  They can reclaim my decomposing body from here if need be.
But theyll never find out exactly what I can do.  Theyll never get me alive.
I stare at these four walls.

Remember the edit in this entry?
Well, I was reading the comments section on one of my favourite blogs today when I read that some peoples entries were returned due to their mailbox being full.
So, I decidecd it may be a good idea to check the email address I sent my entry from.
(Quick aside: I used my professional email address, which I have because an email from William C Forbes looks better than one from Spike from Buffy.)
Sure enough, I got this:
This message was created automatically by mail delivery software.
A message that you sent could not be delivered to one or more of its
recipients. This is a permanent error. The following address(es) failed:
 save to /var/spool/virtual_mail/redplanetprize _redplanetpictures.co.uk_d/
   generated by redplanetprize@redplanetpictures.co.uk
   mailbox is full
Followed by my original email which I’m not putting here dur to character limits.
Went to the website and discovered that they had set up a resubmission email address.  So I re sent my entry with the following message:
Dear Sir/Madam,
Please find enclosed my submission for the competition, which was previously sent back due to a full mailbox.
I have also resent the rejection notice I recieved so that you know I’m not trying to pull a fast one.
Yours faithfully,
William Forbes
And promptly got this reply:
‘Don’t worry. Red Planet has your entry’
Red Planet Pictures
So, now I really have been entered.  And, can I say that Red Planet would have been well within their rights to say ‘Tough, but we didn’t get your entry in time’ so fair play to them for doing this.
They also had this on their website (emphasis mine):
Tony Jordan comments: ‘Thanks to all who have entered for your interest and enthusiasm. We’ve had around two thousand entries to the competition, which is daunting but shows how much talent there is out there. We’ll be working through the entries this month and those that make the next stage should be notified in October.’
Yeah.  Any good luck you could send my way would be more than appreciated.

By RICK YENCER
ryencer@muncie.gannett.com
August 29, 2007
MUNCIE – A joy ride with three Ball State University students in the back seat of a Muncie police car early Tuesday ended in a crash and could cost patrol officer Jason Lyons his job.
“I would have fired him this morning if I had the authority,” said Police Chief Joe Winkle.
The wreck, in front of LaFollette complex on McKinley Avenue, caused a head laceration to one of the students, Stacy Walters, 19, Rogers Hall, who was treated at Ball Memorial Hospital along with Billie Reed, 19, and Sommer Redmon, 19, both of Brady Hall.
Lyons, 38, who was uninjured, was immediately put on administrative leave, pending disciplinary action by Muncie Police Merit Commission.
Winkle said he would recommend firing the 6-year veteran for endangering the students who asked for a ride and for initially lying about the crash.
“He was basically showing off for three college girls,” said Winkle.
Lyons apparently met the three BSU freshmen at a Village Pantry at University Avenue and Martin Street before 1 a.m. and one of the students asked for a ride back to the dorm, according to statements by Lyons and the students. Lyons was not on a call and there were no reports that he was running lights and sirens.
Instead of going to the dorm, Lyons raced down University to Tillotson and Bethel avenues and then to McKinley, before crashing into a light pole in front of LaFollette.
“There is no debate that he was driving at too high a rate of speed,” said Winkle.
Before calling in the accident, witnesses told police that Lyons told the girls to get out of the car and leave the scene.
Winkle said Lyons also denied he had passengers in the car to other police officers at the scene, including his supervisor, police Sgt. Kirk Mace.
“(Lyons) told some mistruths,” said Mace, who arrived at the scene with Ball State University police.
As many as 50 students and others gathered at the scene, and Winkle said witnesses even confronted Lyons, who argued with some students about whether the girls were in the car.
“We have witness statements that saw him let them out and heard him say, ‘Get out of here,’ ” Winkle said.
Lyons later admitted to police he had given the students a ride, saying they were just having fun, but the police chief said the three students said they were scared, given Lyons was driving fast enough to rock them from one side of the car to the other.
Police uniform, traffic and internal affairs officers investigated the crash, which did as much as $10,000 damage to a 2007 police car.
There was no indication that alcohol, drugs or sex were involved, Winkle said.
While the chief can suspend an officer for up to 10 days, the merit commission has authority over firing as well as hiring officers.

Iraq has failed to meet 11 of 18 key progress benchmarks set by the US, according to an independent report from a Congressional watchdog.
Political progress in Iraq has been unsatisfactory and violence “remains high”, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) found.
Iraq had met three benchmarks and partially met another four, it said.
The study was slightly more upbeat than leaks last week had suggested, following criticism from the Pentagon.
The draft report said three benchmarks had been met and only two benchmarks partially met.
Following leaks to the media, a Pentagon spokesman said officials had made some “factual corrections” and “offered some suggestions”.
Washington reports
The GAO said Iraq had failed to live up to key targets on reducing sectarian violence and passing laws on oil revenue sharing.
The report contrasts with a White House study in July which found eight of the key US goals had been fully met.
The targets were established to monitor Iraq’s military and political progress.
The GAO findings come a day after President George W Bush visited Anbar province and said his security surge – the injection of an extra 30,000 troops into Iraq – was delivering results.
Tuesday’s report is the first in a series of assessments over the next month on the success of the US troop surge in Iraq.
The most crucial findings could be the verdicts of General David Petraeus, the commander of US forces in Iraq, and Ryan Crocker, the US ambassador to Iraq.
They will deliver a full progress report to Congress next week.

The battery on my phone died today.  And I don’t have a charger at the moment (for reason, see two entries back).  Cue much panicking until I remember that I still have my old Lobster phone.
I find the phone and spent about half an hour running around like a blue arsed fly looking for the charger.
Couldn’t find it.  Bastard.
I did however find my very old Siemans phone (and the charger) so I’m using that until I can either buy a new charger or I find out what I need to charge my phone on my computer.  Whichever happens first.
Then when I phoned my mum for her belated birthday call (I did try to phone on Thursday (her actual birthday) she wasn’t in) she said that she had a spare digital camera that she would send down to me.  It sounds like it’s just a cheap giveaway thing but still, better than nothing.
God bless stage6.  Some nice person has put every episode of Red Dwarf up there.  Yayage!
I had a shower earlier on and now my hair just will not behave itself.  Seriously, it’s like Books hair in Jaynestown.  Y’know, that hairstyle that freaks River out?  Yeah, that one.
Anyway, I’m going to ahve a smoke then some food.  Oh yeah, and sleep might be an idea as well.

So, had to submit the 10 pages, the syposis and my biography for the Red Planet thing.  So here, for posterity (or for the sake of the ego I never claimed to have) is the half page synopsis and half page biography I had to submit along with the 10 pages for the competition.
And huge thanks to Danni and Shar for the advice thay gave me with the biography.
Such Great Heights
Synopsis:
Josh Wyndham and Alicia Kramer are former lovers.  As Josh lies in the recovery room of a hospital, the pair reminisce about their relationship.  Having met through mutual friends, they start dating.  Things start to go sour as they move in together.  Alicia finds out that she is pregnant and, while this information keeps the relationship together for a while, it eventually falls apart.  This also leads to an almost complete breakdown between the two for various reasons.  Josh is denied access to his child, a son called Michael, because of what happens.  He only knows the gender of his child due to a chance meeting with a mutual friend (not the ones that they met through).  Josh moves on with his life, while always thinking about his son.  Josh finally finds about his son when Michael needs an organ transplant.  Alicia, in what is seen to her as a desperation move, gets a message though to Josh.  Josh, as it turns out, is a close match and more than willingly agrees to be a donor.

Went out for a few drinks last night with the friends who put me up while looking for somewhere else to live.  Ended up going back to theirs and crashing the night.  (Incidently, also saw a random interview with the Petrelli brothers from heroes in which a) they were asked what superpowers they would like in real life and b) they showed a clip from the series featuring neither of them.)
Got back into Boro, wandered round town and finally headed home just after lunchtime to check on my downloads.
Went to my room to dump my jacket and hat and discovered something.
Someone in the house must have left the front door unlocked.  I currently have no lock on my bedroom door.  As a result, someone had walked in and searched through my room.
As a result, I am now down:
1x Digital camera (which is actually broken),
1x Motorola mobile phone charger (which I can’t replace for another fortnight),
£10 (from my mum to pay for something I had to get to aberdeen for her) and
1x Camcorder, firewire lead to connect to computer and carry case.
Thankfully, my laptop, external drive, tv and digibox were in anohter room or I think they might have gone as well.
As this is the day I have to get my Red Planet submission in, i really didn’t need the extra stress.
So I’m currently down the pub.
Fucksocks.

So, i finally got going on my new script.  The delay was because i wasn’t sure if I was going to use a voiceover or not.  The first part of the script really needs one, but it doesn’t make much sense in the second bit.  (Thankfully, I’ve been able to break it down to two halfs.  Kinda.)
There’s also the fact that if not done properly, voiceovers can be nothing but annoying (See: some (but not all) of Mohinders voiceovers in Heroes).  Which ties in to my first point.
So, I’ve decided the way to get around this is to have something similar to flashbacks.  Course, if not done right, this can really suck.  And it means that I need to remeber to put what year it is in the slugline for each scene.  But it has to be done.
Still, at least I have the basic structure outlined in my head.  I did try and get it down on paper, but I’ve realised that I just don’t write that way.
Oh, and I’ve still to decide exactly what kind of transplant the kid needs.
Wish me luck.

Had a quiet bank holiday.  Slept most of today, messed about online.
And took part in Test The Nation: The national IQ Test on BBC1.  I usually end up watching these things, but give up taking part at home.
But this time, I had my digibox so took part on that.
I probably wasn’t firing on all cylinders due to staying up all night playing various Zelda games (didn’t get to sleep till midday), so, how did it go?
Round 1 was Observation.  I’m not the best in the world at this type of thing, so I wasn’t too surprised that I only got 6 out of 13.
Round 2 was memory.  Those of you who know me will know that my memory is, in general, crap.  So I was stunned when I got 14 answers right out of a possible 15.  Still not sure which one I got wrong though.
Logic was the third round.  I can be quite logical (really) but only if given a fair amount of time to think about things.  But, I still got 8 out of 14.
Ahh.  Round 4.  Reasoning.  I know I’m a reasonable guy, but my reasoning skills?  6 out of 9.  Not bad.
And finally, Perception and some more observation questions.  This was 2 seperate rounds, but thet were grouped together for the scores.  And I got 15 out of 19.
Giving me an overall score of 49 out of 70.
To work out my IQ, I had to look for my score on the table then look across to my age group and read off my IQ.
My IQ is 97.  I realise that it is not actually scientific (the top score anyone could get was 145), but still, not bad.
As a bonus, not only was Scotland the top country, but Aberdeen was joint top for cities in Britain!
I am wondering how well this guy would have done.
Now to follow the instructions on my whiteboard and get to work on my script.

Thanks to all who responded to the question I posed a couple of entries ago.  I’ve decided to go for it and have an idea of what to do.  Not saying more till I’ve got it fully outlined and I can see if it’ll work.
In the meantime, Because I’ve got it stuck in my head for some reason, Such Great Heights by Iron and Wine:
I am thinking it’s a sign
That the freckles in our eyes
Are mirror images and
When we kiss they’re perfectly aligned
And I have to speculate
That God himself did make us into
Corresponding shapes like puzzles pieces
From the clay
True, it may seem like a stretch
But it’s thoughts like this
That catch my troubled head
When you’re away, when I am missing you to death
When you were out there on the road
For several weeks of shows
And when you scan the radio
I hope this song will guide you home
They will see us waving from such great heights
“Come down now,” they’ll say
But everything looks perfect from far away
“Come down now,” but we’ll stay
I’ve tried my best to leave
This all on your machine
But the persistent beat
Sounded thin upon listening
That frankly will not fly
You will hear the shrillest highs
And lowest lows with the windows down
When this is guiding you home
They will see us waving from such great heights
“Come down now,” they’ll say
But everything looks perfect from far away
“Come down now,” but we’ll say…
Will

1215,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/top-republican-urges-iraq-pullout-3929765/,2007-08-23,Top Republican urges Iraq pullout,"
An influential Republican senator has called for the withdrawal of some 5,000 US troops from Iraq by the year’s end.
Senator John Warner, former chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said the US needed to show that its commitment to Iraq was not open-ended.
US troops, he said, had enhanced security in Iraq but had been let down by the Iraqi government.
He spoke after the release of a US intelligence report which said Iraqi leaders could not govern effectively.
The National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) acknowledged some military successes since January, following the “surge” in US troop numbers.
But it also said Iraqi security forces were still not capable of operating without support from American forces, and divisions between Sunnis and Shias continued to drive political instability.
It predicted that the situation would only get more precarious over the next six to 12 months.
The BBC’s James Coomarasamy in Washington says that with political and public support for the war finely balanced in America, the words of a senior senator from President George W Bush’s own party could have an important effect.
Senator Warner said initiating the first step in a withdrawal of US forces would send a clear message that Iraq’s leaders should not take the presence of American troops for granted.
“We simply cannot, as a nation, stand and put our troops at continuous risk of loss of life and limb without beginning to take some decisive action which will get everybody’s attention.”
However the senator said that the president should establish a timetable for withdrawal, not the Congress.
The senator went on: “I say to the president, respectfully, pick whatever number you wish.
“You do not want to lose the momentum, but certainly in 160,000-plus, say, 5,000 could begin to redeploy and be home to their families and loved ones no later than Christmas of this year.”
Vietnam comparison
The NIE report represents the judgements of all 16 American intelligence agencies.
It was released a day after President Bush offered Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki his support, describing him as “a good guy doing a difficult job”.
It also comes amid growing calls by senior US Democrats for Mr Maliki to step down because of his failure to bridge sectarian divides.
The report expresses grave doubts that Mr Maliki will be able to overcome sectarian divisions in Iraq and meet political benchmarks on unity.
“Levels of insurgent and sectarian violence will remain high and the Iraqi government will continue to struggle to achieve national-level political reconciliation and improved governance,” it says.
Unless there is “a fundamental shift in factors driving Iraqi political and security developments,” the political compromises needed for “sustained security, long-term political progress, and economic development are unlikely to emerge”, it continues.
The report does say that “Sunni resistance to al-Qaeda has expanded in the last six to nine months, but has not yet translated into broad Sunni Arab support for the Iraq government, or widespread willingness to work with the Shia”.
On Thursday, police reported that a Sunni religious leader in the province of Diyala who had encouraged his community to confront al-Qaeda had been killed in an attack by the militant group.
Mr Bush defended his Iraq policy on Wednesday, comparing current calls for withdrawal from Iraq with what happened at the end of the Vietnam War in 1975.
And following the release of the NIE report, White House spokesman Gordon Johndroe said: “Today’s key judgements clearly show that the military’s counter-insurgency strategy, fully operational since mid-summer, has begun to slow the rapidly increasing violence and patterns of the violence we have been seeing in Iraq.
“I don’t think the president feels any differently about setting a specific timetable for withdrawal. I just think it’s important that we wait right now to hear from our commanders on the ground about the way ahead.”
A progress report is due in mid-September from General David Petraeus, the top US commander in Iraq, on the effectiveness of the recent surge in US troop numbers in tackling the violence there.

On my last entry someone left me the following note:
most of your photos are blurry and crappy  [p]
So, it’s over.  I’m going to have to kill myself.  How can I ever possibly avhieve my dream of becoming a world famous photographer now?  I was hoping to add them to my portfolio, in fact I was going to make them the centerpiece of my portfolio.  But now that I’ve had such amazing insight from an art critic of such renown I know it’s hopeless.  So, goodbye cruel world.
Hang on.  None of that’s actually true.  I took the pictures at about 2am, in my room, inbetween watching episodes of Dead Like Me on a digital camrea which only works intermittently and didn’t cost that much.  Fankly, I’m surprised the pictures turned out at all.
But thank you for your insight.  And, i must admit, it’s kind of a surprise to get an annoyinyanoonynote as a private note.  Suppose that is the ultimate chicken move.

So I had some fun with my digital camera last night and thought I would share.  Enjoy!

My new whiteboard.  This is what I’ll be using it for, reminding me of stuff I need to take before I leave the house.  And my cute ice hockey fridge magnet.

My scene breakdown corkboard, with some of the scenes from the script I’m working on already attached.  Once I’m done writing up all the scenes onto card, the board will be full.  It’ll make things easier to move scenes around.  Also in pic: the script what I wrote.

My little terracotta warrior.

My nuts n bolts football player.  Present from my mum.

My glow in the dark bouncing eyeball that I like to play around with when trying to write.  And the grappa glass i nicked from a bar in Italy.

Billy Blood Drop, the mascot of the National Blood transfusion session.

My backwards clock.
And finally, not one I took, but I like it anyway.  The best caution sign ever:

OLne more thing.  This star was born on the same day as me.

So, just went to try and find out what was happening about my housing benefit, as the landlord is getting a little concerned.
Turns out that my claim has been delayed because a) they still haven’t set up the bit for me having moved house (which they only knew about three weeks ago) and b) they didn’t have proof of ID for me.  Which they have never asked me for.  Despite me having started to make my claim two months ago.

Not really been up to much since I last updated.  Finally got my digibox working, but in a room which I’m not supposed to use (empty upstairs bedroom).  But still.  Digital TV.  West Wing.  Family Guy.  Studio 60.  Yay!
Supposed to be working on the script for this Red Planet thing.  It’s a script I’m re-writing, so I’m not too stressed about that.   Nor the half page synopsis.  No, it’s the half page biography I’m worried about.  So, what I’ve decided to do is write 3 or 4, stick them in here and ask for feedback about which is the most professional looking.
Why can’t these things ever be easy?
I think that’s about it from me, so I’ll leave you with some randomness.

1222,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/vibrator-robber-jailed-over-raid-3929758/,2007-08-19,Vibrator robber jailed over raid,"
A robber who held up a bookmaker’s shop in Leicester with his girlfriend’s vibrator has been jailed.
Nicki Jex, 27, of Braunstone, Leicester, hid the sex toy in a carrier bag pretending it was a gun, Leicester Crown Court heard.
The manager at Ladbrokes in Narborough Road handed over more than £600 in cash when he pointed it at her on 27 December 2006, the court heard.
On Monday, Jex, who pleaded guilty to robbery, was jailed for five years.
Sentencing him, Judge Philip Head said: “It’s right to record that you did not have a firearm but you pretended you had and intended that those you confronted believed that you did, and it must have been truly terrifying for them at the time.”
The robbery was captured by CCTV inside the shop.
‘Considerable courage’
As Jex left with more than £613 in till contents and other money, he was followed outside by the shop’s last remaining customer Wayne Vakani the court heard.
“The defendant pointed the vibrator in the bag at Mr Vakani and warned him to back off,” said Tim Palmer, prosecuting.
“Mr Vakani then kept a discreet distance but kept an eye on the defendant and watched where he went.”
The court heard that it was thanks to this customer that the defendant’s hat, worn during the robbery and containing his DNA, was discovered nearby.
Initially Jex denied any involvement but later changed his plea.
He was a drug addict with a string of previous convictions dating back to February 2002, the court heard.
In mitigation, Phil Gibbs, defending, said Jex, a qualified chef and engineer, had a “fragile” state of mind.
He told the court: “One can be thankful that the item he had wasn’t a firearm.
“Frankly, he didn’t care less what happened to him at that time. He was falling into the abyss and that’s the root cause of drugs.”
Mr Vakani was awarded £500 by Judge Head for his “very considerable courage”.

I don’t think I could have kept a straight face if I was in the court and someone started a sentance with “The defendant pointed the vibrator in the bag…”
And yes, i know it’s quite serious that he pretended to have a gun and yes, I’d have been shitting myself had I been there but…
Still amusing.

Quick entry before I go to pick up my JSA.  (Due to Mondays excitement, it wasn’t sent out so i need to get a counter payment.)
I was searching through a box of stuff the other day and found a script that I wrote years ago.  It’s very badly formatted so I’m retyping it and rewriting it as I go.  I’ll probably use it for my Red Planet competition submission (as it really is too late to start on something new).  Should get going on typing more tonight.  But I’ll probably watch the last of the series of Studio 60.  (Strangely enough, Matt, the head writer of the show within the show, plays with a tennis ball while trying to write.  I do the same but with a glow in the dark eyeball.  How wierd is that?)
I have two rings to get in the post today.  My mum left her engagement and eternity rings here when she was visiting.  (Far, far outdoing the dog biscuits she left here last time).  I then have to buy a whiteboard with free corkboard (while wishing that the sizes were reversed.  Seriously, I can’t find a decent sized whiteboard anywhere in town.)
Those of you with gmail will know about the RSS thingy.  But I really don’t wanna know what inspired this:

Finally:

Aug 14 2007 by Sam Beattie, Evening Gazette
EYE-WITNESSES have described how a busy town centre office became a scene of panic after a man doused himself in petrol and threatened to set himself on fire.
A major alert was sounded after the man poured petrol from a canister over himself inside the JobCentre Plus office in central Middlesbrough.
Fire, police – including armed officers – and ambulance crews raced to the scene at about 1pm yesterday.
Witnesses described how the 27-year-old man threatened to harm himself as police tried to persuade him to leave the building.
Witness Graeme Brown was in the JobCentre when the drama broke out.
The 22-year-old, from the Longlands area of Middlesbrough, said he saw the man douse himself in what he believed to be petrol.
He said: I was in the queue waiting for a meeting when one of the staff came running over telling everyone to get out of the building.
Everyone around me started running, but I looked back and saw this lad pouring petrol on himself from a big cannister.
The woman who got everyone out knew what she was doing and did a good job getting people out. There was a lot of panic, no one knew what was going to happen.
Valerie Mollon of North Ormesby, who also witnessed the incident said He came in with a green petrol can in his hand.
He said I want my ******* money and then he just started pouring it over himself.
I was scared. Everyone was scared and ran out.
The building in Corporation Road was sealed off and the man was locked inside.
An estimated 150 members of staff were evacuated.
Police, including mounted officers, fire and ambulance crews were all at the scene and onlookers reported seeing police sniffer dogs.
The drama lasted about 30 minutes before the man was taken into police custody.
A JobCentre Plus spokesman said: A man walked into the JobCentre Plus office in James Cook House and doused himself with petrol. He is a JobCentre Plus customer, but why he chose to do this I cant say.
Staff were still left outside because we could not immediately let them back in because there was petrol all over the floor. Forensic officers also had to investigate.
A Cleveland Police spokeswoman said: A man was threatening to self-harm. There was no direct threat to staff or other clients and the building was vacated in minutes while police and other emergency services attended.
She added that the man was locked in a public part of the Jobcentre and had no access to other parts of the building.
 A man has been charged with criminal damage with intent to endanger life and was due before Teesside magistrates today.

And this is why I wasn’t able to sign on yesterday.
Yeah.
Thankfully, I wasn’t there at the time (I wasn’t due to sign on until 2:10).  But I realised something was up when the building was closed and there were a couple of cop cars outside.
As much as I can’t understand doing something like this, I can understand the desperation.  The job center in Middlesbrough are extremely difficult to get money out of.  For example: recently I applied for a community care grant for the deposit on the place I’m in just now.  As you can imagine, I was in a bit of a hurry to get a response.  After hearing nothing for a couple of days, I phoned to find out what was happening.  I was then informed that it would take up to three weeks to get a decision.  And no, they would not speed up my case under any circumstances.
The first time I signed on down here, it took five weeks to process my claim.  And then it only happened because I went into the place, pointed out that I was going home for Christmas and New Year soon and it would be nice to have some money for the trip.  (In all fairness the people I spoke with then were stunned it had taken that long as well.)
So, the guy has been charged.  And rightly so.  But I also hope that the DWP will look into the underlying problems that lead the guy to think that this was the best way to do things.

The US military cannot account for 190,000 AK-47 assault rifles and pistols given to the Iraqi security forces, an official US report says.
The Government Accountability Office (GAO) says the Pentagon cannot track about 30% of the weapons distributed in Iraq over the past three years.
The Pentagon did not dispute the figures, but said it was reviewing arms deliveries procedures.
About $19.2bn has been spent by the US since 2003 on Iraqi security forces.
GAO, the investigative arm of the US Congress, said at least $2.8bn of this money was used to buy and deliver weapons and other equipment.
Correspondents say it is now feared many of the weapons are being used against US forces on the ground in Iraq.
Discrepancies
The GAO said weapons distribution was haphazard and rushed and failed to follow established procedures, particularly from 2004 to 2005.
During this period, security training was led by Gen David Petraeus, who now commands all US forces in Iraq.
The GAO reached the estimate – 111,000 missing AK-47s and 80,000 missing pistols – by comparing the property records of the Multi-National Security Transition Command for Iraq against records maintained by Gen Petraeus of the arms and equipment he ordered.
Deputy Assistant Defence Secretary Mark Kimmitt told AFP the Pentagon was “reviewing policies and procedures to ensure US-funded equipment reaches the intended Iraqi security forces under the Iraq program”.
Weapons delay
The report comes as a political battle rages in Washington over the progress of the war in Iraq.
Gen Petraeus and US Ambassador to Iraq Ryan Crocker are scheduled to report to Congress by mid-September on the success of efforts to halt sectarian violence and return Iraq to viable self-governance.
Meanwhile, at the end of July, the US Defence Department admitted that the US-led coalition in Iraq had failed to deliver nearly two-thirds of the equipment it promised to Iraq’s army.
The Pentagon said only 14.5m of the nearly 40m items of equipment ordered by the Iraqi army had been provided.
The US military commander in charge of training in Iraq has asked for help in speeding up the transfer of equipment.
Iraq’s ambassador to the US said the delays were hindering the fighting capacity of its armed forces.

Not that I’m in any way queasy.  Far from it.
It’s a beautiful summers day in Boro and I’m sat in the berr garden of a local pub, using the uni LRC’s wifi internet access.  Sunshine, berr and the ability to smoke.  There are worse ways to surf the net.
Plus, I’ve just found out that the supermarket round the corner from the house does crates of Tennants lager.  Yay!  (Now all I need is the cash to buy one.)

So, last night I slept in a bed for the first time in just under a month.  Yay!  And, as a bonus, I wasn’t woken up by a dog deciding that I really need my face washed at stupid o clock in the morning as my mother went home yesterday with the two dogs.
I love my mum, but she can be annoying at times.  On Thursday, she decided that the clock on the cooker really needed to be set.  Unfortunately, she only succeeded in setting the timer going.  We can’t get the damn thing to shut up permanently unless we switch off the cooker at the wall.  Then, she spends over £30 on food for me and started complaining that she hadn’t bought enough.
£30.  On food.  For one person.  And she doen’t think she bought me enough.

So, finished re-reading the last Harry Potter book (this time at a more serene, sane pace).  It is a good book, but not my favourite (which is still Order of the Phoenix).  Slightly disappointed with myself that I only predicted one thing correctly.  Never mind, makes up for my spectacular success with Heroes.
Which starts tonight on BBC2, with a double bill followed by Heroes Unmasked, a behind the scenes making of programme.  Yay!  Can’t wait.  And it’s being preceeded by a Top Gear Special.
Also, have heard a rumour that the guy who plays Sylar is about to be announced as the new Spock.  Still not sure what to make of the Star Trek film reboot idea but it’s not a bad choice.
Is it just me or is there a lot of next season shows being leaked online at the moment?  The first two Dexters (which I may watch as, despite having not seen the whole of Season 1 I have read the book it’s based on so I know what happens), the pilot for The Sarah connor Chronicles (Terminator spin off) and the pilot for Pushing Daisies.  Which I’ve just watched.  And loved.  And gave me my entry title.  This show deserves to be a huge, huge hit and I’m kinda predicting it will be.
Anyhoo, have to go as I’m just about to get turfed out of here.

The SAS, the Parachute Regiment and the Police decide to go on a survival weekend together to see who comes out on top. After some basic exercises the trainer tells them that their next objective is to go down into the woods and catch a rabbit, returning with it ready to skin and cook.
Night falls.
First up – the SAS. They don infrared goggles, drop to the ground and crawl into the woods in formation. Absolute silence for 5 minutes, followed by the unmistakable muffled “phut-phut” of their trademark silenced “double-tap”. They emerge with a large rabbit shot cleanly between the eyes.
“Excellent!” remarks the trainer.
Next up – the Para ‘s. They finish their cans of lager, smear themselves with camouflage cream, fix bayonets and charge down into the woods, screaming at the top of their lungs. For the next hour the woods ring with the sound of rifle and machine-gun fire, hand grenades, mortar bombs and blood curdling war cries. Eventually they emerge, carrying the charred remains of a rabbit.
“A bit messy, but you achieved the aim; well done”, says the trainer.
Lastly, in go the coppers, walking slowly, hands behind backs whistling Dixon of Dock Green. For the next few hours, the silence is only broken by the occasional crackle of a walkie-talkie “Sierra Lima Whisky Tango Fanta One, suspect headed straight for you…” etc. After what seems an eternity, they emerge escorting a squirrel in handcuffs.
“What the hell do you think you are doing?” asks the incredulous trainer, “Take this squirrel back and get me a rabbit like I asked you five hours ago!”.
So back they go. Minutes pass. Minutes turn to hours, night drags on and turns to day. The next morning, the trainer and the other teams are awakened by the police, holding the handcuffed squirrel, now covered in bruises, one eye nearly shut.
“Are you taking the p**s!!??” asks the now seriously irate trainer.
The police team leader nudges the squirrel, who squeaks:
“Alright, alright, I’m a f***ing rabbit!”

Islamic Republic’s intelligence agents allege rodents were carrying advanced Western spy gear
Dudi Cohen
Iranian intelligence operatives recently detained over a dozen squirrels found within the nation’s borders, claiming the rodents were serving as spies for Western powers determined to undermine the Islamic Republic.
“In recent weeks, intelligence operatives have arrested 14 squirrels within Iran’s borders,” state-sponsored news agency IRNA reported. “The squirrels were carrying spy gear of foreign agencies, and were stopped before they could act, thanks to the alertness of our intelligence services.”
Iranian police commander Esmaeil Ahmadi-Moqadam confirmed the report, saying that a number of squirrels had been caught bearing foreign spy gear within Iran’s borders.
“I heard of this but I have no specific knowledge on the subject,” he said. He refused to give further details.
Recently, Iran has increased its efforts in combating espionage by the West. The use of rodents has not been documented in the past.

Article from: Agence France-Presse
From correspondents in Basra
July 11, 2007 05:37pm
THE Iraqi port city of Basra, already prey to a nasty turf war between rival militia factions, has now been gripped by a scary rumour  giant badgers are stalking the streets by night, eating humans.
The animals were allegedly released into the area by British forces.
Local farmers have caught and killed several of the beasts, but this has done nothing to dispel the rumour.
Iraqi scientists have attempted to calm things down. However, the story has spread like wildfire in the streets of the city and the villages round about.
Mushtaq Abdul-Mahdi, director of Basra’s veterinary hospital, has inspected the corpses of several badgers and tries to reassure Iraqis that the animals are not a new post-war arrival in the region.
These animals appeared before the fall of the regime in 1986. They are known as Al-Ghirayri and locally as Al-Girta, he told AFP. Talk that this animal was brought by the British forces is incorrect and unscientific.
Not everybody is convinced.
I believe this animal appeared following a raid to the region by the British forces, said Ali Mohsen, a farmer in his 40s from Karmat Ali, near the air base used by the multinational force.
As we are close to the airport, they probably released this animal into the area.
British troops have been based in Basra since the 2003 US-led invasion overthrew dictator Saddam Hussein, and the 5500 that remain still face the threat of Shiite militias battling for the region’s oil resources.
They also have to battle the Iraqi rumour mill, as locals are quick to blame them for almost any calamity that befalls the area  including an apparent plague of vicious badgers with long claws and powerful jaws.
British army spokesman Major David Gell said the animals were thought to be a kind of honey badger  melivora capensis  which can be fierce but are not usually dangerous to humans unless provoked.
They are native to the region but rare in Iraq. They’re nocturnal carnivores with a fearsome reputation, but they don’t stalk humans and carry them back to their lair, he said.
Both the scientists and the soldiers agree that the badger ought not to be a danger to humans, but so far they have failed to reassure the populace.
I was sleeping at night when this strange animal hit me on my head. I have not seen such an animal before. My husband hurried to shoot it but it was as swift as a deer, Suad Hassan, a 30-year-old housewife said.
It is the size of a dog but his head is like a monkey. It runs so quickly.
Cell phone video of the badgers circulating in Basra shows a stocky skunk-like animal with long front claws.
The honey badger, or ratel, is known as a brave predator capable of killing a cobra. It weighs up to 14kg.
Sattar Jabbar, a 50-year-old local farmer from Abu Sakhar north of Basra, believes the badger can tackle even large prey.
I saw it three days ago at night attacking animals. It even ate a cow. It tore the cow up piece by piece. I tried to shoot it with my gun but it ran away into the orchards. I missed it, he said.

MANCHESTER, N.H. – Leaf it to New Hampshire, where a bank branch was held up by a man disguised as a tree.
Just as the Citizen Bank branch opened Saturday morning, a man walked in with leafy boughs duct-taped to his head and torso, and robbed the place.
“He really went out on a limb,” police Sgt. Ernie Goodno said Sunday.
Police said the leafy man didn’t saying anything about having a weapon, just demanded cash, and was given an undisclosed amount.
Although the branches and leaves obscured much of the man’s face, someone who saw images from the bank’s security camera recognized the robber and called police.
Officers said James Coldwell, 49, was arrested early Sunday at his Manchester home and charged with robbery. Arraignment was not expected until Monday.

Yu.  As my flatmate is moving out, I have to as well.  And, unfortunately, I’m keeping the same landlord.  Joy.  But at least I’m going to be a lot closer to town, which’ll be handy for staggering home after a night out.
What I’ve decided to do is stay there till i get a job, find somewhere else and move out.  Course, knowing me that’ll never happen but still.  It’s a plan.
It is now officially against the law to smoke in pubs in England.  Meaning that if I want a smoke I have to go outside.  Joy.  Especially given what the weather is like at the moment.  But, I’m meeting some interesting people and there’s quite a lot of conversation going on.  Admittedly, mostly bitching about the ban.  I still can’t wait for the non-smokers to complain about fighting their way through the smokers to get into places, just so I can point out that they were the ones who wanted us outside to smoke in the first frakking place.
I’ve been overdosing on BSG the past few nights.  After getting heartily sick of people saying “dude, you should watch BSG!” I finally did and am hooked.  I’m just about up to the end of season 2 and have yet to download season 3, I’ll probably be going through withdrawls.  Now, if I can only do something about those who say that I should like Star Wars based on the fact I like sci-fi.
Question for those of you who have pet lizards.  How expensive is it for the equipment (tank, etc)?  I’m thinking of buying the equipment over a preiod of time, as that’s the only way I can afford it at the moment, but I’m just wondering how long that’ll take.
My hair is annoying me, as it’s long enough to get into my eyes, but not long enough to put into a ponytale.  So, at the moment, I’mm using an elastic band to keep it back.  Like this:

A grandmother won second prize in a cake-baking contest at a fete, only to discover she was the only entrant.
Jenny Brown, 62, entered her Victoria Sponge into the competition and was initially pleased to have come second.
But she was left shocked when a friend revealed to her that she was the only person to take part.
The contest was organised by the Wimblington Sports Committee and judges marked down the cake because it had indentations from the oven rack.
‘Judges’ expectations’
Ms Brown said: “My friend came over to me at the fete and said I had come second.
“I asked her how many more entries there had been, but she just started laughing and said I was the only one.
“I definitely wasn’t annoyed about it.”
Although the cake was not deemed fit to win the competition, Ms Brown said it was soon polished off with no complaints.
Julie Dent, from the Wimblington Sports Committee, said: “The judges had an expectation and I suppose they didn’t feel as though it qualified for first place.
“This was the first year but the cake competition will become an annual event.”
She said her own baking was subject to another strange decision.
“About 11 years ago I entered a show with some fruit scones. I was the only entrant but I came third.”

The ruling party in East Timor, Fretilin, has claimed victory in last weekend’s elections, although its support has slipped to 29% of voters.
In the last election in 2001, Fretilin won 57%, and now it will need to find coalition partners if it wants to rule.
The Fretilin leader, Mari Alkatiri, said talks were taking place with several other parties.
But he ruled out any deal with the party of the former president, Xanana Gusmao, which polled 23%.
Most parties have said they will not join a Fretilin coalition, and analysts say that one likely outcome would be a government formed around Mr Gusmao’s party, under which Mr Gusmao ends up as prime minister.
Correspondents say the slide in support for Fretilin was largely due to popular anger at the slow pace of development since independence.
Violence and accusations
Results are now almost complete after Saturday’s parliamentary election.
More than 500,000 votes were cast in the poll, which was declared generally free and fair by European Union election monitors.
Fretilin and Mr Gusmao’s National Congress for the Reconstruction of East Timor (CNRT) have dominated the election for the 65-seat parliament.
Twelve other smaller parties also put up candidates in the election.
A fragile peace has existed in the impoverished country since violent feuding between rival units in the fledgling army and police forces spilled onto the streets in 2006.
The clashes left more than 30 people dead, forced tens of thousands of people from their homes and led to the deployment of an international peacekeeping force.
Mr Alkatiri – who was forced to resign after last year’s violence – has accused Mr Gusmao of authoritarian tendencies.
But Mr Gusmao used his campaign to tell supporters that Mr Alkatiri had already tried – and failed – to run a successful administration.
Parliamentary elections come a month after former Prime Minister Jose Ramos-Horta was elected president, vowing to end violence in the young nation.
Mr Gusmao chose not to seek a fresh term as president – a largely ceremonial role – preferring to seek the job of prime minister.
The former Portuguese colony of East Timor broke away from 25 years of Indonesian rule in a 1999 referendum. It was placed under UN protection until it achieved independence in May 2002.

Yup folks, ScriptFrenzy! is now officially over.  So, how did I do?
Well, have a look at my diary pic, or at the bottom of this entry.
Go on.  I can wait.
Yup, I did it.  Admittedly, i was only able to submit it for checking 5 minutes before the deadline.  This was because the last hour was spend tring to find places to add words.  When I finished the script I was on 18,550 words.  And I was damned if I was going to let a mere 1,450 words stop me.
Thus, the frustrating read through.  But I did it.
My final wordcount? 20,065.
Now I need to edit it.  Badly.  But that won’t be for another few days.   I’m also willing to send a copy (unedited) to anyone who wants to read it (again in a few days).  If that’s you, let me know.  But remember, it is around 120 pages.
Still.  Go me!

1248,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/car-on-fire-crashes-into-airport-3929732/,2007-06-29,Car on fire crashes into airport,"
A car on fire has been driven at the main terminal building at Glasgow Airport, police have confirmed.
Eyewitnesses have described a Jeep Cherokee being driven at speed towards the building with flames coming out from underneath.
They have also described seeing two Asian men, one of whom was on fire, who had been in the car.
Strathclyde Police said two people had been arrested and detained in connection with the incident.
The airport has been evacuated and all flights suspended following the incident at 1515 BST.
	There was an Asian guy who was pulled out of the car by two police officers
Richard Gray
Eyewitness
A Whitehall spokesman said the incident was not being treated as a national security threat.
One eyewitness said: “I heard the sound of a car’s wheels spinning and smoke coming out.
“I saw a Jeep Cherokee apparently as if it was trying to get right through the doors into the terminal building.
“There were flames coming out from underneath then some men appeared from in amongst the flames.
“The police ran over and the people started fighting with the police. I then heard what sounded like an explosion.”
Eye-witness Richard Gray told BBC News 24: “A green Jeep was in the middle of the doorway burning.
“There was an Asian guy who was pulled out of the car by two police officers, who he was trying to fight off. They’ve got him on the ground.
“The car didn’t actually explode. There were a few pops and bangs which presumably was the petrol.”
Stephen Clarkson said he saw people running towards him and “panicking” then noticed a crashed Cherokee jeep.
He said he helped police restrain one of the men.
“It was lucky that I was there,” he said.
“I managed to knock the man to the ground with my forearm and the police got on top of him and restrained him and put handcuffs on him.”
‘No accident’
Dr Rak Nandwani was at the airport building to pick up relatives when he saw a plume of black smoke.
He said: “The whole place has come to a standstill, the terminal building has been evacuated. I have spoken to my relatives and they have been moved to outside the building.
“They were told they could not pick their baggage up from the baggage collection area.
“There must be about 50 police cars at the airport. Me and my son, along with everyone else, have been moved to the car rental area.”
Taxi driver Ian Crosby said: “This was no accident. This was a deliberate attack on Glasgow Airport.”
The reaction of members of the public was not to help the men in the car, but to restrain them, he told the BBC.
Mr Crosby, who said he served in Northern Ireland, told how he shepherded people away from the scene in case of a secondary explosion or a nail-bomb.
Two men, one of whom was reported to be badly burned, were seen being led away in handcuffs.

1249,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/brown-is-uks-new-prime-minister-3932717/,2007-06-26,Brown is UK’s new prime minister,"
Labour leader Gordon Brown is the UK’s new prime minister after being asked to form a government by the Queen.
Posing outside No 10 with wife Sarah, the man who has been Tony Blair’s chancellor for the past 10 years, said: “Let the work of change begin.”
He said his priorities were education, health and restoring trust in politics. He promised he would “try my utmost”.
Outgoing PM Blair had earlier received an emotional and unprecedented standing ovation from MPs as he left Parliament.
It is the first time in 17 years a UK prime minister has entered office without a general election.
Mr Brown said: “This will be a new government with new priorities. And I have been privileged to have been granted the great opportunity to serve my country.
“And at all times I will be strong in purpose, steadfast in will, resolute in action in the service of what matters to the British people, meeting the concerns and aspirations of our whole country.”
Reshuffle
Mr Brown promised to lead a government of “all the talents” and said his “mission” was to provide “the best of chances for everyone”.
“If we can fulfil the potential and realise the talents of all our people then I’m absolutely sure that Britain can be the great global success story of this century,” he told reporters in Downing Street.
Then, quoting his school motto, he said: “I will try my utmost. This is my promise to all of the people of Britain. And now let the work of change begin.”
Mr Brown is thought likely to carry out the bulk of his Cabinet reshuffle on Thursday, but it has already emerged that one definite change will see Patricia Hewitt stepping down as health secretary.
Blair job
Conservative leader David Cameron congratulated Mr Brown on becoming prime minister – but demanded he hold an immediate general election.
Speaking on his Webcameron internet site, the Tory leader said: “Gordon Brown doesn’t have the mandate, he wasn’t elected as prime minister, and he should go to the country.”
Earlier, Mr Brown spent 57 minutes inside Buckingham Palace in a private audience with the Queen – more than double Mr Blair’s 28 minutes.
Mr Brown, 56, becomes the 11th prime minister of the Queen’s reign.
He has been seen as the unofficial prime-minister-in-waiting for the past decade – finally getting his chance when Mr Blair announced he would stand down after three terms.
He became Labour leader unopposed on Sunday after potential rivals had failed to gain enough support to mount a challenge.
Mr Blair is now expected to take up a new role as a Middle East peace envoy with the so-called “quartet” of Russia, the EU, America and the UN.
Mr Blair is travelling by train to his Sedgefield constituency, in the North East of England, where he is expected to announce he is standing down after 24 years as its MP.
Earlier, as they left Downing Street the Blair family – including their four children – posed for the gathered world media.
Mr Blair said nothing to the press as they got in the car, but wife Cherie smiled and waved at the press and said she would not “miss” them.
In his final prime minister’s questions in the Commons Mr Blair received a standing ovation from MPs on all sides, in unprecedented scenes.
Tributes
Mr Blair admitted he had “never pretended to be a great House of Commons man” but he paid tribute to the “noble” work of MPs and – in his final words to Parliament – said: “I wish everyone, friend or foe, well and that is that, the end.”
Mr Blair, who was being watched from the public gallery by his family, also paid tribute to troops killed in Iraq, saying he was “truly sorry about the dangers they face today”.
Conservative leader David Cameron hailed Mr Blair’s “remarkable achievement” in being prime minister for 10 years, praising peace in Northern Ireland and Mr Blair’s work in the developing world which he said will “endure”.
He wished Mr Blair “every success for whatever he does in the future”.
Mr Blair thanked Mr Cameron for his tributes and said although he could not wish the Tory leader well politically, “personally I wish both him and his family very well indeed”.
Lib Dem leader Sir Menzies Campbell said that, despite their political disagreements, Mr Blair had been “unfailingly courteous” and extended his party’s best wishes to the outgoing prime minister and his family.
Mr Blair returned the compliment, saying Sir Menzies had a “generosity of spirit and courtesy”.

1250,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/hola-147-3932715/,2007-06-26,Hola!,"
First of all, thanks for the notes on my last entry.  Yeah, I’m disappointed that I wasn’t chosen, but not really surprised.  I’ve still got other things possibly on the go (which reminds me, I’ll have to send that email).
Plus at least I don’t have to argue with the DWP about it kinda sorta being a job interview so I could get the money to go.
Yup, I’m officially signing on.  Had the interview about it on Monday.  At 9am.  As I’m having trouble getting to sleep before 4 – 5am, this particualrly thrilled me.  But I made it and my claim is now being processed.
I also managed to get money on Monday and bought myself a new pair of shoes.  This was very much needed as, at the time, my left shoe was held together using the shoelace.  Yes, you read that right.  I wish I’d taken a photo of it as it’s actually quite funny.  Well, it is now.  At the time?  Not so much.
Speaking of pictures…
More interesting grafitti!


And something I made on sketchup:

And I shall see you guys later.

1251,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/campaigns-end-ahead-of-timor-poll-3929731/,2007-06-26,Campaigns end ahead of Timor poll,"
Political parties in East Timor have held their last campaign rallies ahead of this weekend’s parliamentary poll.
Among those contesting the election are the ruling Fretilin party and a new party created by independence hero and former President Xanana Gusmao.
Supporters of both camps held rallies in the capital, Dili, waving flags and shouting slogans.
Some people have been hurt in clashes between rival supporters, but recently campaigning has been peaceful.
There were initial fears that this would not be the case, when two of Mr Gusmao’s supporters were shot dead earlier in the campaign.
Clashes
Analysts suggest that voters in Saturday’s poll will deal a heavy blow to Fretilin.
The party was in power last year when tensions between police and armed forces triggered weeks of street clashes that left more than 30 people dead and tens of thousands homeless.
The resulting unrest led to the deployment of an international peacekeeping force.
Mr Gusmao’s new party, the National Congress for the Reconstruction of East Timor, is expected to win the largest number of seats in parliament.
However he is not expected to win an overall majority, leaving key government positions open to negotiations between the parties.
East Timorese people hope this election will bring stability to a nation struggling with severe poverty.
Whoever wins faces huge challenges, particularly how to cut unemployment and reduce gang violence.
Saturday’s poll comes just a month after former Prime Minister Jose Ramos-Horta was elected president, also vowing to end violence in the young nation.
East Timor broke away from 25 years of Indonesian rule in a 1999 referendum. It was then under UN protection until it achieved independence in May 2002.

1252,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/factcheck-labours-election-pledge-cards-3929729/,2007-06-26,FactCheck: Labour’s election pledge cards,"
Last Modified: 08 May 2007
By: Channel 4 News
Did things only get better since Labour came to power in 1997?
In 1997, Tony Blair published a list of five pledges which summed up the key targets for Labour’s first term in office.
They even gave them out as handy little cards. It was judged enough of a success to be repeated in 2001 and 2005. But did Labour deliver on them?
What better way to assess the success of the Labour project. Did things really get better, as Labour’s 1997 campaign song promised? Here are the pledges, and here’s how they turned out:
1997
We will cut class sizes to 30 or under for 5, 6 and 7 year olds by using money saved from the assisted places scheme
In 1997, 23.9 per cent of 5-7 year olds were in classes of 30 or more. The latest figures reported that 1.4 per cent of under sevens were being taught in classes of over 30.
Most of those were covered by various exemptions to the rules – only 0.2 per cent were in illegally large classes.
Source: Department for Education and Skills (PDF)
Achievement score: 4
We will introduce a fast track punishment scheme for persistent young offenders by halving the time from arrest to sentencing
The government hit this target, and has more or less kept to it – a significant thing to do, as three months on remand is a long time for anyone, but particularly a child.
“But there were some unintended consequences”, says Frances Crook, director of the Howard League for Penal Reform. Young people often go through a spell of offending, and under the old system this could all be taken into account in one sentence.
Now the first sentence is sometimes rushed through, and some cases where you might have had one sentence, you now have two. And sometimes, that might be a jail term.
Achievement score: 4
We will cut NHS waiting lists by treating an extra 100,000 patients as a first step by releasing £100m saved from NHS red tape
In 1997, 1.3m were on waiting lists. By 2000, this target had been met – though by focusing on waiting lists, the Government was accused of distorting priorities. Since then, the government has decided that it makes more sense to target waiting times, not waiting lists. In 1997, the guaranteed maximum wait was 18 months – Labour is now targeting a maximum wait of 18 weeks by 2008.
Source: The King’s Fund
Achievement score: 5
We will get 250,000 under-25 years-olds off benefit and into work by using money from a windfall levy on the privatised utilities
More than 250,000 young people have passed through the New Deal, and subsequently found jobs. But in a growing economy with low unemployment, many would have found work anyway.
Professor John Van Reenen has estimated that the ‘value added’ by the New Deal programme amounts to around 17,000 extra young people in work per year – a success, at reasonable cost, but perhaps falling slightly below the levels promised by the pledge.
Achievement score: 4
We will set tough rules for government spending and borrowing and ensure low inflation and strengthen the economy so that interest rates are as low as possible to make all families better off
Gordon Brown and Tony Blair have certainly presided over a long period of growth and economic stability (though some indicators, particularly inflation, have been heading upwards lately).
The ‘tough rules’ have been more controversial. The most controversial was the ‘Golden Rule’ which said that the government should balance the books over the economic cycle. The government has met this, but only by redefining exactly what constitutes a cycle.
The Government also pledged to keep government debt below 40 per cent of GDP, the ‘sustainable investment rule’. This has been met, but public sector debt is rising, and the independent thinktank the Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates that there’s a 44 per cent chance it will be exceeded by 2010-11.
Other liabilities, notably public sector pensions and PFI borrowing, aren’t included in that figure. If they were, it would be closer to 90 per cent.
For an exhaustive account, click here.
Achievement score: 2
2001
In 2001, Blair published a similar list of pledges
Mortgages as low as possible, low inflation and sound public finances
Almost too vague to FactCheck. Inflation has certainly been low since 2001, though it has risen recently. Blair and Brown continued to meet their own fiscal rules for sensible management of the public finances. But taxation, spending and government borrowing all rose during the second Labour term in office.
Achievement score: 3
10,000 extra teachers and higher standards in secondary schools
The DfES says that there were 24,700 more teachers than in 2001 – target met. The higher standards issue is more debatable. 57.2 per cent of state school pupils achieved five good grades at GSCE in 2006, up from 42.0 per cent in 2001.
But there have been arguments about falling standards, backed by evidence of poor literacy, and stories about universities having to teach remedial maths classes.
There’s a suspicion that the figures don’t tell the full story – on one fudge, a GNVQ vocational qualification can count for four GSCEs. A potentially more instructive figure is the pass rate including Maths and English: just 44.1 per cent last year.
Achievement score: 3
20,000 extra nurses and 10,000 extra doctors in a reformed NHS
Between 2001 and 2005, the NHS hired 22,000 extra doctors and 53,000 extra nurses – meeting the pledge. But NHS reform remains a work in progress, as recent problems with IT projects, deficits and junior doctor training illustrate.
Source: The Information centre, NHS
Achievement score: 4
6,000 extra recruits to raise police numbers to their highest ever level
Pensioners’ winter fuel payment retained, minimum wage rising to £4.20
Police officer numbers have continued to rise since 2001, reaching 142,972 in England and Wales – an all time high.
The minimum wage was £3.70 in June 2006, and this not especially generous increase was achieved on October 1 2002.
The winter fuel payment has been unchanged since 2001, despite rising energy costs.
Achievement score: 4.5
2005
In 2005, the old pledge tactic was being recycled yet again.
The six pledges:
1. Your family better off
2. Your family treated better and faster
3. Your child achieving more
4. Your country’s borders protected
5. Your community safer
6. Your children with the best start
Some pledges, like number 4, are so vague that some of them can’t be factchecked or falsified, and it’s still quite early in the second term to verify the others.
Is this a sign that Labour has run out of ideas? That Blair and Brown couldn’t agree what to promise? Or just a judgement that general themes will resonate better with voters than concrete pledges?
Overall
The government’s record on its pledges is not bad – most have been achieved, in name at least. And if there are caveats, then you’d hardly expect otherwise.
But a few questions remain. This progress was achieved at the cost of billions of pounds of taxpayers’ money. Was it worth it? And, given the two massive parliamentary majorities Blair had, could he have achieved more? Many things did get better. But could Labour have done better?

Yup, I’ve decided to post another excerpt from my script.  This time, it’s the President’s press conference.

INT. HALLWAY – NIGHT
This hallway obviously belongs to a large house.  It is quite tastefully decorated.  Grace is holding the door open as Lewis, carrying a couple of bags and a box walks through.  Joss is behind him, carrying more stuff.  He stops at the threshold.
GRACE:
If you just dump everything in the living room just now.  Well sort everything out later.  You guys want anything to drink?
LEWIS:
Wouldnt mind some pop.
GRACE:
Prefer a beer?
LEWIS:
Oh, OK then.
GRACE:
Living rooms right through there.
Lewis heads towards the living room as Grace heads into the kitchen.  Joss clears his throat.
JOSS:
Erm, Grace?
GRACE:
Shit sorry.  Is there any particular thing you need me to say?
JOSS:
Not particularly.
GRACE:
OK then.  Come in.
Joss finally walks in.
GRACE:
You need anything to drink?
JOSS:
Ill fix it myself.
GRACE:
Ahhh.  No problem, Ill fix it.  By the way, another good reason to relocate to here.
JOSS:
Good point.
Grace walks away as Joss walks into the living room.
INT. LIVING ROOM – NIGHT
The living room is huge.  The main feature of the room is an entertainment centre with a huge plasma screen TV.  Alice, Simon and Lewis are sat on a sofa watching a news channel on TV.  The sound is low but it can be heard.  Joss puts the bags down.  Simon holds his hand out to Joss.
SIMON:
Im Simon.  You must be the infamous Joss.
JOSS:
Indeed I am.
They shake hands.  Grace comes in with a bottle of beer and a mug.  She hands the mug to Joss and the bottle to Lewis.  Joss takes a sip from the cup.
JOSS:
Oooh, strong.
LEWIS:
Yeah, forgot to warn you.  Bill said that the blood he gave us today is fresher than youre used to, so you might want to watch.
JOSS:
No problem.  Grace, I set up base at that computer over there?
GRACE:
Yeah, its hard wired to the net.  The rest of us can use my laptop.
ALICE:
Turn the sound up, it looks like somethings happening.
Grace points a remote control at the TV and the volume increases.
NEWSREADER (V.O.):
And we cross over now to The White House for a press conference by the President.
CUT TO:
INT. WHITE HOUSE PRESS ROOM – NIGHT
This room really should not need any description.  The White House PRESS SECRETARY is standing at the podium.
PRESS SECRETARY:
The president will make a statement and, if there is time afterwards, the floor will be opened up for questions.  Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States.
The press secretary leaves the podium to be replaced by the PRESIDENT.  He is in his early 60s and dressed in a suit, as one might expect.
PRESIDENT:
Ladies and gentlemen of the press, citizens of America.  I speak to you today in the middle of one of the biggest crisis to ever affect this country.  As you may be aware, the people of this country are disappearing, being attacked and killed in unprecedented numbers.  It is no longer safe to walk the streets, during the day or at night.  Looting is widespread.
CUT TO:
INT. LIVING ROOM – NIGHT
Joss, Alice, Lewis, Simon and Grace are watching the TV.
PRESIDENT  (V.O.)(CONTD):
Our hospitals are being overrun.  There is not enough staff to cope with the demand, even if staff members were not simply disappearing.  Our morgues are being overrun and bodies are mysteriously disappearing.  People are finding themselves teaming with those that they would ordinarily consider enemies.
Alice glances to Joss.
CUT TO:
EXT. STREET – NIGHT
There is a pitched battle going on between two gangs.  William is leading one of the gangs, who are fighting with weapons.  They appear to be winning.
PRESIDENT  (V.O.)(CONTD):
Ordinary people are finding themselves doing extraordinary things just to survive throughout the day.
CUT TO:
INT. BAR – NIGHT
The bar is a typical working mans type bar.  All of the patrons of the bar are staring at the TVs on one wall.
PRESIDENT (V.O.)(CONTD):
The citizens are afraid to leave their house, unsure if they will be able to make it home safely.
A gang of vampires enter the bar and start attacking people.
PRESIDENT (V.O.)(CONTD):
Today, I finally got answers, which I will now share with you.  It is my belief that the great citizens of this country deserve them.  Ladies and gentlemen, this is not just happening in America.  It is happening worldwide.  And it is not merely a crisis
CUT TO:
INT. HOTEL ROOM – NIGHT
The room is obviously very expensive.  Robert, Tracey and Harri are all sat on the bed, watching the TV and drinking Champaign.  There is a smile on their faces.
PRESIDENT (V.O.)(CONTD):
it is an apocalypse, centuries in the making.  It is unstoppable.  And the vampire population of the world is conducting it.
CUT TO:
INT. WHITE HOUSE PRESS ROOM – NIGHT
There are gasps from the reporters.
PRESIDENT (CONTD):
It is for this reason that I am immediately declaring that the United States of America is under marshal law.  According to executive order _____ all future elections are to be suspended and I shall remain as President until further notice.  However, I shall be changing the hierarchy so that those who are more knowledgeable than me.  These changes will be announced in the fullness of time.
The Presidents face then changes, revealing that he is now a vampire.  Shrieks can be heard throughout the room.
PRESIDENT (CONTD):
Any questions?
CUT TO:
Hope you enjoyed.  Also, I really, really need feedback on the pitch/synopsis for the Fever Pitch competition (go back an entry).  I think they’re fine, but I’m not quite sure.

ScriptFrenzy! wordcount before writing last night: 5690.
ScriptFrenzy! wordcount, current: 10,179.
Course, I didn’t get a lot of lsleep while doing that but…
I also wrote a speech for the President of the United States (who won’t be Bush in the script).  Hence my last entry if people haven’t seen the edit.
Now I need some help.  I’m entering this and need to get my entry away by Friday.  I’ve written my pitch and my synopsis and am going to post them below this.  If you could plase, plase, read them and let me know what you think.  Is it clear enough?  Would they make you want to find out more?
(And, yes, I know that some of the information is repeated.  The synopsis is supposed to be an extended version of the pitch.)
Thanks in advance.

The Vampire Apocalypse Articles
Pitch
In the first days of the vampire apocalypse, a human friendly vampire leads one pocket of resistance.  But help could arrive from an unusual source.
The Vampire Apocalypse Articles
Synopsis
The vampire apocalypse is upon the world and the vampires want to take their place at the top of the food chain.  There are pockets of resistance the world over, led mostly by conspiracy theorists.  One such group is lead by Joss MacInnes, a vampire who is friendly towards humans.  He is joined by Lewis Sullivan, an online friend, Grace Jeter, the high school beauty with interesting hobbies, Simon Albarn, one of Graces schoolmates and Dr Alice Inkles, who stumbled her way into the group after being rescued.  The five of them have to try and protect themselves, each other and hopefully stop mankind being wiped out.  But there may be assistance from within the vampire hierarchy itself, as someone in the know can see through to the possible endgame, and doesnt like what it holds.

A lorry driver caught steering with his knees while he ate spaghetti from a pan has been jailed for eight weeks after he admitted dangerous driving.
Martin Veens was spotted driving his left-hand 40-tonne truck erratically on the A55 road near Northop, Flintshire.
Prestatyn magistrates heard how the North Wales Police helicopter’s camera filmed him holding and eating from a saucepan as he steered with his knees.
Veens, from the Netherlands, was banned from driving for a year.
At the hearing, magistrates were shown the footage taken by the police.
Chicken carcasses
It showed Veens, who was driving for a logistics firm based at Blakenham near Ipswich, straddling the white lines in the road as he used his left hand to hold a saucepan of food and his right hand holding a fork and steered the truck with his legs.
It was travelling up the steep Rhuallt Hill and was stopped a few miles further at Northop.
The court heard how Veens accepted his driving was dangerous.
His solicitor said it was agreed it had been an outstandingly stupid thing to do.
Veens was delivering chicken carcasses from Llangefni in Anglesey to Nottingham and had heated the spaghetti while the lorry was being loaded, the court heard.
He was banned from driving for a year and must take an extended test before driving a heavy goods vehicle again.
Chief Supt Geraint Anwyl, of North Wales Police, welcomed the sentence.
He said: “This is a further example of some of the unacceptable and dangerous practices of long-distance lorry drivers travelling on our roads.
“The frightening thing is that this is not an isolated incident.”

Last night I got a lot of work done on my ScriptFrenzy script (The Vampire Apocalypse Articles) and finally got up to just under 6,000 words.  Which I was exited about (despite the fact I should be at over 10,000).  Then I check my email today and find out that some people are already over the 20,000 target.  Bastards.
Didn’t help that I kept spelling Simon as Sinom.  Hence the title.
Hope you guys liked the excerpts from the script in the last entry.  May post more later.  I’ll see.
Last 2 episodes of Dr Who have been amazing, even if, in 2 sentances, Russell T Davies ruined my idea for a recurring Torchwood storyline.  Bastard.
Loved reading the reaction to the finale of The Sopranos online last weekend.  Last time a TV ending split the fans like that was Life on Mars.  And even that wasn’t as devisive.  David Chase may actually be a genius.
Have to get my 25 word pitch and 150 word synopsis written by the end of the week for something else I’m entering.  No actually prize, but there is the chance to make contacts.
And finally.  Fellow MST3K fans, click here and rejoice.
And now I must go.

The first one is currently the third scene, but may be moved up to the opening and the other one is later on.  Hope you enjoy.

INT. NIGHTCLUB – NIGHT
The nightclub is almost achingly trendy.  It looks like the sort of place where you need to get a mortgage just to buy a couple of rounds.  Dance music is playing extremely loudly.  A GIRL is sat on her own drinking an alcopop.  She is dressed to impress, showing as much flesh as is decent.  She is approached by a MAN, wearing a tight t  shirt and jeans.  The man says something to the woman and walks away.  The woman takes a mirror out of her handbag and checks her make up.  She then finishes her drink.  The man returns with another drink for her and one for himself.  He sits down beside her and they start talking.
FADE TO:
INT. NIGHTCLUB – NIGHT
It is later on in the night.  There are a few more empty bottles and glasses on the table.  The couple are making out, oblivious to anything going on around them.  They stop and the man whispers into the girls ear.  They get up and leave, holding hands.
CUT TO:
EXT. STREET – DAY
The couple are walking down the road, arms round each other.  They are both now wearing jackets.  As they approach an alleyway the man pulls the girl into it.  They start making out again, hands all over the place.  The man removes the girls jacket and starts kissing her neck.  The girl pulls away slightly.
GIRL:
Wait, stop, this is wrong.
MAN:
No, come on baby.  Dont stop.
GIRL:
But were in public!  What if we get caught?
MAN:
But thats part of the fun.  Trust me, this is an experience youll never forget.
The girl looks at the mans face and starts to scream.  The man goes back to her neck and the screaming stops, slightly unexpectedly.  Then the man raises his face, and the reason for the screaming stopping becomes clear as a piece of the girls neck goes flying.  The man lowers his head once again.
CUT TO:
INT. OFFICE – DAY
The office is functionally decorated.  Robert is sat behind a desk speaking to someone on the phone.
ROBERT:
Yeah, its absolute bedlam here.
WOMAN (O.S.):
Anyone suspicious?
ROBERT:
Only the staff at the morgue as far as Im aware.  But they can be dealt with.
WOMAN (O.S.):
But apart from them?
ROBERT:
Apart from them it would appear that no one has the first idea whats going on.  Which works out perfectly for us.
WOMAN (O.S.):
Well, they will soon enough.
ROBERT:
You managed that bit already?
WOMAN (O.S.):
Not quite yet.  But were well on course.  Just a matter of time.
ROBERT:
Excellent.  Thanks for the update.  Speak to you soon.
WOMAN (O.S.):
Speak to you later.
Robert hangs up the phone and then presses a button on the main unit of it.
HARRI (O.S.):
Yes, councillor Lennon?
ROBERT:
Could you come in here for a minute Harri?  I need you to do a favour for me.
HARRI (O.S.):
Right away councillor.
Robert gets up and stretches.  The door to the office opens and HARRI CALDWELL walks in.  She is in her 20s and is dressed smartly.  She closes the door behind her.
ROBERT:
Could you also lock the door?  I dont want us to be disturbed.
Harri locks the door.
HARRI:
What can I do for you councillor?
ROBERT:
Call me Robert why dont you?
HARRI:
OK Robert.  What can I do for you?
Robert walks over so he is standing right on front of Harri.
ROBERT:
Youre easily the best assistant Ive had working for me.  And good staff are hard to find, especially these days.  So I need to secure your future and position.
Harri looks down to the ground.
HARRI:
Sir, Im well its just I think youre a really nice person but Im not interested in you that way.
ROBERT:
Dont worry.  Im not talking about anything like that.  Thought, who knows?  Im going to be moving up in the world and, the future is such a long time, you may change your mind.
Harri looks up and covers her mouth with her hands.  She drops her hands and the scream has barely left her mouth when Robert clamps her to his chest in a tight hug.  He starts to stroke her hair.
ROBERT:
Shhh, shhh.  You may not think it now, but what Im about to do for you is a beautiful and amazing thing.
Robert tilts her head to one side and lowers his mouth to her neck.
CUT TO:

1262,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/woman-shocked-by-flashing-judge-3929718/,2007-06-11,Woman ‘shocked by flashing judge’,"
A woman has told a court of her “embarrassment” when one of England’s most senior judges exposed himself to her on a rush-hour train.
Lord Justice Richards faces two counts of exposure on trains in south-west London on 16 and 24 October 2006.
On the first occasion, she thought the “presentable” and “very kind” man was accidentally exposed, the court heard.
Sir Stephen Richards, 56, a father of three from Wimbledon, south London, denies the charges.
The victim identified the Court of Appeal judge and even took his pictures on a mobile phone, before picking him out at a video identity parade, City of Westminster Magistrates’ Court heard.
Recalling the first incident the woman said he had “boxed” her into a corner against the glass panels in the first carriage on the trip from Raynes Park, south-west London to Waterloo.
“Because I was embarrassed and nothing like this had happened to me before, I assumed this was an accident… so I carried on reading my paper,” she said.
“Sometimes the gentleman would adjust himself slightly, sometimes his genitals would be exposed and sometimes not as much.”
She said the incident lasted about 15 minutes.
A week later she spotted the judge on the train again, “My gut instinct then led me to believe that this was not an accident.”
When she realised he was exposing himself, she took out her mobile phone to unnerve him, the court heard. She then reported the incident following her boyfriend’s advice.
‘Unfathomable’ reasons
The court heard she took four photos of the judge on her mobile phone camera on two other occasions when she spotted him on the train, but this time he recognised her and moved away.
In January she boarded the train with a police officer and identified him.
During his police interview Sir Stephen insisted it was a case of mistaken identity.
Peter Wright QC, prosecuting, said Sir Stephen exposed himself “for what must be unfathomable reasons”.
During the trial David Fisher QC, defending, accepted it was possible the victim had seen Sir Stephen on two occasions but stressed he was not the same man.
Recalling his police interview, arresting officer Pc Adrian Watts told the court Sir Stephen had said: “It would be a very extraordinary thing to do, to have walked on to a crowded commuter rail service with one’s penis hanging out.
“If that had happened I would have expected somebody to point it out, I would.
“I simply have to say that what she is alleging, if she is alleging it, is untrue.”
Sir Stephen has overseen several high-profile hearings, including the case brought by the family of Jean Charles de Menezes, seeking action against police officers over the killing of the Brazilian at Stockwell Tube station in south London.
The trial is expected to last two days.

Yup, I’ve made a plan (sort of) for the future.
Discluding doing something to actually get some money (looking for a job, obviously) this is what I plan to do.
1) Finish ScriptFrenzy script.
2) Enter short writing competition mentioned in previous entry.
3) Remember the scriptwriting course I did a couple of years ago?  Well, the uni offers 2 advanced courses to follow on.  I plan to complete each course.  i have already emailed them to ask for more details.
4) The uni is also running a couple of summer school courses where you get to make a short film.  I’m not too sure if I’m going to, but i might apply for one of them.
Dunno what’ll happen after that.
So, yeah, that’s my plan.  Maybe not the best plan in the world, but it’s mine.

Well, actually, it’s been on since Friday.  But I only actually got started on my script tonight.  After a lot of stressing, and more than a couple of false starts, I finally settled on my story and started writing.
I’ve reserected an idea I had years ago, just waiting for the right time to use it.  It’s called The Vampire Apocolypse Articles.  So, no surprise what it is actually about.  It’s something I don’t actually think anyone has come up with before and I’m excited about actually writing the thing.
So, having started with no words at 1amthis morning, I’m now up to just under 800 words.  Which is fine.  It will need fine tuning later (I think the scene I’m about to write would be better at the begining of the film rather than where it is at the moment) but I’m not going to stress about that just now.  I’m just going to write, using advice that Peter_24601 gave me.  Write now, edit later.
Course, it doesn’t help that I have game 3 of the Stanley Cup on.
I’m not sure about posting bits of it in here, simply because formatting it so it’s even vaguely in the right format is a bitch (which I know from this entry  But, if there is enough demand, I will do.
And after I’ve finished with this madness I’ve decided to enter this.  I may be mad, but it looks like fun.
Oh and huge thanks to A rather Shady Mogwi for my new diary icon.
Wish me luck.

Ok, it’s my 1200th entry and, as promised, I’ll be answering your questions.  So, let’s get to it.
Almost a Sarah kicks things off.
Did you know that you look almost exactly like my ex? 
Well, not having seen a picture of him, I would have to say no.  Besides, with him being your ex, I’m not really sure if that’s a compliment or not :¬p
Next, we have shesolovely
Anyone special tugging at you heart?
Yup.  It’s not going to happen, unfortunately, but yup.
What job do you eventually want (if you can get your dreamjob?)
Writing and directing films.
If you’re not earning anything (the testresults), what do you do for money?
I’m currently living off the kindness of friends.
Shukhevych folowed that with:
Ever do any travelling around Europe or the US?
Not in America.  But I’ve been to Denmark (Odense, the birthplace of Hans Christian Anderson), Spain (where I got to see the stadium for the 2002 Olympic games the year before they were held and the Nou Camp Stadium) and Italy (where I went hydrospeeding and, on the way there, went on a midnight tour of Paris including the original Statue of Liberty).
And finally, The Mary had a question.  Or ten.
Would you ever dress up as Zaphod Beeblebrox for halloween?
Hell yes.  But the one from the TV series, not the film one.
What’s your favorite smell?
Brine.  It reminds me of growing up.
Has there ever been a moment in your life where you thought about running away and never being seen again?
There’s been a few.  But I’ve never gone through with it.  Mainly when people keep trying to talk to me when I want to be left alone.
Do you have a cell phone? Tell me about it.
I do.  I have a Motorola W375 in black.  It has a Life on Mars wallpaper and screensaver, the opening of the Dr who theme tune as the ringtone and the message, “Don’t move!  You are surrounded by armed bastards!” when I get a text.
Would you consider becoming a beggar if you made more money?
Actually, I probably wouldn’t.  I have a hard enough time asking friends to lend me money, never mind complete strangers.
What is your favorite food?
Chicken Parmesan.  Chicken fillet, coated in breadcrumbs, deep fried, topped with bechamel sauce and cheese and grilled intil the cheese melts.  Serve with chips and salad.  Sounds disgusting, actually delicious.
Who is your favorite actor?
Not really sure I have just one.  Nathan Fillion has to be up there.  Philip Seymore Hoffman I’ve liked since before Capote.  Edward Norton is amazing.  There really are too many to name.  Oh, but I will say this: Jim Carrey is a much better dramatic actor then a lot of people give him credit for.
Which Firefly character is your favorite and why?
River.  Gotta love a mad chick.
What are your thoughts on the new Buffy comic?
I’m really enjoying it.  Looking forward to Brian K Vaughns Faith in England run.
Do you believe we should pirate the airwaves and demand that an (already bound) Joss Whedon make season after season of Firefly?
Throw in Drive, Wonderfalls, season 6 of Angel and Dead Like Me, and I’m definatly in.
What do you do for a living?
Nothing at the moment.  I’m looking for work.
I want to live in England so bad it hurts. Do you feel that way about America?
I do want to live in America, but not quite that much.  But it would be nice, yeah.  So long as it’s somewhere not too hot.
And that’s the end of the questions.  I’ll be doing this again in another 100 entries.

Poland bans ‘gay’ Telletubbies
The Telletubbies are set to be banned in Poland after a government media watchdog decided they encouraged homosexuality.
The children’s Tv programme has fallen foul of Poland’s government-appointed Children’s Rights spokesman, who believes the show is “gay propaganda”.
A special committee has been appointed to examine the claims including allegations that Tinky Winky’s handbag was breaking down gender barriers and encouraging homosexuality.
Car clamper faces ASBO
A car clamper accused of intimidating motorists is set to be the first in Britain to get an ASBO.
Hundreds of drivers have complained over several years about the methods used by the Carstoppers clamping firm at the beauty spot of Haworth, West Yorkshire.
The firm once immobilised a car while the driver was asleep inside and clamped a minibus taking special needs pupils on a country ride, reports the Daily Mail.
Carstoppers once won the Dick Turpin award for being the country’s worst clampers.
Now one of the company’s employees George McDicken, 38, is facing an interim ASBO order.
He is accused of “intimidating and aggressive” behaviour by the authorities seeking the order.
The move follows hundreds of complaints to police and Bradford Council about Carstoppers. Traders in Haworth have long complained that over-zealous clamping is affecting the Bronte village’s tourist trade.
A Bradford Council spokesman said: “The ASBO application has been brought following numerous complaints to the police and ourselves over a long period of time.
“The case is not actually against clamping, which is legal, it is the behaviour that goes with it.”
Bondage couple lose key
A German couple had to call out the fire brigade after tying each other up in chains – and then losing the key to the padlock.
Jochen Ranstett, 56 and his wife Maria, from the town of Weiden, dressed up in leathers and chained each other to their beds, but lost the key during the romp.
After hours of trying to free themselves they finally gave up and called for help on Jochen’s mobile phone.
He said: “It was so embarrassing. We just wanted to try something a bit different and we ended up with this.
“I even had to be taken to hospital because my wrists had swollen so much from trying to get out of the handcuffs.”
Man sleeps through gunshot to head
A West Virginia man slept through being shot in the head as he lay in bed after a big night out.
Michael Lusher, 37, of Altizer, was sleeping in his mobile home when a gunman fired five bullets into the trailer.
One of them struck Mr Lusher in the head. But he didn’t notice until he woke up four hours later and spotted blood, reports the Huntington Herald Dispatch.
The bullet had slowed down as it passed through two walls before hitting Mr Lusher who had only just returned home from a night out.
Cpl. R H McQuaid, of the local Sheriff’s Department, said: “It was a small-calibre handgun, so it lost a lot of velocity as it traveled through the walls of the trailer
“We’re just glad he didn’t suffer any life-threatening injuries with a head wound. He is being kept under medical observation to make sure there is no swelling of the brain.”
“Once he is able to give us a good interview, we hope to have a strong case. Already several persons of interest have developed.”
Gay flamingos adopt chick
Two gay flamingos have become proud foster parents after taking an abandoned chick under their wings.
Pink pair Carlos and Fernando were so desperate to have a family they started stealing eggs at the Wildfowl & Wetlands Trust, Slimbridge, Gloucestershire.
When one of the Greater Flamingo nests was abandoned, they were considered the number one choice to “adopt” the chick.
The unhatched egg was whisked off to an incubator where it was warmed up and monitored, reports Sky News.
After the chick was born, it was carefully placed in an old eggshell, which was taped up and returned to the gay couple’s empty nest.
The pair were soon seen ‘talking’ to the chick inside the egg and a little while later it hatched for a second time – to be greeted by its foster parents.
WWT spokeswoman Jane Waghorn said: “Fernando and Carlos are a same sex couple who have been known to steal other Flamingos’ eggs by chasing them off their nest because they wanted to rear them themselves.
“They were rather good at sitting on eggs and hatching them so last week, when a nest was abandoned, it seemed like a good idea to make them surrogate parents.”
Carlos and Fernando, who have been together for about six years, can feed their chick without any female help – by producing milk in their throat.
Hired and fired in ten minutes
Ex-soccer star Leroy Rosenior was appointed boss of a struggling club – then sacked after ten minutes.
The former West Ham and Fulham striker broke the record for English football’s shortest managerial reign after being introduced with a fanfare by Torquay United, reports The Sun.
Sports journalists were summoned to a press conference which finished at 3.30pm. Then – at 3.40pm – Leroy was told by the chairman that the Devon club had been sold to a business consortium. And that meant he was out.
Leroy, 43 said: “For it to happen ten minutes after I finished the press conference was a bit of a shock. But we had a good laugh about it afterwards.”
Leroy smashed the previous record for the shortest time as manager – Dave Bassett’s 72 hours at Crystal Palace in 1984.
He joked: “Obviously they thought I had done a fantastic job after ten minutes and let me go.”
The post was Leroy’s second stint at Torquay, who will face next season in the Conference after finishing bottom of the Football League. He was boss between 2002 and 2006 when he left by mutual consent.
Since then the club has been in a managerial crisis, with four different bosses in the hot seat.
Leroy added: “I wish them the very best of luck. They are going to sort me out a bit of compensation.”
Iraq hero puts medal on eBay
A hard-up soldier faces a court martial for trying to sell his top bravery medal on eBay.
Cpl Trevor Coult, who got a Military Cross for heroism in Iraq, said he needed the cash to support himself when he quits the Army.
But under Forces regulations, it is strictly forbidden for serving soldiers to sell medals, reports The Sun.
Top brass were furious as the Military Cross is so prestigious – with only the Victoria Cross and George Cross regarded as higher gallantry awards.
Trevor, 31, won the Cross for single-handedly defeating a suicide bomber’s ambush in Baghdad in 2005. He put four other gongs on the auction website and wanted £80,000 for the lot.
Trevor, serving in the 1st Battalion the Royal Irish Regiment, wrote: “I’m leaving the Army and need the money, otherwise wouldn’t want to sell.”
He told his furious CO he placed the ad only to see what price they could fetch. It has now been withdrawn from eBay.
The MoD said: “Action will be taken where necessary.”
As a junior NCO, single Trevor, of Belfast, earns £23,000 a year.
Tory MP and former Army officer Patrick Mercer said: “If the Government paid soldiers properly, his hand may not have been forced in this way.”
Drunk crashes car without realising
A drunk Austrian motorist woke up at a petrol station to find himself surrounded by police after smashing into a crash barrier on a motorway without realising.
The 36-year-old ploughed into the crash barrier at the side of the motorway as he drove from the German city Rosenheim to the Austrian capital Vienna.
But the car bounced off the barrier and Thom carried on driving to a nearby petrol station where he pulled over and went to sleep.
He was woken up by police who had been called out by other motorists who saw the man crash. He was given a breathalyser test and was found to be almost three times over the legal drink-drive limit.
A police spokesman said: “He was so drunk he did not even realise that he had crashed. He was very surprised when he saw the state of his car.”
Vacuum screamer
A US mother-of-three has invented a sex toy that connects to a vacuum cleaner to give an orgasm in just ten seconds.
The gadget, called Vortex Vibrations, works by concentrating the air flow to create a rapid and gentle vibration, reports the Sun.
Inventor Joanne Drysdale claims it can give multiple, back-to-back orgasms lasting up to a minute a time – and it does not even touch the skin.
The 49-year-old former toolmaker was cleaning her carpets when she came up with the idea for Vortex, which sells for £35 through lovehoney.co.uk.
She saw how a piece of rubber that had got caught in the nozzle was gently resonating in the air flow. She also felt a soft stimulation to her fingertips as she tried to remove the rubber.
At the time Joanne, from Utah, had not had sex for 15 years following her divorce.
She said: “In my attempts to alleviate frustration, I began to think what I could do. I noticed how the rubber moved in the top of the vacuum.
“After several hours, I came up with the prototype. The first time I tried it I reached an orgasm within 10 seconds.

A 10-months-old boy has successfully obtained a gun licence in the US state of Illinois.
Bubba Ludwig’s father, Howard, applied on his behalf after his grandfather gave him a shotgun as an heirloom.
Mr Ludwig said he had not expected to succeed, but he filled in the online form, paid $5 and the licence was his.
The licence includes a picture of a toothless Bubba and a squiggle that represents his best attempt at a signature.
Illinois gun laws are said to be among the strictest in the US. But Illinois State Police, who oversee the application process, said that they had followed the law in this case.
Mr Ludwig said Bubba’s gun would likely remain at his grandfather’s house until he was 14.
“I’m not about to approve any unsupervised hunting or trap shooting for Bubba,” he said. “Still, I’m glad he was able to get his FOID card. It makes an adorable addition to his baby book.”
Passengers pushed to limit
Hundreds of passengers on a train in India were asked by the driver to get out and push.
The train, in the state of Bihar in eastern India, came to a halt when a passenger pulled the emergency cord, reports Metro.
But it stopped in a ‘neutral zone’ – a small section of the track in which there’s no electrical current in the overhead wires.
The passengers were forced to get off the train and it took them half-an-hour to push it the remaining 12 feet into the powered stretch of the line.
A spokesman for Indian Railways commented: “In so many years of service in the railways, I have never come across such a bizarre incident.”
World’s most embarrassing shark attack
A Folkestone fisherman has told how the world’s most embarrassing shark attack left him with a nasty bite on his nose.
Tackle-shop owner Phil Tanner was attacked by a lesser-spotted dogfish after he reeled it in off the local pier.
He fought for five minutes to wrench the thrashing creature, a member of the shark family, off his nose, reports the Sun
Phil, 38, was left with a bloody gash and rows of tiny teethmarks round his nostrils after trying to show off his catch to pal Scott Allen.
He said: “I called out, ‘Hey mate, look at this whopper’. But somehow Scott nudged my arm and the fish catapulted itself up to my nose with its jaws wide open.
“It clamped around my nostrils and wouldn’t let go. It was agony and I was screaming. The fish didn’t just hang on, either. I could feel it chomping its teeth as if it wanted me for its last meal.
“Everyone on the pier was watching me jumping up and down with a shark hanging off my nose. People were singing the Jaws theme tune – I’ve never felt so embarrassed.”
Phil finally pulled the fish away and tended to his wound.
He added: “I probably did need stitches but I couldn’t go to the hospital because I didn’t want the doctors to laugh at me too. My mates take the mickey, but I am a shark attack victim. I could have lost my nose.”

1271,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/e-timors-new-president-sworn-in-3929709/,2007-05-20,E Timor’s new president sworn in,"
Former prime minister and Nobel Peace Prize winner Jose Ramos-Horta has been sworn in as East Timor’s new president.
Taking the oath of office in the capital, Dili, Mr Ramos-Horta vowed to work for unity and stability, urging an end to violence in the young nation.
But hours later there were clashes in Dili in which one man was killed.
The new president replaces Xanana Gusmao, who is to contest polls next month for the more powerful role of PM that Mr Ramos-Horta recently vacated.
Mr Ramos-Horta won the 9 May presidential run-off election with almost 70% of the vote, beating parliament head Francisco Guterres.
Many in East Timor hope his victory in relatively peaceful polls will bring stability to a nation struggling with severe poverty and still recovering from last year’s violent clashes.
Several people were wounded in the clashes following Sunday’s ceremony, as fighting broke out between supporters of rival political groups.
UN peacekeepers were deployed to restore order.
‘End the crisis’
The swearing-in ceremony at parliament house coincided with the fifth anniversary of East Timor’s formal independence.
East Timor broke away from 25 years of Indonesian rule in a 1999 referendum, before being run under UN protection until May 2002.
Speaking after he was sworn in, Mr Ramos-Horta promised to find “the way to end the crisis of the country”, and to tackle differences between the police and armed forces.
In May and June 2006 tensions between the two sides triggered weeks of street clashes that left more than 30 people dead and tens of thousands homeless.
Mr Ramos-Horta also appealed to young people to end a culture of clashes between street gangs.
“With vengeance and violence, we will not win over anything,” he said. “With conscience in our hearts and our minds, with books and computers, we can win.”
Mr Ramos-Horta has previously served as foreign minister. He spent years in exile leading the country’s campaign for independence from Indonesia, for which he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1996.

Quizzes and Personality Tests
Stage terminology:
These Are just amusing stage terms for those of us who actually understand them.
For those of you that don’t, this should give you a basic idea of how a play will run, and who does what… Sort of.
Eternity –
The time that passes between a dropped cue and the next line.
Prop –
A hand-carried object small enough to be lost by an actor 30 seconds before it is needed on stage.
Director –
The individual who suffers from the delusion that he or she is responsible for every moment of brilliance cited by the critic in the local review.
Blocking –
The art of moving actors on the stage in such a manner as not to collide with the walls, the furniture, the orchestra pit or each other. Similar to playing chess, except that the pawns want to argue with you.
Blocking Rehearsal –
A rehearsal taking place early in the production schedule where actors frantically write down movements which will be nowhere in evidence by opening night.
Quality Theater –
Any show with which you were directly involved.
Turkey –
Every show with which you were not directly involved.
Dress Rehearsal –
Rehearsal that becomes a whole new ball game as actors attempt to maneuver among the 49 objects that the set designer added at 7:30 that evening.
Tech Week –
The last week of rehearsal when everything that was supposed to be done weeks before finally comes together at the last minute; reaches its grand climax on dress rehearsal night when costumes rip, a dimmer pack catches fire and the director has a nervous breakdown. Also known as “hell” week.
Set –
An obstacle course which, throughout the rehearsal period, defies the laws of physics by growing smaller week by week while continuing to occupy the same amount of space.
Monologue –
That bright, shining moment when all eyes are focused on a single actor who is desperately aware that if he forgets a line, no one can save him.
Dark Night –
The night before opening when no rehearsal is scheduled so the actors and crew can go home and get some well deserved rest, and instead spend the night staring sleeplessly at the ceiling because they’re sure they needed one more rehearsal.
Bit Part –
An opportunity for the actor with the smallest role to count everybody else’s lines and mention repeatedly that he or she has the smallest part in the show.
Green Room –
Room shared by nervous actors waiting to go on stage and the precocious children whose actor parents couldn’t get a baby-sitter that night, a situation which can result in justifiable homicide.
Dark Spot –
An area of the stage which the lighting designer has inexplicably forgotten to light, and which has a magnetic attraction for the first-time actor. A dark spot is never evident before opening night.
Hands –
Appendages at the end of the arms used for manipulating one’s environment, except on a stage, where they grow six times their normal size and either dangle uselessly, fidget nervously, or try to hide in your pockets.
Stage Manager –
Individual responsible for overseeing the crew, supervising the set changes, baby-sitting the actors and putting the director in a hammerlock to keep him from killing the actor who just decided to turn his walk-on part into a major role by doing magic tricks while he serves the tea.
Lighting Director –
Individual who, from the only vantage point offering a full view of the stage, gives the stage manager a heart attack by announcing a play-by-play of everything that’s going wrong.
Makeup Kit –
(1) Among experienced community theater actors, a battered tackle box loaded with at least 10 shades of greasepaint in various stages of desiccation, tubes of lipstick and blush, assorted pencils, bobby pins, braids of crepe hair, liquid latex, old programs, jewelry, break-a-leg greeting cards from past shows, brushes and a handful of half-melted cough drops.
(2) For first-time male actors, a helpless look and anything they can borrow.
The Forebrain –
The part of an actors brain which contains lines, blocking and characterization; activated by hot lights.
The Hindbrain –
The part of an actors brain that keeps up a running subtext in the background, while the forebrain is trying to act. The hindbrain supplies a constant stream of unwanted information. Such as who is sitting in the second row tonight, a notation to seriously maim the crew member who thought it would be funny to put real Tabasco sauce in the fake Bloody Marys, or the fact that you need to do laundry on Sunday.
Stage Crew –
Group of individuals who spend their evenings coping with 50-minute stretches of total boredom interspersed with 30-second bursts of mindless panic.
Message Play –
Any play which its director describes as “worthwhile,” “a challenge to actors and audience alike,” or “designed to make the audiencethink.” Critics will be impressed both by the daring material and the roomy accommodations, since they’re likely to have the house all to themselves.
Bedroom Farce –
Any play which requires various states of undress on stage and whose set sports a lot of doors. The lukewarm reviews, all of which feature the phrase “typical community theater fare” in the opening paragraph, are followed paradoxically by a frantic attempt to schedule more performances to accommodate the overflow crowds.
Assistant Director –
Individual willing to undertake special projects that nobody else would take on a bet, such as working one-on one with the brain-dead actor whom the rest of the cast has threatened to take out a contract on.
Set Piece –
Any large piece of furniture which actors will resolutely use as a safety shield between themselves and the audience, in an apparent attempt to both anchor themselves to the floor, thereby avoiding floating off into space, and to keep the audience from seeing that they actually have legs.
Strike –
The time immediately following the last performance while all cast and crew members are required to stay and dismantle (or watch the two people who own Makita screw drivers) dismantle the set.
Actors (As defined by a set designer) –
People who stand between the audience and the set designer’s art, blocking the view. That’s also the origin of the word “blocking,” by the way.
Stage Right, Stage Left –
Two simple directions actors pretend not to understand in order to drive directors crazy. (“No, no, your OTHER stage right!”)

And don’t forget, still looking for questions folks!

1273,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/teachers-stage-fake-gunman-attack-on-sixth-graders-3929707/,2007-05-16,Teachers stage fake gunman attack on sixth-graders,"
MURFREESBORO, Tennessee (AP) — Staff members of an elementary school staged a fictitious gun attack on students during a class trip, telling them it was not a drill as the children cried and hid under tables.
The mock attack Thursday night was intended as a learning experience and lasted five minutes during the weeklong trip to a state park, said Scales Elementary School Assistant Principal Don Bartch, who led the trip.
“We got together and discussed what we would have done in a real situation,” he said.
But parents of the sixth-grade students were outraged.
“The children were in that room in the dark, begging for their lives, because they thought there was someone with a gun after them,” said Brandy Cole, whose son went on the trip.
Some parents said they were upset by the staff’s poor judgment in light of the April 16 shootings at Virginia Tech that left 33 students and professors dead, including the gunman.
During the last night of the trip, staff members convinced the 69 students that there was a gunman on the loose. They were told to lie on the floor or hide underneath tables and stay quiet. A teacher, disguised in a hooded sweat shirt, even pulled on a locked door.
After the lights went out, about 20 kids started to cry, 11-year-old Shay Naylor said.
“I was like, ‘Oh My God,’ ” she said. “At first I thought I was going to die. We flipped out.”
Principal Catherine Stephens declined to say whether the staff members involved would face disciplinary action, but said the situation “involved poor judgment.”

And the question is:
Who on Earth thought that this was a good idea in any way, shape or form?  Why would someone do something like this at any time?
I can see the logic in teaching the children what to do in such a situation, but is this really the best way to do so?

Yup, I’ve decided to take part.  I’m used to writing scripts like this anyway, but college and the scriptwriting course I did 2 years ago have all but drummed that out of me.  It’ll be fun to just let my imagination go and write, for once.

Went to a bar after the union shut a couple of weeks ago.  Just before closing time I headed to the toilet.  By the time I got out the door had been locked and the landlord wouldn’t let me out.

Diving is a serious issue in football.  There are different ideas of how it should be dealt with.  Personally, I think Mr T has the right idea:

50 things to do in an elevator:
#  Make race car noises when anyone gets on or off.
# Blow your nose and offer to show the contents of your kleenex to other passengers.
# Grimace painfully while smacking your forehead and muttering: Shut up, dammit, all of you just shut UP!
# Whistle the first seven notes of It’s a Small World incessantly.
# Sell Girl Scout cookies.
# On a long ride, sway side to side at the natural frequency of the elevator.
# Shave.
# Crack open your briefcase or purse, and while peering inside ask: Got enough air in there?
# Offer name tags to everyone getting on the elevator. Wear yours upside-down.
# Stand silent and motionless in the corner, facing the wall, without getting off.
# When arriving at your floor, grunt and strain to yank the doors open, then act embarrassed when they open by themselves.
# Lean over to another passenger and whisper: Noogie patrol coming!
# Greet everyone getting on the elevator with a warm handshake and ask them to call you Admiral.
# Censored by your son.
# On the highest floor, hold the door open and demand that it stay open until you hear the penny you dropped down the shaft go plink at the bottom.
# Do Tai Chi exercises.
# Stare, grinning, at another passenger for a while, and then announce: I’ve got new socks on!
# When at least 8 people have boarded, moan from the back: Oh, not now, damn motion sickness!
# Give religious tracts to each passenger.
# Meow occassionally.
# Bet the other passengers you can fit a quarter in your nose.
# Frown and mutter gotta go, gotta go then sigh and say oops!
# Show other passengers a wound and ask if it looks infected.
# Sing Mary had a little lamb while continually pushing buttons.
# Holler Chutes away! whenever the elevator descends.
# Walk on with a cooler that says human head on the side.
# Stare at another passenger for a while, then announce You’re one of THEM! and move to the far corner of the elevator.
# Burp, and then say mmmm…tasty!
# Leave a box between the doors.
# Ask each passenger getting on if you can push the button for them.
# Wear a puppet on your hand and talk to other passengers through it.
# Start a sing-along.
# When the elevator is silent, look around and ask is that your beeper?
# Play the harmonica.
# Shadow box.
# Say Ding! at each floor.
# Lean against the button panel.
# Say I wonder what all these do and push the red buttons.
# Listen to the elevator walls with a stethoscope.
# Draw a little square on the floor with chalk and announce to the other passengers that this is your personal space.
# Bring a chair along.
# Take a bite of a sandwich and ask another passenger: Wanna see wha in muh mouf?
# Blow spit bubbles.
# Pull your gum out of your mouth in long strings.
# Announce in a demonic voice: I must find a more suitable host body.
# Carry a blanket and clutch it protectively.
# Make explosion noises when anyone presses a button.
# Wear X-Ray Specs and leer suggestively at other passengers.
# Stare at your thumb and say I think it’s getting larger.
# If anyone brushes against you, recoil and holler Bad touch!

1277,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/east-timor-prepares-for-election-3929703/,2007-05-07,East Timor prepares for election,"
The people of East Timor are gearing up to vote in a run-off presidential election to decide who will replace outgoing leader Xanana Gusmao.
Their choice is between interim Prime Minister Jose Ramos-Horta and ruling party candidate Francisco Guterres.
No candidate won an outright majority in the first round last month.
That vote was the first since East Timor gained full independence in 2002 following its bloody separation from Indonesia in 1999.
Despite fears of violence, the run-up to Wednesday’s poll has been peaceful, with both candidates pledging to accept the result.
Past violence
Most analysts see Mr Ramos-Horta – a Nobel Peace Prize winner – as the favourite, especially because most of the six losing candidates in the first round are urging their supporters to back him.
But Mr Guterres remains a strong contender, and is backed by the ruling political party Fretilin, which was the political party of the former armed resistance movement and still has strong support across the country.
President Gusmao has appealed for unity and peace.
He did not want to contest another term as president, and is instead putting himself up as a candidate for the more powerful post of prime minister, in parliamentary elections which will take place in June.
Many people in East Timor hope these elections will bring an end to the political tension and instability that has blighted the young country.
Last summer, more than 30 people were killed, and thousands displaced, in clashes between rival military factions.

1280,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/general-denies-e-timor-violations-3929700/,2007-05-04,General denies E Timor violations,"

The former Indonesian military chief has told an investigation there were no gross violations of human rights ahead of East Timor’s independence vote.
Gen Wiranto was appearing before the Truth and Friendship Commission in Indonesia’s capital, Jakarta.
He denied any links to militia involved in violence that left more than 1,000 people dead and hundreds of thousands displaced in 1999.
The commission was set up two years ago to heal and to establish the truth.
It does not have the power to prosecute but can recommend amnesties for those who appear before it.
East Timor voted for independence from the country that had occupied it for 24 years.
‘Ordinary crimes’
The BBC’s Lucy Williamson, in Jakarta, says Gen Wiranto is the most senior military official to appear before the commission and the room was packed with those who had come to hear his testimony.
He told the panel of judges that what happened in East Timor was not a gross human rights violation but rather a collection of ordinary crimes.
He denied any responsibility for any crimes committed by those under his command, saying that each individual soldier should be held accountable for his or her actions.
“The ad hoc human rights court has spent time and energy and it was clearly proven that there were no gross violations of human rights,” he said.
Gen Wiranto, who wants to be Indonesia’s next president, said the violence remained after independence.
“The pattern was similar to 1999 and that prompted them to invite the UN police.”
The general also criticised the UN for giving Indonesia responsibility for security for the independence referendum.
“We were placed in a very difficult position,” he said.
Gen Wiranto said of the militias that sparked much of the violence: “They were not formed, nor funded, nor equipped by the military and there was no structural control of these groups.”
The 10-member commission has sat in a number of cities listening to testimony.
But our correspondent says it has been criticised by some human rights groups for being a poor replacement for a judicial process.

By Monica Chadha
BBC News, Mumbai
Residents of the Indian city of Mumbai (Bombay) are wondering how long it will take to remove a disused Boeing 737 that has been abandoned in a busy road.
The decommissioned aircraft was being driven through the city at the weekend when the driver got lost and then abandoned the plane.
The Boeing used to belong to the private company Air Sahara.
Some locals are angry that no action is being taken to move the plane. Others say it is a tourist attraction.
It appears that after taking a wrong turn, the driver found himself facing a flyover that was too low for him to take the plane under.
The driver has not been seen since and no-one is assuming responsibility for the 737.
Sunday surprise
Restaurant owner Ramji Thapar is one of the puzzled residents of the Chembur area of the city.
He woke up Sunday morning to find the aircraft on a giant trailer abandoned on the road.
“Saturday night I shut shop and go home and everything is fine,” he told the BBC news website.
“Sunday morning when I get here, this aircraft is here near my restaurant!”
The fuselage of the decommissioned aircraft, with the engine, wings and tail removed, was being taken by road to the capital Delhi late on Saturday night.
Reports say it was supposed to be used at a flight training academy.
The plane has become the centre of attraction with people coming from all over the city to take a look.
“I’ve been fascinated with planes and never seen one so closely,” engineering student Vamsi Shastri said. “It’s huge!”
His friend Ankur Rane said, “It’s fascinating to see an airplane on the roads when one is only used to seeing cars and auto rickshaws.”
No joke
However, for Pradeep Malhotra, who runs a catering service in the area, the plane has become a huge problem because it is parked right in front of his shop.
“My work is suffering because the food cannot be loaded in the big vehicles,” he said.
“I have to load it in the smaller vans and then carry them to the bigger ones parked at the back.
“I don’t know how they are going to take it out because you can’t reverse it, its too big, and you can’t go further down the road.”
Some residents said they had not complained simply because they assumed that the authorities would be making it a priority to get the plane out of the city.
Five days on, it is still not clear who is responsible for the aircraft and its transfer to Delhi.

Student arrested for essay’s imaginary violence
CARY, Illinois (AP) — A high school senior was arrested after writing that “it would be funny” to dream about opening fire in a building and having sex with the dead victims, authorities said.
Another passage in the essay advised his teacher at Cary-Grove High School: “don’t be surprised on inspiring the first CG shooting,” according to a criminal complaint filed this week.
Allen Lee, 18, faces two disorderly conduct charges over the creative-writing assignment, which he was given on Monday in English class at the northern Illinois school.
Students were told to “write whatever comes to your mind. Do not judge or censor what you are writing,” according to a copy of the assignment.
According to the complaint, Lee’s essay reads in part, “Blood, sex and booze. Drugs, drugs, drugs are fun. Stab, stab, stab, stab, stab, s…t…a…b…puke. So I had this dream last night where I went into a building, pulled out two P90s and started shooting everyone, then had sex with the dead bodies. Well, not really, but it would be funny if I did.”
Officials described the essay as disturbing and inappropriate.
Lee said he was just following the directions.
“In creative writing, you’re told to exaggerate,” Lee said. “It was supposed to be just junk. … There definitely is violent content, but they’re taking it out of context and making it something it isn’t.”
Lee was moved to an off-campus learning program, and the district was evaluating a punishment, schools spokesman Jeff Puma said.
“It wasn’t just violent or foul language,” Puma said. “It went beyond that.”
The teenager’s father, Albert Lee, has defended his son as a straight-A student who was just following instructions and contends the school overreacted. But he has also said he understands that the situation arose in the week after a Virginia Tech student gunned down 32 people before committing suicide.
Defense attorney Dane Loizzo said Allen Lee has never been disciplined in school and signed Marine enlistment papers last week.
A conviction could bring up to 30 days in jail and a maximum $1,500 fine.

So, for various reasons, my hair has grown quite long.  Was thinking about buzz cutting it again, but people keep telling me that it looks quite good the length it is.  So, I thought I’d see what you lot think.

Hair long… (sorry about the relative crapness of the pic)

…or hair short?
(If I do decide to have my hair long, I will be cutting out the blond bits.)
Also, don’t let anyone tell you differently, this is the goal of the season.

Entry for ODAA
*lights up cigarette*
It all started on April 9th 2000.  I was in the university library, supposedly working on some assignment or other.  So, of course, I was doing nothing of the sort.
I was messing about online.  I tried looking up bored.com, just to see what happened, then looked through the links it provided.  And there was one for something called open diary.  I clicked on it.
I was taken to a site that hosted online diaries.  I looked through a few and thought “I’ll sign up.”
That was the start.
I wrote a few entries and got some readers.  I started reading their diaries and pretty soon I actually had a favourites list.
But I still thought I had it under control.
*stubs out cigarette and lights another*
Then the surveys started.  And then I discovered the different circles the site had to offer.  Then the interactive entries.  The Peoples Interview, to celebrate every 100 entries.  The Quote Comp.  The Trivia Comp.  Interactive Create-A-Surveys.
But I still thought, it’s not a problem.
Pretty soon, the site was amongst the first I would check every day.  Not long after that, it did become the first.  I started a host of different diaries, for different things.  Still, I convinced myself I wasn’t hooked.
I tried different diary sites.  I even tried starting my own blog.  But OD, like the sirens on Odysseus, kept luring me back.
Still, I convinced myself that I did not have a problem.  Sure, there were some things I’d rather talk/ask advice about here than ask a real life friend, but that’s only natural, isn’t it?
Then I was left with on internet access for a while.  Didn’t mind not being able to check my email.  It was not being able to check OD.  Check my notes, read entries made by my favourites.
That’s when I realised it had happened.
My name is William Forbes, and I’m an ODaholic.
But you know what?
*stubs out cigarette*
If being an ODaholic is wrong, I don’t want to be right.

Yup thought it might be time to let you know the answers to this thing.  So, here we go:
1) Eccentricity, Telephone, Religious Cult
Slightly worried that no-one got this (seeing as quite a few of my favourites are fans) but it was Dr Who.
2) Writer, Masturbation Scene, Horticulture
Again, no guesses for the genius that is Adaptation.
3) Experiment Gone Wrong, Irreverent, Milk
Hat tip to shesolovely for correctly recognising A Clockwork Orange
4) Steampunk, Gun Nut, Warrior Woman
And, yet again, no guesses.  This is the very short lived Firefly.
5) Deja Vu, Caught Masturbating, Elephant
shesolovely and Peter_24601 both correctly said that this is Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind.
6) Locker, 8 Track, Fall From Height
And again, no guesses.  This time it was Get Shorty.
7) Bad Poetry, Whale, # Diner 
Krud will be glad to know that no-one will be sued as both he and shesolovely correctly guessed that this is The Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy.
8) Policeman, Sex, Dance
Not surprised that there were no guesses for this one as it’s kinda obscure (but brilliant).  It is The Happiness Of The Kakaturis.
9) Oral Sex, Stabbed Through Chin, Monitor  
Peter_24601 did take a stab at this one guessing Basic Instinct.  Unfortunatly, the correct answer is Ichi The Killer.
10) Slit Throat, Vacuum, Bickering
Already kinda had this.  It’s the film based on number 4, Serenity.

Apr 27 2007
By Will Sutton, Evening Gazette
A church organist was found dead at his Teesside home naked inside a giant plastic bag.
Ian Kemp, 48, from Stockton, was found alone in his house bound by his wrists and shins, an inquest heard.
A vacuum cleaner was also connected to the bag and it is believed Mr Kemp died after the machine had sucked all the air out of the bag.
The inquest heard there were no suspicious circumstances but Teesside Coroner Michael Sheffield said such incidents were sometimes connected to sexual gratification.
Mr Kemp, the organist at Hardwick Baptist Church, was found by family friend Vivienne Brand on January 26. He had lived alone since the death of his mother.
Detective Inspector David Turnbull of Cleveland Police told the inquest he was called to the house in Evenwood Close at 10.40pm that night.
He said: “I saw the body of a small naked man lying inside a large plastic bag in the foetal position.”
DI Turnbull said Mr Kemp’s legs were tied at the shins by brown parcel tape and his wrists were tied together by a silver chain.
Teesside Coroners Court heard the vacuum cleaner was attached to the plastic bag and was switched on when the body was found.
Det Insp Turnbull added: “There was a roll of parcel tape nearby.”
He described how Mr Kemp’s friend switched off the vacuum and the body was taken to North Tees University Hospital.
Home Office pathologist Dr Peter Cooper gave the cause of death as suffocation. He said: “I do not see how he could have been forced into that position.”
Toxicology tests showed Mr Kemp had not taken any alcohol or drugs.
Teesside Coroner Michael Sheffield said: “Mr Kemp was well thought of and a well-liked man. He was involved with the Baptist Church.
“It was clear that Ian Kemp placed himself inside the bag, using the chains and the binding on his legs.
“The vacuum cleaner sucked the air out of the bag and he died of suffocation. There were no signs he intended to end his life.
“It can be done for some form of sexual gratification but it’s not clear what Mr Kemp’s intentions were.”
Mr Sheffield recorded an open verdict. The inquest heard that evidence of identification had been provided by Mr Kemp’s cousin, Melville Chisnall.
Philip Tait, Minister at Hardwick Baptist Church, today paid tribute to Mr Kemp, who had been a member of the church for 26 years.
“He was a friendly man, a kindly man, always ready to give a helping hand,” he said. “He never married, and cared for his elderly mother for some years – if he felt that to be a burden, he never said so to me.”
The minister said Mr Kemp’s greatest contribution to the life of the church was through his music.
“He was a self-taught amateur, but one of the best church organists I have ever heard,” he said.
“What makes a good organist is not what he does in the hymns, but what he plays and how he plays when there is no set music. On that scale, Ian scored very highly indeed.
“He would play exactly the right piece, relevant to the service and appropriate to the point in the service. After the service he used to go on playing, which he loved to do. Or his friends would gather round the organ to speak with him.”
Mr Kemp’s organ is now kept in the church and used in services as a way of remembering him, he added.

Iran: A nation of nose jobs, not nuclear war
By PETER HITCHENS
For years we in the West have been looking for a new Evil Empire to fill the gap left when Russia – a genuine threat – retired from the job and deprived us of an enemy. What were all those spies to do? How could we justify those missiles and bombs? What should we be scared of now?
At one stage we were reduced to pretending that Panama’s General Noriega was a menace to our way of life. Then it was Slobodan Milosevic. Finally, we inflated the piffling Saddam Hussein into a looming Hitler.
Now the same experts think they have found something to be afraid of in Iran. It is tempting to believe them. This is the land of the glowering ayatollahs, the book-burning mobs, the fatwas of death and the black chador. And Iran has just become even more frightening because in its secret vaults Islamic scientists are fumbling with atoms and testing long-range rockets.
Such is our terror of this mysterious land that Navy bluejackets and Royal Marines seem to have thought they were in the hands of cannibal dervishes when they were captured by them, quailing at the thought of rape, torture and death. Even now, having been subtly humiliated instead of butchered, they do not seem to have grasped that things might not be as they seem. Nor have many of us.
When I told my friends and family I was going to Tehran, they looked at me as if I were taking a short break in Mordor, and expected that the next time they saw me I would be being paraded by Revolutionary Guards after confessing to espionage, and then publicly hanged from a large crane at a busy traffic intersection.
Well, not quite. The people of Iran are probably the most pro-Western in the world, though that will not stop them fighting like hell if we are foolish enough to attack them. Not that they will do so with nuclear weapons any time soon. Iran is rather bad at grand projects. Its sole nuclear power station has never produced a watt of electricity in more than three decades, the capital’s TV tower is unfinished after 20 years of work and Tehran’s airport took 30 years to build.
By bringing this information back to you I expect to annoy the frowning mullahs, who want their people to fear us as much as George W. Bush and Anthony Blair want us to fear Iran. That is why they constantly tease us about their inadequate nuclear programme. They long for our rage and threats.
Again and again, Iranians told me Western hostility was the main force that could push them into the arms of a regime they did not much like. The last thing the ayatollahs need is for the peoples of Europe and America to know much about their country and its people, or to realise the truth – that Iran is our natural ally in the Middle East, a European civilisation trapped by history and geography in the midst of Arabia. It does not belong there, culturally or religiously.
We treat Turkey like a brother, when it is a militant Islamic state kept secular only by a disguised military dictatorship. And we treat Iran like a pariah, when it’s a largely secular nation kept Islamic only by an ageing and discredited, but open, despotism.
In the past ten days I have travelled across beautiful, hospitable Persia and talked to many of its people, unsupervised, unmonitored and unofficially. I have been inside private homes and found out what Iranian people think and why. I have met citizens who voted for President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, citizens who now wish they hadn’t and those who think he is a sick joke.
I have sat among hot-eyed zealots at Friday prayers in Tehran as they chanted ‘Death to England’. I have seen the melodramatic anti-aircraft defences round the nuclear plant at Natanz. I have met supporters of the regime and endangered, persecuted dissenters, as well as plenty in between. I am under no illusions about how barbaric the government can be to those who challenge it openly in the Press or other public forums. But I think its power is waning, and can be kept alive only if we are fool enough to fall for the propaganda of the people who brought us the Iraq War.
I have tried to understand the sweet, sad mystery of Iran’s unique brand of Islam, quite unlike the hard, aggressive faith found in the Arab lands. I have touched the silver bars of the holiest shrine in the country, as the pious crowds thronged around it, many crying out in ecstasy that they have reached this sacred place. I suspect these scenes are the closest I shall come to what English pilgrims to Canterbury must once have known.
I have heard the hundredfold ‘thwack’ as prayer carpets were unrolled across enormous, majestic courtyards and watched the faithful at their evening devotions beneath gold domes and among some of the loveliest architecture on the planet. I have also talked to those who enjoy the illicit thrill of drinking whisky in an Islamic republic whose soldiers still spend hours smashing smuggled cargoes of alcohol. I have observed the cunning efforts of Iran’s women to subvert and mock the ridiculous dress codes forced on them by silly old men. I have seen how many others choose to follow rules of modesty they personally believe in.
I have been told unprintably rude jokes about the late Ayatollah Khomeini. And I have been kissed on both cheeks by a hairy mullah in the holy city of Qom.
Let me begin in Tehran, Iran’s colossal, ugly and charming capital city, which contains two wholly different nations within its ever-expanding boundaries. This is a very young city in a very youthful country. About 40 per cent of Iran’s 70million people are 15 years old or younger, and in Tehran the concentration of the young is even greater.
Grinding along its clogged, modern streets where buildings are the colour of porridge or a sort of dirty custard-yellow, you see plenty of evidence of the horrible, murderous revolution that shocked the world in 1979. Portraits of Khomeini and of other religious leaders are everywhere. So are anti-American murals – the most striking is a US flag in which the stripes are the slipstreams of falling bombs and the stars are replaced by skulls.
On the walls of the long-deserted US Embassy, site of the kidnap of dozens of diplomats, slogans in English and Persian still promise to inflict a great defeat on America. Perhaps that promise has now been fulfilled in Iraq, a few hundred miles away, where American arms have suffered their greatest catastrophe since Vietnam – though the White House does not seem to know it yet.
But these things are old, flaking, faded and largely ignored by the people. They have other things on their minds – mainly private life.
In a bustling restaurant in north Tehran, where Iran’s wealthy middle classes live, it is obvious that Islamic dress has been forced on the many women present and that they are determined to let everyone know it is not their choice. Personally, I found Tehran much less oppressively Islamic than Kensington High Street in London, where an ever-growing number of women voluntarily go about in black shrouds, masks and veils.
This is not some medieval theocracy where females are hidden away or forced to do the will of their menfolk. Men and women sit in animated mixed groups at the lunch tables, conversing as equals. Headscarves are worn. It is still the absolute law. But they are worn in such a way as to make a fool of that law. They are pushed back as far as they can go without actually falling off, held in place by no more than a blast of hairspray, revealing the front parts of elaborate and often vertical hairstyles – frequently blonde.
In a park by a lake, some teenage girls are splashing each other. Incredibly, several of them have illegally taken off their headscarves. Even more incredibly, their teachers pretend not to notice. This would have been unthinkable a year ago. What unthinkable things will be happening a year hence?
Everyone knows next month there will be the annual ritual crackdown, when the police will reprimand thousands of women for defying the official code. And everyone knows that, once it is over, scarves will creep back a little further and heels will get a little higher.
On the streets the women walk and stand like Parisians. Somehow, with a belt here and an adjustment there, they manage to make the modest ‘manteau’ jackets look chic. They laugh and chatter. The days when public laughter was a criminal offence are long gone.
About one in 50 seems to have had recent plastic surgery on her nose. They wear their bandages with pride and some even stick plaster on their faces to pretend that they have undergone this subversive surgery.
The desire among lovely Persian women to look like Snow White is strange but it is a direct reaction to authority’s attempts to make them look like bats and crows.
The fashionable cafes are full of painted, un-Islamic butterflies, sipping milkshakes or coffee. The upstairs rooms are reserved – by common consent – for couples to meet away from the intrusive eyes of their families.
In the evenings, cinemas are popular places for some mild canoodling, though it is unlikely to go further than a Fifties-style kiss. But there is plenty of extramarital and illicit sex in Iran, some of it licensed by the Islamic authorities who permit highly dubious ‘temporary marriages’. Among the rich, operations for ‘revirginisation’ are quite common before marriage, and contraceptives, once prohibited, are now freely on sale. Prostitutes patrol the night streets. I point this out not because I am specially glad about it, but to show how morals enforced from on high will fail if they do not have real popular support.
But travel in the smooth, modern metro down to poor south Tehran and you will find many more black veils and chadors, and many more beards and ringed fingers, the usual signs of serious Islam and support for the regime. For it is the poor who have largely benefited from the revolution, which gave them state jobs and good schools.
Even here, things are not quite what they seem. My guide in this part of the city was Reza, who is now unemployed thanks to the mullahs’ mismanagement of what ought to be a fabulously rich oil and gas economy. Reza recalls wryly: ‘When I was four, Ayatollah Khomeini came to my school and blessed me. It’s been downhill ever since – everything just gets worse. I’ve even gone prematurely bald where the old man put his hand on my head.’
In his part of town, there is often more fervour for football than for Islam.
Reza cannot hide his distaste when we go together to the great shrine to Khomeini, a few miles out of the city. This is a startlingly shabby place – and far from busy.
Its only charm is that the Ayatollah apparently willed that it should be a place of relaxation, so small children are allowed to run around and even play football close to the old man’s tomb. On the motorway that leads to it, speed cameras alternate with signboards bearing quotations from the Koran.
On the anniversary of the Ayatollah’s death, great crowds gather round the shrine in a strange celebration – half holiday, half memorial service. Stallholders sell mementoes and you might think they are keen on the Ayatollah’s memory. But an Iranian-American friend recalls how he once tried to buy some Khomeini clocks to take home.
The salesman became suspicious. ‘You’re American, aren’t you?’ he asked the returning exile. ‘Yes, I am,’ the Iranian-American replied. ‘What of it?’ He thought the merchant was an admirer of the one-time supreme ruler and expected to be upbraided for being irreverent. But no. The clock-seller asked him: ‘Then why on earth do you want to buy so many pictures of this ****hole?’ Both exploded in relieved laughter.
Things are quite different at another nearby shrine, a shocking, city-sized cemetery for the young men who died in the terrible war with Saddam Hussein’s Iraq. Each shaded tomb is decorated with a touching portrait of a very young man (some of the volunteers who marched into minefields or poison gas were as young as 11).
Suddenly Reza is not cynical. He shows me a grave that is said to be always wet (with tears?) and to smell permanently of rosewater. I think Reza wishes to believe in this miracle, even if he couldn’t give a dried apricot for the rest of the official myths.
This war, which most Iranians regard as at least partly the doing of the West, ended in 1988. It is shamelessly used by the regime to create a sort of unity between the revolutionary government and the people.
It cannot last for ever. This year, for the first time, a comedy film was made about the war – reverence is beginning to fade. And so is the revolution’s claim to have made life better, which is untrue for so many.
People are encouraged to visit the Shah’s old palace, with its vulgar chandeliers, decaying tennis courts and enormous bedrooms, so that they can look on his opulent living quarters and rejoice that he was brought down. The Khomeini state has wittily sawn down a large statue of the monarch that used to stand here, leaving only his boots behind.
But people such as Reza have the wrong reaction when they come here. They walk around muttering that the Shah cannot have been that bad and become madly nostalgic for his reign, which was, in fact, notorious for corruption, secret-police savagery and wild incompetence.
The more the Islamic Republic tells them to loathe the Shah or America, the more they yearn to have the Shah back, and to live in America. In this country, America is probably more popular, even now, than in any other country on the planet.
Some people here, the Westernised intellectuals, have always despised a regime they see as backward and stupid. It is gospel among them that Khomeini was not specially clever. They refer scornfully to the regime’s supporters – usually poor state employees or tradesmen – as ‘Hizbollah’. Women who wish to join the West’s drive for sexual equality also loathe the state and are loathed back. One woman I met had been arrested for her feminist views and is now facing trial. Her likely fate is a suspended prison sentence, which will be imposed if she steps out of line again.
But such people are always dissenters. To seek a more representative view, I took the clean, comfortable sleeper train 500 miles east to the shrine city of Mashhad, near the Afghan border, where I met many devout but open-minded and tolerant Iranians.
In some houses, the women stayed covered at all times and I could not even shake hands with them, bowing instead. In others, they dressed and acted like Westerners. It was clear that public opinion exists and matters here. I asked about the gruesome public hangings. My neighbour at the dinner table explained: ‘At the beginning of the revolution these sorts of things, public hangings and floggings and the amputation of limbs, were common. But people didn’t like them. They do sometimes hang mass killers or child molesters but if they announced the public hanging of an ordinary murderer, people would stay away to show their disapproval.’
Remember, this is a country that does have elections and those elections don’t always go according to plan, despite ruthless official rigging. I asked those present if they had supported Ahmadinejad in the presidential poll. All hands but one went up. Would they do so again? No hands went up. By the way, the women dominated this conversation.
‘We were hoping he would be different,’ one said in justification. This kind of hope that something or someone will turn up is at the heart of Iran’s Shia Islam, a religion of mourning and loss, whose adherents still feel woe over the defeat and murder of the three great Imams, Ali, Hossein and Reza.
These martyrdoms took place 1,300 years ago but are still grieved over, especially at the shrine in Mashhad where Reza’s tomb lies. The real zealots mark this each year by beating themselves bloody with chains and slashing their scalps with swords. It is rumoured that people die at these events.
In a belief rather like the ancient British one that King Arthur will one day come back and save his people, Shias constantly await the return of the ‘hidden Imam’, who disappeared in 878 AD, and may reappear at any time, with Jesus at his side, to restore peace and goodness to the world. I know how this sounds in cold print, but even the modest 39 Articles of the Church of England look pretty extravagant when seen from the outside.
It would be hard for anyone to see the devotion of the pilgrims at Mashhad and not come away respecting the force of this faith, which is a living, normal thing among Iranians, as natural a part of their lives as the low passions of football and the Lottery are in ours. Who is to say they do not have the better part of the bargain? I have never been anywhere with such a sense of generous hospitality and consideration to strangers.
At the evening prayers, the sense of deep human emotion is electric. But it is important to realise Sunni Islam, the great majority of the Muslim world, regards Shia Islam as a serious, idolatrous heresy, much as Ian Paisley regards the Pope and all his works.
The austere brand of Islam favoured in Saudi Arabia is specially displeased by the Shia love of relics and glitter. When Iranian Shias go to Mecca, they are said to be treated with cold hostility. The only Shia beloved in the Sunni world is President Ahmadinejad, whose noisy, disreputable hostility to Israel and whose support for Holocaust denial has made him the taxi-drivers’ favourite in every Sunni Muslim country from Indonesia to Morocco.
Which brings me to Friday prayers in Tehran, the weekly festival of loathing for the West that takes place in a hangar-like building in the university. Many of the thousands who attend are bussed in, and one of them, a soldier in uniform, confessed to a friend of mine that if he didn’t bellow ‘Death to America!’ at the appropriate moment he wouldn’t eat that day. A middle-ranking mullah presides, starting with a sermon on family values, and then moving on to political matters.
His message is interesting. Shia and Sunni Muslims, he urges, must forget their differences. Wicked England has been seeking to divide the two branches of Islam for centuries. There is a general belief that British spies are behind everything in Iran. It sounds funny, but it isn’t. It dates partly from the 19th Century when, with guile and bribes, British agents controlled the south of the country, hoping to keep the western borders of the Indian Empire safe.
But more recently, it results from our involvement in a 1953 coup against Iran’s most beloved modern leader, Mohammed Mossadeq. This cynical and short-sighted action was designed to stop Iran getting a bigger share of the proceeds from its own oilfields, then owned by BP, so that we could spend the money instead on our expensive new welfare state. 
A British MI6 man called Monty Woodhouse (later Tory MP for Oxford) and the CIA’s Kermit Roosevelt (grandson of President Teddy) bribed newspapers, paid mobs and suborned soldiers and police to overthrow Mossadeq. (Details of this have actually been published by the CIA.) They succeeded. But bitter memories of that event lay behind much of the savagery of the 1979 revolution, in which anyone who might have been an ally of the West was ruthlessly imprisoned or murdered.
At the end of this renewed denunciation – which I think reveals the mullahs’ determination to keep Iran away from its natural friends in the West – a cheerleader urged the seated crowd into cries of ‘Marg Bar Amrika’ (Death to America!) and ‘Marg bar Angeleez’ (Death to England!). The shouts sounded listless and perfunctory to me, a duty done rather than the passion I had seen at Mashhad.
My next destination was the tomb of the poet Hafez in Shiraz – until the revolution, a centre of wine-growing, appropriately enough, for Hafez writes about love and wine. His verses are revered by the Persian people and much distrusted by the Islamic authorities, yet he is too great to be suppressed.
I fell into conversation with two women. They said the schools taught that Hafez’s references to love were about the love of religion, and that when he spoke about the joys of wine they should know that prayer had the same effect as wine. ‘How would they know if prayer was like wine, since they aren’t allowed to drink?’ I asked them, and the two giggled. They hadn’t thought of asking that. But they will next time.
A few miles away are the great ruins of Persepolis, a historical monument equal to the Pyramids. The ruins were dug out of the sand only 150 years ago, and there are strong rumours that the Ayatollahs wanted to destroy this inconvenient proof that Persian civilisation existed long before Islam. Fortunately, they did not.
I went on to the glorious city of Esfahan, a treasure-house of art and architecture that would be on every tourist itinerary were it in Europe. In the great square, I was accosted by several Iranians anxious to talk. I met two contrasting groups of schoolgirls. One group, all equipped with the coolest possible mobile phones, were deeply worried. One said: ‘We are all sure there will be war with the West this summer.’ This is specially frightening here, since the city hosts one of Iran’s nuclear sites.
The other trio – one severely veiled, one more adventurous and one positively brazen with inches of hair exposed – were angered by Western threats of sanctions and worse. ‘The more you threaten us,’ the severe one said, ‘the more we will rally round our government and the closer we will be to them.’ In this they echoed almost every conversation I had had in Iran.
As one veteran of the Iran-Iraq War had said: ‘If you had come here before the Iraq invasion, lots of us would have said, ‘Please, come and invade us, come and save us.’ America was the most popular country in Iran then. But we have seen what liberation has brought to Iraq and Afghanistan, and if you came now we would certainly fight, not like the Iraqis, but from the very start.’
On the road north to Tehran, I passed close to Natanz, the supposed centre of Iran’s atomic programme. Natanz is an attractive town, where it would have been pleasant to stop for a glass of tea. I chose not to, to avoid any suggestion of spying. But a few miles north, the government had provided spectacular evidence of its warlike posture. On either side of the busy public road, anti-aircraft guns pointed at the sky.
It was as if, where the M4 runs reasonably close to the Aldermaston nuclear weapons plant, the British Army had installed flak batteries. As a military precaution against modern jets, they would be useless. But they help create the atmosphere of tension that keeps the ayatollahs and the people side by side, and so keeps Iran and the West apart.
My final destination was the holy city of Qom, where the ideas of the 1979 revolution were born. I had expected something dark and oppressive. Instead, I found a kind of Shia Blackpool, brightly lit streets full of busy shops selling cut-price Korans and also the local delicacy, a sweet pistachio nut brittle. Iranians, like our own forefathers, see nothing strange in mixing pleasure and faith.
Mullahs patrolled every street. If you watched a corner, a mullah would come round it, brown-robed and turbaned. There were mullahs upright on motorbikes, mullahs surging off buses or clambering on to them, mullahs with briefcases.
The only dark place was a painfully moving war cemetery at the gates of the shrine, paved with gravestones and walled with propaganda posters.
Beyond, the shrine glittered with gold and polished mirrors, floodlit and sparkling merrily in the night. And there I met a mullah who wanted to argue. Like all dogmatists, he was stuck in a circle. The Islamic republic had been a success, despite retreating so far from its original rules. The reforms by the last, liberal president, Khatami, had been made to strengthen Islam in Iran, even though they had relaxed many of the Islamic laws. But what he really wanted to talk about was the British sailors.
‘They were spies,’ he insisted, and when I said that spies didn’t usually wear uniform, he retorted that this would be a typical devious British trick. Then he criticised the way they had behaved when they got home, claiming they had been mishandled when they had been well treated. I didn’t feel like contradicting him.
At that point he looked at me sternly. ‘You won’t behave like them when you get home, will you?’ he asked. And when I said that I really rather hoped not, he suddenly embraced me and gave me a great smacking kiss on both cheeks.
Despite the mullah’s unwanted kisses, I am sticking to my view. By threatening Iran, we only help its rulers keep the wavering support of their people and strengthen their alliance with Muslim hardliners elsewhere.
Iran is not a serious threat to us, and if we treat it as one we will be tumbling into yet another foolish trap, devised by silly, ignorant politicians, from which it will take decades to escape.

1292,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/sunni-leader-attacks-baghdad-wall-3929688/,2007-04-20,Sunni leader attacks Baghdad wall,"
A senior Sunni politician has condemned a US military project to build a concrete wall around a Sunni enclave in the Iraqi capital, Baghdad.
US forces say the wall, which will separate Adhamiya from nearby Shia districts, aims to prevent sectarian violence between the two communities.
But Adnan al-Dulaimi, who heads the biggest Sunni bloc in parliament, says it will breed yet more strife.
Some Adhamiya residents have said the wall will make their district a prison.
Adhamiya lies on the mainly Shia Muslim east bank of the Tigris river and violence regularly flares between the enclave and nearby Shia areas.
Construction of the 5km (three-mile) concrete wall began on 10 April and the US military says it hopes to complete the project by the end of the month.
Once the 3.6m (12 ft) wall is finished, people will enter and leave Adhamiya through a small number of checkpoints guarded by US and Iraqi forces.
The US military says the barrier is the centrepiece of its strategy to end sectarian violence in the area but insists there are no plans to divide up the whole city into gated communities.
Senior Sunni cleric Adnan al-Dulaimi, who leads the General Council for the People of Iraq which is part of the Iraqi Accord Front, said the wall was a disaster.
Speaking to an Iraqi news agency, he said it would separate Adhamiya from the rest of Baghdad and help breed further violence.
‘Maze of walls’
Some Adhamiya residents said the wall would harden the capital’s already bitter sectarian divide.
“Erecting concrete walls between neighbourhoods is not a solution to the collapse in security and the rampant violence,” housewife Um Haider told the AFP news agency.
“If so, Baghdadis would find themselves in a maze of high walls overnight, ” she said.
“I resent the barrier. It will make Adhamiya a big prison,” another resident, Mustafa, said.
Other residents also expressed alarm and said they had not been consulted before construction began.
“This will make the whole district a prison. This is collective punishment on the residents of Adhamiya,” Ahmed al-Dulaimi told the Associated Press news agency.
“We are in our fourth year of occupation and we are seeing the number of blast walls increasing day after day,” he said.
US and Iraqi troops have long built cement barriers around key locations in Baghdad and other cities to prevent attacks, especially suicide car bombings.
But no-one claims that such barriers and walls are protection in themselves, correspondents say.
Iraq has been in the grip of raging sectarian violence since the bombing of an important Shia shrine in Samarra in February 2006.

Do they really think that this is a good idea, or that it will prevent sectarian violence?

I was encouraged to actually do something rather than watch TV.  I was too young for puzzles and didn’t have the patience for jigsaws (still don’t for that matter).  So I read.  This, I am convinced, is the reason I’m such a quick reader.
10) When I was at school, I kept getting myself locked in the classroom over breaktime.

As everyone knows, Peter Jackson directed the Lord of the Rings triloigy and made a fantastic job of it.  This then lead to fans demanding that he also direct a big screen versoin of The Hobbit.
In the process, Jackson also made New Line a shitload of money.  Problem is that for the second and third films, Jackson reckons that they owe his production company, Wingnut, and WETA, the effects company that worked on the film, money that they’re not paying.  Nor are they willing to open their books and let the accounts be inspected.
Jackson sued.
The Hobbit is a complicated thing rights wise.  While New Line hold some of the rights, MGM hold the rest.  MGM is still, unsurprisingly, keen for Jackson to make The Hobbit.  New Line, however, have decided that, as Jackson is suing them, they don’t want to work with him.
Stalemate.  Except there is a possible way out.  But it’s not good for Spidey fans.
From Entertainment Weekly:
‘Hobbit’ Forming?
Sam Raimi says he’s open to directing the ”Lord of the Rings” prequel, which could leave ”Spider-Man 4” without a director — and, perhaps, its Mary Jane
By Adam Markovitz
On the eve of what is expected to be the biggest Spider-Man yet, Entertainment Weekly learns that director Sam Raimi is seriously interested in directing The Hobbit, a choice that could potentially leave Spidey 4 without a director  and, says Kirsten Dunst, a leading lady.
Raimi’s name has been floated in connection with The Hobbit ever since a very public dustup between Peter Jackson and New Line chairman Bob Shaye left the Lord of the Rings prequel without a director. Raimi went on the record for the first time about his potential involvement in the project during an exclusive interview with EW’s Steve Daly for the magazine’s Summer Movie Preview issue, on newsstands Friday: ”Peter Jackson might be the best filmmaker on the planet right now. But, um, I don’t know what’s going to happen next for me right now. First and foremost, those are Peter Jackson and Bob Shaye’s films. If Peter didn’t want to do it, and Bob wanted me to do it  and they were both okay with me picking up the reins  that would be great. I love the book. It’s maybe a more kid-friendly story than the others.” (If Raimi were to take on a complex, intense project like The Hobbit  the rights to which New Line/MGM only has for a limited amount of time  it could force Columbia to either push back its production schedule for Spider-Man 4 or find a new director for the franchise.)
Dunst says she hadn’t heard any rumors about Raimi and The Hobbit until EW raised the subject in an interview. She says she can’t imagine returning for Part 4 without both her director and her costar: ”It’s disrespectful to the whole team, I think, to do that. And audiences aren’t stupid. It’d be a big flop without me, Tobey, or Sam. That would really not be the smartest move. But they know that already. [Sony chief] Amy Pascal would never do that.” Maguire has already expressed his ambivalence about returning for another sequel.
Sony’s President of Production Matt Tolmach tells EW that the studio is cautiously optimistic about retaining the team that launched the Spidey franchise so spectacularly: ”Listen, we’re making Spider-Man 4. Our hope, dream, and intention is to do it with Sam. But I don’t have a crystal ball.”

…knowledge of the news
By Joshua Holland
Posted on April 16, 2007, Printed on April 16, 2007
Coverage of the latest Pew poll on Americans’ media consumption and knowledge of current events will no doubt feature much hand-wringing over the fact that viewers of the Daily Show and the Colbert Report are much more knowledgeable about current events than viewers of Fox News, although I’m not sure why that would be a surprise to anyone.
And the “reality based community” shouldn’t take too much comfort in that fact, given that Comedy Central viewers only scored slightly higher than Bill O’Reilly’s septuagenarian audience, and NPR listeners knew as much as Rush Limbaugh fans.

And of course there are the usual punch-lines about how stunningly ignorant Americans are of the world around them: only slightly more than a third could name Russian president Vladimir Putin; fewer than one in five know who the Senate Majority leader is and three out of ten can’t name the Vice President, even after six news-packed, controversial years in office (fewer can name Darth Cheney today than were able to identify the bumbling Dan Quayle in 1989).
The question that should be asked, but probably won’t be, is why Americans are so out of touch with politics. It’s a much-debated question, but the easy answer is that they’re divorced from the workings of their large and remote DC-based government; they feel they have no power to change the status quo in any way and that feeling, more than anything, leaves way too many of them disinterested in the specifics of exactly who’s screwing them and how. (I’ve written about it before, in the context of corruption.)
I personally believe that this is the result of a more-or-less intentional campaign to convince people of their supposed powerlessness, and every time I hear someone say of politicians, “they’re all the same” or ask “what’s the difference?” I think to myself: ‘that right there is a huge a win for the plutocracy.’

Remember the Oddest Book Title competition I mentioned here?
Well, the results are in:
 Trolley book wins odd title prize
A book titled The Stray Shopping Carts of Eastern North America: A Guide to Field Identification has been named as the oddest book title of the year.
The annual prize, awarded by industry magazine Bookseller, drew more than 5,500 internet voters to its website.
The shopping trolley book, by Julian Montague, picked up 1,866 votes.
Tattooed Mountain Women and Spoon Boxes of Dagestan came second, with Better Never To Have Been: The Harm of Coming Into Existence in third place.
“We are delighted to reward a brilliant piece of niche publishing again this year,” said Joel Rickett, deputy editor of The Bookseller.
“For everyone who has ever seen an abandoned supermarket trolley and wondered how it got there, The Stray Shopping Carts of Eastern North America is an indispensable guide.”
“The book is a labour of love and apparently took the author six years to compile,” he added.
Other runners-up include How Green Were the Nazis? and D Di Mascio of Coventry – An Ice Cream Company of Repute, With An Interesting and Varied Fleet of Ice Cream Vans.
The contest began in 1978 – previous winners include High Performance Stiffened Structures, Living with Crazy Buttocks and How To Avoid Huge Ships.

1300,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/australia-censors-terrorism-books-3929680/,2007-04-12,Australia censors terrorism books,"
By Nick Bryant
BBC News, Sydney
The Australian government has announced plans to outlaw material that advocates terrorism – a move designed to tighten its already strict censorship rules.
Books and films deemed to glorify terrorism will be removed from shelves and barred from entering the country.
The government says the changes are part of its zero tolerance policy towards terrorism.
But critics say they will lead to the censorship of material helpful to those wishing to understand radical Islam.
Present laws restrict the publication or dissemination of materials which promote, incite or instruct people to carry out terrorist acts.
The amended law would mark a significant extension of censorship powers, outlawing books and films deemed to speak out in favour of terrorist violence.
The new law would be targeted at removing the material from publication, rather than punishing its authors, and customs officers would be given much broader powers to confiscate books and films being imported into the country.
Civil libertarians have already been critical of the existing laws brought in by Prime Minister John Howard’s government, allowing the forced removal of books, claiming they limit legitimate research into terrorism and its causes.
As the Australian Society of Authors put it: “We can’t refute what we can’t read”.
But the government has dismissed these concerns, saying public safety overrides the issue of free speech.

MICHAEL HOWIE AND KEVIN SCHOFIELD
ITS portrayal of the lives of heroin addicts in Scotland’s capital was the unlikely smash that put the country on the movie-making map and brought international fame and fortune to its home-grown cast.
Trainspotting became one of the greatest British films ever made, ushering in a new era of gritty Scottish films that have generated millions of pounds for the economy.
Now, more than ten years on from its release, Danny Boyle, the film’s director, has confirmed that Renton, Begbie, Spud and co will return to the silver screen in a follow-up to Trainspotting, revealing that he has been given the rights to the much-talked-about sequel.
Boyle has also given the clearest indication yet that the original film’s leading star, Ewan McGregor, will be reunited with fellow actors Robert Carlyle, Ewen Bremner and co, claiming that “all the actors” have agreed to reprise their unforgettable roles.
Boyle has long talked about his desire to bring Porno, Irvine Welsh’s follow-up to the cult novel that spawned Trainspotting, to the silver screen. However, the project has long been shrouded in doubt, with McGregor reportedly insisting that he does not want to be involved.
The news has been described as “fantastic” by film critics and Scottish Screen, which says there is a massive public appetite for a follow-up.
It is widely held among film critics that Porno cannot be made without McGregor, and public comments from the Crieff-born actor have seemingly killed off the possibility of a follow-up. As recently as last week the star was reported to have said: “They can go ahead and do it if they want, but it will be without me on board.”
He said he was “very proud” of Trainspotting and insisted he “wouldn’t do anything to damage it”.
“I read Porno and I didn’t think it was as good as Trainspotting. There was nothing new in it,” he added.
McGregor was furious with Boyle when he chose Leonardo DiCaprio to star as the traveller on a Thai adventure in The Beach, a decision the director has apologised for.
But speaking this week at a preview of his latest movie, the science-fiction thriller Sunshine, Boyle reiterated plans to bring Porno to the cinema and indicated that McGregor was on board.
“Irvine has given me the rights to make the film. He could have made a lot of money selling it to one of the big production companies, but to his credit he has resisted that,” said Boyle.
He added: “I just want to wait until the actors are in their 40s. I could make it now, but the problem is they all look the same. I want them to look ravaged by the passing of time”.
McGregor could not be contacted to comment yesterday.
A spokeswoman for Scottish Screen described Boyle’s indication that the original cast have agreed to take part as “fantastic news”.
She said: “We would welcome the making of Porno in Scotland, with the original crew in place, with open arms. There’s a huge desire amongst the public to see that happen, although we have yet to be approached about it.
“Trainspotting has had a massive impact since it was first shown more than ten years ago. People are still talking about it. It’s still regarded as one of the greatest British films of all time, let alone Scottish films.
“It has played a huge role in raising the profile of Scotland across the world. It showed really for the first time a contemporary side of Scotland that people were not used to.”
The spokeswoman said it had inspired a host of other “gritty” films shot in Scotland, such as Young Adam and Wilbur Wants To Kill Himself, films which have raised investment in Scotland’s movie business to between £15 million and £20 million a year.
The Scotsman’s film critic, Alistair Harkness, believes there is always a danger that bringing much-loved characters back to life can backfire, but reckons Begbie and the others will be in safe hands.
He said: “I think it’s always intriguing to revisit characters to show how they’ve turned out over time, especially when those characters have made such a big impression on you.
“A film like Before Sunset, Richard Linklater’s sequel to his slacker romance Before Sunrise, was fantastic, because the characters played by Ethan Hawke and July Delpy were so true to themselves that the sequel felt naturalistic and certainly wasn’t just being made to cash in on previous success. Other times it doesn’t work quite so well.
“I don’t think that would be the case with Boyle. I think he’s certainly one of Britain’s best directors, and still as vital as he was when he made Trainspotting.
“I don’t think anyone would want to risk tarnishing the memory of what they created – one of the best British films ever.”

1302,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/calls-for-east-timor-vote-recount-3932940/,2007-04-11,Calls for East Timor vote recount,"
East Timor’s prime minister has joined calls for a recount of votes from the first presidential election round.
Jose Ramos-Horta, a candidate in the election, said he was concerned by allegations of irregularities and intimidation of voters.
Another five of the eight candidates in the race filed a protest over the issue with election officials on Wednesday.
Mr Ramos-Horta is due to face a run-off with the ruling party candidate after no one won an outright majority.
According to preliminary results, the prime minister took 23% of the vote, trailing the Fretilin party’s Francisco “Lu-Olo” Guterres, who had 29%.
The two men are expected to go head-to-head in a second round on 8 May, although the final results of the first round will not be known until early next week.
Recount discussed
International observers, including the UN and the EU, had described Monday’s election as generally calm, orderly and peaceful, with a high voter turnout.
But five of the candidates on Wednesday claimed the election had been undermined by intimidation of voters and irregularities with the count.
FIRST ROUND FRONTRUNNERS
Francisco Guterres, Fretilin Party – 28.79%
Jose Ramos-Horta, Independent – 22.6%
Fernando de Araujo, Democratic Party – 19%
Adding his voice to those concerns, Mr Ramos-Horta said he was alarmed that 150,000 voters – about 30% of registered voters – did not cast a ballot.
“Why? I don’t know,” he told reporters. “There has to be an investigation. I ask the UN for an explanation.”
The national election commission was expected to meet on Thursday to discuss the possibility of a recount.
But spokesman Martinho Gusmao said any recount was unlikely to drastically affect the result.
“No candidate will win more than 30%,” he said.
Monday’s presidential election was East Timor’s first since it won independence from Indonesia in 2002.
Many had hoped it would bring an end to the political tension and instability that has blighted the young country.
Last summer, more than 30 people were killed and thousands displaced in clashes between rival military factions.
There are fears that any prolonged uncertainty over the election could trigger more violence, although similar fears of unrest during the first round mostly proved unfounded.

1305,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/e-timor-holds-presidential-polls-3932938/,2007-04-08,E Timor holds presidential polls,"

Voting has taken place in East Timor’s first presidential election since independence from Indonesia in 2002.
Many are hoping the vote will help resolve political tensions and instability in the troubled nation.
Prime Minister Jose Ramos-Horta, a Nobel Peace Prize winner, is one of eight candidates seeking to replace Xanana Gusmao, who is stepping down.
Clashes last summer between rival military factions resulted in street violence that left 30 people dead.
“I’m happy because we have the right to vote for people to choose the right president,” said Mr Gusmao as he waited to cast his vote.
Mr Gusmao has said he intends to run for prime minister in general elections set for June that will decide a new parliament and government.
‘Free and fair’
Monday’s vote was being seen as a trial run for that poll.
Turnout was high with queues reported outside polling stations from before dawn.
Just over half of East Timor’s population of one million was eligible to vote.
Election observers reported few problems but extra ballot papers had to be delivered by UN helicopter to several districts where they ran out with people still waiting to vote.
“Despite some flaws, despite some intimidation, it can be said to be free and fair,” said Mr Ramos-Horta as he waited to vote.
He has been seen as the leading contender to replace Mr Gusmao.
But Mr Ramos-Horta faces challenges from the powerful Fretilin Party chairman Francisco “Lu-Olo” Guterres and Fernando “Lasama” De Araujo, the chairman of the opposition Democrat Party.
Official results are not expected until 16 April, but a spokesman for the electoral commission said preliminary results could begin to emerge on Tuesday.
Analysts say an outright victory by one candidate is unlikely, which would mean a run-off vote next month.
UN support
Some 3,000 international police and troops were on the streets to provide security for the polls.
These troops – mainly Australian – have been in East Timor since June last year to help stabilise the country after the clashes, which caused thousands to flee their homes.
The United Nations had been planning to leave the country but is now back in force helping to run this election.
The UN expects to be in East Timor now for many years, says the BBC’s Jonathan Head in the capital Dili.
But however smoothly this election goes, our correspondent says, restoring effective government will be a long-term task.
Last year’s crisis re-opened deep splits in East Timorese society, many dating back to the long war against Indonesia’s rule.
There are fears over how well losing candidates will accept the result of this poll and June’s parliamentary elections.

1306,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/scientists-perfect-bacon-butty-3929674/,2007-04-08,Scientists’ ‘perfect’ bacon butty,"
Scientists have created a mathematical formula of how to make the perfect bacon butty.
Experts at Leeds University discovered the secret to the ideal sandwich lay in how crispy and crunchy rashers were.
They found that two or three back bacon rashers should be cooked under a preheated oven grill for seven minutes at about 240C (475F).
The bacon should then be placed between two slices of farmhouse bread, 1cm to 2cm thick.
Cooking times
Four researchers at the Department of Food Science spent more than 1,000 hours testing 700 variations on the traditional bacon sandwich.
They tried different types and cuts of bacon, cooking techniques, types of oil and a range of cooking times at different temperatures.
A shortlist was then tested with computers to measure the texture of each sandwich.
Fifty volunteers also judged each sandwich according to its taste, texture and flavour.
‘Turn-off’
Dr Graham Clayton, who led the research, said: “We often think it’s the taste and smell of bacon that consumers find most attractive.
“But our research proves that texture and the crunching sound is just – if not more – important.
“While there was much debate within our taste panels on the smoked or unsmoked decision, everyone agreed that tough or chewy bacon is a turn-off.”
The formula is: N = C + {fb (cm) . fb (tc)} + fb (Ts) + fc . ta, where N=force in Newtons required to break the cooked bacon, fb=function of the bacon type, fc=function of the condiment/filling effect, Ts=serving temperature, tc=cooking time, ta=time or duration of application of condiment/filling, cm=cooking method, C=Newtons required to break uncooked bacon.

I seem to be collecting those recently.
Not really TMI, but those people who are squeamish may want to miss this bit of this entry out.  Just scroll down til you see this:

And I’ll put a gap between this bit and the story.  So, start scrolling now.

Right, so, to the story.
On Thursday, I gave blood.  I was supposed to do so a couple of weeks before but I, erm, kinda forgot.  So they sent me another reminder and form.
With the form filled out, I went along to the session.  Did the usual health check and iron test.  (They won’t let you give blood if the level of iron in your blood is too low.)
Instead of the usual wait to actually donate I went straight to the bed.  (I wasn’t getting special treatment, it’s just that they weren’t busy.)  Gave blood and then went for my drink and biccies.
When all of a sudden I got demands from the staff that I sit down.  I thought this was quite nice until one of them stated something.  I had started bleeding again.
I looked down and, sure enough, my arm was covered in blood.  And I had left a trail of blood on the floor.  So they got me sat down pressing a tissue to stem the blood.  And, just like when I managed to slice my finger open with a razorblade everyone else was freaking and I was fine.  In fact I got so sick of them asking if I was ok I felt like telling them to shut the fuck up because Birdhouse In Your Soul by They Might Be Giants was plaing on the radio, I love that song, haven’t heard it in ages and they were disrupting it.
Oh, and it’s going to be added to my record that I’m a re-bleeder, which will lead to more questions next time I donate blood.  Joy.

And we have all the squeamish people back.
Sorry about the lack of notes/entries over the past couple of days but I have had absolutely no internet access at all.  Which has been a bit of a bugger for me.
Finally went to MIMA yesterday (as I had sod all else to do).  It’s not that bad, actually.
I’ve decided that I prefer Martha to Rose on Doctor Who.  Simply because she reminds me of Ace who, IMHO, was the Doctors best ever assistant.
And finally, some fun stuff for you.
Some more grafitti that someone has grafittied (if that makes sense).

For all my fellow Doctor Who/Firefly fans:

And finally, cos Shukhevych asked me to do this.  BTW Shuk, you do realise that this is meaninless due to me not actually being American?  But, if I was, this is who I sould vote for, apparently:

1309,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/carry-on-quip-tops-one-liner-poll-3929671/,2007-04-03,Carry On quip tops one-liner poll,"
Kenneth Williams’ Carry On pun “Infamy! Infamy! They’ve all got it in for me!” from Carry on Cleo has been voted the funniest one-liner in film history.
A Sky Movies poll of 1,000 UK film fans and critics picked the Life of Brian quote “He’s not the Messiah, he’s a very naughty boy” as second favourite.
The often-quoted Airplane! quip “don’t call me Shirley”, delivered by Leslie Nielsen, came third.
Nielsen and Peter Sellers both had two quotes included in the top 10.
“Do you have a licence for your minkey,” said by Sellers as Inspector Clouseau in Pink Panther: The Return of the Pink Panther was voted the sixth favourite.
The oldest quote in the top 10 was uttered by Groucho Marx in the classic 1933 comedy Duck Soup, which came in at number four.
Film critic Bob McCabe said: “It is great to see two British movies are in the top three and well established classics with great lasting power.
“I thought that Kenneth Williams would win as it is a great stand-alone joke, the joke is simple and no build-up to the line is needed. Kenneth Williams’ delivery of the line is extremely dramatic, ending in a camp style.”
      Top five classic one liners
    * 1) “Infamy! Infamy! They’ve all got it in for me!” – Kenneth Williams (Julius Caesar) Carry On Cleo (1964)
    * 2) “He’s not the messiah, he’s a very naughty boy.” – Terry Jones (Brian’s Mum) Life Of Brian (1979)
    * 3) Robert Hays (Ted Striker): “Surely you can’t be serious.” Leslie Nielsen (Rumack): “I am serious… and don’t call me Shirley.” – Airplane (1980)
    * 4) “Remember you’re fighting for this woman’s honour, which is probably more than she ever did.” – Groucho Marx (Rufus T Firefly) Duck Soup (1933)
    * 5) “Don’t knock masturbation, it’s sex with someone I love.” – Woody Allen, (Alvy Singer) Annie Hall (1977)

Yeah.  Would explain the title but y’all would think I’m mad(der than usual).
So, yeah.  Not been up to much recently.
New Dr Who started on Satuday.  Yay!
(And how good was Martha?  Methinks the Doctor may have met his match.)
Next Tuesday, the last Life on Mars.  Boo!
But Dr Who is back!  Yay!
A little treat for you David Tennant and John Barowman fangirls (and fanboys).  Who says you can’t sing an instrumental theme tune?
Still not sleeping too well.  Really don’t know what’s wrong with me.  Ah well.
Thinking of visiting MIMA (which is finally open) as the current exhibition is supposed to be good.  We may be getting a Banksy exhibit soon as well.
Apart from that, not really been up to much.  Ohh, there’s a point.  Still got to email my friend about heroes.
I need some excitement in my life.
I know I said this before, but I really do want to thank everyone for their notes in my theme entry.  You guys are overflowing with awesome.  Here, have a cookie.

1311,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/emi-takes-locks-off-music-tracks-3932931/,2007-04-01,EMI takes locks off music tracks,"
Music giant EMI is taking software locks off its digital music sold via download sites such as iTunes.
The “premium” versions of EMI tracks will lack the digital locks common to songs available via many online sites.
The move is significant because most download sites currently try to limit piracy by restricting what people can do with music they buy.
Apple’s iTunes store will start selling the EMI tracks in the “premium” format in May, with other services to follow.
Track changes
EMI said every song in its catalogue will be available in the “premium” format. It said the tracks without locks will cost more and be of higher quality than those it offers now.
Popular EMI artists include Lily Allen, Joss Stone, Robbie Williams, Coldplay and Corinne Bailey Rae.
Contrary to early speculation there was no announcement about music from the Beatles going online in any format.
The higher price will apply only to single tracks that customers download. On iTunes EMI tracks free of digital rights management (DRM) software will cost $1.29 (99p).
Itunes users will be able to upgrade previously purchased EMI songs and albums for 30 cents (20p) a track.
Fans will be able to buy “premium” tracks that are twice the sound quality of currently available EMI tracks.
Apple will continue to sell DRM-protected versions of music tracks, including those from EMI, for 99 cents (79p).
All EMI albums will now be free of DRM and at the higher quality with no increase in price.
“Consumers tell us they would be prepared to pay a higher price for a piece of music they can play on any player,” said EMI boss Eric Nicoli at a press conference in London.
Mr Nicoli said the move did not diminish EMI’s fight against piracy. DRM has been hailed by some in the industry as the most effective way to stop illicit copying.
“We have to trust our consumers,” he said. “We have always argued that the best way to combat illegal traffic is to make legal content available at decent value and convenient.”
Apple boss Steve Jobs shared the platform with Mr Nicoli and said: “This is the next big step forward in the digital music revolution – the movement to completely interoperable DRM-free music.”
He added: “The right thing to do is to tear down walls that precluded interoperability by going DRM-free and that starts here today.”
Analyst Mark Mulligan, with Jupiter Research, said the announcement “changes not just the rules of the game, but the game itself”.
He said: “It’s a reflecttion that EMI is in a more difficult situation than the rest of the record labels – they have to gamble.
“It’s the right move but it’s a limited gamble; about 5% of the music market is online.”
He said he expected the other record labels and online retailers to follow suit in due course.
“Other retail partners have to come to the party because they can’t be seen to be offering an inferior product.”
The move means that consumers will be able to move music tracks between different music players at will. For example, EMI songs bought via iTunes could be played on iPods and other players too.
Although this is possible today it typically involves converting downloaded tracks into neutral formats – which often means a loss of quality.
Other record companies would soon follow EMI’s lead, predicted Mr Jobs.
Open letter
He said the more than half of all the tracks available in the iTunes store would be available DRM-free by the end of the year.
In January Mr Jobs issued an open letter to the music industry calling on it to abandon DRM.
Although DRM is designed to thwart pirates by limiting how many copies people can make of tracks and where they can play them, critics argue that it goes further than the law allows and punishes innocent consumers.
Mr Jobs said the move to remove DRM on music was not a precursor to a similar step in the video market.
“The music and video markets are not parallel. The video industry does not deliver 90% of its content DRM-free.”
He denied that the 99p cost for tracks without DRM constituted a price increase.
“We are adding another product, priced higher, with more features, higher sound quality and hassle free interoperability.
“It’s not a price increase.”

1312,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/british-tv-adverts-3932930/,2007-04-01,British TV adverts!,"
*WARNING* Youtube heavy entry *WARNING*
So, after the seriousness of the last entry (and I sincerely want to thank everyone for their amazing notes) it’s time for some fun.
Now, after exposing you to British TV Phone – In Quizes and British TV Shows the next thing is British Adverts.
So, here goes nothing.
Shake N Vac
One of the joys of growing up in the ’80’s wasn’t this advert.  But it ran for pretty much the entire bloody decade.  Seriously, who actually dances when hoovering the floor?

Smash
Now this is more like it.  Cute ickle robot Martians!  You lot know how much I likes me some Sci-Fi, so that I like this advert is a no brainer.  In case you don’t already know, Smash is a brand of instant mash potato.

PG Tips
PG Tips for years used chimps acting as humans in adverts.  This is a slightly more modern version.
There is a backstory to these adverts.  The original version of Freeview (terrestrial digital TV) used Jonny Vegas and Monkey to promote them.  Then they went bust.  PG Tips decided to reunite them.

And the original PG Tips chimps.

Irn Bru
I’ve got a confession to make.  As a Scot, I’m not actually that big a fan of Irn Bru.  In fact, the only way I can stomach it is as a mixer.  Their ad’s however are bloody amazing.
First of all, the one from this Christmas.  A parody of The Snowman, all the locations in the ad are genuine Scottish landmarks.

One from the ’80’s.  I haven’t actually seen this for years.

Hey, kids?  Mum has a surprise for you!

Awww, sweett.  An old lady.

Sony Bravia
Now for a couple you may have seen.
First of all, paint as fireworks.

And the ad with the most props in advertising history (all the rubber balls are real).

Tango
Ahh, Tango.  Again not the biggest fan in the world but, again, good adverts.
Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.

The one that was banned after it lead to kids puncturing other kids eardrums.

So, they changed it.

And finally, something about the Little General they didn’t teach you in school.

Pot Noodle
They say that every invention is but the answer to a question that has yet to be asked.  If that’s the case, I don’t want to know the unasked question that lead to the invention of the Pot Noodle.  But at least they can poke fun at themselves.
This is to promote the Mexican Spice Pot Moodle.  The whole idea of this campaign is the Pot Noodles are a guilty pleasure.
<embed src=""http://www.youtube.com/v/ZuxbnWuP6wM&quot; type=""application/x-shockwave-flash""wmode=”transparent” width=”425″ height=”350″>
And the first ad in that campaign.

Same idea, different variation.  You could (if you so wanted) send away for your own horn.

And the current campaign.

Honda
Chances are you’ve seen the first one before but it’s so good I had to include it.  A Rube Goldberg machine made entirely fron Honda parts.

A lot of people don’t like this advert, but I actually think it’s quite good.

John West
Man Vs Bear.  The bear actually has some skill in this one.

Tennants Lager
Ahhh, Gods own lager.  Unfortunately, I can’t get it on tap down here.
Solve the crime.

And the second part.

Kinder Surprise
Stumbled across this.  Can’t remember having seen this before, which is probably a good thing.

Ford SportsKa
Unsurprisingly, this got more than a few complaints.

Holsten
Ahhh, Holsten lager, Dennis Leary, anti drink driving advert.  How does that work?  Call said drunk driver an Asshole.

Charley Says
Public information films from the ’70’s.  Used in the Prodigy song of the same name.
Careful in the kitchen.

You wanna see the puppies.  Yes, you do.  You wanna see those puppies.

Frosties
And finally, one of the most annoying adverts on British TV in recent years.  Ear bleedingly bad.

Enjoy!
Will

…if Iraq withdrawal vetoed
By Bob Geiger
Posted on April 2, 2007, Printed on April 2, 2007
http://www.alternet.org/bloggers/geiger/50044/
The White House and Republican leaders may think that they will have dodged the majority of the American people when George W. Bush vetoes the recently-passed war-funding bill containing a provision mandating withdrawal from Iraq but, as they so often are, they will be mistaken.
In anticipation of a Bush veto and the likelihood that they wont be able to summon enough Republicans who care about the troops or public opinion sufficiently to override that veto, Senate Democrats are already rolling out a contingency plan that puts the GOP on notice about something very important: That they are going to be forced over and over again to be on the record as voting to strand our military men and women in the middle of a bloody civil war.
Senator Russ Feingold (D-WI), long one of the gutsy leaders on the Democratic side of the Senate aisle, has announced that he will propose legislation immediately on return from this week’s break that will cut off all funding for the Iraq war in less than a year.
Upping the ante on another major showdown immediately following the expected Bush veto of the war-funding (and withdrawal) bill, is the fact that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) supports the Feingold measure and has signed on as the bill’s first cosponsor.
I am pleased to cosponsor Senator Feingolds important legislation, Reid said. I believe it is consistent with the language included in the supplemental appropriations bill passed by a bipartisan majority of the Senate. If the President vetoes the supplemental appropriations bill and continues to resist changing course in Iraq, I will work to ensure this legislation receives a vote in the Senate in the next work period.
The Feingold legislation would take the withdrawal language passed last week a step further by not just calling for a withdrawal of troops, but actually cutting off money for the war effort, thus forcing Bush’s hand.
With only three narrow exceptions to the directive, the bill states that redeployment of U.S. forces must begin within 120 days of enactment and, more importantly, that “no funds appropriated or otherwise made available under any provision of law may be obligated or expended to continue the deployment in Iraq of members of the United States Armed Forces after March 31, 2008.”
I am delighted to be working with the Majority Leader to bring our involvement in the Iraq war to an end, said Feingold, in a statement. Congress has a responsibility to end a war that is opposed by the American people and is undermining our national security. By ending funding for the Presidents failed Iraq policy, our bill requires the President to safely redeploy our troops from Iraq.
The Senate is in recess this week but it is expected that Senator Feingold will formally propose his legislation on the first day of the next work session, April 10.
“This is the next significant step toward ending this war,” Feingold said in an interview over the weekend. “Congress can’t afford to be characterized as backing down at this point. . . . If he [Bush] vetoes it, he’s basically challenging us to accept his will.”

1314,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/theme-entry-139-3929666/,2007-03-31,Theme entry.,"
This weeks theme question is:
What is the one thing most people don’t know about you?
I could answer this by speaking abiout things that I haven’t spoken about in here before.  Things that I haven’t spoken about simply because the subject hasn’t arisen.
But, instead I’ve decided to reveal something else.
Something that I doubt I’ve even told more than 15-20 people before in my life.
OK.  Here goes.
I have a daughter.
Don’t ask me her name cos I’ve never been told it.  Don’t ask what she looks like, cos I’ve never seen her, nor a picture of her.
Her mother (my ex) and I split up when she was pregnant.  (Her choice, not mine.  She decided that the news would make an ideal Chrismas present.)  We then fell out over a few things (for which we were probably both to blame).
Then, just after I knew she was due I visited the maternity hospital, asked to see her only to be told that she didn’t want to see me.
So what do I know about her?  Well, at the begining of June she’ll be 9 years old.  And, thanks to the fact that my brother saw her (from a distance) at an event he was working at, she’s got thick, dark hair.
So, yeah.  There you go.  One thing most people don’t know about me.

1315,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/fun-night-33-3929665/,2007-03-30,Fun night,"
Yesterday it was a friends birthday.  The night started in the union where we had fun with the English making fun of us Scots and us responding in kind.
Then a heap of us moved through to the cafe to watch the Italy Scotland game.  Finished watching the first half then headed over to another bar to catch up with the rest of them.
Sang Life on Mars on the kareoke, loking through the book and noticed that they had Happy Birthday.  So I was persuaded to request it.  I thought the birthday girl might be upset if I sang it, but another friend convinced me to requested it, saying they’d take the blame if need be.
Finally got up to sing it, went back to the table and it looked like my friend had been crying.  And when I bumped into her today, she thanked me for singing it so, not so much with the annoyed.
Some of us then headed to a club.  In the bar, and at the club got talking to/flirted with one of the women in our party.  She said she liked my hair, said I wasa cute and interesting.  She even convinced me to get on the dancefloor and dance with her.
Course, she’s engaged and has a kid, so I already guessed that it was going nowhere.  Still, it’s been a while since I got that sort of attention so it was nice.

1316,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/the-equal-rights-amendment-is-back-3929664/,2007-03-28,The Equal Rights Amendment is back,"
By Melissa McEwan
Posted on March 28, 2007, Printed on March 29, 2007
http://www.alternet.org/bloggers/mcewan/49860/
Oh. Mah. Gawd. Twenty-five-years after it failed to be ratified by three-quarters of state legislatures to become a Constitutional Amendment (and eighty-four years after it was first introduced in Congress), the Equal Rights Amendment — now known as the Women’s Equality Amendment — is having a resurgence.
Yesterday, House and Senate Democrats reintroduced the measure  and vowed to bring it to a vote in both chambers by the end of the session.
”Elections have consequences, and isn’t it true those consequences are good right now?” Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) asked a mostly female crowd yesterday at a news conference, as the audience cheered. “We are turning this country around, bit by bit, to put it in a more progressive direction.”
The amendment consists of 52 words and has one key line: “Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex.”
I’m crying. I’m honestly sitting here crying, reading that line and thinking that it may finally make its way into the Constitution in my lifetime.
That sentence would subject legal claims of gender discrimination to the same strict scrutiny given by courts to allegations of racial discrimination.
”I think we’ve made a lot of people think about this and say, ‘Yes, this is the right thing to do,’ ” said Arkansas state Rep. Lindsley Smith (D), who sponsored the ERA and has vowed to bring it up again when the legislature reconvenes in 2009. “The question I get most frequently is ‘Lindsley, I thought this already was in the Constitution.’ “
Yeah, I’ve heard that once or twice myself. Probably because most Americans are bloody amazed that it isn’t.
It remains unclear whether the amendment — which has 194 House co-sponsors and 10 Senate co-sponsors and no longer includes a deadline for ratification — can get a two-thirds vote in Congress. [Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.)], who chairs the Judiciary subcommittee on the Constitution, civil rights, and civil liberties, said the bill will receive its first hearing in more than two decades and “is going to be one of the items at the top of the agenda.”
I couldn’t feel more deliriously happy at the mere possibility of the ERA at long last being ratified under the leadership of the first ever female Speaker.
Of course, the usual suspects are reemerging to fight it, just like they did last time: “In the 1970s, Schlafly and others argued that the ERA would lead to women being drafted by the military and to public unisex bathrooms. Today, she warns lawmakers that its passage would compel courts to approve same-sex marriages and deny Social Security benefits for housewives and widows.” The real issue buried in all that nonsense is, of course, “same-sex marriages.” Other opponents are all fidgety “because courts in two states have ruled that equal-rights amendments in state constitutions justify state funding for abortion.” Said Arkansas state Rep. Dan Greenberg (R): “The more general language you have in a constitutional amendment, the more unpredictable the policy impact will be.”
Yeah, who knows what will happen when we finally recognize women as equals?! Maybe frogs will fall from the fucking sky!
Opponents of the WEA are so tired. Their arguments against it are so tired. Waaaaah! Same-sex marriage! Waaaaah! Abortion! They’re willing to deny my equality under the law just because it might open the door to other battles they’re eventually going to lose, anyway. Brave culture warriors, my fat arse.

It shouldn’t take this much work to stand up for the truth but, just like they did in 2004, men who actually served with Senator John Kerry in Vietnam are coming forward to affirm their knowledge of the highly-decorated combat Veteran and to again go up against the smear merchants who attacked Kerry during his presidential run.
The occasion this time is the nomination of Sam Fox of St. Louis to be the new American Ambassador to Belgium. While it’s sadly not unusual to have an unqualified person, who happens to be a big political donor, rewarded with a diplomatic post, Fox truly ups the ante in that arena by virtue of a whopping $50,000 donation he made to the so-called Swift Boat Veterans for Truth in 2004.
“We write to urge the members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to oppose the nomination of Mr. Sam Fox for United States Ambassador to Belgium,” reads a letter addressed to Joe Biden (D-DE) and Richard Lugar (R-IN), the Chairman and ranking Republican, respectively, on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
“As Swift Boat veterans who served together in Vietnam, we strongly believe that Mr. Fox does not deserve to be confirmed for this position. We have been frustrated to hear some suggest that the 2004 election is in the past and we should ‘get over it.’ Those who make that argument forget that this wasnt just about an election; John Kerry may have been the target of the lies of the so-called Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, but he wasnt alone in having his military record falsely impugned.”
Saying “for us, this is personal,” the letter is signed by eleven Swift Boat sailors, including Jim Rassmann, who said Kerry saved his life in the incident for which the Massachusetts Senator was awarded the Bronze Star.
The Vietnam Veterans make it clear that their opposition to Fox is not just for how he contributed to the smear campaign against Kerry, but also for helping the “Swifties” in a sordid campaign that by extension slimed anyone who ever served on a Swift Boat in the Mekong Delta.
“The Swift Boat Veterans for Truth sullied the reputation of one of the Navy’s bravest, most dedicated fighting forces. Today we see the word ‘Swiftboating’ used as a pejorative — not the valiant, honorable term it was nearly 40 years ago when young men gave their lives on the Mekong Delta,” the men write. “Mr. Fox was one of the largest contributors to the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth. He put his money to work in support of a vicious and reprehensible campaign to lie about our collective combat records.”
“We know campaigns are not for the faint of heart. But one of the lessons drilled into us by the military and preserved through the memory of friends who were not lucky enough to come home from Vietnam alive, is that truth matters above all else. Lies about those who put on the uniform of our country have no place in politics.”
Also stepping up to the plate to do the right thing in the vote, which will take place on Wednesday in the Foreign Relations Committee, is Chris Dodd (D-CT), the first Senator to make clear his plan to reject Fox’s nomination.
“I strongly oppose the nomination of Sam Fox to be U.S. Ambassador to Belgium. U.S. Ambassadors need to be both responsible and credible, and Mr. Foxs support for an organization known to have spread falsehoods illustrates neither,” said Dodd, a candidate for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination, in a statement. Moreover, the fact that Mr. Fox refused to apologize for his behavior during his nomination hearing reinforces my belief that he would not be an acceptable representative for the position of U.S. Ambassador.
And leave it to the men who actually served with Kerry in Vietnam to once again point people in the right direction and, in this case, tell 21 Senators on the Foreign Relations Committee the correct way to vote tomorrow.
“In our judgment, those who finance smears and lies of combat veterans dont deserve to represent America on the world stage. We think too highly of the country we defended in combat to trust America in the hands of someone who would so casually bankroll lies about our combat records,” say Kerry’s shipmates. “We cant change history. But the Senate Foreign Relations Committee can make an important, and we hope bipartisan, statement about the truth  and make it clear that in the Senate at least, individuals are held accountable for their political contributions.”

Life on Mars actor Philip Glenister has described the British TV industry as “screwed up” and run by “a lot of fools” who put “fame ahead of talent”.
The actor claimed soaps were frequently “churned out on a treadmill” and described reality shows as “cruel”.
The pressure to meet targets could mean that “the better the quality, the more you’re penalised”, he told Radio Times.
Glenister added that if Life on Mars was delivered on budget, they would be asked to “do it for less” next time.
“It’s very frustrating when they want to hurry you up to save money. I tell them: ‘I didn’t sign up for The Bill. Let’s do it properly.'”
The 44-year-old, who plays chauvinist detective Gene Hunt in the BBC One series, expressed annoyance that “every awards ceremony” had a special category for soaps.
“I don’t want to be a snob but they only do it to satisfy market forces,” he said.
“Soaps are a separate industry, churned out on a treadmill with no time for any creative process.”
He said EastEnders took itself too seriously but claimed Coronation Street did not, adding that he had “a soft spot” for the long-running ITV1 programme.
With reality television, there was “so much cheapness”, he told the magazine.
“Someone makes big bucks at someone else’s expense and it’s the sadistic element of shows like Big Brother I find so cruel.
“We’re so screwed up with our principles. We used to mock Japanese game shows where they ate bugs. Now we’re doing the same, if not worse. It’s terrifying.”
Glenister also ruled out appearing in the forthcoming US remake of Life on Mars.
He said the pressure of such a role would lead to him being treated “in the Priory”, referring to the famous rehabilitation clinic.
“If I was 10 years younger or didn’t have children, I might like to go to Hollywood, but it’s never been a burning desire.
“I’m too old and cynical to go cap in hand.”

Crossing the (fake) border
A new theme park gives thrill-seekers the chance to play at being desperate Mexicans trying to illegally cross the border to the US.
Visitors to the Parque EcoAlberto are put in the position of workers struggling to escape across the Mexican border.
They must hike through undergrowth, dash down steep hills and across rivers, and slip under barbed-wire fences, reports Metro.
Also, they must stay out of the crossfire of watchful border guards during the four-hour night-time ordeal known as ‘caminata nocturna’.
Each visitor pays the equivalent of £10 for the privilege at the theme park in Hidalgo, actually a comfortable 700miles from the US border.
Some groups have criticised the theme park organisers for trivialising the plight of those trying to escape to the US.
But according to Alfonso Martinez, who plays a people-smuggler in the game, the mock-escapes ‘let people get a glimpse of the suffering that migrants endure’.
The theme park also offers river-rafting and more comfortable cabin accommodation, but more than 3,000 people have tried out the caminata nocturna so far.
Singleton advertises for tomb-mate
A single Chinese man is advertising on the internet for a female tomb-mate so he won’t be alone after death.
Mr Li, 45, of Nanjing city, said: “I was chatting with friends in a bar, and we were talking about life and death. They said it’s sad to be all alone, even after death.
“That night I came back home, and thought about it seriously, and came up with the idea of finding a tomb-mate.”
Li posted a message online, saying he is single but sociable and wants a female to share his tomb, and left his mobile phone number.
His ad attracted a lot of comments but Li says a curious journalist from Jinling Evening Post was the first to call.
“I only want to have a try. If I fail, I can take it, as long as I’ve tried,” he said.
“I don’t want a relationship with her. I just want to find someone to share the lonely tomb.”
Pizza head!
A Welshman has had a slice of ham and pineapple pizza tattooed on the back of his head.
A tattoo of a slice of ham and pineapple pizza on the back of Colin Helsby’s head to raise cash for a cystic fibrosis charity and to celebrate the opening of his takeaway pizza shop in North Wales 

Colin Helsby’s tattoo took three hours to complete and features three types of ham, chunks of pineapple and strands of cheese dripping down his neck.
The 45-year-old had the tattoo to raise cash for a cystic fibrosis charity and to celebrate the opening of his new business – a takeaway pizza shop.
Mr Helsby, from Penmaenmawr, north Wales, said he had a bit of a headache but was happy with his new look, reports CBBC News.
He said: “I’m really pleased with it, and I’ll keep my head shaved at the back for a few weeks to show it off.”
Tattooist Blane Dickinson, who tattooed a full English breakfast across the top of a man’s head last month, said he liked the result: “It’s really colourful, and I’m very proud of it.”
Bag snatcher’s gaffe
An Austrian handbag snatcher was shocked to find himself being chased by 27 police patrol cars and police using sniffer dogs.
The 17-year-old had grabbed a pensioner’s bag outside a field where local police were staging a road safety day.
A bus driver who witnessed the attack raised the alarm, and minutes later all the police at the event at Traun in Austria were off in pursuit.
The thief, who suddenly found the whole area full of police cars, was caught as he tried to hide in a multi-story car park.

Chess champ, 15, found with nightclub dancer
A 15-year-old Peruvian chess player who didn’t come back from a tournament in Argentina has been found – living with a nightclub dancer.
Emilio Cordova left Lima to play at the South American Chess Championship in Argentina, which he won.
But instead of returning home he went to Brazil and kept asking his family to send him money, saying he was ill.
After a few months his family grew suspicious and asked the police to find the boy.
Emilio was found living with 29-year-old Adriana Oliveira, who works as a dancer at a nightclub.
Emilio told his father, who brought him home to Peru, that Mrs Oliveira was only one of his girlfriends.
He told the press: “I play chess, study chess but this doesn’t mean I can’t enjoy myself. I’m young and I want to do this. I have to live.
“To be locked up in my room all the time depresses me.”
The fictional enemy within
Hungarians polled for their views on asylum seekers from a made-up country wanted the ‘scroungers’ thrown out.
The country of Piresa was made up to test people’s tolerance to foreigners.
Hungarian opinion research institute Tarki said: “We were surprised that two thirds of the interviewees demanded absolutely no asylum for Piresans, accused them of being spongers and agreed they should be sent home immediately.”
Hungary is repeatedly listed as one of the most xenophobic countries in the Europe, 90% of the population strictly rejected the idea of any further immigration in a recent poll.
Mum dumps baby with tramp
A mum has been arrested after dumping her baby with a tramp while she went shopping.
The woman put the homeless man in charge of the eight-week-old girl after spotting him outside a Sainsbury’s store and then wandered off with her boyfriend, reports the Daily Mirror.
After waiting outside the supermarket for more than an hour, the concerned down-and-out handed the child to shocked store staff – who called police. The pair were arrested at the scene.
As officers were interviewing staff, the 35-year-old woman and her 26-year-old partner finally returned looking for the baby.
After examining the baby in the office of the supermarket in Bromley, Kent, ambulance staff took the child to hospital for a check-up before putting her in the care of social services.
A Sainsbury’s spokesman said: “The baby was taken care of in the store until the police were called.”
The mum’s boyfriend was later released without charge.
Police email boob
Police chiefs in Australia are investigating after a photograph of a policewoman’s breasts was circulated by email.
The police constable was in her uniform with her name badge visible, her shirt undone and her breasts exposed when she was photographed.
She had sent it to her boyfriend as a get well message from her mobile phone, reports Sky News.
But the image also found its way to the inboxes of senior officers and detectives in the ethical standards department in the state of Victoria.
“She has sent an image to her boyfriend and obviously he has done the wrong thing and forwarded it on,” a Victoria Police spokeswoman said.
“The ethical standards department has been notified.
“They are aware of the incident, which involved the circulation of a photograph, and they are examining it to see if an offence has been committed.”
Beeb’s mixed signals
A BBC children’s TV presenter has been accused of getting his sign language embarrassingly wrong.
CBeebies character Mr Tumble – aka presenter Justin Fletcher – aims to greet hard-of-hearing tots by signing: “I’m happy to see you.”
But angry parents say the BBC is mixing up its signals and broadcasting something much more offensive.
Jamie Miller, who works for the Royal National Institute for the Deaf, says he was stunned when he watched Something Special with daughter Kate, five.
Mr Miller, 32, from Northallerton, North Yorkshire, said: “The signs for ‘happy’ and ‘f***ing’ are quite similar but it was an awful mistake to make.
“Katie, who is learning sign language, asked what the gesture meant. I didn’t know what to tell her.”
The BBC denied making a mistake and said they were using Makaton signals which are different to British Sign Language.
But RNID spokeswoman Kate Sidwell said: “Makaton is used more for children with learning difficulties – it is essentially a different language.”
Rustlers gave cows wellies
Romanian cattle rustlers put rubber boots on two cows they had stolen so police couldn’t follow their hoof marks.
But they were caught because a pig followed them and left a clear trail of trotter prints.
The three men, from Burila Mare in Mehedinti county, raided a woman’s stable during the night.
The owner, Mioara Fratila, from Hinova village in Mehedinti county, called the police.
She told Gazeta de Sud newspaper: “When I woke up in the morning to feed my animals they were all gone… just disappeared.
“There were only boot marks outside. But I looked closer and saw some pig tracks. It seems they ran out of boots or just couldn’t find any for the pig.”
Police tracked the 14 foot marks and four hoof marks for over 18 miles and arrested the three men for theft.
Naked OAP joyrider
Police are hunting for a naked pensioner spotted joyriding around a bowling green on a Shopmobility scooter in Scotland.
A passer-by was stunned to see the man – thought to be in his seventies – on the vehicle, which has a top speed of 3mph.
The witness, concerned that the naked pensioner would be seen by children at a neighbouring play park in Perth, called police.
A spokesman for Tayside Police said: “When the complainer called the police, the pensioner put his clothes on and drove off.
“The area was searched but there was no trace of the male involved.”
Man cuts off genitals in drunken rage
A Polish man cut off his own genitals in a drunken fit of rage after his wife left him.
Tadeus Konopizc, 40, from Zakopane, slashed off his penis and testicles with a six inch kitchen knife after downing more than a bottle of vodka.
He managed to call doctors to tell them what he had done and they sent a special helicopter rescue team to fly him to the northern town of Bialystok where surgeons specialise in sewing back severed organs.
But heavy fog on the way delayed the helicopter and by the time they reached the hospital doctors said it was too late to reattach the man’s private parts.
He is now expected to undergo months of surgery as doctors attempt to re-build his penis using skin from elsewhere on his body.

Yup, it’s going to be one of those entries.
Lame excuse of the week: the BBC blaming the falure of Castaway on the phone in thing.  They claim that any show with a phone in element is being treated with suspicion.  So, probably not a good time to launch your search for the next Joeseph, is it?
Speaking of which:
Cynical scheduling of the week: said reality show following Dr Who (I can’t wait!  6 days to go!) on a Saturday night.  After being moved from before it.
Hope you liked my British TV entry.  I’m thinking about another youtube heavy entry this time with British adverts.  What do you think?
Seen some footage from The Golden Compass.  Looks amazing.  I can’t wait for that either.
Still having problems sleeping.  Mind you, the aforementioned staying up ridiculously late for Star Trek didn’t help.  Still recovering from that.
Hopefully the union will be showing the Scotland game on Wednesday.  That fact that it is on BBC2 and the England game is on Sky might help my cause.
Finally found out the last games of the season for the Dons.  And we have Rangers at home on the last day.  Come on! 
(This is the annoying thing about the split.  I wish the SPL would see sense and get rid of it.  But then, that would require them to actually see sense.  So look for it to happen about the same time that GWB wins Mastermind.)
Quiz at the union tonight.  Actually, it’s the first time me and Nikki have participated since the infamous titanium thing.  Not that I’m still bitter about that.  No, not at all.
I’ll stop boring you lot now.

So, last night was in the union for a bit.
Had a couple of pints, read the paper, wind up some England fans after their and Scotland’s respective results.
Got into a conversation with some friends about Heroes.  (That started when I said I wasn’t going up to School Disco (sorry, Back To Skool) and I siad I was too knackered due to staying up till 4:30 Saturday Morning to watch a classic Star trek double bill (what, don’t look at me like that) and I was asked about Heroes.  Though I had to explain my personal geek out moment in Heroes Episode 17.)
Went to the toilet before I left and on my way out I bumped into someone who I hadn’t seen in a long time.
Well, two someone’s actually.
The second one was Kat.  As in my ex.
Yeah.
So we all did the ‘What are you up to nowadays’ dance.  And then I went to leave.  Before I did, though, she thanked me for something that she really didn’t need to thank me for.
Which makes a change from people blaming me for things that are not my fault.
So, yeah.  Interesting.

Greig Watson
Entertainment reporter, BBC News
As the blood sprays and body parts are scattered in the sword and sandal blockbuster 300, the first thought on your mind may not be “have they got the armour right?”.
But crying foul when Hollywood plays fast and loose with facts is not just for history nerds.
The heroic westerner vs tyrannical Persian theme of 300 – based on Frank Miller’s graphic novel about the Battle of Thermopylae in 480 BC – has sparked indignation from some commentators in the US, and brought protests from the Iranian authorities.
And while not every movie provokes an international incident, bending the facts to fit the film is nothing new – as film historian Kevin Brownlow reveals.
“In his 1927 epic Napoleon, director Abel Gance showed his hero at the Club des Cordeliers when the Marseillaise was first sung. He was informed that Napoleon had not been present. ‘He is now,’ he said.”
A particular low point in the relationship between film and fact was 1936’s The Charge of the Light Brigade.
“Instead of being the result of a military blunder during a war in Southern Russia,” said Mr Brownlow. “The doomed attack became an act of personal revenge in India.
“They got so many things wrong you wonder why they bothered to pretend it was history at all.”
Star of The Charge, Errol Flynn, also took the role of General Custer in They Died With Their Boots On, where he died a hero’s death with his men.
“Some evidence suggests many of the US soldiers were shot in the back and were therefore running away – but who would want to see that?,” says Mr Brownlow.
The political power of films was understood by Stalin who, eyeing the growing belligerence of the Nazis ordered a rousing account of 13th century warlord Alexander Nevsky who had defeated invading German knights.
Mr Brownlow said: “Such was the rush it was shot in July heat on artificial snow. But no sooner had it been finished than the 1938 Hitler-Stalin Pact had been signed and the picture had to be put on the shelf.
“It came off the shelf just as quickly when Hitler invaded in 1941.”
Things got little better in the post-war era.
US journalist Lowell Thomas helped create the legend of Lawrence of Arabia with his filmed reports and was even included in David Lean’s 1962 epic.
“Despite being confronted with perhaps the most brilliant spectacle in talking picture history,” recalls Mr Brownlow, “He said ‘The only accurate things in Lawrence were the camels and the sand’.”
While it would be hard to make a film about as volatile region as the Middle East without drawing protests from somewhere, British audiences can be almost as prickly.
American War of Independence epic The Patriot, starring Mel Gibson, was condemned for portraying the British soldiers, or Redcoats, as child-murdering criminals.
So vocal were the objections that the then Culture Secretary warned there was a difference between “putting a gloss on something and distorting things beyond all recognition”.
By then, Gibson had developed a reputation for sticking it to the British.
Dr Martin Farr, a lecturer in Politics at the University of Newcastle, said: “Braveheart is one of the most striking examples of a film influencing the real world.
“I went to a screening in Glasgow and the SNP were handing out leaflets. During the film, every English death was greeted with a huge cheer.”
Just to show it was not a fluke, Gibson has gone on to upset both Jews, with The Passion of the Christ, and Mayan central Americans, with Apocalypto.
‘Fundamentally unfair’
Dr Farr emphasised popular films and academic history are different creatures: “The demands of camera is such that you can’t be as fair in 90 minutes as you can in 100,000 words.
“But there is a line that moviemakers should not cross. In U571 the audience was told that the US, rather than the British, navy seized Germany’s Enigma code machine.
“It was one of the most significant moments of the Second World War and to alter it so fundamentally is unfair.”
Such controversy shows, believes Dr Farr, a basic fact about history.
“It’s never settled. There is never one view of what happened and why. Just imagine the fuss that is going to be caused when they make a film about Margaret Thatcher.”
300 opened in cinemas across the UK on 22 March

*WARNING* Very youtube heavy entry*
So, after the notes I got on my last entry, I thought I’d introduce you lovely lot to some of the stuff that passes for TV in this fair land*.  So, here we go.
Top Gear
Motoring show.  And probably the show that the BBC gets the most regular complaints about.
Ever wondered what would happen if the car you were in was struck by lightning?

Background for this next one.  The team decided to find out if it would be easier and cheaper to buy a car for a holiday in America than hire one.  Along the way, they faced challenges.  Like camping out and eating nothing but roadkill.  Oh, and this one.

Never Mind The Buzzcocks
Comedy music quiz, with the emphasis on the comedy.  If you go on the show expecting not to have the mickey taken then…
Well, just watch the clip.

Louis Theroux Wierd Weekends
Documentary by Louis Theroux (who got his break on the show TV Nation) looking at the stranger aspects of America.  In this clip, he’s looking at pro-wrestling and has kinda annoyed someone with the wrong question.

Dr Who/Comic Relief
Ahh.  Now this is a find.  Written for Comic Relief, apparently after it aired American fans went nuts requesting copies on tape (this being before DVD or downloading).  The writer of this spoof is now writing for the show itself and has written three of the best episodes since the relaunch (The Empty Child, The Doctor Dances and The Girl In The Fireplace).
Part 1:

Part 2

Dead Ringers
Impression/satire show.
The show is blessed to have (imho) the best Bush impressionist going.

Tony Blair takes out a loan.

Bush writes a sitcom!

Childrens TV is always a good target.

And so is James Blunt.

Blue Peter
Remember the incident I talked about in a recent entry concerning a phone in competition?  Well, here is the apology.

2DTV
Animated satire.  The animation technique used meant that they could produce the show a couple of days before it aired.
Bill Gates discovers a new product.

George W Bush Vs Osama Bin Laden.  Who has the best toys?

Tony Blair has fun with the Cabinet.

And a twofer.  Political and Simsons satire.

Spitting Image</b>
And to finish with, the daddy of satire in Britain, the much lamented Spitting Image.
First of all a song.  Trust me, you will have this stuck in your head after hearing it.  If memory serves right, it did reach number 1 over here.

And, hey, why not.  The lyrics.  Sing along folks!
The Chicken Song:
It’s the time of year, now that spring is in the air
When those two wet gits, with their girly curly hair
Make another song, for marronic holidays
that nausiate-ate-ates in a million different ways
From the shores of Spain, to the coast of southern France
No matter where you hide, you just can’t escape this dance
Hold a chicken in the air, stick a deck-chair up your nose
Buy a Jumbo-Jet, and then bury all your clothes
Paint your left knee green, then extract your wisdom teeth
Form a string quartet, and pretend your name is Keith.
Skin yourself alive, learn to speak araphahoe
Climb inside a dog, and behead an Eskimo
Eat a Renault 4, wear salami in your ears
Cassarole your gran, dis-embowel yourself with spears
The disco is migrating, the sound is loud and grating
It’s truly nausiating – let’s do the dance again..
Hold a chicken in the air, stick a deck-chair up your nose
Buy a Jumbo-Jet, and then bury all your clothes
Yes you’ll hear this song, in the holiday discos
And there’s no escape, in the clubs or in the bars
You would hear this song, if you holidayed in Mars
Skin yourself alive, learn to speak araphahoe
Climb inside a dog, and behead an Eskimo
Now you’ve heard it once, your brain will spring a leak
And though you hate this song you’ll be humming it for weeks
Hold a chicken in the air, stick a deck-chair up your nose
Buy a Jumbo-Jet, and then bury all your clothes
la la la la la la la….
(voice in the background at the end: “‘ay – we had a laugh!”)
And to finish off with, Jack Nickelson Offers Robert DeNiro a role.
SIDeNiro
Hope you enjoyed that folks.

1327,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/us-house-votes-for-iraq-deadline-3929653/,2007-03-22,US House votes for Iraq deadline,"
The House of Representatives has voted in favour of ordering President George W Bush to pull US troops out of Iraq.
The bill links $124bn (£62bn) funding for the war to a 31 August 2008 deadline for the withdrawal of all US combat troops.
It was passed by 218 votes to 212 by the Democratic-controlled House. Correspondents say it is the boldest challenge yet to Mr Bush’s strategy.
The president has made clear he will veto the bill.
The White House says legislators should allow more time for his new strategy – which includes sending 28,000 extra troops to Iraq – to work.
‘High stakes’
“The American people have lost faith in the president’s conduct of this war,” House leader Nancy Pelosi said.
“The American people see the reality of war. The president does not.”
However some Democratic representatives voted against the bill, because they said it would not put an immediate end to the war.
Most Republicans opposed the legislation, which they said would represent an admission of failure in Iraq.
“The stakes in Iraq are too high and the sacrifices made by our military personnel and their families too great to be content with anything but success,” Republican Roy Blunt said.

Gordon Brown will not face a vote if he is the only candidate to succeed Tony Blair as Labour leader, the party’s National Executive Committee has said.
But the chancellor will still have to attend hustings during a deputy election campaign due to last at least seven weeks, the NEC confirmed.
He is the favourite to succeed Mr Blair who has said he will go by September.
Two other MPs, left-wingers Michael Meacher and John McDonnell, have said they will run against him.
But they must first get the signatures of 44 other Labour MPs to get on to the ballot.
‘Affirmative ballot’
Tuesday’s decision, during a day-long meeting of the NEC at Westminster, spares Mr Brown having to go through an “affirmative ballot” if he is the only candidate.
Six MPs have confirmed they will run for the deputy leader’s job, to replace John Prescott, who has said he will stand down with Mr Blair.
The contenders include five ministers – Peter Hain, Hilary Benn, Harriet Harman, Hazel Blears, Alan Johnson – and one backbencher, Jon Cruddas.
Mr Blair is expected to announce his retirement within days of the Scottish and Welsh elections on 3 May. It could mean Britain has a new prime minister as early as 22 June.
NEC general secretary Peter Watt said the executive would meet within 72 hours of an announcement to agree a timetable for the election.
Nominations would begin immediately afterwards, with MPs given three days on which the Commons is sitting to submit papers.
Hustings would be held over about six weeks – three in England, one in Scotland and one in Wales.
The ballots will go out about five weeks into the process and should take about two and a half weeks.
The winner of both the leadership and deputy leadership contest will have to secure more than 50% of the electoral college – under which party members, unions and MPs each have a third of the votes.
The NEC also confirmed that all new members would have a vote, waiving the usual qualifying period.
Labour chief whip Jacqui Smith said the rules would reflect the fact that, as well as choosing a new leader, the party was electing a prime minister for the first time.
“We will be electing both the leader and deputy leader but also the prime minister of this country and that is why we have been clear … that we will expect the candidates to get out and talk to the Labour Party and to talk to the country,” she told Sky News.

Now, this is interesting.  I have long maintained that anyone who thought that Brown wasn’t going to be the next PM was on something.  And I do think that this is the right decision.
However, I really don’t think that Brown will be unopposed.  I rwally cannot imagine the blairites allowing it.
This is going to get pretty interesting over the next few months.

…Expresses Regret
GUANTANAMO BAY, CUBA- According to his signed confession released this past week, purported 9/11 mastermind Khalid Shaikh Mohammed has admitted to a great number of heinous crimes in the name of Al Qaeda including hijackings, bombings, and murders. Most shocking was the admission that Mohammed had infiltrated the American media by becoming a high-ranking executive for Fox Television and was directly responsible for the devastating 2002 cancellation of Joss Whedon’s Firefly after just a few episodes.
Fox Television, sister company to Fox News Channel, has vehemently denied ever employing the infamous terrorist, but anonymous sources at the network report seeing his name on a variety of emails and memos during that period.
“I never saw him,” says our source, “but I have to admit I liked the guy. He was so ruthless, so affably callous, that he fit right in.”
The mass murderer and Ron Jeremy look-alike now says that he performed his Fox duties by email and fax from his spider hole in Rawalpindi, Pakistan, until he was captured in the spring of 2003. When he issued the order to axe the show, no one seemed questioned it or defended the show in any way. He quickly came to the conclusion that at Fox, canceling fledgeling programming is just too easy.
Looking back, he says that it was at this point that he began to feel remorse, fearing that perhaps his destroy America from the inside had destroyed him instead. He was becoming one of them. He was a terrorist, cold-blooded murderer of thousands, but at least he was not a Fox executive at heart.
Mohammed vowed to himself that, although he would continue to endeavor to kill many thousands of Americans, wading hip-deep into the entertainment industry was just too dear a price to pay for the cause of destroying the Great Satan from within.
With the aid of his court-appointed representative, Mohammed expressed deep regret over his actions regarding the troubled sci fi program.
“At first I thought it would be funny to air the episodes out order, and none of the other executives objected,” he said. “After watching the shows on DVD as they were meant to be seen, I finally ‘get’ the UST between Mal and Inara- a meta plot that died so young and fragile like a strangled baby bird. I feel awful about the whole thing.”
While the national news media scratches their heads over the litany of confessions, fans of the show don’t seem surprised at all over the revelation. Immediately after it left the air, barely a year after 9/11, conspiracy theories abounded over how such a thing could happen. On the Internet, fans blamed everything from terrorism to satanic cults- anything but low ratings. Many of them seem to believe that the cancellation was all a hoax and that episodes are still being produced and shown on a secret network only available to high-level members of the Illuminati, though there has never been any evidence supporting this.
The truth began to congeal after fans discovered this cryptic post on the fireflyfans.net message board earlier this year:
Khalid_Shaikh_Mohammed911: Sorry guys.
As it stands, the confessed Al Qaeda planner is likely to stand trial in the coming months. Depending on the outcome, he could be looking at a death sentence, life in prison, or a development deal with Mirimax.
“At the time I told myself it was all for the greater glory of Alah,” Mohammed recalled, “but in the end it just seemed like I was doing it for the glory of me. I am deeply ashamed of what I did to that poor defenseless television program.”

So, what’s been happening in my life since Wednesday?  Well, not a hell of a lot.
Strange experience watching the Scotland 6 Nations game in the union yesterday.  Y’see with it being St Paddy’s Day, there were a lot of Irish people in the place.  And they were all supporting Scotland (purely because the score determined who won the entire tournament).
Odd.
Anyway, much fun was had by all.  I also got accused of being a traitor for being out last night by a friend of mine who a) is Welsh and b) was wearing a Guiness hat.
I got Buffy Season 8 Issue 1 on Thursday and have read it about 4 times now.  (If you are a Buffy fan, I highly recommend it.)  Then yesterday I finally found out when Dr Who would be returning to TV (Series 3 starts on the 31st).  So I thought that was my inner geek well looked after.
That was until I went to whedonesque this morning and found that IDW (who owns the rights to comics based on Angel) had basically comfirmed Angel Season 6 comics, co-written by My Master himself.
So my inner geek has had to go, lie down and recover from all the excitement.
And so, to finish with…

1332,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/us-rejects-ruling-on-uk-soldier-3929648/,2007-03-15,US rejects ruling on UK soldier,"
The US State Department has rejected a coroner’s conclusion that the “friendly fire” death of a British soldier in Iraq was unlawful and a criminal act.
Lance Corporal Matty Hull, 25, died near Basra in March 2003 when a US pilot fired on his convoy.
US spokesman Sean McCormack said the death was a “terrible accident”.
The coroner was critical of US failure to send witnesses to the inquest but the Pentagon said he had access to most information from its own inquiry.
Speaking at a State Department briefing in Washington, Mr McCormack said: “We would not agree with any categorisation that this was a criminal act.
“This was a terrible accident. We mourn the loss of life and our hearts go out to his family… but we have come to a different conclusion.”
Recording a narrative verdict, Oxford assistant deputy coroner Andrew Walker said L/Cpl Hull’s death was “entirely avoidable”.
“The attack on the convoy amounted to an assault,” he said.
“It was unlawful because there was no lawful reason for it and in that respect it was criminal.”
The US pilots from the Idaho Air National Guard should have flown lower to confirm identities before opening fire, he added.
“I don’t think this was a case of honest mistake.”
Speaking after the verdict, widow Susan Hull said she felt a great sense of relief that it was over and it had confirmed that her husband’s death was “entirely avoidable”.
“I think all of our family feel it was the right verdict. It was what we’d waited four years to hear.”
She said she was now prepared to “draw the line” on the event.
“It’s been a long and painful time and we need to move forward.”
But she said the lack of co-operation from the US was “very disappointing”.
The Ministry of Defence said it was “very sorry for confusion and upset” caused by the handling of the US cockpit tape.
The recording was not initially shown to the inquest, but the US authorities only agreed for it to be released after the footage was leaked to the Sun newspaper.
An MoD spokesman said a team has been set up to liaise with coroners and bereaved families and to ensure documents are made available quickly to inquests.
Lawyer Geraldine McCool said the verdict did not suggest there would be a prosecution of the US pilot and the Hull family would not be calling for one.
‘Combat environment’
The Hull family believes key information was blacked out of a US Friendly Fire Investigation Board Report given to the coroner investigating his death.
Constitutional affairs minister Harriet Harman, who met with US diplomats in London ahead of the inquest, said she shared the “frustration” at their failure to send witnesses.
“I explained that this was not a criminal court, nobody could be found guilty and sent to prison, it is simply asking questions and requiring answers,” she said.
In a statement the US Department of Defense described the incident as a “tragic accident”.
It said the US shared all the information from its inquiry with the MoD, except those parts that had to be withheld for “security, privacy or other reasons”.
“The investigation determined that the incident took place in a complex combat environment, the pilots followed applicable procedures,” it said.
L/Cpl Hull, who was from the Household Cavalry, died from multiple injuries inside his blazing Scimitar tank despite efforts by colleagues to save him.
Four other soldiers travelling in the convoy of light armoured vehicles were also injured in the incident on 28 March 2003 near Basra.

1333,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/the-great-british-tv-phone-in-swindle-3929647/,2007-03-15,The Great British TV Phone In Swindle,"
In recent weeks over here, there has been a lot of controversy over TV phone ins.
It all started with Richard and Judy on Channel 4.  On the show they have a game called You Say, We Pay.  In order to possibly become a contestant on the game, viewers are urged to phone a premium rate phone line and answer a question (usually along the lines of What colour is Manchester United’s home top?  a) Red, b) Silvery or c) Greece).
Then a leaked email from the company that runs the phone in to the shows production company gave the details of possible contestants and was sent at about 5:10 (the show is on 5 – 6pm).  Not long after, viewers were yet again urged to phone in to take part.  The game has been suspended on the show pending a full enquiry (there are rumours that the problem stretches back at least 2 years).
Hot on the heels of this it was the BBC’s turn.  On their show Saturday Kitchen, viewers were invited to phone in to speak to the chef.  Despite the show having been pre-recorded.  Viewers were also given the chance to phone in to be in the audience for the next weeks show.  Admittedly, the show where that opportunity arose was live.  The show they were being invited to, however, was recorded straight after.  This, too, is being investigated.
Now we move to ITV, where The X Factor got dragged into things.  This time it was not the phone in part of the show but the interactive ‘red button’ voting where it was discovered that viewers voting in this way were overcharged.  ITV have given full refunds, made a donation to Childline and voluntarily suspended all phone in votes until it could be established that everything was above board.
Back to Channel 4 and the racing programme The Racing Line, where callers were being charged for calls made after the lines had closed.  This quiz has also been suspended.
And Channel 5 got involved after its afternoon show Brainteasers was discovered to have invented winners of their viewer phone in competition in cases where none of the viewers got it right.  (Incidentally, having seen the show these cases must have been pretty rare as their phone in quiz is usually incredibly easy.)  Five reacted the same way as ITV and suspended all phone ins pending the results of an internal enquiry.
There have also been allegations about ITV shows Saturday Night Takeaway, I’m A Celebrity, Get Me Out Of Here! and Soapstar Superstar.  So it seems to be quite a far reaching problem.
But surely there are some shows that can easily be above suspicion.  Surely the nations longest running and best loved childrens TV show can’t possibly get caught up in the whole thing?
Blue Peter sorry over fake winner
The hosts of BBC children’s programme Blue Peter have apologised to viewers after the results of a competition were faked last November.
A technical problem meant viewers calling for the Whose Shoes contest did not get through to the studio.
Instead, a visiting child was asked to pose as a caller, and won the prize.
Host Konnie Huq said: “We’d like to say sorry to you because when this mistake happened we let you down.” The BBC did not profit from the calls.
BBC Children’s controller Richard Deverell called the incident a “serious error of judgement”.
The contest, on 27 November, was raising money for children orphaned by Aids in Malawi.
Callers were asked to phone in and identify a mystery celebrity’s shoes. More than 13,800 people entered, with calls costing 10p each, including 3.25p for the Unicef charity.
But an “unavoidable technical difficulty” meant producers were unable to access the callers’ details and so found a stand-in. The winner could select a prize from a list of children’s toys.
The child they found was already in the studio because she had won a separate competition.
Premium phone line regulator Icstis is investigating the incident, which was discovered when another visitor to the programme set, Mona Zahoor, wrote to the BBC’s Have Your Say messageboard.
Falling short
“We were all quite horrified when it happened,” she told the BBC News website.
An internal investigation confirmed the error and a separate independent review will be carried out into the circumstances surrounding the competition.
“This edition of the programme fell short of the high standards Blue Peter viewers quite rightly expect,” Blue Peter editor Richard Marson said.
“We are very sorry for the way this competition was conducted.”
The competition has been re-run, with a new winner chosen from the original callers. The problem will “never happen again”, viewers have been told.
“I would like to apologise unequivocally to viewers, to all the children who took part in the competition,” Mr Deverell said.
“We have already apologised directly to the child involved and her family for this incident.”
Mr Deverell called the faking of the competition an “exceptional incident”, and said the person responsible had acted “in a panic”.
But speaking to Radio Five Live, he refused to rule out the possibility that staff would be sacked over the incident.
A freephone number – 08000 565 363 – is available for viewers who took part in the competition and would like more information.
Viewers can also find information on the Blue Peter website.
But Ms Zahoor, whose information led to the discovery, said she thought the BBC’s reaction was “silly”.
“I didn’t realise that it would be blown out of all proportion,” she said, adding that she had refused to lodge a formal complaint about the show.

Privacy bodies have welcomed Google’s decision to anonymise personal data it receives from users’ web searches.
The firm previously held information about searches for an indefinite period but will now anonymise it after 18 to 24 months.
“This is an extremely positive development,” said Ari Schwartz, deputy director of the Center for Democracy and Technology, a US-based watchdog.
“It’s the type of thing we have been advocating for a number of years.”
However, governments could still force Google to hold onto data or hand it over to authorities.
“By anonymising our server logs after 18 to 24 months, we think we’re striking the right balance between two goals: continuing to improve Google’s services for you, while providing more transparency and certainty about our retention practices,” a statement from the search giant said.
It added: “Unless we’re legally required to retain log data for longer, we will anonymise our server logs after a limited period of time.”
Peter Fleischer, Google’s privacy counsel for Europe, said the decision has been taken after consulting with privacy bodies in the US and Europe.
He said: “We believe that privacy is one of the cornerstones of trust. We will be retroactively going back into our log database and anonymising all the information there.”
Rolled out
Mr Fleischer said the firm was holding on to the information for up to 24 months in part to match data retention laws being rolled out across Europe.
European internet service providers (ISPs) and phone companies are in the process of implementing an EU directive which forces them to retain a variety of communication data for up to two years.
Google collects and stores data from each query. It holds information such as the search term itself, the unique address of the PC being used, known as the IP address, and details of how a user makes searches, such as the browser used and previous queries to Google.
That information can contain private data about a user, and could be used to build a detailed picture of the user’s habits or lifestyle.
Google says it was using this information to help improve its different services and to monitor how its search engine was functioning.
Online habits
Privacy groups are concerned about how the data collected by Google – and other web firms – could be used to monitor people’s online habits.
Richard Clayton, a researcher at Cambridge University specialising in web traceability, said Google’s announcement was positive but had not gone far enough.
“It’s a step forward but I would like to see them anonymising data in a much shorter period.
“There is no justification for holding on to the data for two years.”
Mr Clayton said the data Google collected was useful to the firm in improving its services only in the short term.
He said that Google was hiding behind the European directive in setting time limits on how long it should hold on to the data.
“There is no sense of whether this directive even applies to web search logs,” he said.
He said the real reason Google was holding on to the data was because of the cost involved in anonymising it.
He said he also had concerns about how the firm was ensuring that held data could not be traced back to individual users.
Google has said it will alter the data so that users’ searches cannot be traced back to an individual’s computer.
But Mr Clayton said the recent row over search data released by AOL showed that identification of users could still be made even without a machine’s unique IP address.
AOL released data to academics last year relating to millions of search queries carried out by its users. While there was no direct identifying data, there was enough information in the searches to build profiles of users.
It is not yet clear if other search engines will follow suit. No-one at Yahoo or MSN was available for comment at the time of writing.

…Those who can count and those who can’t.
So, yeah, this entry from Chariots Corner kinda sums things up just now.
I’ve decided to give up on the script I’ve written for the myspace thing and go with an old script.  Which I’ve to rewrite from scratch as I don’t have a copy on disc anywhere.
Which is kinda handy as it was designed around the song Streets Of Laredo(sp?) by Johnny Cash.  And I’m pretty sure it needs to be copyright free.
Actually, that reminds me.  Must look up the definition of catharsis for the opening title cards.
I’m also still worried that I have pacing issues with Granite.  Even though neither of the people who have read it so far have said that is the case.
(Admittedly, I completely forgot to ask one of them (sorry The Mary, I did mean to email you back and ask that) so that could be why.)
I’m overdosing on Heroes websites seeing as how the show is on hiatus.  I’m hooked on Hiro’s blog, the online comic (which is still being put up weekly during the hiatus) and even regestered for a possible job at Primatech.
Also, cos I’m a spoiler whore, I read an article which had a huge spoiler for the rest of the season.  And it comfirmed that two of my theories are correct (though one in a way I didn’t quite expect).
Don’t worry though, I won’t post them here.
As for the rest of my life?  Landlords still a fuckwit.  Still no heating in my room and Life On Mars new episode tonight.  Yay!
Hmmm.  Thought I had more to write about than this.
I apologise for the utter lameness of this entry folks.  I’ll try to be more interesting next time.*

Israel has recalled its ambassador to El Salvador after he was found drunk and naked apart from bondage gear.
Reports say he was able to identify himself to police only after a rubber ball had been removed from his mouth.
A foreign ministry official described Ambassador Tzuriel Refael’s behaviour as an unprecedented embarrassment.
The incident, which happened two weeks ago, has renewed calls for a radical overhaul of the way Israel appoints and promotes its diplomats.
San Salvador was Mr Refael’s first post as ambassador. He was promoted in 2006 from a technical position in the ministry which had involved several foreign postings.
He was being recalled, although he had not broken any laws, foreign ministry spokeswoman Zehavit Ben-Hillel told reporters.
She confirmed that lurid reports of the incident in the Israeli press were accurate.
“We’re talking about behaviour that is unbecoming of a diplomat,” she said.
Israel has been rocked by a recent series of misconduct and corruption scandals, shaking public confidence in the political leadership.
Haaretz website reports that police found Mr Refael in the Israeli embassy compound where he had been found bound, gagged and naked apart from sado-masochistic sex accessories.
In 2006, Israel’s diplomatic service was criticised by the public watchdog for its appointments system.
The state comptroller’s report singled out the foreign ministry appointments committee for its inadequate examination of candidates and lack of transparency.

1341,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/answer-time-2-3929639/,2007-03-11,Answer time,"
All right.  Lets do it to it.
findingsunshine wanted to know:
*You are the last person alive on a deserted island, with nothing to eat on it except for vegetables. Knowing how much you loathe vegetables, which veggie would you kill yourself with?
Thing is, I don’t hate all vegetables.  Just the ones that are blatently evil like cauliflower, broccoli, cabbage and sprouts.  So I’d have to go with one of them, seeing as how they’re out to get me anyway.
*you may have answered this when I wasn’t reading your OD, but was wondering if there has ever been a book that changed our life, and if so, what was it.
Erm, Fast Food Nation is the book that finally got me to stop eating, well, fast food.  No Logo inspired me to get more involved in stuff.  And The Rule Of four and Hitchhikers Guide blew me away when I first read them.
*Who would you get to compose the score to your first film?
I would love to get Belle & Sebastian but they’ve been burned before when it comes to film scores so I doubt I’d manage it.  So I’d have to go with either Snow Patrol or (assuming I could actually afford him) Ennio Morricone.  Or Greg Edminson(sp?) the guy who scored Firefly.
*What is your favourite colour post-it note? And, what colour SHOULD they have?
Don’t actually use post-it’s, so I really don’t have a particular favourite.  But I do think they should make one that’s sky – blue pink with a tartan border.
*Is Britney Spears the anti-Christ?
Don’t be stupid.  That’s Dick Chaneys job!
*Do you prefer to write with a pen or a pencil?   
If I’m writing a script I’m kinda exact about things.  I like to write with one of those retractable pencils on narrow ruled, margined paper.
Jay The Pest enquired:
My question for you is do you have a girl friend? And if so are you going to ask her to merry you? 
At this exact moment in time I’m single and have been since November.
Oribeth finishes this off:
Which foreign language would you most like to be able to speak fluently?
Italian.  It’s such a romantic language.
Do you ever have thoughts that, once they’ve popped into your head, make you stop in your tracks and smile/laugh, regardless of where you are and what you’re doing?
All the time.  I’ve also learned that it’s not the best idea in the world to listen to Hitchhikers Guide on my MP3 player.
Which Open Diarists would you most like to meet? (I’m excluding myself from this question whether you would want to meet me or not!)
Well, excluding you and in no particular order of importance, findingsunshine, Karma Girl, Peter_24601, Band Candy, Ken Fitlike, Corbeau, shessolovely, Krud, originalsinner, JustSte, The Mary, Sensual, and others.
Do you have a hero? Who/why?
I somehowe people won’t be too shocked when I say that one of them is Joss Whedon, just because he’s so damned talented.  Richard Kelly because Donnie Darko inspired me to finally do something about learning to make films.  And Ghandi and MLK for proving that nonviolent protest can actually work.
What is your idea of perfect happiness?
Just enough money to live off but not so much that I don’t know what to do with it.  Friends that, when you say that you want to be left alone and not talk to anyone will understand and do just that.  A complete and utter lack of writers block.  And a half chicken parmo with chips and salad.
If money was no object, what shiny shiny thing would you buy first?
The most powerful Mac I could, 2 monitors, hardware upgrades so I could use them both at the same time, a TV, a DVD recorder, a video recorder and a mi-DV deck so I would have my very own edit suite.
And finally… would you like a pillow for the next time you *headdesk*? ^^ 
Ohh, that would be lovely, thanks.
Well, hope y’all enjoyed that.

So, Wednesday night went to kareoke for the first time in quite a while.  Got there and remembered that it was also Tees/Wear varsity that day.  Never the best of days to sing.  But, ah well.
Got up to sing The Time Warp (shock) and I got a stage invasion from a bunch of Sunderland Uni students.  Later I sang Teenage Kicks and the same happened.  Some of them were actually quite cute, although a couple of my friends got pissed off on my behalf.  I, old pro at stage invasions that I am, wasn’t actually too bothered.
They’d gone by the time I sang Sweet Child O Mine.  So I got a friend to take some pictures of it.  And here they are:




In case you’re wondering what I’m doing in that last one, I’m playing air guitar.  Much cheaper than a real one :¬p
Apart from that, I haven’t really been up to much.  Arguing with the landlord (again).  I really cannot wait till I move out in the summer.  The guy is a wanker.
And I finally caught up with Heroes.  Now just to wait for it to come back.  Oh and for Drive to start as that looks fantastic!
This is the last call for questions as I’ll be answering them on Monday.  If you’re a bit shy, let me know and I’ll protect your anonimity.
Finally, found this and thought it was too good to share:
 Odder book titles make shortlist
How Green Were the Nazis? and The Stray Shopping Carts of Eastern North America are just two of the titles competing for an unusual book prize.
The Bookseller magazine has released its shortlist for the Oddest Titles prize, honouring fringe publishing.
Proceedings of the Eighteenth International Seaweed Symposium is also in the running, with a public vote due to decide the winner.
The winning author receives a bottle of champagne for their efforts.
Last year’s contest was won by Gary Leon Hill for his impressively titled The People Who Don’t Know They’re Dead: How They Attach Themselves to Unsuspecting Bystanders and What to Do About It.
Joel Rickett, deputy editor of The Bookseller, said: “While rival literary awards like the Costas and the Orange Broadband Prize have sold out, The Bookseller/Diagram Prize has refused all offers of corporate sponsorship for 29 years.
“It continues to celebrate the bizarre, the strange, and the simply odd. This year’s shortlist shows that despite publishers cutting back their lists, literary diversity continues to flourish.”
The shortlist was compiled from entries that caught the eye of publishers, booksellers and librarians across the world.
Another of this year’s contenders for the prize starts off simply enough with D Di Mascio’s Delicious Ice-Cream, but continues with the subtitle D Di Mascio of Coventry: An Ice Cream Company of Repute, with an Interesting and Varied Fleet of Ice Cream Vans.
The winner will be revealed on 13 April, ahead of the London Book Fair.

1345,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/fbi-obtained-records-illegally-3929635/,2007-03-09,FBI obtained records ‘illegally’,"
The FBI has been illegally obtaining information on the US public, a report by the justice department’s inspector general has said.
The FBI used the Patriot Act, passed after the 11 September 2001 attacks, to compel the release of information illegally or improperly, it said.
It said most of the errors were through poor record-keeping or agent mistakes rather than criminal misconduct.
The errors were “unacceptable” and would be corrected, the FBI said.
Rise in requests
The 126-page report by inspector general Glenn Fine said in some cases agents had failed to get the proper authorisation to obtain personal data.
In others they sought the data in non-emergency situations.
“We believe the improper or illegal uses we found involve serious misuses of national security letter authorities,” it concluded.
The Patriot Act allowed for the use of such national security letters, or administrative subpoenas, in cases relating to spying or terrorism.
Under such a subpoena, personal records of clients and customers must be handed over to the FBI from such sources as banks, telephone firms and internet service providers.
The report said national security letter requests had risen from 39,000 in 2003 to about 56,000 in 2004 before falling back to about 47,000 in 2005.
In a review of field office files, the report found that 22% of the cases it investigated contained one or more possible unreported or unidentified violations.
Attorney General Alberto Gonzales praised the report and said he had told FBI director Robert Mueller past mistakes would “not be tolerated”.
Mr Mueller said the deficiencies were “unacceptable”.
“While we’ve already taken some steps to address these shortcomings, I am ordering additional corrective measures to be taken immediately,” he said.

The alleged mastermind of the 11 September attacks on the US and 13 other terror suspects are set to face hearings at the US Guantanamo Bay camp.
The closed-door sessions will decide whether Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and the others can be deemed enemy combatants and therefore face military trials.
They were transferred to Guantanamo after years in secret CIA jails.
This is the first time they have faced any court. But human rights groups say the hearings are sham tribunals.
The hearings are being held with no defence lawyers present, and human rights groups say the panels of three military officials could consider evidence obtained by force.
The hearings do not rule on guilt or innocence, but are the first step towards charging a detainee with crimes.
‘Too sensitive’
Officials declined to say which of the 14 would go first or how many have refused to take part in the proceedings, AFP news agency said.
Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, of Pakistani-Kuwaiti origins, who was captured in Pakistan in March 2003, has been described by US President George W Bush as “the man believed to be the mastermind of the 9/11 attacks” which killed about 3,000 people.
Another key suspect is Ramzi Binalshibh, an alleged senior al-Qaeda figure originally from Yemen who was captured in Pakistan in September 2002.
A third man, Saudi-born Abu Zubaydah, who is believed to have been the chief al-Qaeda recruiter, was also captured in Pakistan in 2002.
The group also includes an Indonesian, Hambali, who is accused of planning the 2002 Bali bombings that killed more than 200 people.
They were moved from CIA detention last September.
In the past, initial hearings have been open to outside observers, but the Pentagon decided that these cases were too sensitive to be reported freely.
The BBC’s Justin Webb in Washington says that in particular, there is concern that the men might reveal information about how they were captured.
Edited transcripts will be posted on a Pentagon website, a spokesman said.
Lawyers acting for the detainees have said this decision undermines the credibility of the whole process.
‘Legal black hole’
Five years after the first prisoners arrived, Guantanamo Bay is soon to see a new phase with the expected start of military tribunals or commissions in March or April.
The camp currently holds about 385 suspects accused of fighting for al-Qaeda, the Taleban or associated militant groups.
It is seen by the Bush administration as a vital tool in the “war on terror”. It enables the US to interrogate suspects who are not US citizens and hold them – indefinitely if necessary – in territory it controls but which is not subject to normal US court rules.
Critics say it is a legal black hole in which suspects have been abused and face either military tribunals or open-ended imprisonment.

The NHL will play regular-season games in Europe for the first time when the Anaheim Ducks face the LA Kings in London to open the 2007-08 campaign.
The teams will play two games, on 29 and 30 September, at London’s new O2 Arena, formerly the Millennium Dome.
London’s Wembley Arena was the site of pre-season NHL games in 1992 and 1993.
The NBA recently announced that the Boston Celtics and Minnesota Timberwolves will play a pre-season game later this year at the 02 Arena.
“This a great honour for us, to be chosen to play in the NHL’s first regular-season games in Europe,” Anaheim Ducks general manager Brian Burke said.
“Showcasing a great rivalry between two clubs from the Southern California market will be terrific for the NHL.”

Monday night, quiz night in the union.  On my way in with my friend I bump into someone I knew from college and we stood around and chatted for a bit.  Then, later on in the union, I spoke to someone else from college.  Three in one day!  What are the chances of that?
So, every week in the quiz they have the random round.  As the name suggests, the theme of the round changes each week.  (Particular highlight was the week it was about the Pizza Hut menu (no, really)).  So this week it was superheroes.
We got three questions wrong.
First one we got wrong was What is the name of Prince Adam of Eternia’s pet cat?
We put Tygra.
Answer: Cringer.
Second one we got wrong was How many types of Kryptonite are there?
We put 10.
Answer: 5.
(Although some fans of the comic argued that was only in the films.  Wikipedia lists 15.)
But the third one was the one that got my geek heckles raised.  This one had me ranting for ages (and poor Nikki had to put up with it).
What metal is bonded to Wolverines skeleton?
Immediately I wrote down ‘Adamantium’ which I know to be spot on.  I knew it.  I also said to Nikki that few teams would actually get that right, cos it doesn’t actually exist.
The answer that was given as correct?
Titanium.
Fucking titanium.
It’s not.  It’s bloody not.  I know it isn’t.  I’ve read countless guides to The X-Men (thanks to my ex) and they all say the same thing.  Wolverine has a metal called adamantium bonded to his skeleton and bone claws and this is the toughest metal known to man.
IT’S NOT TITANUIM FOR THE LOVE OF PROFESSOR X!!!!!!!!!
(Yeah, and just remember that Nikki got that, and variations thereof, for about 15 minutes.)
When I confronted them about it afterwards, they admitted that they knew it was wrong.
Nikki was crashing at mine, so we got food and then got a taxi back, at her request.  And I’m wishing she hadn’t cos I got the tip of one of my fingers trapped in the door when I closed it.  So now the finger in question is kinda bruised, swolen and ouchy.
Tuesday I got my old, broken laptop back.  I opened the box and kinda got nostalgic about it.  But, everything changes as they say.  Now all I need is the cash to send it to Aberdeen.
I’m going to seriously get addicted to http://www.alluc.org as it’s thanks to them that I’m getting caught up Heroes (huge personal SQUEE!!! moment in Chapter 13) and then there’s Veronica Mars, then they have wrestling videos and then series one of The Prisoner, and then…
If only their Studio 60 links would work :¬(
Anyhoo, got to go to the cludgie, then have a smoke then I’ve got Chapter 14 of heores all lined up.  Yay!
On my way into town today I noticed that there is a shop opening up near me selling pet lizards, etc.  I swear, if I thought I would be allowed pets in the flat, I had the room and the money, I would get one.  And probably name it Hiro.
Unless I got a gekko.  In which case I’d name it Gordon.  (Kudos if you get the reference.)
Don’t forget.  I need your questions for my belated 1100th entry interview thingy.  Hopefully I’ll get it posted at the weekend.

1349,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/white-house-official-libby-guilty-3929631/,2007-03-05,White House official Libby guilty,"
A former key White House official, Lewis Libby, has been found guilty of obstruction of justice and perjury.
Libby, ex-chief of staff to Vice-President Dick Cheney, faces a prison term of up to 25 years. He will be sentenced in June.
He was accused of lying to the FBI and a grand jury over revelations about CIA agent Valerie Plame’s identity.
Libby’s lawyer said they were “very disappointed” at the verdict, and would ask for a new trial, or would appeal.
Libby, who goes by the nickname “Scooter”, was found guilty on four out of five counts. He was acquitted on one count of lying to the FBI.
‘Honest lapses’
Correspondents say the case shed light on the inner workings of the Bush White House.
Critics claimed the White House had deliberately leaked Ms Plame’s identity to ruin her career. Her husband, former ambassador Joseph Wilson, had publicly cast doubt on the Bush administration’s case for going to war in Iraq.

LIBBY CHARGES AND VERDICT
Two counts of perjury – guilty on both
Two counts of making false statements – guilty on one
One count of obstruction of justice – guilty
It can be a crime to reveal the identity of an undercover CIA agent.
The alleged cover-up rather than the leak itself was the subject of the trial.
Libby told FBI investigators and a grand jury investigating the leak of Ms Plame’s name, that he had learned of her identity as a CIA agent from reporters.
However, several people testified that he discussed her identity before the date he said he learned of it.
“He claims he forgot nine conversations with eight people over a four-week period,” prosecution lawyer Peter Zeidenberg said in his closing statement.
The defence maintained that Libby’s false statements were the results of honest lapses in memory by a man tasked with extraordinary responsibility.
“He was bombarded with a blizzard of information. Those briefings would make your toes curl,” defence lawyer Theodore Wells said.
Bush ‘saddened’
After the verdict, and standing beside his client, who remains free until sentencing, Mr Wells said: “We have every confidence that ultimately Mr Libby will be vindicated.
“We believe he is totally innocent, and did not do anything wrong.”
Prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald said he was “gratified” by the verdict, but that it was “sad” that “we had a high-level official who obstructed justice and lied under oath”.
US President George W Bush “said that he respected the jury’s verdict. He said he was saddened for Scooter Libby and his family,” said White House spokeswoman Dana Perino.
But Senate majority leader Harry Reid said: “I welcome the jury’s verdict. It’s about time someone in the Bush administration has been held accountable for the campaign to manipulate intelligence and discredit war critics.”

How has Britain changed in the last 10 years? Last week, the Magazine challenged readers to tell us.
Our inspiration was a letter from reader Rachel Hurley (right), of Perth, Australia, who is moving back to these shores with her husband John and their young daughter.
“Has anything changed?” Rachel asked, innocently enough. On the one hand, there have been seismic, and obvious, political changes, on the other, some rather predictable and prosaic ones.
But the Magazine Monitor, our weblog, asked readers to tune into the more nuanced differences ; the subtle, but significant, changes to have crept up on us in the past decade.
Here are 30 of the best.
1. Coffee is served by the pint and it will cost more than a pint of beer.
Kate
2. Once you received your gas from British Gas, your electricity from your local electricity board and your phone service from BT. Now, you will get your gas from your bank, your electricity from British Gas, and your phone service from Tesco.
Colin
3. The DFS sale which started just before Rachel left will be ending soon.
Craig H
4. I remember arranging to meet friends at a given location/time many days in advance. If they were late you had to scratch around for 10p to ring from a phone box (and their mum would always tell you they had set off). They would never stand you up, as the cowardly way of cancelling without warning by text just didn’t exist then.
Felicity Matthews
5. It’s OK to take photos at concerts, so long as you use your phone.
Valerie
6. Marmite now comes in a squeezy jar.
Kelly
7. Elaborate descriptions adorn food packaging: “freshly made”, “perfectly ripe”, “deliciously creamy” or (a recent favourite) a “hand-stretched” pizza.
Cazza S-B
8. Beach huts used to be for nannas and grandads rather than property speculators.
Euan Grice
9. A “C” in the middle of a circle meant “copyright”.
Nigel Macarthur
10. The M62 and M25 were still motorways rather than car parks.
Jared Read
11. “I was following my Sat Nav” is now the excuse for driving where you shouldn’t.
Jan Podsiadly
12. Helen Mirren was occasionally called “Ma’am” by junior officers in Prime Suspect, but not by anybody else.
Nigel Macarthur
13. “Decking” now refers to something you do to your garden, rather than what one boxer does to another.
Valerie
14. Swear words are no longer asterisked in a newspaper.
Greg Hoover
15. Headline puns are no longer the sole property of the tabloids.
David Michael
16. A wag was something a dog did with its tail.
Lynda Taylor
17. If children carried guns, they squirted water.
Amreek Singh
18. Policeman are still nominally unarmed but wander around in body armour – even in the Lake District – that makes them look like battle scene extras from Starship Troopers.
Richard Hardisty
19. You can no longer wear a hat or a hooded top inside a shopping centre.
Caroline, Southend, UK
20. A family seaside holiday in Britain is considered chic.
Mark Blackman
21. Northern Ireland is one of the UK’s top tourist destinations.
Gordon Bingham
22. The customer is no longer wrong all the time.
Kerrin, Stratford
23. The phrase “Big Brother is watching you” should actually be the other way round for many people.
Stig
24. Naked bottoms in TV ads!
Pat O’Donnell
25. Noel Edmonds is still on telly, but at least his Crinkly Bottom has been banished to oblivion.
Lee Dauphin
26. Daleks were reduced to scraping a living in Kit-Kat adverts 10 years ago. Today they’re appearing on a lunchbox, annual, poster, t-shirt, DVD, sticker collection and life-size cardboard cut-out near you.
Rebecca
27. Passwords were for international spies and entry to gang huts a decade ago. Now you can barely buy milk without the need for some secretive alpha-numeric code.
Derek Scobie
28. People go to hospital to become ill.
Jan Podsiadly, Cheam
29. The UK will be just like Australia except the weather is worse and the coffee isn’t as good.
Paul Woodfine
30. And everyone wants to move to Australia.

Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah

You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrough ya
She tied you to her kitchen chair
She broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
Well, maybe Ive been here before
Ive seen this room and Ive walked this floor
I used to live with leonard before I knew ya

Its a cold and its a broken hallelujah

Hallelujah, until youre nothing
Hallelujah, baby, until shes everywhere
Hallelujah, until together you are somewhere Id lost

Sunday, March 4, 2007
Five years of the Bush administration’s overreaching and congressional collaboration continue to exact a high toll in human lives, America’s global reputation and the architecture of democracy. Brutality toward prisoners, and the denial of their human rights, have been institutionalized; unlawful spying on Americans continues; and the courts are being closed to legal challenges of these practices.
It will require forceful steps by this Congress to undo the damage. Taking on this task is a moral imperative that will show the world the United States can be tough on terrorism without sacrificing its humanity and the rule of law.
Here we offer a list  which, sadly, is hardly exhaustive  of things that need to be done to reverse the unwise and lawless policies of President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney. Many will require a rewrite of the Military Commissions Act of 2006, an atrocious measure pushed through Congress with the help of three Republican senators  Arlen Specter, Lindsey Graham and John McCain.
Our list starts with three fundamental tasks:
Restore habeas corpus
One of the new act’s most indecent provisions denies anyone Bush labels an “illegal enemy combatant” the ancient right to challenge his imprisonment in court. The arguments for doing this were specious.
Habeas corpus is nothing remotely like a get-out-of-jail-free card for terrorists, as supporters would have you believe. It is a way to sort out those justly detained from those unjustly detained. It is essential to bringing integrity to the detention system and reviving the United States’ credibility.
Stop illegal spying
Bush’s program of intercepting Americans’ international calls and e- mail messages without a warrant has not ceased. The agreement announced recently  under which a secret court supposedly gave its blessing to the program  did nothing to restore judicial process or ensure that Americans’ rights are preserved. Congress needs to pass a measure to force Bush to obey the law that requires warrants for electronic surveillance.
Ban torture, really
The provisions in the Military Commissions Act that McCain trumpeted as a ban on torture are hardly that. It is still largely up to the president to decide what constitutes torture and abuse for the purpose of prosecuting anyone who breaks the rules. This amounts to rewriting the Geneva Conventions and puts every American soldier at far greater risk if captured. It allows the president to decide in secret what kinds of treatment he will permit at the CIA’s prisons. The law absolves American intelligence agents and their bosses of any acts of torture and abuse they have already committed.
Many of the tasks facing Congress involve the way the United States takes prisoners, and how it treats them. There are two sets of prisons in the war on terror. The military runs one set in Iraq, Afghanistan and Guantánamo Bay. The other is even more shadowy, run by the CIA at secret places.
Close the CIA prisons
When the Military Commissions Act was passed, Bush triumphantly announced that he now had the power to keep the secret prisons open. He cast this as a great victory for national security. It was a defeat for America’s image around the world.
Account for ‘ghost prisoners’
The United States has to come clean on all of the “ghost prisoners” it has in the secret camps. Holding prisoners without any accounting violates human rights norms. Human Rights Watch says it has identified nearly 40 men and women who have disappeared into secret American- run prisons.
Ban extraordinary rendition
This is the odious practice of abducting foreign citizens and secretly flying them to countries where everyone knows they will be tortured. It is already illegal to send a prisoner to a country if there is reason to believe he will be tortured. The administration’s claim that it got “diplomatic assurances” that prisoners would not be abused is laughable.
A bill by Representative Edward Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, would require the executive branch to list countries known to abuse and torture prisoners. No prisoner could be sent to any of them unless the secretary of state certified that the country’s government no longer abused its prisoners or offered a way to verify that a prisoner will not be mistreated. It says “diplomatic assurances” are not sufficient.
Congress needs to completely overhaul the military prisons for terrorist suspects, starting with the way prisoners are classified. Shortly after 9/11, Bush declared all members of Al Qaeda and the Taliban to be “illegal enemy combatants” not entitled to the protections of the Geneva Conventions or American justice. Over time, the designation was applied to anyone the administration chose, including some U.S. citizens and the entire detainee population of Guantánamo.
To address this mess, the government must:
Define ‘combatant’
“Illegal enemy combatant” is assigned a dangerously broad definition in the Military Commissions Act. It allows Bush  or for that matter anyone he chooses to designate to do the job  to apply this label to virtually any foreigner anywhere, including those living legally in the United States.
Screen prisoners fairly
When the administration began taking prisoners in Afghanistan, it did not much bother to screen them. Hundreds of innocent men were sent to Guantánamo. The vast majority will never even be brought before tribunals and still face indefinite detention without charges.
Under legal pressure, Bush created “combatant status review tribunals,” but they are a mockery of any civilized legal proceeding. They take place thousands of miles from the point of capture, and often years later. Evidence obtained by coercion and torture is permitted. The inmates do not get to challenge this evidence. They usually do not see it.
The Bush administration uses the hoary “fog of war” dodge to justify the failure to screen prisoners, saying it is not practical to do that on the battlefield. That’s nonsense.
Beyond all these huge tasks, Congress should halt the federal government’s race to classify documents to avoid public scrutiny  15.6 million in 2005, nearly double the 2001 number. It should also reverse the grievous harm this administration has done to the Freedom of Information Act by encouraging agencies to reject requests for documents whenever possible.
The United States should apologize to a Canadian citizen and a German citizen, both innocent, who were kidnapped and tortured by American agents.
Oh yes, it is time to close Guantánamo camp. It is a despicable symbol of the abuses committed by this administration, with Congress’ complicity, in the name of fighting terrorism.

…Filmmaker
Posted Mar 2nd 2007 7:02PM by Scott Weinberg
Filed under: Documentary, Awards, Celebrities and Controversy
When Jerry Seinfeld came out to present the Best Documentary Award at last month’s Oscar telecast, I turned to the person next to me (who was a total stranger) and said “Seinfeld presenting an Oscar? Who’s next? Ray Romano?” And then the comic kicked in with a real tired old piece of comedy schtick about the litter you often find in movie theaters. (I guess by now he’s run out of jokes about airplane food.) Anyway, the guy was a silly choice to be an Oscar presenter — and now one of the Oscar-nominated documentarians has decided to speak up for another reason.
Iraq in Fragments producer John Sinno is more than a little unhappy — justifiably so if you ask me — and he’s not being shy about his displeasure. I’ll post the full letter (entitled “An Open Letter to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences”) after the jump, but here’s the gist of his umbrage: Seinfeld was pretty damn disrespectful of the documentary genre while cracking jokes for a billion-plus audience. Mr. Sinno is particularly unhappy with the ignorant and dismissive way in which the Oscar-nominated documentaries were described as “incredibly depressing!” (I was particularly unhappy about the really obvious humor from a guy who really ought to have some good new material by this point. Wow, docos about war are “depressing!” You go, Seinfeld, that’s some insight!)
Sinno’s got a point: If ever there were ever opportunity to educate and elucidate a large audience as to the importance of documentary films, it would be during the annual Oscar broadcast. Yet Seinfeld (who appeared in one half-decent documentary that probably had ten times the budget of Iraq in Fragments) took the stage and basically reinforced all the lamest stereotypes out there. I mean, would it be so hard to find presenters (and joke writers) who actually know a little bit about film? Or is it preferable to simply roll out a disinterested billionaire and let him “humorously” spew a bunch of short-sighted fallacies? (Oh, but if they chose a different presenter we might have missed all that hilarious stuff about movie theater litter!) Well, we now know where John Sinno stands; his letter to the Academy is included below.
An open letter to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences
I had the great fortune of attending the 79th Academy Awards following my nomination as producer for a film in the Best Documentary Feature category. At the Awards ceremony, most categories featured an introduction that glorified the filmmakers’ craft and the role it plays for the film audience and industry. But when comedian Jerry Seinfeld introduced the award for Best Documentary Feature, he began by referring to a documentary that features himself as a subject, then proceeded to poke fun at it by saying it won no awards and made no money. He then revealed his love of documentaries, as they have a very “real” quality, while making a comically sour face. This less-than-flattering beginning was followed by a lengthy digression that had nothing whatsoever to do with documentary films. The clincher, however, came when he wrapped up his introduction by calling all five nominated films “incredibly depressing!”
While I appreciate the role of humor in our lives, Jerry Seinfeld’s remarks were made at the expense of thousands of documentary filmmakers and the entire documentary genre. Obviously we make films not for awards or money, although we are glad if we are fortunate enough to receive them. The important thing is to tell stories, whether of people who have been damaged by war, of humankind’s reckless attitude toward nature and the environment, or even of the lives and habits of penguins. With his lengthy, dismissive and digressive introduction, Jerry Seinfeld had no time left for any individual description of the five nominated films. And by labeling the documentaries “incredibly depressing,” he indirectly told millions of viewers not to bother seeing them because they’re nothing but downers. He wasted a wonderful opportunity to excite viewers about the nominated films and about the documentary genre in general.
To have a presenter introduce a category with such disrespect for the nominees and their work is counter to the principles the Academy was founded upon. To be nominated for an Academy Award is one of the highest honors our peers can give us, and to have the films dismissed in such an offhand fashion was deeply insulting. The Academy owes all documentary filmmakers an apology.
Seinfeld’s introduction arrived on the heels of an announcement by the Academy that the number of cities where documentary films must screen to qualify for an Academy Award is being increased by 75%. This will make it much more difficult for independent filmmakers’ work to qualify for the Best Documentary Feature Award, while giving an advantage to films distributed by large studios. Fewer controversial films will qualify for Academy consideration, and my film Iraq in Fragments would have been disqualified this year. This announcement came as a great disappointment to me and to other documentary filmmakers. I hope the Academy will reconsider its decision.
On a final note, I would like to point out that there was no mention of the Iraq War during the Oscar telecast, though it was on the minds of many in the theatre and of millions of viewers. It is wonderful to see the Academy support the protection of the environment. Unfortunately there is more than just one inconvenient truth in this world. Having mention of the Iraq War avoided altogether was a painful reminder for many of us that our country is living in a state of denial. As filmmakers, it is the greatest professional crime we can commit not to speak out with the truth. We owe it to the public.
I hope what I have said is taken to heart. It comes from my concern for the cinematic art and its crucial role in the times we’re living in.

…liberals, and The Weather Channel
Posted By Carpetbagger On 27th February 2007 @ 13:15
TV preacher Jerry Falwell has been denying global warming for years, but this week, he was a little more specific about his perspective.
The religious right leader sees a conspiracy, working to convince people to accept a myth. Whos involved with the scheme? Al Gore, liberal politicians, the media, radical Hollywood,  and The Weather Channel. From Falwells latest sermon:
The Weather Channel has taken up that task with its series It Could Happen Tomorrow. The Weather Channel started its It Could Happen Tomorrow series in January 2006. The program includes episodes where a tornado destroys Dallas, a tsunami destroys the Pacific Northwest, Mount Rainier erupts and destroys nearby towns, and San Diego is devastated by wildfires. What is the Weather Channel up to?  The big lie, conceived by the Weather Channel in cahoots with environmental extremists, is to get us in a tizzy over global warming.
OK, but why is The Weather Channel working with Hollywood and liberals to get us in a tizzy? Dont worry, Falwell can explain that, too. As he sees it, theres a three-prong strategy in place:  (1) To Create Major Economic Damage to America. (2) The Desire To Change the Subject Concerning the Worlds Moral Bankruptcy. (3) Most importantly, it is Satans Attempt to Re-direct the Churchs Primary Focus.
I should probably note that these arent mutually exclusive  Falwell appears to believe that The Weather Channel/Liberal axis may be working alongside Satan.
Of course, Id be remiss if I didnt put this in the appropriate political context.
The Falwell who sees this climate conspiracy is the same Falwell whos teamed up with Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.).
* Falwell hosted a reception for McCain at the National Religious Broadcasters Convention.
* McCain hired a top Falwell staffer for his campaign.
* McCain has appeared on national television defending Falwells tolerance.
* And McCain appeared alongside Falwell in March, giving the commencement address at the TV preachers college.
McCain has cozied up to a man who believes global warming is not only a myth, but a tool in a Satanic plot.
Something to keep in mind for the next person to call McCain an independent-thinking maverick.

Stunning Reversal for Former Veep
Just days after former Vice President Al Gore received an Academy Award for his global warming documentary An Inconvenient Truth, the United States Supreme Court handed Mr. Gore a stunning reversal, stripping him of his Oscar and awarding it to President George W. Bush instead. 
For Mr. Gore, who basked in the adulation of his Hollywood audience Sunday night, the high courts decision to give his Oscar to President Bush was a cruel twist of fate, to say the least. 
But in a 5-4 decision handed down Tuesday morning, the justices made it clear that they had taken the unprecedented step of stripping Mr. Gore of his Oscar because President Bush deserved it more. 
It is true that Al Gore has done a lot of talking about global warming, wrote Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for the majority. But President Bush has actually helped create global warming. 
In another setback for the former vice president, a group of scientists meeting in Oslo, Norway today said that Mr. Gore was growing at an unsustainable rate. 
The polar ice caps may be shrinking, but Al Gore is clearly expanding, said Dr. Hiroshi Kyosuke of the University of Tokyo. 
The scientists concluded that if Mr. Gore continues to expand at his current rate, he could cause the earth to spin off its axis by 2010, sending it hurtling into the sun. 
Heres an inconvenient truth, Dr. Kyosuke added. Als got to stay away from those carbs. 
Elsewhere, after foreigners received a record number of Academy Award nominations, CNN anchor Lou Dobbs proposed building a 12-foot high fence around the Kodak Theater.

So, yeah, see the title.
Part of it is other stuff but most of it is this bloody myspace movie thing.
I’m having real problems getting it written.  I think that a huge part of it that I’m not really motivated enough.  Let me explain.
I’d be fine if I really, really wanted to win it.  If the prize was something I really wanted I’d be fine.  But it’s not.
As mentioned in the entry linked above, it’s filmmaking by comittee.  Which I hate.  Had it been what I originally thought it would be (£1 million to make my own film) again I’d have been happy.
The reason I’m entering is because of the opertunity it’ll give me.  It’s hard enough trying to break into the industry without turning something like this down.  Hell, even if I only get to the pitch stage I’ll get to meet with people from Film4.
But I still feel like I’m entering for the wrong reasons.
I’m enthusiastic about Granite and want to get that finished and made.  And I know that entering the comp represents a fantastic opertunity to help get that out there.
But still.
So, yeah.  I’m stressed.  I’m not sleeping at all well, I’m tense and usually have a headache of some kind.
Hopefully you can make sense of my random babblings above.
Am I right or wrong to feel like this?  And should I be so stressed about it?

…Stinks the Berry Worst of 2006
Sharon Stone’s Hoot-a-Minute Who-Dunnit “wins” Worst Picture, Actress 
Little Man and Lady in the Water also Take Multiple Dis-Honors
Although they decided to spread the loathe around, voters for this year’s 27th Annual RAZZIE® Awards clearly placed Sharon Stone’s unintentionally hilarious who-dunnit Basic Instinct 2 head and hooters above the competition. In ceremonies held on Oscar eve at Hollywood’s Ivar Theatre, the film known to Golden Raspberry Award Foundation members as Basically, it Stinks, Too took four $4.97 trophies, among them Worst Picture, Worst Screenplay, Worst Prequel or Sequel and Stone herself as 2006’s Worst Actress.
But BASIC didn’t find itself alone in the “winners” circle at Tinsel Town’s tackiest trophy derby: Fellow Worst Picture nominees Lady in the Water and Little Man each took multiple dis-honors as well. The Wayans brothers’ far-from-funny midget-thief-pretending-to-be-a-baby “comedy” Little Man swiped three statuettes from its seven nominations: it was named Worst Remake or Rip-Off, and Shawn and Marlon Wayans were both dually dissed as the year’s Worst Screen Couple, and jointly named Worst Actor. M. Night Shyamalan, who blew off a multi-million-dollar, multi-picture deal with Disney to get his thrill-free-thriller Lady in the Water made, was rewarded for his megalomania with two RAZZIES: He was named both Worst Director and, for casting himself in a pivotal role in his own film, was also chosen as Worst Supporting Actor. Worst Supporting Actress turned out to be a neck-and-neck race between two talent-free blonde bimbos, but in the end Carmen Electra beat out last year’s Worst Actress “winner” Jenny McCarthy. Electra’s third RAZZIE nomination proved the charm, and she took the spray-painted gold for her cameo appearances in a pair of putrid parodies, Date Movie and Scary Movie 4. Rounding out the field, and running on empty where actual amusement is concerned, was the “winner” in the newest RAZZIE category, Worst Excuse for Family Entertainment: Robin Williams’ road apple of a road movie, RV.
The RAZZIES® were created in 1980 by lifelong cinemaniac and cynic John Wilson, author of both The Offical Razzies® Movie Guide and Everything I Know I Learned at the Movies. “Winners” were determined by mailing ballots to 757 Golden Raspberry Foundation members throughout 42 US states and more than a dozen foreign countries. Those few brave souls who choose to accept their RAZZIES® receive a gold-spray-painted, golf-ball-sized raspberry atop a mangled super 8 film reel, with an estimated street value of $4.97.

Yup, this is pretty much going to be a random entry.  So, hang on to your tootsies!
So, after having a hold of it for ages, I finally got round to watching the Buffy unaired pilot last night.  Not bad, but I can see why they recast Willow.  The actress was, how can I put this delicately, shit.  But still worth getting a hold of.
Something else which is worth getting a hold of is a documentary I watched on Wednesday night called So Much, So Fast.  It’s about a guy suffering from ALS (AKA motor neuron disease).  While he comes to terms with slowly losing control of his body his brother, frustrated at the lack of research into a cure/drug to help slow things down (ALS is what is known as an orphan disease, so called because there’s not enough sufferers to make it worth drugs companies time looking into it) sets up a foundation to do the research himself.  Meanwhile his girlfriend isn’t immediately sure about marrying him, not because she doesn’t love him but in case anyone accuses him of being selfish by asking her when he’s got a terminal illness.  It is one of the most moving and heartbreaking things I have seen in a long time.
I decided I was bored with my old myspace layout.  After all, I have had it for quite a while now.  So, with the help of a generator, I made my own.  And very proud of it I am too.  Have a look and tell me what you think.
Those of you who have previously expressed an interest in reading through my scripts and giving me feedback, watch your inboxes over the next few days.  As of Tuesday I have exactly 2 months to get the myspace thing written, crewed, cast, filmed, edited and submitted.  So I’m going to finish the script this weekend (honest) and send it probably Monday or Tuesday.  If you are not on the list and would like to be, leave a note with your email address.  If you are on the list but don’t think you’ll have time to give me quick feedback/just plain don’t want to be anymore, leave me a note to that effect too.
And finally, cos I also watched these last night some stuff from Ren and Stimpy!
The Royal Canadian Kilted Yaksmen:
The Happy, Happy, Joy, Joy song!
(Annoyingly I couldn’t find the one from the series.  I chose this one simply for the inanity of the maker thinking we actually need help with the chorus!)
And finally, an advert:

1366,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/blair-defiant-over-iraq-security-3929614/,2007-02-21,Blair defiant over Iraq security,"
Tony Blair has refused to apologise for the security situation in Iraq, saying he bears no responsibility for it.
The prime minister told BBC Radio 4 that extremists trying to thwart Iraq’s democracy were to blame for attacks.
“I don’t think we should be apologising at all for what we are doing in Iraq. We’re trying to support the democrats against the terrorists,” he added.
The UK is to withdraw 1,600 troops from Iraq but Mr Blair said numbers could increase again “if we’re needed”.
He told MPs on Wednesday that the remaining 5,500 troops would stay until 2008.
However, when he was asked about reversing that decision on the Today programme, he said: “I don’t want to get into speculating about that because we have the full combat capability that’s there.
“So, if we’re needed to go back in any special set of circumstances we can, but that’s not the same as then increasing back the number.”
He said he bore no responsibility nor would he apologise for the “terrible” security situation in Iraq.
“I don’t think we should be apologising because we’re not causing the terrorism.
“It’s being caused by internal extremists who are linking up with external extremists. And 80-90% of that violence is in or around Baghdad and it’s being caused deliberately in order to stop the government of Iraq – which 12 million people voted for – from functioning.”
Pride
His assessment was at odds with comments by the former British envoy to Iraq, Sir Jeremy Greenstock.
Sir Jeremy, in the BBC documentary Blair: The Inside Story, said Mr Blair had taken his “eye off the ball” in the aftermath of the war and that no one in those early days had focussed on the security of Iraq.
“There was a vacuum from the beginning into which looters, saboteurs, the criminals, the insurgents moved very quickly.”
And Lord Butler, who chaired an inquiry into the intelligence behind the decision to go to war in Iraq, said in a House of Lords debate that Mr Blair did share some of the blame for post-war violence.
He said: “The prime minister’s centrist and informal approach to running the government prevented all the resources available in departments on this aspect from being brought into play.
“We know that the International Development Secretary at the time, Clare Short, tried repeatedly to get the Cabinet to focus on post-war Iraq and got short shrift for it.”
Sectarian violence
But Mr Blair has dismissed suggestions coalition forces had been unprepared for the aftermath of war, particularly the sectarian violence.
He told Radio 4 the Iraqi police force then was “an instrument of Saddam’s dictatorship” and it would always have been the case that it and the army had to be rebuilt “from scratch”.
“Now, you can argue about – and I’ve already been back over it myself – about whether you could have disbanded the army differently and so forth, but it isn’t the principal reason you’ve got a problem in Iraq,” he told the BBC.
“The principal reason you’ve got a problem is, as I say, because there are elements deliberately giving you that problem.”
Blair: The Inside Story will be broadcast on BBC Two at 2100 GMT, 27 February

An American appeals court has upheld an anti-terrorism provision that states that Guantanamo Bay inmates cannot challenge their detention in US courts.
The provision was a key element of a law for prosecuting terror suspects that President George W Bush sent through Congress last year.
The appeal court said civilian courts could not determine whether detainees were being held illegally.
The ruling is almost certain to go to the Supreme Court, correspondents say.
Last year that court threw out the government’s original plans for trying detainees before military commissions.
‘Enemy combatants’
The US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled 2-1 in favour of the provision in the Military Commissions Act.
Mr Bush had said he needed the new law to bring terror suspects to justice. It allows for the indefinite detention of foreigners as “enemy combatants”.
Writing in favour of the majority decision, Judge A Raymond Randolph said that accepting the arguments of lawyers on behalf of detainees “would be to defy the will of Congress”.
Dissenting Judge Judith W Rogers said district courts would be “well able to adjust these proceedings in light of the government’s significant interests in guarding national security”.
There are nearly 400 detainees being held at the Cuba detention centre.
Up to 80 are set to face the new military commissions.

February 19, 2007 1:51 PM
Justin Rood Reports:
The National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) won’t say what it plans to do with thousands of dollars in campaign donations it received from an accused terror financier.
Abdul Tawala Ibn Ali Alishtari gave $15,250 to the NRCC since 2002, according to FEC records published on the Web site opensecrets.org.
On Friday, Alishtari pled not guilty to funding terrorism and other crimes, including financial fraud.
The NRCC is the main political group dedicated to helping the Republican party win seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. Reached Monday morning for comment, an NRCC spokeswoman declined to discuss the matter on the record.
The indictment against Alishtari unsealed in Manhattan federal court Friday charges him with providing material support to terrorists by transferring $152,000 between banks to allegedly be used to purchase night-vision goggles and other equipment needed for a terrorist training camp.
Alishtari, aka Michael Mixon, was paid for his efforts to collect and transfer the funds, which included $25,000 sent from a bank in New York to a bank in Montreal, Canada, the indictment alleges.
Police and FBI agents arrested Alishtari in New York City on Friday. A day earlier, agents raided his Ardsley, N.Y. home, according to the “Lower Hudson Journal News.” When a reporter for the paper reached a woman claiming to be Alishtari’s wife on Friday and informed her of the charges, she cried and said he was innocent, the paper reported.
The NRCC would not confirm it had received donations from Mr. Alishtari, or that he had received numerous awards from the organization, as is claimed by an online list of personal accomplishments that appears to have been posted by Mr. Alishtari.
The list says he was made a life member of the NRCC’s “Inner Circle” and was named New York State Businessman of the Year by the group in 2003 and 2004. 
The NRCC “Businessperson of the Year” fundraising campaign, which gave such “awards” to at least 1,900 GOP donors, has been derided as a telemarketing scam by political watchdogs.
The online list also claims Alishtari was appointed to the president’s “USNRCC White House Business Advisory Group.”
An archived Web site for one of Alishtari’s companies, GlobalProtector.net, claims it had demonstrated a “Web filter” technology for officials at the Department of Defense’s Miami, Fla.-based Southern Command (SouthCom), which coordinates U.S. military operations in Central and South America and the Caribbean and oversees the controversial Guantanamo Bay detention facility.
SouthCom spokesman Steve Lucas would not confirm or deny any contacts between Alishtari and officials there. SouthCom personnel he spoke with said SouthCom does not use the company’s software, and could not rule out the possibility they had received a sales pitch from him or another company representative.
A database of unclassified federal contracts at FedSpending.org does not show SouthCom or any other government branch awarded business to Alishtari’s company.
A call to the telephone number which had been listed on GlobalProtector’s site connects to a recorded message offering the caller to “spark up your days and nights” by calling a 1-800 phone chat line.

So, Wednesday.  The day where poeple in a relationship can be really romantic in the hope of covering the fact that for the rest of the year they’re not.
Course I’m single so…
I started the evening watching Top gear.  In this episode, they tried to prove that it was easier to buy a car for a holiday in America than it was to reant one.  Starting in Miami with a $1,000 budget.  On the way they had to complete tasks from the amusing (tonight you’ll be camping out and eating only roadkill) to the, frankly, stupid and dangerous (paint slogans on each ohters cars that will get the driver shot or arrested in Alabama).
And then they reached New Orleans, their destination.  The segment was filmed a year after Hurricane Katrina struck, and the devistation was still stunning to see.  I think one of the hosts said it best when he said “How can the rest of America sleep at night knowing this is here?”
The aim when they reached New Orleans was to sell the cars and see who could make the biggest profit/lose the least amount of money.  But after what they’d seen, it didn’t feel right.  So they gave the cars away instead.
After Top gear, I had a shower and headed to the union where they were running Love By Numbers.  As the name kinda sorta suggests, everyone gets given a number.  There is a board on the stage.  If you spot someone you like then you can leave a message for their number.  And hopefully something good will happen for you.
Course the reality is that people leave wind up messages for their friends or messages for their existing partner.
Not that I’m bitter that I didn’t get any messages.  No, not at all.  I was speaking to this girl who is a geek, but sadly she also has a boyfriend.  Damn.
Thursday and Friday I didn’t do much.  Except on Friday I read my first Dashiel Hammnett story.  Or at least I was until two complete random strangers decided that they couldn’t leave me on my own and dragged me over to sit with them.  Good fun.  (Now, if only I could remember their names…)
Saturday listening to the Aberdeen – Celtic game.  We lost but at least we don’t have players who get injured while warming up :¬p
Sunday not much happened.  Untill I came back from the shop and saw a small black thing run across the hall.  Yeah, remember before when I said I thought we had mice?  Not so much with the thought any more.  Buggeration.
Last night was quiz night at the union.  As usual, I took part with my friend Nikki.  When I was at the bar inbetween rounds this idiot decides to show off to his friends by asking me to sing The Time Warp.  I ordered my drink, nudges one of his friends and asked him to point out to the guy that it was the wrong night for kareoke.
Oh, quick question for the folks who’ve used photobucket for sharing videos.  Is there a maximum file size?  Cos I’d like to post footage of me singing The Time Warp in here but it’s too big for myspace.
I’m on a bit of a rock kick on my mp3 player at the moment.  Nine Inch Nails, Nirvana, Offspring and Guns N Roses.  Is there any better feeling than listening to an album for the first time in ages and remembering exactly why you liked it in the first place?  That’s what the last couple of days have been like for me.  My favourite of the songs I’ve rediscovered, in lyric form:
November Rain
When I look into your eyes
I can see a love restrained
But darlin’ when I hold you
Don’t you know I feel the same
‘Cause nothin’ lasts forever
And we both know hearts can change
And it’s hard to hold a candle
In the cold November rain
We’ve been through this such a long long time
Just tryin’ to kill the pain
But lovers always come and lovers always go
An no one’s really sure who’s lettin’ go today
Walking away
If we could take the time to lay it on the line
I could rest my head
Just knowin’ that you were mine
All mine
So if you want to love me
then darlin’ don’t refrain
Or I’ll just end up walkin’
In the cold November rain
Do you need some time…on your own
Do you need some time…all alone
Everybody needs some time…on their own
Don’t you know you need some time…all alone
I know it’s hard to keep an open heart
When even friends seem out to harm you
But if you could heal a broken heart
Wouldn’t time be out to charm you
Sometimes I need some time…on my
own Sometimes I need some time…all alone
Everybody needs some time…on their own
Don’t you know you need some time…all alone
And when your fears subside
And shadows still remain, ohhh yeahhh
I know that you can love me
When there’s no one left to blame
So never mind the darkness
We still can find a way
‘Cause nothin’ lasts forever
Even cold November rain
Don’t ya think that you need somebody
Don’t ya think that you need someone
Everybody needs somebody
You’re not the only one
You’re not the only one 
Edited my last entry cos I kinda got one of the quotes wrong.  Whoopsiedoodle!  Also took the opertunity to remove all quote marks from the entry as well.
Was going to post the answers to my you think you know me entry, but thus far only one person has taken part so I’m gonna leave it a bit longer, just in case.
Found out the other day, while watching The Culture Show (what?) that Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds are recording a new album in the summer.  Yay!
Can’t think of anything else.
No, wait.  Pics!

Kari.  My mums dog.  AKA pest.

Greenfern Infants school.  The first school I attended.  I have great memories of the place which is why it’s sad to see that it’s closed and in that sort of state.
Now for more grafitti.
(Confession here.  I saw a great piece when I was home that said ‘sexy in latin’ but when I noticed it the batteries in my camera ran out before I could photograph it.  When I went back a few days later it had gone.  :¬( )

1371,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/us-wrestles-with-execution-question-3929609/,2007-02-18,US wrestles with execution question,"
By Iain Watson
BBC News, Washington
On a pitch black winter’s night at the Lady of Mercy church in the small town of Potomac, Maryland, about 50 people have braved sub-freezing temperatures to hear a chilling tale of an early death.
Vicki Schieber has come to talk about her daughter, Shannon.
Shannon was a student in nearby Pennsylvania.
She was raped and murdered at her hall of residence and the killer was caught only after he moved to a different state and committed another rape.
A transfixed audience listens to her mother’s hushed yet longing tones: “What do you do when this happens to you? The death of a family member is a tragedy of unimaginable proportions.”
Similar cases are often cited by supporters of capital punishment to argue that the families of murder victims get “closure” only when the killer is executed.
But Vicky Schieber is talking to an audience of abolitionists – those who want to end the death penalty in her home state of Maryland.
Ban plan
She says was pressed by state prosecutors to call for the death penalty for her daughter’s killer, but she refused.
“It was against everything I was brought up to believe. Taking another person’s life is wrong. Don’t put a question mark where God puts a period,” she told the crowd to spontaneous cheering.
Maryland may be about to become the first state to ban the death penalty outright since the United States reintroduced it more than 30 years ago.
State Senator Lisa Gladden, a lawyer who has defended those accused of murder, has introduced a bill to ban executions and has called exonerated death row inmates to testify this week.
Maryland’s new Democratic Governor Martin O’Malley has said he would be willing to sign any law which ended capital punishment.
Opponents of the death penalty like Sen Gladden believe that if Maryland outlaws capital punishment, other states will follow suit.
“We have to have courage, we can lead the way – I believe other states will think the death penalty is more trouble than it’s worth and will repeal” it, she says.
Temporary suspensions
Thirty-eight of the 50 US states have the death sentence on the statute books – but almost a third of them have placed temporary bans on executions.
The suspensions follow concerns about the possibility of wrongful convictions in some areas, and worries about the method of execution in others.
Late last year, the outgoing governor of Florida – President Bush’s brother Jeb – suspended executions when it was revealed it took prisoner Angel Diaz 34 minutes to die after a lethal cocktail of drugs was apparently injected into tissue rather than into his veins.
But while many of the temporary bans centre on technical and legal challenges to the death penalty, politicians in Maryland seem willing to take on the moral arguments.
The state legislature has a Democratic majority, but that does not mean Sen Gladden’s bill will pass automatically.
Even some Democrats are worried that a full frontal assault on the death penalty – rather than simply continuing with a moratorium on executions – could lead to an unwelcome counterattack by populist political opponents at the next election.
Strong support
Supporters of the death penalty think it likely that Maryland will formally abolish the ultimate sanction.
But they say the decision should be in the hands of all voters, and not just the politicians.
And that is because recent evidence suggests that even in states which currently have no death penalty, support for capital punishment remains strong.
Wisconsin was one of the first states to abolish capital punishment, in 1853. (Yes, 1853 not 1953).
Yet in a recent referendum, a narrow majority voted to re-instate it for the most vicious crimes, and on condition that DNA evidence of guilt was provided.
The referendum was not binding and the Democrat-controlled state legislature is unlikely to pass such a law.
But death penalty supporters cite Wisconsin’s vote as an example of the continuing popularity of the death penalty so long as voters – and juries – are convinced they are not sentencing potentially innocent people on the basis of unreliable evidence.
Will of the people?
Mike Paranzino runs the pressure group Throw Away the Key from the town of Kensington in Maryland and is a former adviser to senior Republican politicians.
He says a referendum would better inform the voters of his state, many of whom would be shocked not at the imposition the death penalty, but about how rarely it is used.
“At the moment, the people of Maryland don’t really know the ins and outs of how the death penalty is applied,” he argues.
“Most child killers are exempt from the death penalty. Serial killers are exempt unless they kill more than one person on the same day.
“In fact, the death penalty is underutilised -there have been 7,000 intentional murders since the death penalty was restored in Maryland and only a handful of killers executed.”
The anti-death penalty campaigners who listened to Vicky Schieber’s harrowing story were treated to polling evidence commissioned by Maryland CASE – Citizens Against State Execution.
They said the polls show a narrow majority in the state still supports the death penalty.
But when asked if they would find life in prison without the possibility of parole a suitable alternative, two-thirds of them said they would support that option.
But it’s unlikely this issue will be put to a popular vote.
And for the moment, existing evidence suggests Americans may be more queasy about how people are put to death – rather than why.

I’ve started writing the script for the myspace thing, based on something that happened in the union last night.  Strange where you get inspiration from sometimes.
The opening shot is hugely ambitious but if it works will be absolutely spectacular.  If I get to do it on my current budget of, well, nothing.  I can imagine the folk a friend is going to hopefully hook me up with for filming (I do have a camcorder but don’t think filming on it is quite suitable for the competition) reading the script and saying ‘absolutely not’.
I did come up with a way to finish the script off, but now I really think about it, it’s not so good.  Thing is, I’m used to feeling like this when I’ve finished writing something, but not during.  So I’m not entirely sure if I should scrap it completely or not.
Hell, it’s only a 5 – 10 min script, I might just write it anyway.
For the past couple of days I’ve taken my laptop into the library to download some stuff.  After jumping through the not inconsiderable hoops they’ve asked me to for using the wifi connection, now it won’t bloody well let me connect.  So I have given up.  I did get connected long enough to download some of the stuff but the rest will have to go onto my MP3 player.  Grrrrr!
I did something recently that really hurt someone and now they’re not talking to me.  And I hate it, because I consider this person to be a close friend and I’m not entirely sure why what happened hurt them as much as it did.  As they won’t respond to my emails and won’t talk to me on MSN I can’t find out nor can I apologise.
So, I guess I’m stuck.

1376,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/obama-launches-presidential-bid-3929604/,2007-02-09,Obama launches presidential bid,"
Democratic Senator Barack Obama has officially launched his presidential campaign with a speech in Illinois.
Mr Obama is considered by many to be the first African-American candidate with a realistic chance of winning.
He, along with Senator Hillary Clinton, is leading the race for the Democratic Party’s nomination for the 2008 vote.
But the BBC’s James Coomarasamy in Washington says he has little national experience, causing some to question if his skills match his ambition.
A large crowd of supporters had braved the sub-zero temperatures in Springfield, Illinois to watch Mr Obama make his announcement.
In the shadow of the building where Abraham Lincoln called for Americans to unite against slavery, Mr Obama said: “I stand before you today to announce my candidacy for President of the United States of America,” causing the crowd to cheer and chant his name.
As he declared his candidacy Mr Obama acknowledged that some consider him too inexperienced to take on such a role saying: “I know that I have not spent a long time learning the ways of Washington, but I have been there long enough to know that the ways of Washington have to change.”
Changing politics
Ahead of Saturday’s speech in the city of Springfield Mr Obama appeared in an online video message to his supporters.
In it he expressed a desire to re-engage with people on a grass roots level, saying that together they are beginning “a great journey to take our country back and fundamentally change the nature of politics”.
Instead of being cynical about politics he asked people to believe in the possibility they can make an impact on people’s everyday lives.
Mr Obama burst on to the national scene two-and-a-half years ago, delivering a stirring keynote speech at the Democratic party convention.
His declaration that there was no white or black America, but a United States of America helped him win a seat in the US Senate that year and subsequently set him on a fast track to vie for the White House.
Time magazine has dubbed Mr Obama “America’s hottest political phenomenon” and US chat show host Oprah Winfrey urged him to announce his candidacy on her programme.
But instead he chose to launch his presidential campaign on the very spot where Abraham Lincoln once denounced the divisions in America caused by slavery.
Experience under fire
However, unlike previous black presidential candidates, Mr Obama was not part of the civil rights movement, which, according to our correspondent, makes some African-Americans wary of him.
His mixed race heritage – with a white mother from Kansas, and a black father from Kenya – has in fact led some observers to suggest that he is an African and an American, but not an African-American.
Though undoubtedly ambitious and charismatic, with relatively little national experience and formidable opponents, including Clinton, many question whether he can really secure the Democratic nomination, and whether he has the depth of policy to match.
Mr Obama has tried to answer critics in recent weeks, our correspondent says, introducing a bill that calls for the phased redeployment of US troops from Iraq.

Star Wars character impersonator allegedly attacks Hollywood tour guide
Reuters
Updated: 3:53 p.m. ET Feb. 3, 2007
LOS ANGELES – A Chewbacca impersonator was arrested after being accused of head-butting a Hollywood tour guide who warned the furry brown Wookiee about harassing two Japanese tourists, police said Saturday.
Nobody tells this Wookiee what to do, Chewie from the Star Wars movies said before slamming his head into the guides forehead, the Los Angeles Times newspaper reported.
The 6-foot, 5-inch-tall 44-year-old man was charged Friday with misdemeanor battery and later released on $20,000 bail, the Los Angeles Police Department said.
Superman and other movie and cartoon impersonators were reported to be witnesses to the aggression in front of Graumans Chinese Theatre amid concern that such behavior could endanger their livelihoods.
Street performers at the world-famous cinema collect tips from tourists by posing for photos, but some are known to turn hostile if they dont get money.
Two years ago, Mr. Incredible, Elmo the Muppet and the dark-hooded character from the movie Scream were arrested for aggressive begging, the L.A. Times reported.

A quick history of the Manics:
The band consisted of lead singer/rhythm guitarist James Dean Bradfield, bass guitarist Nicky Wire, drummer Sean Moore and lead guitarist Richey Edwards.  The truth is that Richey couldnt actually play and was in the band because a) he was a lifelong friend of the others, b) looked good and c) was good at interviews.  The songwriting was divided between the four with James and Richey writing the lyrics and Nicky and Sean taking care of the music.
They signed to Sony records and announced that they would release one album (a double album at that) and then split.  The result was Generation Terrorist which was stretched a bit thin for a double.  On the album the band revealed their influences (mostly Guns N Roses) and, after failing to get Kylie Minogue to sing on the album, they got Traci Lords instead.  (Ironically, the band would later be asked to write songs for Kylie.)
They promptly didnt split and released Gold Against The soul.  Not their best by any stretch of the imagination the band later admitted it was over produced (they spent £2,000 a day and, for one song surrounded the drum kit with over 20 microphones).
In the midst of this was Richeys mental state.  He was prone to severe mood swings and self harming.  In one interview, after the band were accused of faking their attitude, Richey produced a razor blade and calmly carved 4 REAL into his forearm while he spoke.  Richey wrote most of, produced and even performed on the bands third album The Holy Bible, which is widely recognised as being their best album.
Shortly before the albums release, Richey was committed due to his issues.  The band, fierce socialists, were condemned for pulling Richey out of a NHS hospital and placing him in The Priory.  The band argued that all they were doing was looking out for their friend.
Then, on the day he and James were due to fly to the States to promote the album, Richey disappeared, leaving all his possessions behind (including his passport).  Though his car was found near a notorious suicide spot, Richey has yet to be found.
The band took a break, as you may expect.  Then James wrote a poem and sent it to Nicky.  Nicky took a few verses and A Design For Life was born.  The band then wrote an entire album and the rest, as they say, is history.
So, why do I like the band?  First of all, their resilience.  After the disappearance of their long time friend, it would have been easy for them to call it a day.  But they came back and, it could be argued, became bigger than they were before.
Secondly are Nickys interviews.  Nicky is one of those people who will say what he wants and damn the results.  (Though he has admitted he may regret wishing HIV on Michael Stipe).
Next is their strength in their beliefs.  To promote the album Know Your Enemy they played a gig in Cuba, pricing the tickets at the equivalent of 7p.  They got to meet Castro twice who proclaimed that they were louder than war.  Also, they are probably the only band to have a number one single about the Spanish Civil war.
Now, the music:
I know I said two songs per band and there are actually three.  But it was the only way to get one of the songs here.  The first video is James performing acoustic versions of She Is Suffering and 4st 7lb, both from The Holy Bible.  While She Is Suffering is a good song its 4st 7lb I wanted here.  The song is about anorexia (the title is apparently the weight at which the sufferer is closest to death) and is easily my favourite Manics song.  And this version shows exactly why I think James is one of the most underrated singers in the industry today.
The second song is The Masses Against The Classes.  Not on any albums (apart from the greatest hits) this was the bands first release of the 21st Century and was deleted the day it was released so however many were originally sent out to the shops, thats how many there are in circulation (and my copy got nicked :¬( ).  Its an amazing song and shows the bands more political side.
So, the videos.  Enjoy.

So, on Monday night, I got home after the quiz and decided to watch me some Angel.  Setteled down on front of my computer, watched Bad Karma (the ‘lost’ My Name Is Earl poilot) then Angel.  about half way through the episode, I hear a squeaking.
Fucksocks.  That’d better not be what I think it is.
Finally got round to gutting a cupboard in the kitchen yesterday.  Removed all the food in there, the cups, plates and pans (which’ll all need to be washed) and swept it out as there was muesli everywhere.  Went to look in thecupboard today and droppings everywhere.
Yup, we have mice.
A friend is going to lend me a couple of traps and hopefully that’ll sort the problem.  Also need to warn the people in the flat downstairs as they’ll have them as well.
Can someone plase remind me what an esay life is again?
The writing is going…
Actually it’s not.  Not cos i’m blocked or anything, just haven’t sat down to actually do any more recently.  Hopeing to get more done this weekend.
Still not found work 🙁
Can I officially nominate July as Harry Potter month?  Not only is the next film released on the 13th but the last book is out on the 21st.  Can’t wait.  That’ll be another (and the last) midnight trip to Waterstones for me.
Glad to see that people seemed to like the music entrey.  Look for another one soonish (just need to decide who it’s going to be).
One last thing.  Ever wondered which bands are gay?  Stress no more!  Someone’s worked it out for you!

This is inspired by  Shukhevychs music entries.  Unlike Shuk, however, Im going to use these to talk about some of my favourite bands and let you hear a couple of my favourite songs by them.  There will, however, be a few surprise entries.
I was first introduced to the music of The Beatles when I watched a documentary about the making of Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band.  I liked the music, asked for, and got, the album for my birthday and it spent so long in my personal stereo that the tape broke.
The first thing to notice about the band is the talent.  John on rhythm guitar, Paul on bass.  Georges awesome performances on lead guitar.  And I dont care what anyone says, listen to A Day In The Life, where the drumming style changes at least twice, and then tell me he is not the best drummer ever.
But the incredible talent isnt just shown on the instruments.  In any other band, any band whatsoever, George Harrison would have been the main songwriter.  In The Beatles, however, he was third behind Lennon and McCartney.  And it wasnt the writing together that made them so damn good, it was the competition between them, encouraging them to try and top each others last song.  And while Ringo may not be the best songwriter in the world he still wasnt too shabby.  Octopuss Garden is infused with joy and an amazing childlike quality.
Also, forget Bowie or Madonna, The Beatles showed the music world how to reinvent yourself.  It would have been easy for them to wither and die during the start of psychedelia, but they took it head on and won (admittedly, with the help of copious amounts of drugs).
Its a shame things had to end the way they did (listening to How Do You Sleep (a not even veiled attack on Paul) on the Imagine album is hard going) but perhaps it was for the best.  I doubt if they would have gone on to be like the Stones and at least they went out on a high.
And now the music.
The first song is Strawberry Fields Forever, which is one of the best songs never to make it to number one in Britain (it was beaten to the top by Please Release Me).  I believe the Americans showed a bit more taste.  The next one I was pleasantly surprised to find on youtube.  Its While My Guitar Gently Weeps, but its the demo version which is version very slightly remixed for the Love album.
Anyhoo, on with the music!

So, I’m still using the computers in the university LRC.  And earlier on the fire alarm went off.  Virtually no-one moved until someone said the above line.  I’m sitting not far from one of the fire escapes so I took the opertunity to open the thing.  Turns out it was a false alarm.
But, really, how much of a sign do you need that there is a problem with the alarms when peoples first reaction is to actually do nothing?  I swear to Bob that we would actually need to see flames before moving.
I think I’ve found a way to solve the pacing problems in my script that I mentioned before.  At least for now.  It does mean creating a new(ish) character, which unfortunately means naming him 🙁  (Naming characters is one of the hardest things about the whole process.)  So, if any of my male readers would like to have a hired heavy named after them in the script, let me know.  Also if you have any suggestions.  (Yes, I know, I’m lazy :¬p)
It also means I’m about to write the first fight scene I’ve ever written.  I don’t mean as in verbal arguments, I mean actual fisticuffs.  We’ll see how it goes.
I’m slightly torn about something.  I’m tempted to send a copy of what I’ve done so far to them’s who said they’d like to read it (once i’ve got email addresses) but then there’s the thing about never showing anyone a work in progress.  Hmmm.  Any thoughts?
I was going to get some writing done last night but I ended up watching Top Gear instead.  It was the first show since Richard Hammonds accident and they showed the crash.  The look on the other two presenters faces was one of complete shock and mines probably was as well.  How the hell he not only survived after crashing at just under 300mph but travelling upside down at 230mph but is not up and fine (apart from now liking celery) is completely beyond me.  May be slightly morbid but it made facinating viewing.
And, yes, I know I said this entry would be the new thing.  I did write that entry, cut it to spell check it in Word, IE crashed and it disappeared from the clipboard.  It will be my next entry.  Hope it was worth the wait.

So, what’s been happening in my life since I last wrote?  Not a lot.
I’ve got more of that script done and am now up to 10 pages.  Only thing is I think I may have a slight pacing problem with it.  I’ll keep going and see where I end up.
But apart from the pacing thing I’m quite pleased with it so far.  I’ve introduced most of the characters, it’s all flowing well and none of them are saying anything they wouldn’t do.  Dunno if that last bit makes any sense to you lot but I know exactly what I’m on about, which is good.
Just got one thing to sort out, but it may be a while before I get there so there’s still time.  Thankfully.
On Friday I had jury duty.  Kinda.  One of my friends is conducting research for her dissertation and I volunteered to take part.  And it was actually quite good fun.  We read through a ‘transcript’ of a courst case (based on a real life case) and then debated.  We then voted on whether we thought the guy was guilty or innocent.  All good fun.
Still job hunting and still getting nowhere.  Grrr.  I have, however, convinced a friend to buy my old, broken laptop for £250.  So, now to get it back from Toshiba.
(In case anyone thinks I’ve ripped him off a. he knows it’s broken and b. he runs his own computer repair business and will likely use it for spare parts.)
So, that’s my life right now.  Next entry I’m going to try something which will hopefully become a regular series.  We’ll see.

…’04 presidential recount
By M.R. Kropko
ASSOCIATED PRESS
3:08 p.m. January 24, 2007
CLEVELAND  Two election workers were convicted Wednesday of rigging a recount of the 2004 presidential election to avoid a more thorough review in Ohio’s most populous county.
Jacqueline Maiden, elections coordinator of the Cuyahoga County Elections Board, and ballot manager Kathleen Dreamer each were convicted of a felony count of negligent misconduct of an elections employee. They also were convicted of one misdemeanor count each of failure of elections employees to perform their duty.
Prosecutors accused Maiden and Dreamer of secretly reviewing preselected ballots before a public recount on Dec. 16, 2004. They worked behind closed doors for three days to pick ballots they knew would not cause discrepancies when checked by hand, prosecutors said.
Defense attorney Roger Synenberg has said the workers were following procedures as they understood them.
Ohio gave President Bush the electoral votes he needed to defeat Democratic Sen. John Kerry in the close election and hold on to the White House in 2004.
Special prosecutor Kevin Baxter did not claim the workers’ actions affected the outcome of the election  Kerry gained 17 votes and Bush lost six in the county’s recount.
Maiden and Dreamer, who still work for the elections board, face a possible sentence of six to 18 months for the felony conviction. Sentencing is on Feb. 26.
A message left for Elections Board Director Michael Vu was not immediately returned Wednesday. The board released a statement that said its goal is to restore confidence in the county’s election progress and pursue reforms in addition to those made since 2004.

1389,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/racism-on-primetime-british-television-3929591/,2007-01-22,Racism on primetime British television,"
NB: this is the first of an irregular series where, instead of just copy-pasting articles from other websites, I’m going to give my perspective on things.  If you have any ideas for stuff for me to write about (UKcentric stuff preferred) leave a note.
At the moment on Channel 4 (one of Britains terrestrial channels, meaning that anyone can watch it) there is a series called Celebrity Big Brother.  A “spin off” from reality show Big Brother, this version features, as implied by the title, “celebrities” (usually people whose star is on the wane/people who you can barely remember in the first place).
But this year it’s been marred by incidents that have actually become so big that the governments of two different countries have become embroiled.
I won’t torture you by listing all the contestants on CBB, I’ll just introduce you to the main players:
Shilpa Shetty:

Shetty was a surprise entry to this years CBB.  Not well known by most Brits, she is a major star in Bollywood having appeared in about 50 films.
Danielle Lloyd:

Miss Lloyd is famous for two things.  1) being a WAG (Wife And Girlfriend).  On entering the house she was dating West Ham star Teddy Sherringham.  2) being sacked as Miss Great Britain in disgrace when it was revealed (by her during an interview) that she was dating judge Sherringham at the time of the contest.
Jo O’Mera:

Former singer with the band S Club 7 (later changed to S Club) has not really done anything of note since the band split.  And finally,
Jade Goody:

Famous for, well, appearing on the third series of Big Brother and a host of reality shows since then.
So, here’s how it went.
Jade was introduced to the house the Friday after the show started along with her mother Jackiey (famous for being, well, Jade’s mother) and boyfriend Jack (guess why he’s famous?  Apparently he’s also a football agent in which case he ain’t that good at his job).
Having already seen two contestants walk out of the house due to her behaviour, Jade then turned her attention to Shipla.  And Jo and Danielle joined in.
Between them they said such stunning things as:
“You need a day in the slums. Go in your community and go to all those people who look up to you and be real.”
“Indian people are so thin because they undercook their food and eat with their hands.”
“I think she should f**k off home.” 
But the absolute highlight was when Jade referred to Shipla as “Shipla Poppadom.  Her argument for the nickname?
“She’s Indian and so will have an Indian nickname.  It’s not racist.  Most Indians would not have a problem with that nickname.”
OFCOM were flooded with complaints.  In fact, the show is now the most complained about in British television history (40,000 to be exact).  Effigies of Jade were burnt in India.  The Indian government commented.  Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and David Cameron (Tory leader) all commented.
The Carphone Warehouse, main sponsors of the show, pulled their sponsorship after warning C4 that they would have no choice but to do so if nothing was done.
And how did Channel 4 react, exactly?
They refused to pull the show off the air.  They failed to remove Jade, Jo and Danielle.
Instead they made comments about sparking debate in Britain.  They (naturally) watched the ratings climb.
Oh, and they put both Jade AND Shipla up for eviction Friday just gone.  Which, of course, was immediately turned into a referendum over whether or not Britain is actually racist.  (A view held by Gordon Brown, amongst others.)
As expected, Jade was evicted with 82% of the vote.  There were no crowds for the eviction, no press conference after her eviction interview and Jade was taken to a safe house afterwards.
Meanwhile, Shipla’s mother has said that, despite not liking Jade, she’s worried for her safety and appealed for calm.
What does this mean for the four?  Shipla is now favourite to win the series outright with bookmakers no longer actually taking bets.  She’s also expected to become the first Bollywood star to truly cross over to the West.
Jade’s career (if you can call it that) should be over.  The Perfume Shop has already decided to stop stocking her perfume ‘Shhh!’.  (The name of her perfume also mirrors the advice she should have followed.)  But it won’t be.  The “rehabilitation” has already begun.  And I can virtually guarantee that some enterprising production company (probably Endemol (the company responsible for BB) themselves) will have a fantastic idea for a documentary whereby Jade travels to India to learn about the people and the culture.
Danielle has already lost a modelling contract and her boyfriend.  The later is no surprise considering that Sheringham is a) actively involved in the Kick Racism Out Of Football campaign and b) one third of his team-mates are coloured.  Her career will be affected.  But she’ll likely claim that Jade bullied her into it and, erm, get her tits out to distract half the population of the country (the ultimate in “Look!  Shiny thing!).  She’ll turn to glamour modelling and will probably be fine.
Jo’s career is the most likely screwed.  Considering she became famous for being in a band who’s target audience were kids.  She’s already had her comeback gig at GAY nightclub cancelled after a vote on the clubs website.  She too will claim that Jade bullied her into it.  Expect her to also make an issue of the fact that one of her S Club band mates was coloured.
As for Channel 4?  Well, even if Carphone Warehouse does permanently pull their sponsorship for BB (at the moment it’s CBB only), they will have companies lining up to replace them.  Viewing figures have gone up for a show that actually wasn’t doing that well and they’ve all the money from the eviction vote calls/texts.  (Although they are contributing money from the last vote to charity, in fairness.)
Still, they must have learnt from their mistakes right?
Erm, well…
Y’see they’ve another reality show that started on Sunday.  And unlike CBB, this one goes out in a teatime slot.
One of the contestants on the show is 18 year old Lucy Buchanan.  This is what she had to say on the first episode:
“When I look out at what Britain is, it’s just a complete mess. 
“I don’t appreciate how people come into our country and take over our country. Britain’s really not Britain anymore. 
“My mind is completely open to different cultures, but I don’t think they should bring them to Britain.” 
She added: “I don’t like fat people, I don’t really like really ugly people, I don’t like it when foreigners come into this country and they don’t take on British culture and British values. 
“I’m for the British Empire and things. I’m for slavery, but that’s never going to come back.” 
Yeah.  There really is no way to describe that other thanracist.
And C4 actually haven’t.  The argument this time is that whenever Lucy airs opinions like this, the other contestants verbally slap her down.  Which is actually a very good point and didn’t happen on CBB (perhaps because the other contestants were scared that they’d be next).
But still.  Allowing that to go out directly in the aftermath of the CBB thing wasn’t exactly a good idea.  So I’d suggest that changes need to be made in the upper levels of C4.
Chances are, it won’t happen though.

1390,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/crowded-house-plan-world-tour-3929590/,2007-01-22,Crowded House ‘plan world tour’,"
Australian and New Zealand band Crowded House are set to reform for a world tour 11 years after they spilt, according to newspaper reports. 
Singer Neil Finn and bass player Nick Seymour are currently seeking drummers in Australia, with more auditions planned for New Zealand and the US. 
The band’s original drummer, Paul Hester, committed suicide in 2005. 
Crowded House, whose hits include Distant Sun, will confirm the tour this week, New Zealand’s Dominion Post said. 
Farewell concert 
Julia Connolly, a spokeswoman for Finn’s office, told the newspaper that auditions were planned in Auckland and Los Angeles. 
“At the moment, they’re just working at getting the band together,” she said. 
“Something’s formally coming out once the band is in place.” 
Crowded House, headed by New Zealand-born Finn, formed in Melbourne, Australia, in 1986. 
They had hits with songs such as Better Be Home Soon, Weather With You, and Don’t Dream It’s Over. 
In November 1996, the band performed in front of 120,000 people outside Sydney Opera House for their farewell concert. 
Since then Finn embarked on a solo career, and worked with his brother Tim, who was also a member of Crowded House for a short time. 
Seymour works as a music producer, while Hester became a TV and radio personality in Australia, before taking his own life at the age of 46.

So, ex flatmate (and flatmates ex) has finally moved out.  The flat is a hell of a lot less cluttered than it was before.
And thankfully, her and flatmate have come to an agreement over the NTL (it was in her name, neither him nor me can get it in ours) so should hopefully have internet at home by the end of the weak.  So I can stop using these slow arse computers with a version of IE which is more unstable than any other I’ve experienced (which is saying a lot).
I’m doing better.  Finally got my head sorted out.  Now, just to work on my life.
I also finally, finally got writing on the script idea I’ve been nursing for about 6 months but have been too blocked to actually write.
It’s a noirish film set on the mean streets of Aberdeen.  (No, really.)  Will probably have a lot of pop culture references, does have someone looking out over the ocean, a main character who’s a stoner and doesn’t even want to be involved, good use of the smoking ban in Scotland, and end scene in outside a nightclub which is under a bridge (no, really) and one bit (hopefully about 5 nimutes but more likely to be 2 – 3) all in Doric with no subtitles (my homage to The Godfather) in which everything is explained including somethings you’ll never find out otherwise.
As usual, if you’re interested in reading/critiquing it (bear in mind it will be about 90 pages), let me know and I’ll be in touch nearer the time.
I’ve finally caved in and got myself on facebook.  Search for William Charles Forbes.  If you wanna, that is.
And now I must depart and take part in the quiz at the union.  Have fun peeps!

…In Picking the Berry Worst of 2006 
Little Man and Sharon Stones Basic Instinct 2  lead
with seven nods each, Bloodrayne , Lady In The Water ,
Wicker Man also Worst Picture nominees. 
Any honest Academy member will admit that Oscar voters are dealing with slim pickings for 2006. But at the other end of the quality scale, voters for this year’s 27th Annual RAZZIE® Awards had literally dozens of deserving contenders to choose from. And choose they haveand RAZZ the nominees they will, in ceremonies to be held at 7:30pm/PST on Oscar eve, Saturday, February 24 at Hollywood’s Ivar Theatre. 
Heading the dis-honor roll of Worst Achievements in Film this year are a lascivious murder mystery that turned out to be a laugh riot, and a comedy nearly as devoid of laughs as SCHINDLER’S LIST: Sharon Stone as a “femme fatale” The L.A. Times called “footloose and panty-free” in BASIC INSTINCT 2 and Shawn and Marlon Wayans in their brother Keenan Ivory Wayans’ blatant knock-off of a 1954 Bugs Bunny cartoon, LITTLE MAN. Each racked up 7 shots at the spray-painted gold statuettes no one in Hollywood really wants to “win.” Joining these films in the final circle as Worst Picture nominees are M. Night Shyamalan’s brain-dead bedtime story (and box office dud) LADY IN THE WATER, Oscar winner Nicolas Cage donning an unconvincing bear suit in the laugh-out-loud funny remake of the Australian thriller WICKER MAN, and a film helmed by the man many Internet users consider the worst director alive today, Uwe Boll’s BLOODRAYNE. 
The Wayans brothers and Cage will be competing for Worst Actor of 2006 against last year’s “winner” Rob Schneider in BENCHWARMERS, former TV funnyman Tim Allen, with a trio of terrible titles (SANTA CLAUSE 3, SHAGGY DOG and ZOOM) and Larry the Cable Guy (Dan Whitney) as Larry the Cable Guy in LARRY THE CABLE GUY: HEALTH INSPECTOR. Vying with Stone for Worst Actress will be repeat offender Jessica Simpson (nominated this year for EMPLOYEE OF THE MONTH), teen-idol (and terrible role model) Lindsay Lohan in JUST MY LUCK, newcomer Kristanna Loken in BLOODRAYNE and spelling-challenged risible siblings Hilary and Haylie Duff in MATERIALS GIRLS. Other well-known names and former Oscar darlings getting dinged with Golden Raspberry nods for 2006 include Ben Kingsley, Martin Short and Danny DeVito competing as Worst Supporting Actor, and RAZZIE® regulars Jenny McCarthy and Carmen Electra competing with LOST star Michelle Rodriguez, Kristin Chenoweth and Kate Bosworth (as an ultra-lame Lois Lane in SUPERMAN RETURNS) for Worst Supporting Actress. This year’s newest RAZZIE® category salutes the dearth of quality G and PG rated movie fare in 2006: Nominated as Worst Excuse for Family Entertainment are DECK THE HALLS, GARFIELD 2, RV, SANTA CLAUSE 3 and SHAGGY DOG. Links to the complete list of nominees are on the left column of this page. 
The RAZZIES® were created in 1980 by lifelong cinemaniac and cynic John Wilson, author of both THE OFFICIAL RAZZIE® MOVIE GUIDE and EVERYTHING I KNOW I LEARNED AT THE MOVIES. Nominees were determined by mailing ballots to 737 Golden Raspberry Foundation members throughout 42 US states and more than a dozen foreign countries. Should they choose to accept their RAZZIES® “winners” receive a gold-spray-painted, golf-ball-sized raspberry atop a mangled super 8 film reel, with an estimated street value of $4.97.

Bill Richardson, governor of the US state of New Mexico, has become the latest Democrat to declare an interest in the 2008 presidential election. 
He has announced that he is setting up a presidential exploratory committee, the first step in the race. 
Mr Richardson would become the first Hispanic president, if elected. 
Former First Lady Hillary Clinton and African-American Senator Barack Obama are also running in what correspondents say will be a highly diverse contest. 
Mr Richardson, 59, has served in a number of senior government posts. He was energy secretary, and the US ambassador to the United Nations during Bill Clinton’s presidency. 
He is also a former congressman, and would hope to mobilise the considerable Hispanic vote in the US. 
However, he does not have the level of support enjoyed by Senator Clinton, Senator Obama or John Edwards, who was John Kerry’s running mate for the Democrats in the 2004 election. 
New Clinton White House? 
“I am taking this step because we have to repair the damage that’s been done to our country over the last six years,” said Mr Richardson, in a statement announcing his move. 
“Our reputation in the world is diminished, our economy has languished, and civility and common decency in government has perished.” 
His move comes a day after Senator Hillary Clinton announced her candidacy, saying: “I’m in – and I’m in to win.” 
Senator Clinton said she planned to answer questions in web chats on three consecutive nights, starting on Monday. 
She is currently serving as a senator for New York, having won a second term by a landslide last November. 
Correspondents say her unbeatable name recognition and unmatched fundraising ability make her a clear front runner for the Democrats.

So, I’m getting things sorted in my head.  Not quite there yet but an improvement over the last few days.
Yesterday I said something to someone that I knew would hurt them.  And I know that I worried a lot of you with my last few entries.  I wish I could sit here and write that I’m sorry.
Unfortunately, I can’t.  Cos I’m really not.
The reason that I’m not is because, for the first time in this miserable, fucked up existance that I laughingly call a life I’m putting myself first.  Not other people.
Selfish?  Hell yeah.  Do I particularly care?  Have you actually read this entry?
And, no, I still don’t want to talk about it, before you ask.

I’ll fake it through the day
With some help from Johnny Walker Red
Send the poison rain down the drain
To put bad thoughts in my head
Two tickets torn in half
And a lot of nothing to do
Do you miss me, Miss Misery
Like you say you do? 
A man in the park
Read the lines in my hand
Told me Im strong
Hardly ever wrong I said man you mean
You had plans for both of us
That involved a trip out of town
To a place I’ve seen in a magazine
That you left lying around
I dont have you with me but
I keep a good attitude
Do you miss me, miss misery
Like you say you do? 
I know you’d rather see me gone
Than to see me the way that I am
But I am in the life anyway
Next door the TV’s flashing
Blue frames on the wall
Its a comedy of errors, you see
Its about taking a fall
To vanish into oblivion
Is easy to do
And I try to be but you know me
I come back when you want me to
Do you miss me Miss Misery
Like you say you do?

Central Reservation Affiliated Press:
Dr. who actor David Tennant has ended weeks of speculation and announced that he will indeed be leaving the show during it’s fourth series.
But the reason he’s leaving isn’t for fear of being typecast or because of the long and hectic shooting schedule.
Inside sources have revealed that Tennant, last seen on the big screen in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, will be announced within the next few days as having secured the lead role in the forthcoming Wonder Woman film.
Joss Whedon, the writer and director for the film, commented, “After I saw Tennants performance on The Friday Night Show as The Doctors companion I instantly knew that the search was over.”
When asked about the challenge of playing Wonder Woman, Tennant said, “At the moment I play the tenth incarnation of a  900+ year old time travelling alien.  After that, anythings possible.”
A spokesperson for the BBC said, “We are naturally disappointed that David has decided to leave the series, despite the fact we have not actually commissioned a fourth series yet.  However, we realise that the Wonder Woman role is too big for any actor to turn down and we wish him all the best.”
The spokesperson has added that the search for Tennants replacement is currently underway.
No release date for Wonder Woman has been announced.

Central Reservation Affiliated Press:
Downing Street comfirmed today that the Prime Minister will issue a “full, frank and sincere” apology to America during the next session of Prime Ministers questions.
The apology is regarding the move to LA Galaxy by David Beckham who will be joined by his wife Victoria.
Mr Blair is expected to point out that while a lot of Premiership clubs were reportedly interested in signing Beckham, the fact that none were willing to meet his demands lead to this catastrophic event.
The apology mirrors the one issued to Spain in 2003 when Beckham moved from Manchester United to Real Madrid.
There is no word yet if the Spanish government plans to issue a similar apology.
A spokesman for the White House said that unless an apology was issued the move would be seen as “tandamount to an act of war.”
“The only bright side to the whole situation is the effect on the American economy.  After all, what does Victoria Beckham do, if not shop?”
There was no comment from Mr Beckham, Real Madrid or LA Galaxy.

So, Friday I ended up drinking in the union with a couple of friends, just generally shooting the shit and putting the world to rights.  Hell, it beats the soul destroying having to look for a full time job cos someone else fucked things up for me.
So, one of my friends left and I was left with a crazy lesbian from Canadia (and no, that’s not a typo.  Might explain later).  She decided that she wants to go to a gay bar and asks if I want to go along.  I say sure, why not?  a) beats drinking on my own and b) possibility of kareoke.
So we go along, after I get more cash and she makes a phone call and yay! they do have kareoke that night!  We get drinks and my friend introduces me to the barmaid as…
John.
And then she realises her mistake.  They then chat for a bit and then we meet another of my friends friends and she intrioduces me to her as…
Wait for it…
You won’t believe this (unless, of course, you do)…
John.
So I decide that if she’s going to keep calling me John, I should get to call her Lou.  She’s fine with that as long as I call her Luke.
So, yeah.  Luke my lesbian friend from Canadia.  Did I mention that neither of us are particularly sane?
I sing on kareoke, have a bit too much to drink, flirt outrageously with a girl and generally have fun.
(A quick aside: it’s strange.  Normally when I meet someone of to opposite sex for the first time I’m incredibly quiet.  But when it’s in a gay bar I can flirt for Britain.)
Anyway, I’m going to go because my hands don’t seem to be working anymore and this took way longer and with way more typos than it really should have.
But before I go, I’ll repeat the question I asked in a previous entry:

The rules:
1. List ten things you want to say to 10 people but know you never will.
2. Don’t say who they are.
3. Readers feel free to comment, but know the writer will not confirm or answer anything.
4. Never discuss it again.
1) You don’t know how much you hurt me.  Seriously, the problem I have with you is that I don’t like you and I don’t hate you.  I have no feelings whatsoever towards you and that’s something I hate.  Incidentally, there is a very specific reason I picked that day to confront you.
2) I am very grateful having you in my life.  But you once asked me to do something for you, something which is simple common courtesy.  But you wouldn’t do the same for me.  And that hurts.
3) You are my best friend and my support structure.  Thank you.
4) One of the simple pleasures about me returning home is the knowledge I’ll get to hang out with you again.
5) Thank you for years of support despite the fact I tend to be a fuck up.
6) What you did to me was cold.  You do realise that it’s not just one life you’ve fucked about with, don’t you?
7) You taught me more than probably anyone else I’ve had as a teacher.  I’m eternally grateful.
8) You, on the other hand, were crap.  I learned more through trial and error than you ever taught me.  There’s no point in saying something is wrong without pointing out why.  FYI: if they want to sack you it’s not racism.  It’s cos you shouldn’t be in the job in the first place.

Due to the aforementioned internet issues at the flat, I’m using a friends log in details in the university library to go online (which is majorly annoying due to whichever bastard version of IE they use being roughly as stable as building the Transporter bridge on a foundation of incorrectly set jelly).  So, as I’m not allowed to smoke in here I head to the union.  As it’s fricking freezing outside.
I find a seat, perch on it, light up and decide “Hmmm, this really is not that comfortable.”  Placing my feet on a bar on the chair, as I have done countless times, I put my weight on it and CRACK!
The sodding bar falls off.
After my smoke i picked it up and headed to the bar to report it.  Unfortunately, it was one of the bar managers I spoke to.  But I know him so we had a bit of a laugh about it and the took the chair away to be fixed.
Forgot to mention yesterday but I finally got my hands on Love by the Beatles.  It’s the one they did for a Cirque de Soliel show and it’s amazing.  What they’ve done is, rather than using just the songs that you know and love, George Martin and his son Giles ripped the songs apart into their respective tracks and completely remixed the lot.  So you’ll be listening to one song and suddenly hear bits from a completely different song.  The best example of this is Strawberry Fields Forever.  Yoko gave them a copy of the original demo and what they’ve done is crafted the song so that it progresses from this version (with a change in the opening line) through to the finished piece.  So, that album is my current musical obsession.
Actually, sod it.  Who want’s a mix CD?  If you do, leave me a note.  Don’t forget to mention if you have and special requests (like if you know I like a band and you don’t or even if you are curious about a particular band) and I’ll make it.
And now I must go.  I need more juice.

By SABRINA TAVERNISE and JOHN F. BURNS
BAGHDAD, Jan. 10  As President Bush challenges public opinion at home by committing more American troops, he is confronted by a paradox: an Iraqi government that does not really want them.
The Shiite-led government of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki has not publicly opposed the American troop increase, but aides to Mr. Maliki have been saying for weeks that the government is wary of the proposal. They fear that an increased American troop presence, particularly in Baghdad, will be accompanied by a more assertive American role that will conflict with the Shiite governments haste to cut back on American authority and run the war the way it wants. American troops, Shiite leaders say, should stay out of Shiite neighborhoods and focus on fighting Sunni insurgents.
The government believes there is no need for extra troops from the American side, Haidar al-Abadi, a Parliament member and close associate of Mr. Maliki, said Wednesday. The existing troops can do the job.
It is an opinion that is broadly held among a Shiite political elite that is increasingly impatient, after nearly two years heading the government here, to exercise power without the constraining supervision of the United States. As a long-oppressed majority, the Shiites have a deep-seated fear that the power they won at the polls, after centuries of subjugation by the Sunni minority, will be progressively whittled away as the Americans seek deals with the Sunnis that will help bring American troops home.
These misgivings are broadly shared by Shiite leaders in the government, including some whom Mr. Bush has courted recently in a United States effort to form a bloc of politicians from the Shiite, Sunni and Kurdish communities that can break Mr. Malikis political dependence on the radical Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr. He leads the Mahdi Army, the most powerful of the Shiite militias that are at the heart of sectarian violence in Iraq.
Hadi al-Ameri, the leader of the security committee in Parliament and a close associate of Abdul Aziz al-Hakim  a prominent Shiite leader who met with Mr. Bush last month in Washington, and who has quietly supported the American push to reshape the political landscape in Baghdad  was unequivocal in his opposition to a troop increase. Im against any increase in troops, he said.
Redha Jawad Tahi, another Shiite member of Parliament from Mr. Hakims party, took a similar view. You cant solve the problem by adding more troops, he said. The security should be in the hands of the Iraqis. The U.S. should be in a supporting role.
The plan sketched out by Mr. Bush went at least part way to meeting these Shiite concerns by ceding greater operational authority over the war in Baghdad to the government. The plan envisages an Iraqi commander with overall control of the new security crackdown in Baghdad, and Iraqi officers working under him who would be in charge of military operations in nine newly demarcated districts in the capital. 
The commanders would report to a new office of commander in chief directly under the authority of Mr. Maliki. The arrangement appeared to have the advantage, for Mr. Maliki, of giving him a means to circumvent the Ministry of Defense, which operates under close American supervision. The U.S. agrees that the government must take command, Mr. Abadi said. 
The arrangements appeared to suggest that Mr. Maliki would have the power to halt any push into Sadr City, the Mahdi Army stronghold that American commanders have been saying for months will have to be swept of extremist militia elements if there is to be any lasting turn toward stability in Baghdad. But along with more authority for Mr. Maliki, the American plan appeared to have countervailing safeguards to prevent sectarian agendas from gaining the upper hand. Bush administration officials said that Americans would be present in the commander in chiefs office and that an American Army battalion  400 to 600 soldiers  would be stationed in each of the nine Baghdad military districts. 
Shiite suspicions of the American troop increase reflect a tectonic shift in the political realities here. Shiites, the principal victims of Saddam Husseins repression, had joined with Iraqi Kurds in hailing the American-led invasion in 2003, seeing it as opening their way to power. But once they consolidated their control through two elections in 2005, they began distancing themselves from the Americans, seeing their liberators increasingly as an impediment to the full control they craved.
By contrast, moderate Sunnis, who were deeply alienated by the American occupation at an earlier stage of the war, are now looking to Americans for protection, as Shiite militias have moved into Sunni neighborhoods in a deadly cycle of revenge. On Wednesday, moderate Sunni politicians hailed the idea of more American troops. 
The Shiite leaders frustrations have grown in recent months as American commanders have retained their tight grip in Baghdad. While the Americans have argued for a strategy that places equal emphasis on going after Shiite and Sunni extremists, the Shiite leaders have insisted that the killing is rooted in the Sunni attempt to regain power through violence and that Shiite militias and revenge killings are an inevitable response. 
American officials have warned that with lessening American oversight, Shiite leaders might shift to a sectarian strategy that punished Sunni insurgents but spared Shiite militias. The execution 11 days ago of Saddam Hussein, carried out in haste by the Maliki government over American urgings that it be delayed until the legal paperwork was completed, only reinforced such fears. 
With as many as 17,000 additional American troops in Baghdad, the American force level in the capital will rise above 30,000, and many of those, under the Bush plan, will be in American units that are twinned with Iraqi units, or in expanded teams of military advisers that are embedded with the Iraqis, down to the company level.
American generals have acknowledged that the twinning of American and Iraqi units, and the sharp increase in American advisers, will serve the dual purpose of stiffening Iraqi combat performance and providing American commanders with early warning of any Iraqi operations that run counter to American objectives. In effect, the advisers will serve as canaries in Mr. Malikis mine, ensuring the American command will get early notice if Iraqi operations threaten to abandon the equal pursuit of Sunni and Shiite extremists in favor of a more sectarian emphasis on going after Sunnis alone. 
But if that appeared to set the stage for future tensions between the Americans and the Iraqis, there was much else in the Bush plan that appeared to have been fashioned to avoid an early confrontation with the Maliki government. While the plan set out a range of political benchmarks for the Iraqi leader, it appeared to lack any timelines to force compliance on Mr. Maliki, who has shown in the past months that his willingness to pledge action on issues urged on him by the Americans is more than matched by his resourcefulness in finding ways to defer steps that might incur resistance among Shiite religious groups. 
The wish list set out by White House officials was the same as the one the Americans laid down in May, when Mr. Maliki took office: an oil law that promises a fair distribution of future oil revenues between the Shiite and Kurdish populations that sit atop most of Iraqs oil wealth, and the Sunnis whose heartland is mostly bereft of proven oil reserves; constitutional revisions that will assuage Sunni complaints that their interests were swept aside when Shiite and Kurdish voters approved the charter 15 months ago over Sunni objections; a new de-Baathification law that will lower the barriers that thousands of Sunnis have found in seeking government jobs; and, most important, a militia law that will lay the groundwork for disarming and demobilizing armed groups like Mr. Sadrs that challenge the governments monopoly on armed force.
Hard-line Shiite politicians have been saying with growing vehemence that these American goals amount to an attempt to deprive them of the victory they won at the polls, and that instead of placating Sunni Arabs, a minority of about 20 percent in Iraqs population of 27 million, the United States should stand aside and allow the minority to lose. For Americans, whose best road home lies in drawing the Shiites, Sunnis and Kurds together, it amounts to a collision with the hard history of Iraq.
Only time will tell whether Mr. Maliki and his associates, with the trends in the war running against them, will take the breathing space that White House officials said the American troop reinforcements will give them to decide, at last, that they can refashion that history in a way that brings Iraqis of all groups together and avoids a further slide toward all-out civil war.
Bush Troubled by Video of Hanging
WASHINGTON, Jan. 10  President Bush told a private gathering of television news anchors and hosts on Wednesday that he was deeply troubled by the handling of the execution of Saddam Hussein.
I asked the president if he had seen the execution video of Saddam Hussein, Brian Williams, the NBC News anchor, said on the Nightly News. He indicated that he had and said in his view the way it was handled ranked just below the Abu Ghraib prison scandal in terms of mistakes made thus far in the war.
A grainy unauthorized recording of the execution showed some of the guards in the room taunting Mr. Hussein moments before his hanging.
In Iraq on Wednesday, The Associated Press reported that Mr. Maliki has named Lt. Gen. Aboud Gambar, an Iraqi general who was taken prisoner of war by American forces during the 1991 Persian Gulf war, as the overall commander of his troops. 
General Gambar, a Shiite, will have two assistants, one from the police and one from the army, Iraqi military officers said on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to disclose the information. General Gambar will report directly to Mr. Maliki, The A.P. reported.
At least 91 people were killed or found dead in Iraq on Wednesday, Reuters reported.
A day after Iraqis and Americans battled insurgents in downtown Baghdad, the area was quiet and empty on Wednesday. The American military said it had detained 21 Iraqis in two raids there.

BY: Actress Archives   |   Wednesday, January 10, 2007 
When it comes to news anchors, Katie Couric and Charles Gibson have nothing on Bill O’Reilly and Stephen Colbert. O’Reilly’s Fox News show, The O’Reilly Factor, is routinely one of the highest-rated news shows on an all-news network, and while some disagree with his traditionally conservative values, Stephen Colbert saw something else. Colbert, host of The Colbert Report on Comedy Central, has essentially created a satire of Bill O’Reilly on his popular late-night “news” program. Now, the right-wing host and the satirically right-wing comic will trade appearances on each other programs on Jan. 18
Stephen Colbert’s The Colbert Report features the comedian, who used to be a correspondent for Jon Stewart on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, portraying a self-important, satirical talk-show host who parodies conventional news broadcasting, particularly political talk shows such as Bill O’Reilly’s The O’Reilly Factor. Bill O’Reilly, on the other hand, hosts the top-rated show on cable news with The O’Reilly Factor, where he and his guests debate current hot-button topics in the political arena. While some have labeled O’Reilly a “conservative pundit”, he identifies himself as a “traditionalist”.
After more than a year of parodying Bill O’Reilly, Stephen Colbert will get the chance to host the real thing for half an hour. O’Reilly, who Colbert refers to as “Papa Bear”, has agreed to appear on The Colbert Report on January 18, and Colbert will return the favor with an appearance on The O’Reilly Factor that same day. As the two hosts seemingly exist at opposite ends of the political spectrum, both were ready to take a shot at the other in statements released to the media. The Associated Press quoted both statements, which saw Bill O’Reilly say, “I’m really looking forward to speaking to a man who owes his entire career to me.”
Meanwhile, in his typically humorous fashion, Stephen Colbert threw down a self-congratulating joke with, “I look forward to the evening. It is an honor to speak face-to-face with a broadcasting legend, and I feel the same way about Mr. O’Reilly.” Bill O’Reilly’s The O’Reilly Factor is broadcast on Fox, a subsidiary company of News Corp., while The Colbert Report calls Comedy Central, a division of Viacom, home.

This has the potential to be either awesome or a complete trainwreck.  It all depends on if O’Reilly realises that Colbert’s schtick is an act and plays along with it or if he genuinly believes that that is who Colbert is.
Either way, nice early birthday present for me.

So, here I am back in Middlesbrough after the holidays.  The journey down was ok, not including the delay outside Edinburgh train station which meant I missed my connection.
So, got my loan through.  And I’ve made a couple of big purchases.  From amazon I bought the Dr Who series 2 box set.  Admittedly, I could have bought that in a shop, but then I would not have got this:
Yay!
How cool is that?
I also got myself a new laptop rather than just getting my old one fixed.  Looked around online and finally found one with the exact same spec as my old one.  But this one has a biometric fingerprint scanner!  So, instead of a password to log in, I just scan my finger.  Woo!
Not that I can get online with it at the moment.  While I was away, the couple I shared the flat with split up and she’s moved.  Because the NTL was in her name, she’s cancelled it.  So, at the moment I have no internet, no digital TV and no phone.
So, now that I’m back in Middlesbrough, am I back at college?  Well, no.  I am no longer a student, and haven’t been since December.
What happened was that the course I was doing was validated by the University.  Who I have issues with going back a few years that I thought I had sorted.  Mid November, they realised that I was enrolled on the course and told me my enrollment had been revoked.  I tried to sort it with them but, due to the fact that the department in question tends to move about as quickly as a three toed sloth with arthiritis, it didn’t happen and I was officially removed from the course in December 1st.
And in the middle of all this me and Shar split up.  It’s just one of those things that didn’t work out.  I’m still friends with her and we still chat online every so often.
So, yeah, an interesting end to the year.

The US has spent a million dollars for every dead Iraqi – is that what they mean by value for money? 
Terry Jones
Saturday January 6, 2007
The Guardian 
Early this year the Bush administration is to ask Congress to approve an additional $100bn for the onerous task of making life intolerable for the Iraqis. This will bring the total spent on the White House’s current obsession with war to almost $500bn – enough to have given every US citizen $1,600 each. I wonder which the voters would have gone for if given the choice: shall we (a) give every American $1,600 or (b) spend the money on bombing a country in the Middle East that doesn’t use lavatory paper?
Of course, there’s another thing that George Bush could have done with the money: he could have given every Iraqi $18,700. I imagine that would have reduced the threat of international terrorism somewhat. Call me old-fashioned, but I can’t help thinking that giving someone $18,700 brings them round to your side more quickly than bombing the hell out of them. They could certainly buy a lot of lavatory paper with it.
In 2002 the house budget committee and the congressional budget office both guesstimated the cost of invading Iraq at approximately $50bn; $500bn seems a bit wide of the mark. What’s more, with over half a million dead, it means that the world’s greatest military superpower has spent a million dollars for every Iraqi killed. That can’t be value for money!
So how on earth could such a vast overspend occur? After all, the US is the flagship of monetary common sense. Well, for starters, in 2003 the White House refused to allow competitive bidding for contracts in Iraq, which is odd for the champions of free enterprise. Then the White House ensured there would be no overseeing of what was spent. In the original Iraq spending bill, which earmarked the first $87bn to go down the drain, there was a provision for the general accounting office to keep a check on things, but that provision was stripped from the bill – even though the Senate had originally voted for it 97 to 0.
But what I want to know is: how do they actually spend all that money? Well the answer is: they don’t. According to the website Halliburtonwatch, the Halliburton subsidiary KBR bills the US taxpayer for $50-$80 per day for labourers working for it in Iraq, but pays them only $5-$16 per day. It’s the same with Halliburton. In December 2003 the US army discovered that the company had overcharged by $61m for fuel transportation and $67m for food services in Iraq.
Then there is good old-fashioned incompetence. Take the al-Fatah pipeline: KBR went through $75.7m of taxpayers’ money, supposedly trying to replace a pipeline across the river Tigris that US forces had blown up. They never finished the job, but still got paid.
With all this double-dealing and incompetence, you’d expect that those responsible would have been penalised by now. But that’s where the mystery deepens. Companies such as Halliburton and its subsidiaries have never had it so good. In January 2006 the Bush administration intervened in a dispute between the Pentagon and Halliburton, and agreed to pay the company $199m in disputed charges. On January 26 2006 Halliburton announced that its 2005 profits were the “best in our 86-year history”. And to date KBR has received around $16bn from its contracts in Iraq.
Vice-President Dick Cheney, formerly CEO of Halliburton, has not had a bad war either. His tax returns for 2005 show that he earned $194,862 from his Halliburton stock options alone. Mind you, it’s small change compared to his $36m payoff when he left the firm. Was that for his past role, or was Halliburton anticipating further services from the future vice-president of the US? Perhaps it’s just as well that in 2003 the White House removed from the Iraq spending bill any provision to penalise war profiteers who defrauded US taxpayers.

1411,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/fbi-workers-saw-guantanamo-abuse-3929569/,2007-01-03,FBI workers saw Guantanamo abuse,"
An internal report by the FBI has catalogued a long list of abuses of prisoners held at the US detention centre in Guantanamo Bay in Cuba. 
At least 26 agency employees say they witnessed inmates being mistreated and subjected to harsh interrogation. 
One reported seeing a man whose head was covered in duct tape, another saw detainees chained from hand to foot in the foetal position for up to 24 hours. 
The report was released to a US civil liberties group fighting a law suit. 
A federal judge has yet to decide whether to accept the suit, filed by the American Civil Liberties Union (Aclu) against former Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and others on behalf of former inmates who say they were abused. 
A Pentagon spokesman said the department had a clear policy: “We treat detainees humanely. The United States operates safe, humane and professional detention operations for enemy combatants who are providing valuable information in the war on terror.” 
Nonetheless, the BBC’s Jonathan Beale says the report appears to clearly contradict such assurances, which have also been made by President George W Bush. 
‘Not new’ 
In 2004, the FBI asked 493 employees whether they had witnessed aggressive treatment that was not in line with agency policies. 
It says it received 26 witness statements detailing abuse that included: 
Rooms kept so hot that a detainee was rendered almost unconscious, with a pile of hair next to him that he apparently pulled out 
Detainees left for over 24 hours chained to the floor hand and foot in foetal position, with no chair, food or water – most urinated or defecated on themselves 
Sleep deprivation interviews with strobe lights and loud music, apparently lasting up to 4 days 
A detainee brought into an interview room appearing to have broken fingers and facial injuries 
A detainee gagged with duct tape that covered much of his head after reportedly chanting the Koran non-stop 
A detainee draped in an Israeli flag in a room with loud music and strobe lights 
Many of the allegations are already in the public domain, the FBI said, while stressing that its own personnel were not involved. 
The agency’s report added that some officials had told FBI agents that the interrogation techniques had been approved at the defence department by officials who included Mr Rumsfeld. 
The report does not amount to a criminal investigation, and all the information has been passed on to the Pentagon’s inspector general, the FBI said. 
It was made in response to a freedom of information request by the Aclu, which has already obtained a number of documented abuse allegations in this manner.

First off, I’m really sorry about the lack of proper updates recently.  I’ve had some seriously heavy shit happen to me in the past couple of months and I’m still trying to get my head around it my own self.
I will write about it someday, but not quite yet.
So, I’m back home for the holidays.  Trying to get used to the smoking ban (at least I’ll have a jump start on most of my friends come July).  Turn out the secret is to either smoke in between pints or inbetween bars.  Hmmm. Whodathunkit?
Didn’t really get anything exciting for my Christmas.  Well, unless you include the DVD’s I got with my HMV gift vouchers (Good Night, And Good Luck and The Usual suspects 2 disc set).
Got absolutely hammered on Hogmanay.  So much so that I fell over on my way home.  Oops.  T’was a good night anyway.
Watched a lot of TV over the holidays as well.  Dr Who Christmas special (good apart from Catherine Tate, the motorway scene is stupendous), Sarah Jane Adventures (sonic lipstick!), The Ruby In The Smoke (billie Piper and Philip Pullman, you know I was all over that) and High School Musical.  Which I, erm, well…
I actually kinda really, really enjoyed.  And there may have been unusual excitment over a download.  But I’m not saying.
But for me, the main thing was This Life +10.  Those of you in Britain should know what This Life is.  And they brought it back for a one off special.  And it was fan – fucking – tastic.  Really, really, really good.
Anyhoo, I really should think about heading back to bed.

Quick Passage of First Bills Sought
By Lyndsey Layton and Juliet Eilperin
Washington Post Staff Writers
Tuesday, January 2, 2007; A01
As they prepare to take control of Congress this week and face up to campaign pledges to restore bipartisanship and openness, Democrats are planning to largely sideline Republicans from the first burst of lawmaking.
House Democrats intend to pass a raft of popular measures as part of their well-publicized plan for the first 100 hours. They include tightening ethics rules for lawmakers, raising the minimum wage, allowing more research on stem cells and cutting interest rates on student loans.
But instead of allowing Republicans to fully participate in deliberations, as promised after the Democratic victory in the Nov. 7 midterm elections, Democrats now say they will use House rules to prevent the opposition from offering alternative measures, assuring speedy passage of the bills and allowing their party to trumpet early victories.
Nancy Pelosi, the Californian who will become House speaker, and Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, who will become majority leader, finalized the strategy over the holiday recess in a flurry of conference calls and meetings with other party leaders. A few Democrats, worried that the party would be criticized for reneging on an important pledge, argued unsuccessfully that they should grant the Republicans greater latitude when the Congress convenes on Thursday.
The episode illustrates the dilemma facing the new party in power. The Democrats must demonstrate that they can break legislative gridlock and govern after 12 years in the minority, while honoring their pledge to make the 110th Congress a civil era in which Democrats and Republicans work together to solve the nation’s problems. Yet in attempting to pass laws key to their prospects for winning reelection and expanding their majority, the Democrats may have to resort to some of the same tough tactics Republicans used the past several years.
Democratic leaders say they are torn between giving Republicans a say in legislation and shutting them out to prevent them from derailing Democratic bills.
“There is a going to be a tension there,” said Rep. Chris Van Hollen (Md.), the new chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. “My sense is there’s going to be a testing period to gauge to what extent the Republicans want to join us in a constructive effort or whether they intend to be disruptive. It’s going to be a work in progress.”
House Republicans have begun to complain that Democrats are backing away from their promise to work cooperatively. They are working on their own strategy for the first 100 hours, and part of it is built on the idea that they might be able to break the Democrats’ slender majority by wooing away some conservative Democrats.
Democrats intend to introduce their first bills within hours of taking the oath of office on Thursday. The first legislation will focus on the behavior of lawmakers, banning travel on corporate jets and gifts from lobbyists and requiring lawmakers to attach their names to special spending directives and to certify that such earmarks would not financially benefit the lawmaker or the lawmaker’s spouse. That bill is aimed at bringing legislative transparency that Democrats said was lacking under Republican rule.
Democratic leaders said they are not going to allow Republican input into the ethics package and other early legislation, because several of the bills have already been debated and dissected, including the proposal to raise the minimum wage, which passed the House Appropriations Committee in the 109th Congress, said Brendan Daly, a spokesman for Pelosi.
“We’ve talked about these things for more than a year,” he said. “The members and the public know what we’re voting on. So in the first 100 hours, we’re going to pass these bills.”
But because the details of the Democratic proposals have not been released, some language could be new. Daly said Democrats are still committed to sharing power with the minority down the line. “The test is not the first 100 hours,” he said. “The test is the first six months or the first year. We will do what we promised to do.”
For clues about how the Democrats will operate, the spotlight is on the House, where the new 16-seat majority will hold absolute power over the way the chamber operates. Most of the early legislative action is expected to stem from the House.
“It’s in the nature of the House of Representatives for the majority party to be dominant and control the agenda and limit as much as possible the influence of the minority,” said Ross K. Baker, a political scientist at Rutgers University. “It’s almost counter to the essence of the place for the majority and minority to share responsibility for legislation.”
In the Senate, by contrast, the Democrats will have less control over business because of their razor-thin 51-to-49-seat margin and because individual senators wield substantial power. Senate Democrats will allow Republicans to make amendments to all their initiatives, starting with the first measure — ethics and lobbying reform, said Jim Manley, spokesman for the incoming majority leader, Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.).
Those same Democrats, who campaigned on a pledge of more openness in government, will kick off the new Congress with a closed meeting of all senators in the Capitol. Manley said the point of the meeting is to figure out ways both parties can work together.
In the House, Louise M. Slaughter (D-N.Y.), who will chair the Rules Committee, said she intends to bring openness to a committee that used to meet in the middle of the night. In the new Congress, the panel — which sets the terms of debate on the House floor — will convene at 10 a.m. before a roomful of reporters.
“It’s going to be open,” Slaughter said of the process. “Everybody will have an opportunity to participate.”
At the same time, she added, the majority would grant Republicans every possible chance to alter legislation once it reaches the floor. “We intend to allow some of their amendments, not all of them,” Slaughter said.
For several reasons, House Democrats are assiduously trying to avoid some of the heavy-handed tactics they resented under GOP rule. They say they want to prove to voters they are setting a new tone on Capitol Hill. But they are also convinced that Republicans lost the midterms in part because they were perceived as arrogant and divisive.
“We’re going to make an impression one way or the other,” said one Democratic leadership aide. “If it’s not positive, we’ll be out in two years.”
House Republicans say their strategy will be to offer alternative bills that would be attractive to the conservative “Blue Dog” Democrats, with an eye toward fracturing the Democratic coalition. They hope to force some tough votes for Democrats from conservative districts who will soon begin campaigning for 2008 reelection and will have to defend their records.
“We’ll capitalize on every opportunity we have,” said one GOP leadership aide, adding that Republicans were preparing alternatives to the Democrats’ plans to raise the minimum wage, reduce the interest on student loans, and reduce the profits of big oil and energy companies.
Several Blue Dog Democrats said they do not think Republicans can pick up much support from their group.
“If they’ve got ideas that will make our legislation better, we ought to consider that,” said Rep. Allen Boyd Jr. (D-Fla.), leader of the Blue Dogs. “But if their idea is to try to split a group off to gain power, that’s what they’ve been doing for the past six years, and it’s all wrong.”
To keep her sometimes-fractious coalition together, Pelosi has been distributing the spoils of victory across the ideological spectrum, trying to make sure that no group within the Democratic Party feels alienated.
Blue Dogs picked up some plum committee assignments, with Jim Matheson (Utah) landing a spot on Energy and Commerce and A.B. “Ben” Chandler (Ky.) getting an Appropriations seat. At the same time, members of Black and Hispanic caucuses obtained spots on these panels, as Ciro Rodriguez (Tex.) was given a seat on Appropriations and Artur Davis (Ala.) took the place of Democrat William J. Jefferson (La.) on Ways and Means.
Democrats acknowledge that if they appear too extreme in blocking the opposing party, their party is sure to come under fire from the Republicans, who are already charging they are being left out of the legislative process.
“If you’re talking about 100 hours, you’re talking about no obstruction whatsoever, no amendments offered other than those approved by the majority,” said Rutgers’s Baker. “I would like to think after 100 hours are over, the Democrats will adhere to their promise to make the system a little more equitable. But experience tells me it’s really going to be casting against type.”
“The temptations to rule the roost with an iron hand are very, very strong,” he added. “It would take a majority party of uncommon sensitivity and a firm sense of its own agenda to open up the process in any significant degree to minority. But hope springs eternal.”

Hundreds of protesters in France have rung in the New Year by holding a light-hearted march against it. 
Parodying the French readiness to say “non”, the demonstrators in the western city of Nantes waved banners reading: “No to 2007” and “Now is better!” 
The marchers called on governments and the UN to stop time’s “mad race” and declare a moratorium on the future. 
The protest was held in the rain and organisers joked that even the weather was against the New Year. 
The tension mounted as the minutes ticked away towards midnight – but the arrival of 2007 did nothing to dampen their enthusiasm. 
The protesters began to chant: “No to 2008!” 
They vowed to stage a similar protest on 31 December 2007 on the Champs-Elysees avenue in Paris.

Hammer of Doom 
2006 Darwin Award Nominee 
Confirmed True by Darwin 
(August 2006, Brazil) August brings us a winner from Brazil, who tried to disassemble a Rocket Propelled Grenade (RPG) by driving back and forth over it with a car. This technique was ineffective, so he escalated to pounding the RPG with a sledgehammer. The second try worked–in a sense. The explosion proved fatal to one man, six cars, and the repair shop wherein the efforts took place. 
14 more RPG grenades were found in a car parked nearby. Police believe the ammunition was being scavenged to sell as scrap metal. If it wasn’t scrap then, it certainly is now!

(2006, Vietnam) In a similar event, a Rolling Stone isn’t all that gathers no moss. Three men scavenging for scrap metal found an unexploded 500-pound bomb perched on a hill, and decided to retrieve it with help from Sir Isaac Newton. As they rolled the bomb down the hillside according to the laws of gravity, the bomb detonated, leaving a four-meter crater and sending the three entrepreneurs to a face-to-face meeting with their Maker.
Stubbed Out 
2006 Darwin Award Nominee 
Confirmed True by Darwin 
(17 April 2006, England) There’s always someone who thinks good advice doesn’t apply to him. For example, if a doctor advises that the one thing you must not do is go near a flame, as you are going to be covered wtih a flammable material, most people would take this advice onboard, and not strike a match until the flammable material has been removed. 
However, Phillip, 60, knew better than his doctor. Philip was in the hospital to treat a skin disease, said treatment consisting of being smeared in paraffin-based cream. Philip was warned that the cream would ignite, so he definitely should NOT smoke. But he just couldn’t live without that cigarette.” 
Smoking was not permitted anywhere on the ward, but Phillip took this setback in stride, and sneaked out onto a fire escape. Once he was hidden, he lit up… inhaled… and peace descended as he got his nicotine fix. Things went downhill only after he finished his cigarette, at the moment he ground out the butt with his heel. 
The paraffin cream had been absorbed by his clothing. As his heel touched the butt, fumes from his pyjamas ignited. The resulting inferno “cremated” his skin condition, and left first-degree burns on much of his body. Despite excellent treatment, he died in intensive care. 
Using the Darwin checklist: 
1.Reproduction — if he has children, he’s not having more.
2.Excellence — this one I’ll remember!
3.Self-Selection — he was warned paraffin & flames don’t mix.
4.Maturity — At 60 I guess he was old enough.
5.Veracity — Major UK news carriers covered the story. 
This ticks all the boxes, and though I feel sorry for the family, his death acts as a warning to others. If a doctor tells you not to smoke, there’s a very good reason.

Star Wars 
2006 Darwin Award Nominee 
Confirmed True by Darwin 
(2006, England) The Darwin Awards salute the improvement of the human genome by honoring those who, uh, remove themselves from it… 
Like two people, 17 and 20, who imitated Darth Vader and made light sabres from fluorescent light tubes. That’s right, they opened up fluoresceent tubes, poured gasoline inside, and lit the end… As one can imagine, a Star Wars sized explosion was not far behind. One died, the other survived to ‘fess up to their creative, but stupid, reenactment.
Darwin says: “Some moderators say 17 is too young, but I disagree. This one passes the “minors rule” because 17 is legal driving age. Old enough to pump gas is old enough to know not to light it.”

High on Life 
2006 Darwin Award Nominee 
Confirmed True by Darwin 
Take a deep breath…
(3 June 2006, Florida) Two more candidates have thrown themselves into the running for a Darwin Award. The feet of Jason and Sara, both 21, were found protruding from a deflated, huge helium advertising balloon. Jason was a college student, and Sara attended community college, but apparently their education had glossed over the importance of oxygen.
The pair pulled down the 8′ balloon, and climbed inside. Their last words consisted of high-pitched, incoherent giggling as they slowly passed out and passed into the hereafter. 
Sheriff’s deputies said the two were not victims of foul play. No drugs or alcohol were found. The medical examiner reported that helium inhalation was a significant factor in their deaths. A family member said “Sara was mischievous, to be honest. She liked fun and it cost her.” 

Score For Goliath 
2006 Darwin Award Nominee 
Confirmed True by Darwin 
(September 2006, Florida) A fearsome mythical giant was felled by a humble slingshot. But a modern speargun vs. an underwater leviathan is another tale altogether, as a Florida man discovered. 
Outlawed in 1990, hunting Goliath-sized groupers remains surprisingly popular. These fish can weigh hundreds of pounds, yet there are underwater hunters who choose to tether themselves to such muscular sea creatures. However unlikely a pursuit, the poaching of groupers by divers and snorkelers continues, in defiance of both the law and common sense. 
Of this elite group, our Darwin Award winner distinguished himself yet further by disregarding one essential spearfishing precaution. By embarking on this hunt without a knife to cut himself loose, the “fit and experienced snorkeler” was guaranteeing that his next attack on a giant grouper would be his last. 
Why anyone thinks it’s a good idea to tether yourself to a fish twice your size, I don’t know. Some time later, the body of the spearfisher was found pinned to the coral, 17 feet underwater. Three coils of line were wrapped around his wrist, and one very dead grouper was impaled at the other end of the line. 
In those final hours, the tables were turned, and the fish was given an opportunity to reflect on the experience of “catching a person.”
Copper Kite 
2006 Darwin Award Nominee 
Confirmed True by Darwin 
(19 March 2006, Belize) Benjamin Franklin reputedly flew his kite in a lightning storm, going on to discover that lightning equals electricity. However, certain precautions must be taken, as Ben Franklin took, to avoid sudden electrocution. 
Kennon, 26, replicated the conditions of Ben Franklin’s experiment, but sans safety precautions. He was flying a kite with a short string that he had extended with a length of thin copper wire. 
The copper made contact with a high tension line, sending a bolt of artificial lightning down the wire towards the man. To cap the story off, Kennon’s father told listeners, his son was an electrician and “should have known better.” Kennon is survived by his parents, six sisters, and five brothers.

Faithful Flotation 
2006 Darwin Award Nominee 
Confirmed True by Darwin 
(August 2006, Libreville, Gabon) In August, a congregation’s 35-year old pastor insisted one could literally walk on water, if only one had enough faith. Big and bold was his speech. He extolled the heavenly power possessed by a faithful man with such force that he may well have convinced himself.
Whether or not he believed in his heart, his sermons left room for only shame should he leave his own faith untested. Thus, the pastor set out to walk across a major estuary, the path of a 20-minute ferry ride. But the man could not swim.
Lacking the miraculous powers of David Copperfield, let alone holy Jesus Christ, this ill-fated cleric found only a Darwin Award at the end of his final path.

By BETH FOUHY, Associated Press Writer 
Mon Dec 11, 5:27 PM ET
NEW YORK – Al Gore is waging a fierce campaign for recognition and an Oscar statuette for his global warming documentary, while reviving talk that he’s pursuing a bigger prize: the presidency. 
His recent itinerary has been the ultimate in high profile. The former vice president made self-deprecating jokes on “The Tonight Show With Jay Leno,” offered ideas on preserving the environment to Oprah Winfrey and her daytime audience and parried questions on Iraq from Matt Lauer on the “Today” show.
This Saturday Gore is hosting a network of 1,600 house parties across the country to watch and discuss his documentary, “An Inconvenient Truth,” with the Democrat planning to address the gatherings by satellite hookup. The movie is on the short list of feature-length documentaries being considered for Oscar nominations.
Crisscrossing the country to promote the DVD version of the movie  just in time for holiday gift-giving  Gore insists that he’s not planning a return to politics.
“I am not planning to run for president again,” Gore said last week, arguing that his focus is raising public awareness about global warming and its dire effects. Then, he added: “I haven’t completely ruled it out.”
Those words make Gore the 800-pound non-candidate of the Democratic field. The possibility of another presidential bid delights many Democrats still steamed over the disputed 2000 election, in which they argue a few more votes, a state other than Florida and a different Supreme Court could have put Gore, not George W. Bush, in the White House.
New York Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton is the front-runner, but a polarizing one for some Democrats. Illinois Sen. Barack Obama is the electrifying newcomer, but limited in his experience. Gore remains, for many party activists, the Democrat and popular vote-getter done wrong.
“He won the election in 2000  he just lost the (electoral) count,” former Democratic National Committee Chairman Don Fowler said. “If I were he, I wouldn’t rule out a run. It’s an uncertain field, and he’s a person who is widely respected.”
In many respects, Gore is better positioned for a political comeback than in his previous bids.
He has won fame for “An Inconvenient Truth,” the highest-grossing documentary of the year. His outspoken environmentalism and opposition to the Iraq war has drawn raves from many Democrats, who have been frustrated by the caution among some party lawmakers on those issues.
Derided in 2000 for being a wooden know-it-all, the new Gore is funny. He’s done humorous turns on “Saturday Night Live” and voiced a disembodied head on the cartoon “Futurama,” which is being made into a movie.
Perhaps most important for his future political endeavors, Gore has gotten rich. Thanks to a range of business ventures, including a longtime advisory relationship with Google and a seat on Apple Computer’s board of directors, aides say he could spend as much as $50 million of his own money to launch a credible presidential run.
To be sure, Gore has given plenty of signals that he does not intend to become a candidate.
While Clinton, Obama and other likely contenders have begun courting activists and building their organizations, Gore has steered far from campaign mechanics.
And while many prospective candidates have visited states with early presidential contests such as Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, Gore spends most weekends at home in Nashville, Tenn., training environmentalists to deliver a slideshow presentation on global warming to audiences across the country.
“I see no signs of Gore organizing supporters right now,” said Donna Brazile, Gore’s presidential campaign manager in 2000.
Neither Clinton nor Obama has yet announced plans to run. Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack has declared his candidacy, while Indiana Sen. Evan Bayh has formed an exploratory committee. Other likely candidates include Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry, the 2004 presidential nominee; former North Carolina Sen. John Edwards, the 2004 vice presidential nominee; Delaware Sen. Joe Biden; Connecticut Sen. Chris Dodd; and New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson.
Despite his protestations to the contrary, some Democratic strategists believe Gore could be persuaded to enter the race and will wait to see how the field shakes out before making a final decision. 
Joe Trippi, who managed Howard Dean’s Internet-fueled presidential campaign in 2004, said Gore would be a formidable candidate and could probably wait longer than others to enter the field. 
“If anything, he’s more relevant than anyone in the race because of his positions on the war and global warming,” Trippi said. “And that’s really tough to do in the Democratic Party, which treats its failed presidential candidates like members of leper colony.” 
The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announce the Oscar nominations Jan. 23, with the 79th Oscars slated for Feb. 25. Iowa caucuses would be less than a year after that.

Former Beatle John Lennon has been shot dead by an unknown gunman who opened fire outside the musician’s New York apartment. 
The 40-year-old was shot several times as he entered the Dakota, his luxury apartment building on Manhattan’s Upper West Side, opposite Central Park, at 2300 local time. 
He was rushed in a police car to St Luke’s Roosevelt Hospital Center, where he died. 
His wife, Yoko Ono, who is understood to have witnessed the attack, was with him. 
Shots heard 
A police spokesman said a suspect was in custody, but he had no other details of the shooting. 
“This was no robbery,” the spokesman said, adding that Mr Lennon was probably shot by a “deranged” person. 
Witness reports say at least three shots were fired and others have claimed they heard six. 
There are also reports Mr Lennon staggered up six steps into the vestibule after he was shot, before collapsing. 
Jack Douglas, Lennon’s producer, said he and the Lennons had been at a studio called the Record Plant in mid-town earlier in the evening and Lennon left at 2230. 
Mr Lennon said he planned to have some dinner and then return home, Mr Douglas said. 
Fans at scene 
The Lennons are said to have left their limousine on the street and walked up the driveway when the gunman opened fire. 
It is unclear whether the man had been lying in wait in the entrance to the building for Mr Lennon, or whether he came up behind him. 
Witnesses describe the gunman as a “pudgy kind of man”, 35 to 40 years old with brown hair. 
Other former band members, Paul McCartney, guitarist George Harrison and drummer Ringo Starr are thought to have been informed of Lennon’s murder. 
Fans have already begun arriving at the scene, many still unaware Lennon has died. 
Mr Lennon is survived by his wife, their son Sean, and his son from a previous marriage, Julian.

1421,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/santa-claus-an-engineers-perspective-3929559/,2006-12-06,SANTA CLAUS: An Engineer’s Perspective,"
I.  There are approximately two billion children (persons under 18)in the world. However, since Santa does not visit children of Muslim, Hindu, Jewish or Buddhist religions, this reduces the workload for Christmas night to 15% of the total, or 378 million (according to the Population Reference Bureau). At an average(census) rate of 3.5 children per household, that comes to 108 million homes, presuming that there is at least one good child in each. 
II.  Santa has about 31 hours of Christmas to work with, thanks to the different time zones and the rotation of the earth, assuming he travels east to west(which seems logical). This works out to 967.7 visits per second.  This is to say that for each Christian household with a good child, Santa has around 1/1000th of a second to park the sleigh, hop out, jump down the chimney, fill the stockings, distribute the remaining presents under the tree, eat whatever snacks have been left for him, get back up the chimney, jump into the sleigh and get on to the next house. 
Assuming that each of these 108 million stops is evenly distributed around the earth (which, of course, we know to be false, but will accept for the purposes of our calculations), we are now talking about 0.78 miles per household; a total trip of 75.5 million miles, not counting bathroom stops or breaks. This means Santa’s sleigh is moving at 650 miles per second–3,000 times the speed of sound. For purposes of comparison, the fastest man-made vehicle, the Ulysses space probe, moves at a poky 27.4 miles per second, and a conventional reindeer can run (at best) 15 miles per hour. 
III.  The payload of the sleigh adds another interesting element. Assuming that each child gets nothing more than a medium sized Lego set (two pounds), the sleigh is carrying over 500 thousand tons, not counting Santa himself.
On land, a conventional reindeer can pull no more than 300 pounds. Even granting that the “flying” reindeer could pull ten times the normal amount, the job can’t be done with eight or even nine of them–Santa would need 360,000 of them. This increases the payload, not counting the weight of the sleigh, another 54,000 tons, or roughly seven times the weight of the Queen Elizabeth (the ship, not the monarch). 
IV.  600,000 tons traveling at 650 miles per second creates enormous air resistance–this would heat up the reindeer in the same fashion as a spacecraft re-entering the earth’s atmosphere. The lead pair of reindeer would absorb 14.3 quintillion joules of energy per second each. In short, they would burst into flames almost instantaneously, exposing the reindeer behind them and creating deafening sonic booms in their wake. 
The entire reindeer team would be vaporized within 4.26 thousandths of a second, or right about the time Santa reached the fifth house on his trip. Not that it matters, however, since Santa, as a result of accelerating from a dead stop to 650 m.p.s. in .001 seconds, would be subjected to centrifugal forces of 17,500 g’s. A 250 pound Santa (which seems ludicrously slim) would be pinned to the back of the sleigh by 4,315,015 pounds of force, instantly crushing his bones and organs and reducing him to a quivering blob of pink goo. 
V.  Therefore, if Santa did exist, he’s dead now.

ENGINEERING SAVES SANTA
Please forgive the previous example of old fashioned linear thinking within the box.
The math, of course, is all wrong because of incorrect linear thinking and absurd assumptions.  Where did the number of presumed children come from?  Anyone who has driven on our freeways knows there are children who are chronologically well over 360 months old.  Why presume there is at least one good child in each household?  In many there are none at all.  On the other hand, in the Clintonite society, goodness has nothing to do with this – it helps your self esteem to get presents, whether or not you have been good or in any manner deserving. Besides, if you are given presents, you might refrain from taking presents that were not intended for you.
So, for the good of society, every child, no matter how old, should be considered “good” and given most favored child status.  Furthermore, discrimination on the basis of religion, ethnic origin, or any other reason, including perceived goodness or badness, is intolerable. Thus, the numbers of places designated for delivery of presents is grossly understated.
As for the OPTEMPO of Santa’s operation, the above analysis did nothing to refute the hypothesis that Santa simply operates in a different time warp.  Perhaps what appears to be one nanosecond to mere humans is an eternity to Santa, or this year’s Santa. As stated in the “Miracle on 42nd Street,” what if he simply slowed time down?  They did it on Star Trek!
Secondly, why has the analysis discounted parallel processing?  Who is the analyst to say that Santa can’t do all the homes in one city at the same time?  Bill Gates can send the same, or similar messages, to multiple addresses at one time, and he’s only been at this game for a few years.  Who is to say that Santa doesn’t deliver all the dolls in one parallel delivery? And all the toy trucks in another?  There are certainly fewer varieties of presents than there are of recipients, so they can be matched up for parallel delivery.
As for the attempt at a time-motion study, clearly the above engineer has never been to Filene’s Basement Sales in which women who normally are 30 minutes late for a date manage to try on and decide upon 35 different outfits within 1.00034 seconds, and in many cases apparently manage to time-share with others in the process.  This isn’t Lord and Taylor’s, and linear thinking just won’t cut it.  And where is due consideration for virtual reality or the transmission of a concept which is assembled from appropriate molecules at destination.  When the telephone was first invented, did people see a piece of paper shoved in one end come out the other?  No, but today fax machines essentially do just that. So perhaps presents are ordered at one end, and materialize at the other, perhaps even with the help of local distributors, sometimes disguised as Toys-R-Us outlets.
As for structural calculations: if 10,000 vehicles with an average weight of 4,000 pounds cross a bridge every day, is the bridge supporting 40,000,000 pounds?  No, it is supporting an average well below that, albeit the average may be perfectly theoretical.  Thus Santa’s sleigh need not support the full weight of all the presents, just as a telephone line does not support the weight of all the faxed documents transmitted.  And as for energy, an announcement this week was made that a firm has not only demonstrated, but patented a device which produces several thousand times as much sound energy as previously possible by controlling the boundary waves at the speed of sound, avoiding shock waves and the sound barrier.  So why couldn’t Santa have discovered equivalent ways of taming the drag coefficients, and improving the thrust of cloven hooves a long time ago?
What our engineer needs is a little lubrication and holiday cheer. Someone give him some egg nog so he can see the world outside his calculator.
QUANTUM MECHANICS SAVES SANTA
The analysis about the death of Santa Claus, based on classical physics, is seriously flawed owing to its neglectof quantum phenomena that become significant in his particular case. As it happens, the terminal velocity of a reindeer in dry December air over the Northern Hemisphere (for example) is known with tremendous precision.  The mass of Santa and his sleigh (since the number of children and their gifts is also known precisely, ahead of time, and the reindeer must weigh in minutes before the flight) is also known with tremendous precision.  His direction of flight is, as you say, essentially east to west.
All of that, when taken together, means that the momentum vector of Mr Claus and his cargo is known with incredible precision.  An elementary application of Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle yields the result that Santa’s location, at any given moment on Christmas Eve, is highly imprecise.  In other words, he is “smeared out” over the surface of the earth, analogous to the manner in which an electron is “smeared out” within a certain distance from the nucleus in an atom.  Thus he can, quite literally, be everywhere at any given moment.
In addition, the relativistic velocities which his reindeer can attain for brief moments make it possible for him, in certain cases, to arrive at some locations shortly before he left the North Pole. Santa, in other words, assumes for brief periods the characteristics of tachyons.
I will admit that tachyons remain hypothetical, but then so do black holes, and who really doubts their existence anymore?
Taken from here.

Robert Gates said he would speak his mind 
Gates’ views on Iraq  
US Defence Secretary nominee Robert Gates has told a Senate committee that the US is not winning the war in Iraq. 
Mr Gates told a confirmation hearing he was open to new ideas on Iraq, but warned the situation there would shape the Middle East for years to come. 
The committee approved him to replace Donald Rumsfeld, who quit last month amid criticism of his Iraq policy. 
The next chairman of the panel said Mr Gates would face a monumental challenge if confirmed by a full Senate vote. 
After the 21 senators on the committee unanimously approved Mr Gates, the Senate should vote by the end of the week, with approval widely expected. 
Senate hearings on Mr Gates’ nomination began a day before the Iraq Study Group – of which Mr Gates was a member – publishes its findings. 
The session also came on another violent day in Iraq. 
More than 30 people were killed in shootings and car bomb attacks in Baghdad, Iraqi officials said. At least 30 more died in violence in northern and south-western Iraq. 
‘Regional conflagration’ 
Mr Gates told the Senate Armed Services Committee that all options remained on the table for Iraq.
He agreed with the panel that the situation was unacceptable and said he would introduce a change of tactics, if confirmed. 
Mr Gates said he would do his utmost to avoid chaos in Iraq. 
“Our course over the next year or two will determine whether the American and Iraqi people and the next president of the US will face a slowly but steadily improving situation in Iraq or… the very real risk and possible reality of a regional conflagration,” he said. 
Asked by the next chairman of the panel, Democratic Senator Carl Levin, if he believed the US was winning, Mr Gates replied: “No, Sir.” 
He later said he believed the US was neither winning nor losing, “at this point”. 
Mr Levin said the US needed someone who would speak the truth, and not just tell the president what he wanted to hear. 
Mr Gates said the president would have the last say on any changes in approach, but he would speak his mind to both Mr Bush and Congress. 
“I did not want this job,” he reminded the senators. 
“I’m doing it because I love my country.” 
In wide-ranging remarks, the nominee also: 
Said the US should attack Iran only as a last resort and he would not support military action against Syria 
Called for a broad bipartisan agreement on how to fight war on terror 
Phased withdrawal 
Now that the panel has approved his nomination, the 63-year-old is likely to appear before the full Senate for a confirmation hearing later this week. 
Democratic senators are thought unlikely to oppose Mr Gates’ nomination not least because they are keen to see Mr Rumsfeld leave the role quickly. 
Mr Gates met Mr Bush for breakfast at the White House before the hearing, after which the president said the nominee would “do an excellent job”. 
Correspondents say he would probably be the most significant new blood to come into the Bush team since the president took office. 
Mr Gates stood down from the bipartisan Iraq Study Group – which has been asked to recommend ways of tackling the problems the US faces in Iraq – after Mr Bush picked him to replace Mr Rumsfeld. 
The group’s recommendations are widely expected to include a gradual phased withdrawal of US troops over the next 18 months. 
It is also thought to favour the idea of holding a regional conference on Iraq that would involve Syria and Iran, with whom Washington has refused to negotiate directly. 
Mr Bush has indicated he will look closely at, but not necessarily follow, the group’s suggestions.

…Freedom of Speech…
Friday November 17, 11:17 pm ET  
44 Janitors Arrested in Non-Violent Civil Disobedience in Houston Held on Combined $39.1 Million Bond 
For peaceful protestors charged with Class B misdemeanors, bond for each set at unprecedented $888,888 cash; For Harris County man recently charged with murder, bond set at $30,000 

HOUSTON, Nov. 17 /PRNewswire/ — In an unprecedented transparent attempt to severely limit the right to peaceful protest and freedom of speech of low-wage Houston janitors and their supporters, a Harris County District Attorney has set an extraordinarily high bond of $888,888 cash for each of the 44 peaceful protestors arrested last night. Houston janitors and their supporters, many of them janitors from other cities, were participating in an act of non-violent civil disobedience, protesting in the intersection of Travis at Capitol when they were arrested in downtown Houston Thursday night. They were challenging Houston’s real estate industry to settle the janitors’ strike and agree on a contract that provides the 5,300 janitors in Houston with higher wages and affordable health insurance.
The combined $39.1 million bond for the workers and their supporters is far and above the normal amount of bail set for people accused of even violent crimes in Harris County. While each of the non-violent protestors is being held on $888,888 bail …

    * For a woman charged with beating her granddaughter to death with a
      sledgehammer, bail was set at $100,000;
    * For a woman accused of disconnecting her quadriplegic mother’s breathing
      machine, bail was set at $30,000;
    * For a man charged with murder for stabbing another man to death in a bar
      brawl, bail was set at $30,000;
    * For janitors and protesters charged with Class B misdemeanors for past
      non-violent protests, standard bail has been set at $500 each.
More than 5,300 Houston janitors are paid $20 a day with no health insurance, among the lowest wages and benefits of any workers in America.
Community activists and leaders expressed concern and dismay today at the police’s use of horses to intimidate and corral janitors participating in the non-violent civil disobedience Thursday night in downtown Houston. The police’s choice to use horses to stop the protest resulted in four people being injured, including an 83-year old female janitor from New York.
In a statement released today prior to the bonds being set, U.S. Representative Sheila Jackson Lee said, “A protest is a sign of freedom in the United States and exercises our basic rights to free speech.”
Photos and video shot by people in the crowd during the incident are available on http://www.houstonjanitors.org
Background:
More than 1,700 SEIU janitors in Houston have been on strike since October 23 over civil rights abuses and a failure to bargain in good faith by their employers, the five national cleaning companies ABM, OneSource, GCA, Sanitors, and Pritchard.
With five of the most influential players in Houston’s commercial real estate industry refusing to intervene in the dispute, the workers’ strike against five national cleaning firms is increasing in scope and intensity. In the highly competitive market of contract cleaning, it the building landlords that hire the cleaning firms that negotiate and set rates for janitors’ wages and benefits. These five major landlords, Hines, Transwestern, Crescent, Brookfield Properties, and the oil giant Chevron, have the power to settle the strike by directing the cleaning contractors they hire to provide higher wages and health insurance all workers need to support their families.
In every city, the janitors work for many of the same national cleaning firms in buildings owned by the same national commercial landlords. But, while janitors in Chicago, Los Angeles, New York and other cities make more than $10 an hour, have health insurance and full-time work, Houston workers are paid an average of $20 a day, with no health insurance for part-time work.
Last fall, 5,300 Houston janitors made the historic choice to form a union with SEIU (Service Employees International Union). Their decision capped one of the largest successful organizing drives by private sector workers ever in the Southern half of the United States. Since forming a union with SEIU, Houston janitors have been seeking a raise to $8.50/hour, more hours, and health insurance in a citywide union contract. For more info, visit houstonjanitors.org
More than 225,000 janitors in 29 cities are members of SEIU.

Today, i got the estimate for the repair to my computer screen.  £315.  Or, if I can’t pay that, £35 to get the broken computer returned to me.
Problem?  I don’t have the money for the repair but need to get my computer fixed 🙁
PLUS, that’s only the cost of getting the cracked screen fixed.  Not the original problem.
So, I’m gonna have to phone them up, explain that I won’t have the money till January (when I get my next loan payment) and ask if they’ll accept a post dated cheque as payment.  We’ll see what happens.
Oh, and kareoke pictures!

1428,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/sir-elton-ban-organised-religion-3929552/,2006-11-11,Sir Elton: Ban organised religion,"
Sir Elton John has said he would like to see all organised religion banned and accused it of trying to “turn hatred towards gay people”. 
Organised religion lacked compassion and turned people into “hateful lemmings”, he told the Observer. 
But the musician said he loved the idea of the teachings of Jesus Christ and the beautiful stories about it which he had learned at Sunday school. 
And he said there were many gays he knew who loved their religion. 
‘Doesn’t work’ 
His comments were made in a special gay edition of the Observer Music Monthly Magazine, where he was interviewed by Scissor Sisters’ Jake Shears. 
“I think religion has always tried to turn hatred towards gay people,” he said. “Religion promotes the hatred and spite against gays. 
“But there are so many people I know who are gay and love their religion.” 
According to the singer-songwriter, 59, his solution would be to “ban religion completely, even though there are some wonderful things about it”. 
He added: “I love the idea of the teachings of Jesus Christ and the beautiful stories about it, which I loved in Sunday school and I collected all the little stickers and put them in my book. 
“But the reality is that organised religion doesn’t seem to work. It turns people into hateful lemmings and it’s not really compassionate.” 
He also said that the problems experienced by many gays in former nations of the Soviet bloc, such as Poland, Latvia and Russia were caused by the church supporting anti-gay movements. 
‘God’s people’ 
And he called on the leaders of major religions to hold a “conclave” to discuss the fate of the world – which he said was “near escalating to World War Three”. 
“I said this after 9/11 and people thought I was nuts,” he said. “It’s all got to be dialogue – that’s the only way. Get everybody from each religion together and say ‘Listen, this can’t go on. Why do we have all this hatred?’ 
“We are all God’s people; we have to get along and the [religious leaders] have to lead the way. If they don’t do it, who else is going to do it? They’re not going to do it and it’s left to musicians or to someone else to deal with it.” 
He also said he would continue to campaign for gay rights. 
“I’m going to fight for them, whether I do it silently behind the scenes or so vocally that I get locked up.”

AKA the continuing adventures of Will’s broken laptop and his attempts to get the damn thing fixed so he can continue downloading stuff getting his coursework actually done, even though we all know that the chances of that actually happening are somewhere near absolute zero due to Will being a world class procastinator, hence the reason he’s writing an absurdly long alternate title for this entry and possibly scaring his readership off instead of actually writing the entry.
Anyway, when I left the tale, I had bought some bulldog clips to try and get my screen working.  These, along with cotton buds (no, really) did actually work.  Meanwhile I waited the five working days for them to call me back.  Which, of course, they never did.
In the meantime my oh-so-clever was still working.  Untill Tuesday when it managed to actually crack the screen.  Cos I is smart.  S-M-R-T, smart.
Due to having college on Wednesday I was going to phone Toshiba on Thursday.  But I didn’t need to due to the fact that they actually remembered that I had a problem!
Turns out I didn’t need to pay the £25 collection fee.  However, if the repairs are not covered by the warranty (which, by the sounds of it they will be) and I don’t want to pay for it, I have to pay £32 to get my beloved computer back 🙁
So, they came to collect it today at 2pm and I should have it back within 3 – 5 days 🙂
And so, I’ll finish with a moral dilema:
You’re in Florida…In Miami, to be exact. There is great chaos going on around you, caused by a hurricane and severe floods. There are huge masses of water all over you. You are a CNN photographer and you are in the middle of this great disaster. The situation is nearly hopeless. You’re trying to shoot very impressive photos. There are houses and people floating around you, disappearing into the water. Nature is showing all its destructive power and is ripping everything away with it.
Suddenly you see a man in the water, he is fighting for his life, trying not to be taken away by the masses of water and mud. You move closer. Somehow the man looks familiar.
Suddenly you know who it is — it’s George W. Bush!
At the same time you notice that the raging waters are about to take him away, forever. You have two options. You can save him or you can take the best photo of your life. So you can save the life of George W. Bush, or you can shoot a Pulitzer prize winning photo, a unique photo displaying the death of one of the world’s most powerful men.
And here’s the question (please give an honest answer):
Would you select color film, or rather go with the simplicity of classic black and white?

The screen for my laptop has been playing up recently.
This weekend I really needed to get the script for my specialism written so I could rough out storyboards and pass the lot onto my friend Nikki so she could make proper storyboards for me.  (I really, really can’t draw and want them looking as good as they can be.)
So, true to form, my screen picks this bloody weekend to decide that it doesn’t want to work unless I press on the frame in one corner with my thumb.  You can probably guess how damn annoying that is.
So I phone Toshiba tech support and report the problem (as the computer is still under warranty).  After factory resetting the thing the problem still exists (kinda like I thought it would).  So I phone back.  Get this:
It’s going to take up to 5 working days for them to even pick the damn thing up for repair (which is going to cost me £25).
If the damage is covered by my warranty, or if I can afford to pay them to fix it, it will then take up to 3 weeks for them to fix it.  THREE BLOODY WEEKS!
So, yeah.  I’ve bought bulldog clips in the hope that they’ll help me.  Otherwise I’m stuck on the uni lrc computers (again).
Sorry about that.  Rant over.

From the Baltimore Sun
FBI is contacted over anonymous package
By Melissa Harris
Sun reporter
October 20, 2006
Diebold Election Systems Inc. expressed alarm and state election officials contacted the FBI yesterday after a former legislator received an anonymous package containing what appears to be the computer code that ran Maryland’s polls in 2004.
Cheryl C. Kagan, a longtime critic of Maryland’s elections chief, says the fact that the computer disks were sent to her – along with an unsigned note criticizing the management of the state elections board – demonstrates that Maryland’s voting system faces grave security threats.
A spokesman for Diebold, which manufactures the state’s touch-screen voting machines, said the company is treating the software Kagan received as “stolen” and not as “picked up” at the State Board of Elections, as the anonymous note claimed. Lawyers for the company are seeking its return.
The disclosure comes amid heightened concerns nationwide about the security of the November elections and the ability of the state to keep tight controls on the thousands of machines that will be used next month.
Maryland’s September primary – which used voting machines and electronic check-in equipment made by Diebold – suffered a series of mistakes, and the outcomes of some contests were not known for weeks.
In the wake of the problems, Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. and other politicians renewed their call to jettison the equipment. The governor has urged state voters to request absentee ballots, although use of the paper alternative raises different concerns about fraud.
A spokesman for the governor said the apparent distribution of the voting-machine software was troubling.
“This raises yet another unanswered question with regard to Diebold technology,” said Henry Fawell, an Ehrlich spokesman.
The availability of the code – the written instructions that tell the machines what to do – is important because some computer scientists worry that the machines are vulnerable to malicious and virtually undetectable vote-switching software. An examination of the instructions would enable technology experts to identify flaws, but Diebold says the code is proprietary and does not allow public scrutiny of it.
Diebold has not confirmed that the code received by Kagan is authentic, said Mike Morrill, a spokesman for the company in Maryland. But Johns Hopkins University computer scientist Aviel Rubin reviewed one of the disks and said he believed it was genuine. If it wasn’t, he said, “someone went to great lengths to make it look like it was.”
“My feeling is that it may have come out of the testing labs, which means that if that’s true, their procedures for protecting their clients’ valuable proprietary information have failed,” said Rubin, who in 2003 published a report on Diebold security flaws after discovering a copy of the code on the Internet.
“If it came out of Diebold, it’s like Coca-Cola having their recipe exposed and then not learning their lesson,” he said. “If it came out of the testing labs, then it’s hard to blame the manufacturer.”
Kagan, a former state Democratic delegate from Montgomery County who is now executive director of the Carl M. Freeman Foundation, said the disks were delivered to her office Wednesday.
An accompanying letter refers to the State Board of Elections and calls Kagan “the proud recipient of an ‘abandoned baby Diebold source code’ right from SBE accidentally picked up in this envelope, right in plain view at SBE. … You have the software because you are a credible person who can save the state from itself. You must alert the media and save democracy.”
Kagan called the attorney general’s office, and word of the disks began to spread. Learning of the development, Linda H. Lamone, the state’s elections chief, reported Kagan’s possession of the code to the FBI yesterday.
Kagan said she had been contacted by an FBI investigator but had not met with him. “I intend to cooperate” with the inquiry, Kagan said, adding that she believed evidence of a serious security breach had to be revealed.
An FBI spokeswoman could not confirm yesterday the nature of the bureau’s interest.
Morrill, the Diebold spokesman, said it was unlikely that the code was obtained in the manner outlined in the letter.
The codes, which were delivered to Kagan in three versions on separate disks, are proprietary – meaning there are restrictions on their use and duplication. Violators of those restrictions could be charged with crimes.
Based on their labels, the disks appear to be created by two companies that test the software – Wyle Laboratories and Ciber Inc., whose teams are based in Huntsville, Ala. Maryland law requires such independent testing before the equipment’s use.
The disks have the testing authorities’ names on them, as well as other identifying features. Anyone who had permission to handle these disks would have received passwords from Diebold, enabling investigators to trace those authorized to use them.
Morrill said two of three disks were never used and that the third was version 4.3.15c, which was used in Maryland during the 2004 primary.
Ross Goldstein, the state’s deputy elections administrator, said Maryland now uses version 4.6 and that the public should be confident that their votes are secure.
The disks contain “nothing that’s being used in this election,” Goldstein said.
Diebold marketing director Mark Radke said the company is investigating the chain of custody of the disks and is asking its testing companies to pull their logs.
“These disks contain codes used for testing purposes,” Radke said. “They were shipped from the testing authority. Diebold was never in the chain of custody.”
Older versions of Diebold’s computer code have long been in public circulation, including the copy discovered by Rubin.
This year, a team of Princeton University computer scientists obtained a slightly older version of the code than that sent to Kagan and found that a programmer with access to the voting machines and their passwords could install malicious software or viruses.
Some of the flaws could be remedied with quick fixes, the researchers said, but others were “architectural in nature” and could not be easily corrected without redesigning the machines.
“In any case, subsequent versions of the software should be assumed insecure until fully independent examination proves otherwise,” the researchers wrote.
Diebold has consistently resisted pressures from computer and political scientists to make their software available to experts for critiques, a process called open-source software development.
Not doing that is “a mistake” on Diebold’s part, said Donald F. Norris, a professor at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County and director of the university’s National Center for the Study of Elections.

Sorry for the lack of updates recently.  College stuff has been kicking my ass and I’ve been slightly blocked as well.
Which has been helping the college stuff kick my ass.
So, college update:
Straight 8:
I have my script.  (If anyone want’s to read it and critique it, let me know.  Don’t forget your email address if I don’t already have it.)  I have an actor (I think).  I have my crew (all 2 of us).  What I don’t have yet is the Super8 stock to film it on.
My tutor has decided, in his infinate wisdom, that as the one for entry to the festival is to be filmed on Super8, the version for assessment has to be filmed on the same medium.  But, guess who’s got to actually pay for it?
So for the stock, the processing and the telecine it’s going to cost me just under £40.  And then there’s entering the festival itself.  Which is another £40.
Nope, I don’t think it’s fair either.  And I am planning to complain.  (Well, in addition to the drunken rant Shar suffered on Wednesday night.  Sorry about that.)
Live studio:
Not actually mentioned this module before.  Basically we have to create a show to be recorded as live in the TV studio at college.  Previously the class was split into 2 groups and each group made a 30 min programme.  Due to complaints about the way it was done, this has since changed to 4 groups contributing a 12 min segment of a hour long programme (including ad breaks).
While I can completely understand why it’s being done the way it is, I can see far too many things that could go horribly wrong.  The main one at the moment by clashes of ego.  But we’ll see.
I’m directing my groups segment which is called Tony Blair On Trial.  Well, at the moment anyway.  Title may be reshuffled.
We’ve encountered a few problems but we’ll get there.
Now, onto other stuff.
I have a digital camera.  It only cost me £25 (which is a bargan).  It’s not the best camera in the world, but then I didn’t really need it to be so…
Strangely enough, when I bought it, the person serving me pointed out that although it captures video images, it won’t capture sound and is that ok?  I felt like pointing out that I have a camcorder and are studying TV and Film Production so would not be using it for video capture.  But I kept my mouth shut.
Now all I need is a memory card for it.  But I’ll put off buying that cos I’m sure my mum’s got a spare one.
I also won my first ebay auction the other day!  Wanna see what I bought?  Click here!
Yup, I now have my very own Super8 camera!  Yay!  And I actually do have it, it arrived this morning.  Once I get home I’ll take a pic of it (with my new camera) and post it here.  So, yup.  One old camera, one new camera.
Anyhoo, I do actually remember the old saying if after a long time you don’t strike oil, stop boring.
Or in other words:
“Stop talking now? Yeah, you bet.”

A US court has ruled that the conviction of former Enron boss Kenneth Lay cannot stand as he died before he was able to appeal against the verdict.
He died in July, less than two months after his conviction for fraud and conspiracy related to Enron’s collapse.
A US district judge ruled that the case against him should be wiped out as a dead defendant could not be punished.
The US energy giant went bankrupt in 2001 with debts of $31.8bn (£18bn), leaving 4,000 people out of work.
The verdict is likely to hamper the government’s efforts to recover $43.5m in cash and other financial assets which prosecutors claim that Mr Lay stole from Enron shareholders.
The authorities can still pursue these claims in a civil court but will have to compete with other litigants, which include ex-investors and employees of the energy giant.
Black hole
Mr Lay’s lawyers argued the conviction should be overturned following his death, citing a 2004 appeals court ruling that the state could not punish a dead defendant or their estate unless their case had been heard on appeal.
Mr Lay was chairman of the Texas firm at the time of its spectacular collapse in 2001 after a huge black hole was uncovered in its finances.
He was found guilty of being aware of and doing nothing to prevent a massive fraud at the company, which knocked $60bn of its market value.
Mr Lay’s co-defendant, former Enron chief executive Jeffrey Skilling, is due to be sentenced on Monday.
Andrew Fastow, the firm’s former finance director who gave evidence against Mr Lay and Mr Skilling in their fraud trial, was sentenced to six years in jail earlier this month.

An ITN journalist was unlawfully killed by American soldiers in southern Iraq, an inquest has found.
The troops shot 50-year-old Terry Lloyd in the head while he was in a makeshift ambulance, having already been hurt in crossfire, the coroner said.
Mr Lloyd’s interpreter was also killed and his cameraman is missing believed dead following the incident, which took place near Basra in March 2003.

Oxfordshire Assistant Deputy Coroner Andrew Walker said he would also be writing to the director of public prosecutions asking for him to investigate the possibility of bringing charges.

Mr Lloyd’s Lebanese interpreter, Hussein Osman, was also killed and French cameraman Fred Nerac is still officially classed as missing, presumed dead. Belgian cameraman Daniel Demoustier was the ITN crew’s only survivor.
The National Union of Journalists (NUJ) said Mr Lloyd’s killing was a “war crime” and this was echoed by Mr Lloyd’s widow, Lyn.
In a statement she said: “This was a very serious war crime, how else can firing on a vehicle in these circumstances be interpreted?
“This was not a friendly fire incident or a crossfire incident, it was a despicable, deliberate, vengeful act, particularly as it came many minutes after the initial exchange.
“US forces appear to have allowed their soldiers to behave like trigger happy cowboys in an area where civilians were moving around.”
Mr Lloyd’s daughter Chelsey said: “The killing of my father would seem to amount to murder, which is deeply shocking.”
A spokesman for the US Department of Defense said an investigation in May 2003 had found that US forces followed the rules of engagement.
“The Department of Defense has never deliberately targeted non-combatants, including journalists,” he said.
“We have always gone to extreme measures to avoid civilian casualties and collateral damage.
“It has been an unfortunate reality that journalists have died in Iraq. Combat operations are inherently dangerous.”
ITN praised
Mr Lloyd, who was originally from Derby, was covering the British and American invasion of Iraq as a “unilateral” journalist, rather than those “embedded” with UK or US forces, who were subject to military censorship.
He and his three colleagues were caught up in a firefight between US and Iraqi forces near the Shatt Al Basra Bridge on 22 March 2003.
After an eight-day inquest Mr Walker cleared ITN of any blame for Mr Lloyd’s death and praised him and his team for their “professionalism and dedication”.
He said it was his view the American tanks had been first to open fire on the ITN crew’s two vehicles.
He added Mr Lloyd would probably have survived the first bullet wound he received, but was killed as he travelled away in a makeshift ambulance.
Mr Walker said it “presented no threat to American forces” since it was a civilian minibus and was facing away from the US tanks.
“I have no doubt it was the fact that the vehicle stopped to pick up survivors that prompted the Americans to fire on that vehicle,” he said.
ITN’s editor in chief David Mannion said: “I would also like to say something that I know Terry would have wished me to say.
“Independent, unilateral reporting, free from official strictures, is crucial; not simply to us as journalists but to the role we play in a free and democratic society.”
Mr Nerac’s widow Fabienne said she would continue her “lonely vigil” to find out what happened to her husband.

Why is it that just when you really, really need something, you can never find it?  Narrow ruled A4 notepads*, pens, socks, garden gnomes…
Yup, you read that right.  Garden gnomes.  Three to be precise.
Y’see, as I mentioned before, I am, as part of my coursework, entering a cometition called Straight 8.  So, I was struggling to come up with an idea to film.  So I started brainstorming ideas and wrote that I needed, as a prop, a garden gnome.
I then got an image in my head, that I cannot budge, of a garden gnome with a lit cigarette in my mouth.  This then gave me the inspiration to come up with the whole film.
So now I need to find the damn thing.  Well, actually 3.  One for the non smoking bit, one for the smoking bit and one so I can experiment and get the shot I want.
So, trailed round town today.  Could I find anywhere which sells even one garden gnome?  Can I ecclescake!
(BTW: before any of you point it out, there are no garden shops nearby and besides, I have to fund this with my own money and won’t be able to afford their prices.)
So, the Great Willish Gnome Hunt ’06 will continue tomorrow.
In the meantime, here’s a picture of me supposedly dressing like a schoolboy:

So, last night my course leader paid for everyone to go see a film.  Yay!
Bad is that the film in question was The Night Listener.  Boo!  I maybe reviewing it later but suffice to say it was crap!
Then today we had icebreakers to get to know the first years.  One of these was recoring audio links for a CCAD programme on the Propeller channel.  But they wanted to film them as well.
Bugger.
I do not like appearing on camera.  I don’t even like getting my photo taken.  So you can imagine how much I was looking forward to that one.  Thankfully, I managed to talk my course leader into not filming me.
Then I got some good news.  We had already been told that the college had purchased a high definition camera for the course.  Now, I was thinking of filming my specialism on 16mm film.  The only problem with that is the cost.
I asked my course leader today if we were also getting high definition editing facilities.  She replied that not only were we getting such facilities, but that it would be Final Cut Pro instead of Premiere.  YAY!
(I have always, always prefered editing on Final Cut as it is vastly superior to Premiere.)
So it looks like the 16mm is out and high definition filming is in.

1442,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/judge-says-saddam-not-dictator-3929538/,2006-09-13,Judge says Saddam ‘not dictator’,"
The chief judge in Saddam Hussein’s trial has said the former Iraqi leader was not a dictator, but had only been made to seem like one by his aides. 
The controversial comments come a day after Judge Abdullah al-Amiri was accused of bias towards the defence. 
During the court session, a Kurdish man recalled a 1989 audience with Saddam Hussein, which he had hoped would secure freedom for his jailed family. 
Saddam Hussein and six others are on trial for war crimes against Kurds. 
The trial comes against a backdrop of increased violence. 
On Thursday, US forces said they had captured an al-Qaeda leader in one of several raids in Baghdad. 
Another al-Qaeda leader, Abu Jaafar al-Liby, is said to have been killed in a raid by Iraqi forces. 
Elsewhere in Baghdad, police said at least 10 people had been killed in two car bomb attacks on Thursday. 
The first blast happened in a mixed Shia and Sunni area in north-western Baghdad. The second bomb exploded outside a passport office. 
Elsewhere, a traffic-police colonel was shot dead on his way to work in Baghdad. 
Family ‘gone’ 
The exchange between the judge and Saddam Hussein came after the testimony of Abdullah Mohammed Hussain. 
Saddam Hussein asked the 57-year-old witness: “Why did you try to meet me when you knew I was a dictator?” 
“You were not a dictator. People around you made you [look like] a dictator,” the judge said. 
“Thank you,” Saddam Hussein replied. 
Earlier in the high-profile trial taking place within Baghdad’s high-security Green Zone, Mr Hussain said how he had met the Iraqi leader in 1989 after the end of the Anfal campaign against the Kurds. 
He said the meeting came after repeated requests to the Iraqi military. 
“I told Saddam: ‘Sir, my family members were arrested’,” Mr Hussain, a farmer, told the court. 
“Saddam asked me where, and I told him: ‘In my village’. Saddam said: ‘Shut up. Your family is gone in the Anfal’.” 
The Iraqi president told him to “get out of here”, he said. 
“I saluted him, saying: ‘Yes, sir.’ And I left. I consoled myself, thinking that Saddam may feel sorry for me and set my family free. I was very sad. But I really hoped he would release them,” he said. 
Mr Hussain said the remains of some of his relatives turned up in a mass grave only two years ago, but that there was no trace of others. 
The witness also described how his village of Sida, near the Kurdish city of Suleimaniya, came under attack by artillery fire and aircraft during the Anfal campaign. 
On Wednesday, chief prosecutor Munqith al-Faroon called for the judge to stand down for alleged bias towards the defendants, saying the accused had been given too much room to threaten witnesses and make political speeches. 
The previous day, Saddam Hussein had threatened to “crush the head” of a lawyer of one witness for the prosecution. 
The former leader and others, including his cousin Ali Hassan al-Majid, are accused of killing up to 180,000 Kurdish civilians during Operation Anfal.

…remains anonymous
By SAM GREENHILL 
An innocent man jailed for a sex attack was dramatically cleared after it emerged that his ‘victim’ is a serial liar with a long history of crying rape. 
But because of laws that protect her anonymity, judges are powerless to name and shame her, leaving her free to make more false accusations against blameless members of the public. 
Mr Blackwell, 36, hugged his loyal wife Tanya and wept as the Appeal Court quashed his conviction. 
He described his accuser as “every man’s worst nightmare”. 
Mr Justice Tugendhat admitted, however, that similar tragic cases could follow because of the lies of the woman, Miss A. 
“Parliament does not seem to have contemplated this situation. 
“There appears to be no means of displacing her entitlement to anonymity.” 
In the 1970s, the Daily Mail campaigned for women in sex cases to be granted automatic anonymity, but now there are questions about whether the law has gone too far. 
Warren Blackwell’s nightmare began when Miss A, now 38, claimed she had been seized with a knife outside a village club early on New Year’s Day 1999, taken to an alley and indecently assaulted. 
She later picked Mr Blackwell out at an identity parade. 
There was no forensic evidence against him and he had no previous convictions. 
‘She needs to be stopped’

Yet Mr Blackwell, from Woodford Halse, Northamptonshire, was found guilty and spent three years and four months behind bars. 
Eventually the case was referred to the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) which assigned Detective Chief Inspector Steve Glover, to investigate. He discovered that the woman: 
 Has made at least five other fake allegations of sexual and physical assault to police in three separate forces. 
 Was married twice and made false allegations against both husbands – one of whom was a policeman. 
 Once accused her own father of sexual assault, but police concluded she had made it up. 
 Accused a boy of rape when she was a teenager, only for a doctor to discover she was still a virgin. 
 The CCRC concluded that in the case of Mr Blackwell, she had “lied about the assault and was not attacked at all, her injuries being self-inflicted”. 
The Crown Prosecution Service did not oppose the appeal. 
David Farrell QC, for the Crown, said: “This conviction is unsafe. What has come out of the woodwork paints a picture of a woman with immense personal problems with serious difficulties in distinguishing between truth and lies.” 
If this information had been known at the time of the trial, he added, “this case would not have made it off the ground”. 
Mr Blackwell said: “Clearly something has to be done about this woman. She needs to be stopped. The prosecution say she is psychiatrically disturbed, but insane people who murder are tried and if found guilty put away.” 
Mr Blackwell, who plans to sue police over his ordeal, will now have his name removed from the Sex Offender Register. 
His accuser has a history of mental illness and self-harm – once inscribing the word ‘HATE’ on her body with scissors. 
However, because she has changed her name at least eight times, and moved between addresses in at least three counties, it seems police never realised they were dealing with the same woman. 
For Mr Blackwell, her accusations meant he missed more than three years of family life. His son Liam, ten, and stepdaughter Holly, 16, were three and nine when his ordeal began. 
His 36-year-old wife said: “I never doubted him for a second. We were together six years before it happened, and ever since.”

Published by Greg Palast September 11th, 2006 in Articles 
September 11, 2006
by Greg Palast 
It¡¯s true. It¡¯s weird. It¡¯s nuts. The Department of Homeland Security, after a five-year hunt for Osama, has finally brought charges against¡­ Greg Palast. I kid you not. Send your cakes with files to the Air America wing at Guantanamo.
Though not just yet. Fatherland Security has informed me that television producer Matt Pascarella and I have been charged with unauthorized filming of a ¡°critical national security structure¡± in Louisiana.
On August 22, for LinkTV and Democracy Now! we videotaped the thousands of Katrina evacuees still held behind a barbed wire in a trailer park encampment a hundred miles from New Orleans. It¡¯s been a year since the hurricane and 73,000 POW¡¯s (Prisoners of W) are still in this aluminum ghetto in the middle of nowhere. One resident, Pamela Lewis said, ¡°It is a prison set-up¡± ¡ª except there are no home furloughs for these inmates because they no longer have homes.
To give a sense of the full flavor and smell of the place, we wanted to show that this human parking lot, with kids and elderly, is nearly adjacent to the Exxon Oil refinery, the nation¡¯s second largest, a chemical-belching behemoth.
So we filmed it. Without Big Brother¡¯s authorization. Uh, oh. Apparently, the broadcast of these stinking smokestacks tipped off Osama that, if his assassins pose as poor Black folk, they can get a cramped Airstream right next to a ¡°critical infrastructure¡± asset.
So now Matt and I have a ¡°criminal complaint¡± lodged against us with the feds.
The positive side for me as a journalist is that I get to see our terror-busters in action. I should note that it took the Maxwell Smarts at Homeland Security a full two weeks to hunt us down.
Frankly, we were a bit scared that, given the charges, we wouldn¡¯t be allowed on a plane into New York last night. But what scared us more is that we were allowed on the plane.
Once I was traced, I had a bit of an other-worldly conversation with my would-be captors. Detective Frank Pananepinto of Homeland Security told us, ¡°This is a ¡®Critical Infrastructure¡¯¡­ and they get nervous about unauthorized filming of their property.
Well, me too, Detective. In fact, I¡¯m very nervous that this potential chemical blast-site can be mapped in extreme detail at this Google Map location.
What also makes me nervous is that the Bush Terror Terriers have kindly indicated on the Internet that this unprotected critical infrastructure can be targeted ¡ª I mean located ¡ª at 30 29¡ä 11¡å N Latitude and 91 11¡ä 39¡å W Longitude.
After I assured Detective Pananepinto, ¡°I can swear to you that I¡¯m not part of Al Qaeda,¡± he confirmed that, ¡°Louisiana is still part of the United States,¡± subject to the first amendment and he was therefore required to divulge my accuser.
Not surprisingly, it was Exxon Corporation, one of a handful of companies not in love with my investigations. [See ¡°A Well-Designed Disaster: the Untold Story of the Exxon Valdez.¡±]
So I rang America¡¯s top petroleum pusher-men and asked their media relations honcho in Houston, Marc Boudreaux, a simple question. ¡°Do you want us to go to jail or not? Is it Exxon¡¯s position that reporters should go to jail?¡± Because, all my dumb-ass jokes aside, that is what¡¯s at stake. And Exxon knew we were journalists because we showed our press credential to the Exxon guards at the refinery entrance.
The Exxon man was coy: ¡°Well, we¡¯ll see what we can find out¡­ Obviously it¡¯s important to national security that we have supplies from that refinery in the event of an emergency.¡±
Really? According to the documents our team uncovered from the offices of Exxon¡¯s lawyer, Mr. James Baker, the oil industry is more than happy to see a limit on worldwide crude production. Indeed, the current squeeze has jacked the price of oil from $24 a barrel to $64 and refined products have jumped yet higher ¡ª resulting in a record-busting profit for Exxon of nearly $1 billion per week.
So this silly ¡°criminal complaint¡± has nothing to do with stopping Al Qaeda or keeping the oil flowing. It has everything to do with obstructing news reports in a way that no one would have dared attempt before the September 11 attack.
Dectective Pananepinto, in justifying our impending bust, said, ¡°If you remember, a lot of people were killed on 9/11.¡±
Yes, Detective, I remember that very well: my office was in the World Trade Center. Lucky for me, I was out of town that day. It was not a lucky day for 3,000 others.
Yes, I remember ¡°a lot¡± of people were killed. So I have this suggestion, Detective ¡ª and you can pass it on to Mr. Bush: Go and find the people who killed them.
It¡¯s been five years and the Bush regime has not done that. Instead, the War on Terror is reduced to taking off our shoes in airports, hoping we can bomb Muslims into loving America and chasing journalists around the bayou. Meanwhile, King Abdullah, the Gambino of oil, whose princelings funded the murderers, gets a free ride in the President¡¯s golf cart at the Crawford ranch.
I guess I shouldn¡¯t complain. After all, Matt and I look pretty good in orange.
*******
A personal request to readers. Many have written to ask what can be done to protect Matt and me from becoming unwilling guests of the State.
First, this ain¡¯t no foolin¡¯ around: Matt and I are facing these nutty charges. So spread the info. We believe that getting the word out is the best defense.
Second, call Homeland Security and turn us in. They seem to have trouble finding us. If you get a reward, you may choose to donate it to the Palast Investigative Fund, a 501(c)(3) educational foundation which supports our work and pays our legal fees.
Third, ask your local library to order our book, Armed Madhouse: Who¡¯s Afraid of Osama Wolf? Homeland Security now reserves the right to read over your shoulder at the library; therefore, the more our agents are forced to read this subversive material, the more likely we can convince them to come in out of the cold. All kidding aside, we do ask you to request your library order the book: not everyone can afford to purchase this hardbound edition.
Our thanks to Amy Goodman at Democracy Now! and the folks at LinkTV for broadcasting our report from New Orleans and the Exxon refinery. And to Gil Nobel, host of the ABC Television¡¯s Like It Is, our Courage in Journalism award for broadcasting our report on his network¡¯s New York affiliate. Catch Gil on WABC every Sunday at noon.

Cos I currently get about £50 a week, and my rent is £30.  Leaving me scrabbling for cash by about Wednesday/Thursday.
Why do we need to pay rent?
Anyhoo, have to go now, cos about to be turfed out.  But before I go, I found something that I thought you lot might find interesting:

¡®Unacceptable,¡¯ ¡®Defamatory,¡¯ ¡®Strewn With A Lot of Problems,¡¯ ¡®Zero Factual Basis¡¯ 
The criticism against ABC¡¯s docudrama The Path to 9/11 isn¡¯t isolated simply to Clinton aides. In fact, many conservatives have criticized the film. Here are a few examples ¨C
John Podhoretz, conservative columnist and Fox News contributor: 
The portrait of Albright is an unacceptable revision of recent history and an unfair mark on a public servant who, no matter her shortcomings, doesn¡¯t deserve to be remembered by millions of Americans as the inadvertent (and truculent) savior of Osama bin Laden. Samuel Berger, Clinton¡¯s national security adviser, also seems to have just cause for complaint. [NYPost, 9/8/06] 
James Taranto, OpinionJournal.com editor:
The Clintonites may have a point here. A few years ago, when the shoe was on the other foot, we were happy to see CBS scotch ¡°The Reagans.¡± [OpinionJournal, 9/7/06] 
Dean Barnett, conservative commentator posting on Hugh Hewitt¡¯s blog:
One can (if one so chooses) give the filmmakers artistic license to [fabricate a scene]. But if that is what they have done, conservative analysts who back this movie as a historical document will mortgage their credibility doing so. [Hugh Hewitt blog, 9/6/06] 
Chris Wallace, Fox News Sunday anchor:
When you put somebody on the screen and say that¡¯s Madeleine Albright and she said this in a specific conversation and she never did say it, I think it¡¯s slanderous, I think it¡¯s defamatory and I think that ABC and Disney should be held to account. [Fox, 9/8/06]
Captain¡¯s Quarters blog:
If the Democrats do not like what ABC wants to broadcast, they have every right to protest it ¡ª and in this case, they had a point. [Captain Quarter¡¯s blog, 9/7/06] 
Bill Bennett, conservative author, radio host, and TV commentator:
Look, ¡°The Path to 9/11¡å is strewn with a lot of problems and I think there were problems in the Clinton administration. But that¡¯s no reason to falsify the record, falsify conversations by either the president or his leading people and you know it just shouldn¡¯t happen. [CNN, 9/8/06] 
Seth Liebsohn, Claremont Institute fellow and produce of Bill Bennett¡¯s radio show: 
I oppose this miniseries as well if it is fiction dressed up as fact, creates caricatures of real persons and events that are inaccurate, and inserts quotes that were not uttered, especially to make a point that was not intended. [Glenn Greewald¡¯s blog, 9/7/06] 
Richard Miniter, conservative author of ¡°Losing bin Laden: How Bill Clinton¡¯s Failures Unleashed Global Terror¡±:
If people wanted to be critical of the Clinton years there¡¯s things they could have said, but the idea that someone had bin Laden in his sights in 1998 or any other time and Sandy Berger refused to pull the trigger, there¡¯s zero factual basis for that. [CNN, 9/7/06] 
Brent Bozell, founder and president of the conservative Media Research Center:
I think that if you have a scene, or two scenes, or three scenes, important scenes, that do not have any bearing on reality and you can edit them, I think they should edit them. [MSNBC, 9/6/06] 
UPDATE: 
Bill O¡¯Reilly, Fox News pundit:
Ok, we¡¯re talking about the run up to 9-11 and this movie that they¡¯re re-cutting now ¡ª and they should because it puts words in the mouth of real people, actors playing real people that they didn¡¯t say and its wrong. [O¡¯Reilly radio show, 9/8/06]

I am ashamed to say that the programme aired over here on the BBC in 2 parts.  The first part was last night, the second part is tonight (afaik).  Did I watch it?  No.  I decided instead to watch a re-run of an episode from The West Wing Season 1.
I do, however, find it amusing that so many conservatives are now decrying the attempt at censorship over this.  After they complained so vocally over Fahreneight 9/11 or that programme about Ronald Regan.
As Andrew Sheppard said in The American President:
“It’s gonna say “You want free speech? Let’s see you acknowledge a man whose words make your blood boil, who’s standing center stage and advocating at the top of his lungs that which you would spend a lifetime opposing at the top of yours.”
Are these same people now willing to admit their hypocracy?
My position on the whole thing is that ABC and the BBc are entitled to broadcast this if they want.  If you don’t want to watch, do what I did and don’t watch.  My main problem with it is that they are calling it a docudrama, which is becoming a way of saying “It may not strictly be accurate, but that’s OK” as opposed to “It’s based on real life with some bits acted and there may be some artistic license taken”.

Tony Blair has confirmed he will be stepping down as prime minister within the next 12 months. 
Speaking on a visit to a London primary school, Mr Blair said he wanted to end speculation about his departure. 
The announcement follow 48 hours of bitter feuding and a string of resignations over Mr Blair’s refusal to name an exit date. 
He has not said a precise date but it is expected to be some time in May, allies say. 
There are hopes among Mr Blair’s supporters that the prime minister’s words will end damaging speculation over his future. 
But other Labour MPs are saying it will not be enough to end civil war in the party. 
Speaking before the prime minister’s announcement, left wing backbencher Jeremy Corbyn said: “We need a date from the prime minister.” 
Chancellor Gordon Brown has said he will support Mr Blair in whatever decision he takes about his future. 
“I am determined that in the months and years to come we continue to do our duty by the people of Britain – and it is my determination and his to do that – that will influence everything that happens in the time to come,” said Mr Brown, speaking earlier. 
‘Comfortable’ 
Mr Blair’s official spokesman said earlier that Mr Blair would not be “giving a running commentary” on exit dates. 
Downing Street has rejected suggestions a deal had been struck to hand over power on 4 May, three days after Mr Blair notches up 10 years in power and the day after local elections. 
The BBC’s political editor Nick Robinson said Mr Blair is thought likely to put a precise date on his departure “some time in the New Year”. 
According to this timetable, Mr Blair would then resign as Labour leader in early May, with a new prime minister in place by early June, following a party leadership election. 
But our correspondent stressed this was a provisional timetable and could change. 
Mr Blair has been under pressure to quit earlier than May in order to get a new leader in place before elections in England, Scotland and Wales, which are expected to be disastrous for Labour. 
‘Acrimonious meeting’ 
Mr Brown – the man most likely to succeed Mr Blair – was also thought to be unhappy at the prospect of taking over at the end of a Parliamentary session. 
The two men were reported to have to have had an “acrimonious meeting” over the issue on Wednesday morning. 
It was followed by a day of open warfare between supporters of the chancellor and Mr Blair over when the prime minister should quit. 
Commons leader Jack Straw moved to calm speculation by saying voters would expect Mr Blair to stay “to the halfway point of a normal four-year parliament”, which would be May. 
He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme Mr Blair had “made it clear – or it has been made clear on his behalf – this forthcoming conference, in three weeks’ time, will be his last annual conference”. 
“There has to be another leader in place by next year’s annual conference. 
“Our procedures take some time, because we’re a democratic party,” he said. 
“There has to be some certainty about who the leader is before the summer break next summer, not afterwards, and people can then work backwards from there. 
“I think that is satisfactory. I think it’s what the party accepts.”

Personally, I think that, by 1/1/07, if there isn’t a new Prime Minister, the Labour party will be in the middle of a leadership election.
After Blair gave this timetable, his opponents (both in Labour and the Conservatives) will see him as a lame duck leader.
But, we’ll see.

It was indeed The Editor (played by Simon Pegg) in the Doctor Who episode The Long Game.

So, what’s been happening with me?
Well, my black eye is slowly but surely disappearing.  For the first time this summer I’m praying I don’t have a job interview.  Oh, and I am definately going to have another scar on my face.
My landlord is annoying me.  At the moment I pay my rent weekly on a Monday as that’s when I get money.  So he insists on phoning me on the Monday.  Why?  I duno.
Mind you, from what I’ve been told he’s put two different names on the contract.  Definately a bit dodgy.

Paris Hilton targeted in CD prank 
Hundreds of Paris Hilton albums have been tampered with in the latest stunt by “guerrilla artist” Banksy. 
Banksy has replaced Hilton’s CD with his own remixes and given them titles such as Why am I Famous?, What Have I Done? and What Am I For? 
He has also changed pictures of her on the CD sleeve to show the US socialite topless and with a dog’s head. 
A spokeswoman for Banksy said he had doctored 500 copies of her debut album Paris in 48 record shops across the UK. 
She told the BBC News website: “He switched the CDs in store, so he took the old ones out and put his version in.” 
But he left the original barcode so people could buy the CD without realising it had been interfered with. 
Banksy is notorious for his secretive and subversive stunts such as sneaking doctored versions of classic paintings into major art galleries. 
His spokeswoman said he had tampered with the CDs in branches of HMV and Virgin as well as independent record stores. 
He visited cities including Bristol, Brighton, Birmingham, Newcastle, Glasgow and London, she added. 
A spokesman for HMV said the chain had recovered seven CDs from two Brighton shops but was unaware that other locations were affected. 
Artistic leeway 
No customers had complained or returned a doctored version, he said. 
“It’s not the type of behaviour you’d want to see happening very often,” he said. 
“I guess you can give an individual such as Banksy a little bit of leeway for his own particular brand of artistic engagement. 
“Often people might have a view on something but feel they can’t always express it, but it’s down to the likes of Banksy to say often what people think about things. 
“And it might be that there will be some people who agree with his views on the Paris Hilton album.” 
A spokesman for Virgin Megastores said staff were searching for affected CDs but it was proving hard to find them all. 
“I have to take my hat off – it’s a very good stunt,” he added.

So, what’s been happening in my world since yesterday?
Well, first of all, got the phone bill yesterday. £56 on calls to Canada. Wonder who I could be phoning there? So, cue not very happy housemate.
Then went into town. Handed in application form for Virgin Megastores, went to LRC with my friend, printed out letter for student loan application.
Then went to hand it in. Due to past experience with the place where I had to hand it losing things I asked for a reciept. And if looks could kill, I’d be a dead man by now. But did get my reciept.
Wondered round town with my friend, saw her onto the bus home then went home myself.
Had something to eat and then went on a night out with a couple of firends. On the way home, got a punch simply because I had no money. So currently I have a black eye and a cut just above my eyebrow which may well leave a scar.
Hey, no problem, chicks dig scars, yeah?
My friend phoned to see if I got home OK. Told her what happened, prefacing the description with the words “don’t freak out when I tell you this”. So, of course, she promptly did.
Later talked to Shar for the first time in days. God I’d missed her. (Still do, come to that.) Told her what happened, again asking her not to freak out when I did.
So, of course, she freaked out as well. Hmmm, there may be a lesson for me there but I’m damned if I can think of what it is :p
Finished talking to Shar then read some of Mick Foleys first autobiography. Then got an interesting nights sleep.
Talked to Shar again this morning. Then went to college to see about re-enrolling for my course. Turns out they had sent the form out to me, but it probably went to my old address. So, one was printed out for me to sign there and then. At which point I discovered that they got my house number wrong. Hmmm. So anyhoo, now re-enrolled. College starts back on the 18th. Which, coincidently enough, is the day Studio 60 starts in the States.
And the rest of my day has been pretty boring. So I won’t bore you with it.
Toodles!

So, I normally do this in my diary at open diary. Unfortunately, I’ve get severly limited access to OD at the mo, so here I am.
Minor annoyance: I have been waiting for a while to hear back about my student loan application. finally I get a letter yesterday asking me to supply evidence of the reason I left my old course. The problem is, I left because I realised that the course wasn’t for me. I told the university of my decision face to face and, as such, had no evidence. So I have been asked to supply a covering letter. Well, that was after I could contact the buggers.
I tried phoning yesterday. Unfortunately, the line was engaged. so I though, sod it, I’ll email them. Only to discover that I the only way to get in touch with the SLC is by phone. If I want to write/email, I have to do so through my LEA. Who, naturally enough, don’t have a bloody email address.
So I’ll get the letter written tonight, ask my friend very nicely if she’ll print it out for me (my printer access is also very limited at the mo) and get that dropped off. Oh, and I’ll get a reciept as well, cos I know what the place it’s to go to is like.
Watched Snakes On A Plane the other day. It’s actually really, really good. I mean, it’s in no way a classic, but it is what it is. Which is entertaining.
I’m also hopelessly addicted to Studio 60 On The Sunset Strip after I downloaded aquired it. Can’t wait for it to start properly. Fan – fucking – tastic.
Oh, and in comment to my last post, I was a huge fan of the planet Pluto as it drove people mad in it’s defy definition position. Grrr to the people who classified it. Grrr sayeth I
Anyway, must go, I’m about to get booted out of here.

If astrolology is a way of predicting future events using the location of planets and stars in the sky at a particular time…
And bearing in mind the news from last week that Pluto is not actually a planet…
Does this mean that decades of astrology predictions are now to be discarded?

Just to let you guys know that I’m not actually dead.  The reason I haven’t been reading/noting much (apart from the fact that I never really note much) is that I’m still on limited interweb access at home (roll on getting a wireless router) and the computers in the LRC haven’t let me access OD since Friday for reasons as yet unknown.

So, what have I been up to recently?
Well, last Wednesday, I got a surprise.
The Sunday before I phone my mum (as usual) and she told me to expect a package.  On Wednesday, it arrived.  Addressed to my mum.  Which confused one of my housemates.
I opened it.  I kinda knew what it would be, seeing as my mum had promised to buy me a new MP3 player.
However, I really wasn’t expecting a 1gig mp3 player with built in FM radio!  (Have I ever said before that my mum rocks?)
So I currently have a sitload of music on it.  The only real problem I have is that it does not have a random feature.
What else have I been up to?
Had to factory reset my laptop the other day.  Not that I particularly wanted to.  But when I switched it on on Thursday, I had no icons on my desktop and no taskbar either.
GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
So, yeah, factory reset.
But I have got a couple of rather nice toys for my computer.
One is an open source programme for editing songs (which I used so I finally have Mirsulu by Dick Dale and the Daletones without the Pulp fiction quote at the begining.)  The other rips audio tracks from DVD’s.
At the moment, I’m using that one to make a Live 8 album from the DVD’s.  I’m also planning to use it to get sound clips from DVD’s for different things on my computer 😀
Apart from that, I’ve been job hunting and watching TV.  Last night I ewatched Done the Impossible, a fan made documentary about Browncoats.  It’s amazing (and, it’s free to download via torrent).
Anyhoo, have to go now (really need the toilet).  Speak to you all later.

Wife: “What’s that?”
Bloke: “It’s a cock-sucking frog.”
Wife: “What do you expect me to do with that?”
Bloke: “Teach it to cook, and fuck off.”
A cat died and went to Heaven. God met her at the gates and said, “You
have been a good cat all these years. Anything you want is yours for
the asking.”
The cat thought for a minute and then said, “All my life I lived on a
farm and slept on hard wooden floors. I would like a real fluffy
pillow to sleep on.”
God said, “Say no more.” Instantly the cat had a huge fluffy pillow.
A few days later, six mice were killed in an accident and they all
went to Heaven together. God met the mice at the gates with the same
offer that He made to the cat.
The mice said, “Well, we have had to run all of our lives: from cats,
dogs, and even people with brooms! If we could just have some little
roller skates, we would not have to run again.”
God answered, “It is done.” All the mice had beautiful little roller 
skates.
About a week later, God decided to check on the cat. He found her
sound asleep on her fluffy pillow. God gently awakened the cat and
asked, “Is everything okay? How have you been doing? Are you happy?”
The cat replied, “Oh, it is WONDERFUL. I have never been so happy in
my life. The pillow is so fluffy, and those little Meals on Wheels you
have been sending over are delicious!”

Hi, this isn’t Will!  It’s Shar.  I’d link to my diary (typed ‘dairy’ at first..mmm cheese) but I think Will’s already done so on some really cute entry he wrote for me on my birthday.
We are so cute that it makes people want to vomit.  This makes me laugh, because I have never really been like this before.  I am normally a jaded, cynical, bitter person.  But something is different now.  
I will (heh) say this: he is just about the cutest drunk person ever.  I’m not sure if any of you have ever spoken to him, but he has this really hot scottish accent.  When he’s drunk, it’s pretty damn amusing, because he has a tendency to slur his words (much like the other night), which is so endearing!  I mean, yes, I have trouble understanding him when this happens, but the funniness (is that a word?) more than makes up for the lack of understanding.
I’ve had a few beers.  I’m trying to forget how hot it is in my apartment.  It’s not working so far.
I was really, really tempted to change some of his diary settings, but that would have been evil.
So he hasn’t done this quote competition in quite awhile, so I’m going to give you all a quote and you have to guess where it came from, etc blah blah blah.

There is one downside to what’s happened this week.  What with moving and my mother visiting, I haven’t been able to speak to Shar that much.  Which totally, utterly and completely sucks.
She phoned me last night as she really needed to talk to me.  Unfortunately, I couldn’t really speak and asked her to phone back today.  Afterwards I felt really, really, really really REALLY bad about that.  But that’s the way it’s beeen most of the week.  And it sucks.
There’s this totally cute, amazing, intellegent girl who just makes me stupid amounts of happy and when she needs me I can’t be there.  And I don’t want to do anything to hurt or upset her because I worry about her and if she’s upset it upsets me.
Besides, I know how lucky I am to have someone like this in my life, luckier still that she is (for some bizarre reason) actually interested in me and I don’t want to blow it.
I’m also worried that she’s spending too much money phoning me (still no landline at the house 🙁 ) and worrying how to balance that above how good it feels to hear her voice and speak to her.
Well I woke up today
And the world seemed a restless place
It could have been that way for me
…
I wish today was just like every other day
‘Cause today has been the best day
Everything I ever dreamed
And I started to walk

I’ve had a merry time with you
I wish today was just like every other day…

…I’ve moved house again!
So, here’s how it went down.
Last Thursday night, I’m at home watching The West Wing when there’s a knock on the door.  Tis the landylord.  I was asked to fetch my housemates and we all assemble in the living room.
Landlord turns round and announces that he’s sold the house, they’re swapping keys on Monday and so we have to be out on Saturday.
Mr. Jaw, plase meet Mr. Floor.  Ooops.  Sorry.  Was that a bit painful?
He then apologises for the short notice.  Really.  He didn’t need to do that.  1 full day to find somewhere else and pack all my stuff is more than enough.  Short notice would have been phoning on Saturday morning telling us we had to be out that day.
As it turns out we found a place that night.  The guy who is renovating the house next door had a 2 bed flat to rent.  The rent was cheaper and it’s 5 minutes from college.
He has another house that he’s going to be doing up and once he’s finished that, we get first refusal onb a room there.  I won’t be moving though as:
a) it’s a pain in the backside and
b) the flat is FIVE FREAKING MINUTES FROM COLLEGE!  What, do you think I’m mad?  (Actually, don’t answer that.)
So, get my mum to agree to help me move.  The (old) landlord says will be back on Saturday night with a van to help us move.  So, Friday I get pissed instead of packing and get my packing done on Saturday.
Old (wanker) landlord turns up on Saturday night.  The van he promised was ever so slightly conspicuous by one thing.  Unless they were using a Somebody Elses Problem field on it, it was not there.
Turns out he didn’t want to pay £80 for the van hire.  So our stuff was moved in three small cars.  Making about 4 trips each.  They did ask if we could move some of it.  Ourselves.  With no vehicular help of any description.  To a place which was a good 1/2 hour walk WITHOUT being laden down with bags and boxes.
Rearange the following into a well known saying or phrase.
THINK HAPPENING FUCKING NOT CHANCE A THAT’S.
So, I’m all moved and recovering from my mothers visit.

What would you work with if you could choose completely free? Never mind college education, experience etc. What would you want to do? 
Sad as it probably sounds, I’d have to go with what I’m doing at the moment at college film making.  Particularly the writing side of things.  Even though I have to agree with Aaron Sorkin on this:
“I love writing but hate starting. The page is awfully white and it says, ‘You may have fooled some of the people some of the time but those days are over, giftless. I’m not your agent and I’m not your mommy, I’m a white piece of paper, you wanna dance with me?’ and I really, really don’t. I’ll go peaceable-like.”
scottish freya enquired:
What does the granite city mean to you ? 
Home.  Pure and simple.  No matter where I go in the world, or what I do, Aberdeen will, now and forever, be home.
Meanwhile donut went a wee bit question crazy.  Which really isn’t fair, as she could ask me these questions whenever.
1. Where do you see yourself in five years?
On a beach in the Carribian, drinking lavish and expensive cocktails and with a gorgeous woman on each arm.  Actually, that’s where I’d like to be now :p
Just kidding.  Hopefully working in the film/TV industry.
2. If you were stuck on a deserted island and could only bring 5 cds with you, what would they be? (you might have been asked this before, but humour me)
You have asked this before but here goes:
If You’re Feeling Sinister by Belle & Sebastian
The Star And The Wiseman by Ladysmith Black Mambazo
American IV: The Man Comes Around by Johnny Cash
Whatever You Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not by Arctic Monkeys and
Ladies And Gentlemen, We Are Floating In Space by Spiritualised
3. What is your favourite item of clothing?
Probably my Social Outcast t shirt.
4. Do you wear socks to bed?
Yes, I do.
5. If you could have a superpower for one day, what would it be and how would you use it?  
Probably the ability to fly so I could go to Canada.
Not content to leave loads of questions, Donut also tagged me for this meme thingy that’s making the rounds.
So, here we are.
The first player of this game starts with writing 6 weird things/habits about themselves and then selects 6 others to write an entry about their 6 weird things/habits as well as state this rule clearly. After making your list of weird things, pick 6 others. They are allowed to laugh at you in your comments as much as they want, so deal! Don’t forget to leave a note that says, “You are tagged!” in their diary.
1)  I got skin grafts when I was a child.
2)  When training at my old job, I won £5 from one of the trainers for being able to answer 100 questions from this quiz thingy correctly.
3)  I used to be a morning person.  Nowadays I have a vague concept of this morning idea.
4)  I very rarely have only one book that I am in the middle of reading at any one time.
5)  If I watch a film that has had a lot of hype, I actually have the ability to completely ignore the hype and watch the film on it’s own merits.  Usually, I enjoy the film but on occasion am disappointed (Star Wars, I’m a looking at you!)
6)  I quite often go out drinking without eating anything all day.  In fact I quite often go days without eating anything at all.
As for who I’m tagging?  I’m not sure who on my friends list has already been tagged so, if you want to do this, consider yourself tagged.  ‘Kay?
It’s been unbearably hot here the past few days.  Thankfully, it rained last night so, in Boro at least, it’s a hell of a lot cooler (thank Bob).  Still it did remind me of this old entry.  Enjoy.
**PRESS RELEASE FROM LAST WEEKS P&J***
Panic gripped the streets of Aberdeen this morning when patches of sky took on an unusual blue colour and a ball of fire appeared above the city.
The phenomenon, known as ‘The Sun’, and commonly found in Mediterranean countries such as Greece and England, unleashed a terrifying heat and brightness upon the city, causing many ordinary Aberdonian’s to tear off their hats and scarves in mid August.
While most of the motorists were able to turn their headlights and wipers fully off. Some feared that they would be scalded or blinded by ‘The Sun’s’ intense radiation of heat and light. Jack McConnell, speaking from a Sun-proof bunker lying deep under Aberdeen’s King St. urged people to be calm and return to work as normal, stating: “We’ve seen this sort of thing before, it happened once in 1947 and we put it down to the war”.
Fearing it could lead to a break out of cheerful, happy smiling he said “Don’t worry it will never last, it can’t. Our natural Siberian climate with its force 9’s, ferocious chill factor and horizontal rain will soon put pay to these shenanigans. Aberdeen will soon be freed from this terrifying situation and we can all return to our natural drab, downbeat selves complaining all the time and being suspicious about everything.”
No sooner had the apparition occurred, than a large, dark ominous cloud moved in from Ellon, covering the city and efficiently blocking out the horrible, dangerous sun. The familiar horizontal driving rain made a welcome return and once again the cafe’s along the sea front reinstated their usual metal shutters to protect themselves from the pounding they take as the sea crashes down to top of them in summer.
However, it still wasn’t as cold, drab or depressing as Peterhead.
And I’m out.

…it’s me!
So, don’t have internet at new house (yet).  As such I’m currently using the computers in the uni library.  Which is annoying as all of my bookmarks are on my laptop.  Not to mention that MSN web messenger kinda sorta sucks.
I could use my laptop here (as the library has a wireless internet thingymadoofer).  But I wouldn’t be allowed to plug the laptop into any of the power sockets.
Y’see, for safety reasons, they do not allow you to do so unless the power cable has been checked out.  They tell you that.  They also tell you that the library does not carry out aforementioned checks.
Guess what they don’t tell you?
If you guessed “Where you can get the cable checked”, congratulations.  You’ve just won yourself a cookie!
But still, internet access is internet access.  Which is handy cos I get to talk to Shar.  not as much as I’d like, but still.  Better than nothing.
I missed being able to speak to her on Sunday (first time in 2 weeks).  But then she phoned me.  Yayness!  Then the battery on my mobile phone died and I couldn’t find my charger in time to stop the call being cut.  Boooness.  🙁
I am so in love with the girl it’s not even funny.  She’s just absolutely incredible.  It’s kinda bizarre since we’ve never, y’know, actually met, but there you go.

So, last time I wrote I had just seen somewhere, talked to my mum and managed to get the deposit together.
So I then texted the guy I spoke to before and said I would take the room.  No response.
Didn’t hear anything on Wednesday, so yesterday afternoon I tried phoning him to find what was ahppening.
Only to have him tell me to do one then promptly hung up.  So, I take it you don’t want me moving in then?
Bollocks.  Especially as I had already been told I had to be out of my place by 5pm today.
Cue much panicing on my behalf.  After a marathon session on the phone, I found somewhere to move to.
It’s £20 per week more than the other room, but the room is bigger.  Also, it’s not even 5 minutes from the union, which will be handy for kareoke :¬D
So, still haven’t moved.  Couldn’t move my stuff to the new place until 6pm tonight.  And because I have a lot of stuff and no access to a car, they’re going to give me a hand tomorrow.
So, after tomorrow, my interweb access is going to be limited.  So, this’ll be my last entry for a while.  Which’ll give you lot time to ask more questions for my 1000th entry (thus far, I only have one).
There is one huge downside though.  No internet = no MSN = no talking to Shar.  Which will be the first time since, well, game seven of the Stanley Cup.  And it sucks.
The girl is amazing.  Through all the stress I’ve been experiencing these past few days, she’s been able to keep my spirits up and keep me smiling.  Even when she’s worrying about me for no reason.

1471,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/because-you-asked-for-it-2-3929509/,2006-06-27,Because you asked for it.,"
A couple of entries ago, I mentioned a 16 hour conversation I had with someone and casually commented raved about how utterly amazing she is.
And then lamented the fact that she’s in Canada and I’m stuck here in Britain.
And some of you asked for more details.
Well, it goes a little like this.
I first met her when she left a note on my diary, way back in March.  She offered an opinion on which tattoo I should get.
I started reading her diary, liked what I read and added her to my favourites list.  I then set up a myspace account (http://www.myspace.com/williamthebloody1880 in case anyone is wondering).  She asked me to add her as a friend, I checked out her profile, thought she looked like a cool person and promptly added her.  (admittedly, at the time I didn’t know it was her.)
Fast forward to a week past Monday just gone.  I’m up absurdly late watching game 7 of the Stanley Cup and she leaves me a couple of messages on myspace.  One of them has her MSN name.  So I added her to my favourites list.  And we chat during the rest of the game, and for a bit afterwards.
Tuesday, we chat a bit more.
Then on Wednesday, I get home, start watching Deal Or No Deal and sign into MSN.  She’s online.  So we start chatting.  When her MSN goes down, we use the chat function on gmail.  Being a bit freaked out by that, I download AIM and the conversation continues.  Then she phones me and we talk on the phone for about half an hour.
It’s now 10pm and we started chatting about 4:15pm.  By this time her MSN is back up and running, so we return to that.  At about midnight, I go and get food.  Which I’d been intending doing for a couple of hours but I really didn’t want to stop chatting to her.  I’m gone for about 20 minutes, the longest break in the conversation thus far.
I return and we keep chatting as I’m eating.  And we continue talking.  At 4:15am, we celebrate the fact that we’ve been talking for about 12 hours solid.  How do we celebrate?  By keeping going.
An hour later, I’ve given up all thoughts of sleeping.  I’m having too much fun talking to her.  Then, about 8, she comments that she’s tired and has work the next night.  So I make her go to bed and get some sleep.
And we’ve chatted every day since.  As well as email when she’s at work.
So, there are the details (god, this was a longer entry than I thought it would be.)
But hang on Will, you’re probably thinking to yourself, does this tube of wonderfull have a name?
Well, of course she does.
She’s best known on here as donut
And I’ve only got one thing left to say.
Happy birthday honey.

So today I went to see a room to move into.  The house was really nice, the rent is fucking amazing (£100 a month) and potential housemates seem really cool.
So, where’s the problem?
I have to pay a £100 deposit.  I don’t even have £10 to my name.  The landlords of the place I’m in won’t let me have any of my deposit back.  My mum has said she can help me with some of it, but not all.
AAARGH!!!!!!!!!!
I’m going to give her a phone later and see what’s what.  Fingers crossed for me.
Apart from that, things are going OK.  Things are going amazingly with the girl I told you about a couple of entries back.  She has the amazing ability to make me feel stunningly good about myself.  I can’t help but have a huge grin on my face when talking to her.
If only she didn’t live so far away.
Don’t forget, you’ve only got three more entries after this one to submit questions for my 1000th entry.  So go for it.

Hey, folks.
How is everybody?
I’m better than fine.
Need to find somewhere to live.  Like, by the end of the week.
Also need to find a job.  I hate being skint.
Guns N Roses are playing in Newcastle next month.  I’m a huge fan (have been for a while).  I really want ot go.
But I can’t afford it.  ARGHH!
Add to that the fact that the bank has fined me, and have no idea why.  Which has put me over my overdraft.
Double ARGHH!
Also, wouldn’t mind making a trip soon.
Supposed to be going to watch the England match tomorrow.  (Actually, must phone friend to find out what’s happening.)  So will probably post answer/question 2 of quote comp tonight.
I was taking a look round the skype website as am thinking of getting it.  They suggest that if you don’t have a microphone you could use a spare set of headphones instead.  But they can’t guarentee the quality.
Gee, I wonder why?
Maybe because headphones are NOT DESIGNED TO BE MICROPHONES?
What else.
Oh, yes.  It’s coming up to my 1000th entry.  So, it’s question time.
Ask me a question.  Ask me more than oneif you wish.  And I will answer them.
And finally, I thought I’d show you a picture of my library.

So, they’ve been doing up parts of middlesbrough.  The Boulevard, which is pretty much city centre, has been closed for over a year now while they built the Middlesbrough Institute of Modern Art and generally do up the place.
Having seen the plans, I think it’ll look good.  But then, it’s an area which has been badly needing it for years.
And it’s better than their plans for Middlehaven, another area in Middlesbrough.  Where the plans include an area inspired by Prada skirts, a theatre shaped like a toaster, a hotel shaped like a champagne bottle and glass, another one based on the game Kerplunk!, sugar cube offices.  Oh, and a giant Space Invader.
(Think I’m joking?  Go here then click on check out the plans for Middlehaven.)
Anyway, back to my original point.  They opened up part of the revamped area recently.  And blundered into outrage.
Was it that they moved the statues?  Or got rid of the tatty old shelter?
No.  It was the benches.
Yup.  Or, to be more precise, these benches.


I’ll admit, they are nice looking benches.  And they seem to be comfortable.
They were also designed in Norway, made in Scotland and cost £7,000.
Each.
And, no that was not a typo.
And how many do you think the council bought?
10.
I actually think godd on them for doing this and not just putting in ‘normal’ benches.
But, there you go.
As you may (or may not) know, Middlesbrough recently lost their manager as he’s taking over the England job.
So an enterprising soul decided to apply.  Based on his experience playing Football Manager 2005.
Don’t quite think he expected a response for Steve Gibson (Boro chairman).

So.  Where to begin?

Probably the fact that she is is incredibly hot.
And sweet.
And, for some strange reason, thinks I’m hot.
Possibly the 16 hour conversation.
Or maybe, the fact that that the conversation spanned MSN, gmail chat, AIM and a phone call.
Oh, and factor in that she has an extrememly cute accent.
Pile on the fact that I willingly didn’t sleep last night but made her get some sleep.
Oh, and the cherry on the top?
This’ll give you an idea where she lives:

1479,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/the-us-wants-to-end-guantanamo-3929501/,2006-06-20,The US ‘wants to end Guantanamo’,"
US President George W Bush has said he would like to close the US prison camp at Guantanamo Bay and send many detainees back to their home countries.
However, he said not all the inmates would be returned – some would need to be put on trial in the US because they were “cold-blooded killers”.
The comments came after talks with EU leaders at a one-day summit in Vienna.
The US has faced mounting pressure over the camp that currently holds about 460 detainees, mostly without charge.
Mr Bush has said before that he wants to close the camp.
But the BBC News website’s world affairs correspondent Paul Reynolds says his remarks on Wednesday were significant because he revealed more about how he might bring this about.
Leaders at the summit also focused on other issues:
    * Mr Bush urges Iran to respond within “weeks, not months” on an international package of incentives to get Tehran to halt its enrichment programme
    * He warns North Korea against testing a long-range missile believed to be capable of reaching the US, saying it must abide by international agreements
    * The two sides pledge to push for a world trade agreement that would benefit poorer nations
    * They agree to strengthen co-operation over the search for long-term energy security.
Releases and trials
Mr Bush said he understood European concerns over the US detention camp in Cuba.
“I’d like to end Guantanamo. I’d like it to be over with,” he said.
He said 200 detainees had been sent home, and most of those remaining were from Saudi Arabia, Yemen and Afghanistan.
But he added that there were some detainees “who need to be tried in US courts”.
“They will murder somebody if they are let out on the street.”
Austrian Chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel, who hosted the talks, welcomed Mr Bush’s comments on an eventual closure – and offered to help negotiate with countries that are to take detainees back.
Suicides
Calls to close Guantanamo have increased following the first apparent suicides by prisoners earlier this month.
Lawyers say the three men who are said to have hanged themselves had been driven by despair.
Dozens of prisoners have been released without charge, but others have been held for up to three years without being charged or facing trial.
At present only 10 inmates face trial by military tribunal and the US Supreme Court is to rule by the end of June on the legality of the tribunals.
European leaders and human rights groups have said procedures at Guantanamo Bay violate the rule of law and undermine the fight against terrorism.
“We can only have a victory in the fight against terror if we don’t undermine our common values,” Mr Schuessel said.
The Bush administration has denied allegations of abuse at Guantanamo, and the military says it provides safe, humane care and custody of the detainees

And now the request.
Need to get my creative juices flowing to rewrite a script for college next year.
Actually, first of all…
I’ve decided to re-write the script I worte for the scriptwriting class I did last year.  I know Angie has read the original but I need people who will be willing to read the new version (Angie, that includes you, if you’re so inclined) and give me honest feedback.
And, back to creative juices and flowing…
Give me something to write.  I could be a mood, a situation, a line.  All said suggestions are going to be written about and the subsequent stories posted in this diary (with a note left in your diary to let you know)
One condition.  No titles for stories.  It’s too restrictive for me.

1482,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/prosecution-demands-saddam-death-3929498/,2006-06-18,Prosecution demands Saddam death,"
The prosecution in the trial of ousted Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein has called for his execution as it delivered its closing arguments.
The prosecution said Saddam Hussein and two of his seven co-defendants should be put to death for war crimes.
The trial has now adjourned and judges will consider their verdict after final defence arguments on 10 July.
The defendants deny being responsible for the deaths of 148 Shia Muslim villagers in the 1980s.
The men are accused of launching a crackdown in the village of Dujail after a failed assassination attempt on Saddam Hussein.
In other developments:
    * An insurgent group linked to al-Qaeda says it is holding two US soldiers seized south of Baghdad on Friday
    * US and Iraqi troops push further into the western city of Ramadi
    * The UK says its troops will hand over security duties to Iraqi forces in the southern province of Muthanna next month. 
Leniency
In the trial of Saddam Hussein and seven former aides, all defendants were in court as proceedings resumed on Monday.
Chief prosecutor Jaafar al-Mussawi said: “We demand the maximum punishment for Saddam, [his half-brother] Barzan al-Tikriti and [former vice-president] Taha Yassin Ramadan.”
“They were spreading corruption on Earth… and even the trees were not saved from their oppression,” Mr Mussawi said.
Saddam Hussein, dressed in a black suit, muttered sarcastically from the dock: “Well done.”
Mr Mussawi asked for charges against one defendant, Baath party official Mohammed Azawi Ali, to be dropped and for him to be freed.
The prosecutor also asked for three other defendants – Baath officials Abdullah Kadhem Ruaid, Ali Daeem Ali and Mizher Abdullah Ruaid – to be treated leniently.
Mr Mussawi made no specific calls on the fate of Awad Hamad al-Bandar, former chief judge of Saddam Hussein’s revolutionary court.
Another prosecution lawyer, whose name has not been released for security purposes, had opened Monday’s proceedings by saying defendants had “carried out a systematic, wide-scale attack” in Dujail.
“They carried out broad imprisonments of men, women and children, who were exposed to physical and mental torture, including the use of electrical shocks,” he said.
The lawyer argued that the assassination attempt had been “fabricated” for “political aims”.
Criticised
The defence has argued the crackdown was necessary in the wake of an attempt to kill Saddam Hussein.
It has also claimed that some of the 148 people the prosecution says were killed are still alive.
The trial has so far lasted eight months and has been criticised by some international legal experts.
Some said the defence had been given a disproportionately short period to present its witnesses.
The trial has also been marred by the killing of two defence lawyers and the resignation of the first chief judge in January.

3) No clues as to where the quote is from will be supplied.
4) You must leave your answewr in a note in the comp entry.
5) There are no actual prizes. The ‘prize’ is a link to your diary and boasting rights.
6) Where there is a film and a book, if the quote is the same in both, either will be accepted as an answer.
7) If the quote appears in more than one place (i.e. two different songs), the one I got it from is the correct answer. NO EXCEPTIONS.

1485,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/east-timor-rebels-begin-to-disarm-3929495/,2006-06-16,East Timor rebels begin to disarm,"
Rebel troops in East Timor have handed over a small number of weapons to foreign peacekeepers.
Alfredo Reinado, the rebels’ leader, said he was complying with a request to disarm from President Xanana Gusmao, to whom he has pledged loyalty.
But the rebels remain firmly opposed to Prime Minister Mari Alkatiri, who sacked 600 soldiers in March.
Gun battles between loyal troops and rebel soldiers sparked recent unrest that has plagued the capital, Dili.
At least 21 people have died in the violence and another 130,000 are thought to have fled their homes in fear.
More than 2,200 foreign peacekeepers are now patrolling the city’s streets in an attempt to keep order.
Long process
Major Reinado handed his own M-16 rifle to Australian troops, then oversaw the giving in of more than a dozen other weapons.
“Everybody has to cooperate. This is only another mechanism to reach the objective. The objective is peace and justice,” he told reporters.
But it remains unclear how many weapons, and of what type, the rebel forces have.
“Every weapon we have been issued, we will hand over,” Major Reinado told reporters from his mountain hideout.
Brigadier Mick Slater, the commander of the Australian-led forces charged with restoring order to East Timor, said he was hopeful about the outcome.
“I don’t for a minute fool myself into thinking that we’ll see all of the weapons handed in today. I think this will be a gradual process over a number of days,” he told Australian media.
But he also acknowledged that many weapons were likely to remain hidden in the hills surrounding Dili “for many, many years to come”.
Mr Slater said the rebels would receive protection in return for handing over their weapons, and were expected to stay in their compounds in the towns of Maubisse and Gleno.
“Provided they stay in these areas, they will receive the full protection of the international force to make sure that no one is aggressive toward them,” Mr Slater told reporters.
“This will enable them to confidently enter into negotiations with the president and other members of the government.”

1489,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/clashes-flare-again-in-east-timor-3931937/,2006-06-03,Clashes flare again in East Timor,"
Fresh fighting between rival gangs broke out in a district of East Timor’s capital Dili on Sunday.
Youths threw rocks, set fire to homes and smashed windows in another eruption of the violence which has left at least 20 people dead in two weeks.
Malaysian and Australian troops sent to try to quell the unrest kicked in doors as they searched for weapons.
Tens of thousands of people have fled to refugee camps since the violence flared two weeks ago.
Some 2,200 international troops are trying to end the unrest sparked by the sacking in March of 600 soldiers who had gone on strike. The violence has since spread to rival ethnic gangs.
Australia, which has the largest contingent of soldiers, has said it favours bolstering the United Nations presence in the small country.
Sunday’s clashes broke out in a district of Dili close to the airport.
Malaysian and Australian troops arrived in half a dozen armoured personnel carriers, conducting door-to-door searches to try to seize weapons and tear gas canisters.
But reporters at the scene said while their presence allowed firefighters access to put out fires, gang members melted away into back alleys only to regroup for further attacks once troops moved on.
Several buildings were torched.
‘Only temporary relief’
Residents spoke of their frustration at troops’ apparent inability to impose more than temporary relief from the fighting.
“If they come, it’s okay,” resident Zeca Godinho told the news agency Associated Press, as a building burned nearby.
“But then they leave, and it starts again.”
Mr Godinho said his family had fled to the airport to escape the unrest, but that he had stayed to defend his home.
Some 100,000 people are thought to have fled to refugee camps, but aid agencies have warned that the camps offer inadequate facilities and could themselves become flashpoints for violence.
Police force
Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said on Sunday that several hundred Malaysian, Portuguese, New Zealander and Australian police would soon be arriving in East Timor to join the troops there.
East Timor’s own police force has been embroiled in the factional fighting and is in disarray.
Mr Downer, who visited the country on Saturday, has called on the UN to take command of the police force.
The UN scaled back operations after East Timor became an independent nation in 2002 following a 1999 referendum.

East Timor’s Foreign Minister and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Jose Ramos Horta is to take over as the troubled country’s security chief.
The move follows President Xanana Gusmao’s sacking of the discredited defence and interior ministers, and is designed to end weeks of violence.
The capital, Dili, was reported to be calmer on Friday.
But in one incident, hundreds of people looted a government building, taking computers and other office equipment.
Mr Ramos Horta told Australian radio his priority was to end feuding within and between the security forces that has prompted weeks of violence.
“I’m the only one who might be able to heal the wounds within the armed forces, between the armed forces and the police force, between the armed forces and society at large,” he told ABC.
The violence was triggered by the sacking of 600 troops in March. Fighting between the army and the rebel troops then spread to include the police and rival gangs, before a 2,500-strong international force arrived to keep order.
It was not clear whether Mr Ramos’ appointment would be enough to satisfy the rebel troops.
On Thursday, one of their leaders called for the resignation of the Prime Minister, Mari Alkatiri, who the rebels blame for the sackings.
Mr Alkatiri again refused to resign on Friday, saying the rebel troops should hand in their weapons.
Poverty trap
Correspondents say Dili was calmer on Friday, with traffic back on the streets and shops beginning to re-open.
But there were some reports of violence, including the looting of the government building.
The looting began after a crowd waiting for food handouts from a nearby warehouse discovered it had been emptied overnight, reports say.
International peacekeepers finally chased off the looters.
Correspondents say the looting highlights the widespread poverty afflicting the young country, and the continuing risks of more violence.
“People are hungry and they don’t have money. So they are stealing stuff in hopes of selling it and using the money to buy food in the shops,” Timorese police officer Joao Pereira told the AFP news agency.
At least 20 people are reported to have been killed and tens of thousands have fled their homes since the violence began.

1494,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/inquiry-into-chemical-plant-blast-3929486/,2006-05-31,Inquiry into chemical plant blast,"
Investigations are under way after an explosion at a Teesside chemical plant.
The explosion happened on a pipe at the Terra Nitrogen (UK) Limited site, in Billingham, at 0015 BST on Thursday.
Emergency services declared a major emergency after a fire started involving mixed gases including hydrogen, nitrogen and ammonia.
Two people working at the site were treated for minor cuts and shock. Residents reported hearing the blast and seeing a ball of flame.
Roads were sealed off around the scene and residents were advised to keep doors and windows shut as a precaution. The plant was shut down.
By about 0300 BST, police said the incident had been scaled down and there were no off-site implications or risks to the public.
UK manufacturing director of Terra Nitrogen UK Limited Ashraf Malik said: “We would like to apologise to anyone who has been inconvenienced by the need for the precautionary actions and would thank people for their patience and understanding during the incident.
“The company would also thank our employees and the emergency services for their efforts.”
Terra Nitrogen produces nitrogen products used in the chemical industry and agriculture. It employs 400 people in the UK, including 250 people on Teesside.
The site was previously owned by ICI and it was taken over by Terra Nitrogen in 1998.
A spokeswoman for the company said the explosion happened on a pipe at the ammonia plant.
The company said it had started a full investigation. The Health and Safety Executive and Environment Agency will also be investigating.
Supt Ian Richards from Cleveland Police said the emergency services had the situation under control in a relatively short period of time.
He said: “Fortunately what was initially perceived as a major incident was quickly dealt with.
“The emergency services and petrochemical industry on Teesside regularly exercise to ensure such incidents can be dealt with effectively.
“Their expertise and training to deal with such situations and protect the public is nationally recognised.”
Peter Honeyman, 28, from Middlesbrough, was driving home with four friends after a night out in Hartlepool.
He was level with the plant at the time of the first explosion.
“The first blast almost knocked my vehicle off the road. I pulled up and heard two more explosions,” he said.
“The sky lit up with orange and red flames. I could feel a burst of heat and an awful smell filled my throat.”

I was on my way home from kareoke when this happened.  I did hear a loud bang, then saw 2 cops running down the street.

1495,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/more-about-east-timor-3929485/,2006-05-30,More about East Timor,"
Another couple of articles about the current situation in East Timor.  The first one relates to the calls for the Prime Minister, Mari Alkatiri to resign.  He is refusing to do so.  This comes the day after the countries President, Xanana Gusmao announced 30 days of emergency rule.
Gusmao and Alkatiri differ on how to deal with the situation.  Alkatiri wants the sacked soldiers only to disarm, while Gusmao wants both the sacked soldiers AND the Timorise army to disarm and for the job of security to be handed over foreign forces (most likely from Australia as Indonesia refuses to send troops to help).
The second article is written by someone living in East Timor and gives an idea of exactly what it is like for ordinary citizens at the moment.
It’s great to see Australia step up to the plate and help out as peacekeepers.  I would like to think that America and Britain would be willing to help out seeing as Bush and Blairs priority in the world is apparently making the world more secure and peaceful.
Maybe we should inform them that East Timor has oil.  Hmmm.  Maybe not.  Next we’ll be told that Gusmao is hiding WMD’s.
E Timor PM refuses to step down
East Timor’s PM Mari Alkatiri has told the BBC he will not resign, despite being blamed for not ending the unrest which has paralysed the capital Dili.
Mr Alkatiri also disputed whether President Xanana Gusmao, who announced emergency rule on Tuesday, was now in sole charge of the country’s security.
Dili was calmer on Wednesday, though some arson and fighting continued.
Fifteen major aid donors to East Timor, including foreign governments, urged rival groups to stop their feuding.
Mr Alkatiri has been blamed by other members of the government for failing to stop the violence, which was triggered by his decision to sack of hundreds of troops after they went on strike.
But the prime minister said any political change would have to wait for parliamentary elections in 2007.
“Wait until the election and people will vote,” he told the BBC. “If you are talking on the name of the people, bring the people to vote”
Political dispute
On Tuesday, Mr Gusmao said the decision to impose emergency rule – which would last 30 days – had been taken in “close collaboration” with Mr Alkatiri.
Emergency powers will give Mr Gusmao control of the army and police, split by internal disputes and gang violence.
But the prime minister disputed whether Mr Gusmao was now in control of the security forces.
“You are wrong, completely wrong, he [Mr Gusmao] is not taking control,” he told Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio.
“The defence and security is still part of the government, and I am the head of the government,” he said, blaming the confusion on a misinterpretation of Gusmao’s statement from Portuguese into English.
The intervention of the president, who normally plays a largely symbolic role, will be widely welcomed, says the BBC’s Jonathan Head, who is in the capital Dili.
But he alone cannot fix the loss of confidence in East Timor’s government.
At least 20 people are reported to have been killed and tens of thousands have fled their homes since the violence began.
On Wednesday, as news of Mr Gusmao’s announcement spread, most of Dili was reported to be much calmer than in recent days. But there were some reports of gunfire and of gangs torching buildings, as well as street fights between rivals.
The immediate cause of the unrest was the sacking of 600 striking soldiers in March. The soldiers, who were mainly from the west of the country, complained of discrimination against them by leaders from the east.
But there are also signs that some of the violence is politically motivated.
Attorney-General Longuinhos Monteiro told the BBC on Tuesday that his offices had been looted on several occasions and up to 15% of the criminal archive stolen.
Some of the stolen files relate to Indonesia’s bloody withdrawal from East Timor following a 1999 referendum.
Pro-Indonesian militias were accused of orchestrating the violence, which left more than 1,000 people dead.
The head of the Australian military, Angus Houston, says he believes his country’s peacekeepers will be in East Timor for six months.
Air Chief Marshal Houston told a Senate committee that he hoped to scale down the operation as order returned.

‘Most of my relatives have left’
Domingo Savio, a lecturer in international politics at Dili University, describes how daily life has been affected by weeks of violence.
It is a beautiful day today in Dili. Only, it is different from any other beautiful day.
When I went for a walk this morning, I realised what’s missing: the usual crowd of people exercising on the beach. Instead one can see and hear military planes flying above.
Two military ships are docked near the Dili harbour and tanks drive through the city. The site has attracted a few onlookers, whose smiley faces welcoming the arrival of Australian troops, create a false sense of joy.
Deserted city
Because of the violence, the majority of the population has left to seek refuge in villages far away from the city.
Most of my relatives have run away, some as far as 200km away from Dili. And those who have remained seek sanctuary in churches, seminaries, the airport – places they feel safe in.
The city is deserted. It’s difficult to buy things because the supermarkets and petrol stations are closed. Closed too are government offices, schools and universities. The system is paralysed and our life has been hugely affected.
I went to the hospital to visit a friend who got shot in the leg and I saw many wounded people there. Two of them were injured when they were ambushed by a break-away group on their way home from work.
Now the fighting between the soldiers and the military has stopped, but there is a new problem. Mobs of young trouble-makers started looting and burning houses scaring away the few people who have remained. The other day there was a house burning 500 meters away from home.
There were no gunshots for a couple of days and then suddenly we heard gunshots again. Who knows who is shooting who and where, but you can hear it very close by.
Determined to stay
The arrival of the Australian troops certainly restored a bit of the confidence in people. People in my neighbourhood decided to stay home instead of running to the hills to seek sanctuary. I am determined to stay.
I am not scared, because I have been through much worse. I was in the jungle for 6 years under Indonesian occupation, where we were bombed 24 hours a day by the Indonesian forces.
My personal opinion is that there is power struggle between certain elements high up in the government, who take advantage of the situation for their own political gain. I don’t think there will be an easy solution to the problem.
There have to be changes in the structure of institutions like the police and the armed forces. It is very sad to see the country that was barely up and running for the past four years now falling apart again.

1496,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/chaptering-things-3929484/,2006-05-29,Chaptering things.,"
Hello, you lovely, lovely people.
As you may have seen from my DD, I’ve started using the diary chapters my subscription allows.  The chapter titles are self explanitory, and means that if, for example, you don’t want to read my political entries, you don’t have to.
So, anyhoo.  Life’s going well.  Got all my coursework in.  I am only just going to pass 2 of my modules, but that’s my choice.
Also, remeber the scriptwriting class I did last year?  Well, next Monday I have an awards ceremony to get my certificate.  Yay!  My camcorder will be there, I’ll use Premiere to take still images, and post pics on here of me in a gown.  If you’re lucky.
What else has been happening in my life?
Well, currently looking for a job for over the summer, seeing as how I have no money and no college (well, apart from a couple of things I need to do).
Came 2nd at the quiz at the union a couple of times, including last night (OK, so there were only 6 teams last night but, hey, we worked damn hard for our prize).
Watched the UEFA Cup final.  Unfortunately, Boro didn’t win.  The general feeling is that it was one game too far.
Was slightly pissed off on Friday.  One of my housemates didn’t lock the front door on Thursday night, someone walked in and I am now down 1 MP3 player.
GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I’ve just finished reading a book called Them about extremists.  It’s good but I did feel like I should be wearing a tinfoil hat while reading it.
And my mind has gone blank.  So here’s a picture of me hard at work at college.  Enjoy.

1497,https://www.opendiary.com/m/williamthebloody/top-50-conservative-rock-songs-3929483/,2006-05-29,Top 50 Conservative rock songs.,"
National Review has recently identified 50 rock songs which encourage Conservative viewpoints.  So, what is on the list you may ask?  Well, here it is:
1. Wont Get Fooled Again, by The Who.
The conservative movement is full of disillusioned revolutionaries; this could be their theme song, an oath that swears off naïve idealism once and for all. Theres nothing in the streets / Looks any different to me / And the slogans are replaced, by-the-bye. . . . Meet the new boss / Same as the old boss. The instantly recognizable synthesizer intro, Pete Townshends ringing guitar, Keith Moons pounding drums, and Roger Daltreys wailing vocals make this one of the most explosive rock anthems ever recorded  the best number by a big band, and a classic for conservatives.
2. Taxman, by The Beatles.
A George Harrison masterpiece with a famous guitar riff (which was actually played by Paul McCartney): If you drive a car, Ill tax the street / If you try to sit, Ill tax your seat / If you get too cold, Ill tax the heat / If you take a walk, Ill tax your feet. The song closes with a humorous jab at death taxes: Now my advice for those who die / Declare the pennies on your eyes.
3. Sympathy for the Devil, by The Rolling Stones.
Dont be misled by the title; this song is The Screwtape Letters of rock. The devil is a tempter who leans hard on moral relativism  he will try to make you think that every cop is a criminal / And all the sinners saints. Whats more, he is the sinister inspiration for the cruelties of Bolshevism: I stuck around St. Petersburg / When I saw it was a time for a change / Killed the czar and his ministers / Anastasia screamed in vain.
4. Sweet Home Alabama, by Lynyrd Skynyrd.
A tribute to the region of America that liberals love to loathe, taking a shot at Neil Youngs Canadian arrogance along the way: A Southern man dont need him around anyhow.
5. Wouldnt It Be Nice, by The Beach Boys.
Pro-abstinence and pro-marriage: Maybe if we think and wish and hope and pray it might come true / Baby then there wouldnt be a single thing we couldnt do / We could be married / And then wed be happy.
6. Gloria, by U2.
Just because a rock song is about faith doesnt mean that its conservative. But what about a rock song thats about faith and whose chorus is in Latin? Thats beautifully reactionary: Gloria / In te domine / Gloria / Exultate.
7. Revolution, by The Beatles.
You say you want a revolution / Well you know / We all want to change the world . . . Dont you know you can count me out? Whats more, Communism isnt even cool: If you go carrying pictures of Chairman Mao / You aint going to make it with anyone anyhow. (Someone tell the Che Guevara crowd.)
8. Bodies, by The Sex Pistols.
Violent and vulgar, but also a searing anti-abortion anthem by the quintessential punk band: Its not an animal / Its an abortion.
9. Dont Tread on Me, by Metallica.
A head-banging tribute to the doctrine of peace through strength, written in response to the first Gulf War: So be it / Threaten no more / To secure peace is to prepare for war.
10. 20th Century Man, by The Kinks.
You keep all your smart modern writers / Give me William Shakespeare / You keep all your smart modern painters / Ill take Rembrandt, Titian, da Vinci, and Gainsborough. . . . I was born in a welfare state / Ruled by bureaucracy / Controlled by civil servants / And people dressed in grey / Got no privacy got no liberty / Cause the 20th-century people / Took it all away from me.
11. The Trees, by Rush.
Before there was Rush Limbaugh, there was Rush, a Canadian band whose lyrics are often libertarian. What happens in a forest when equal rights become equal outcomes? The trees are all kept equal / By hatchet, axe, and saw.
12. Neighborhood Bully, by Bob Dylan.
A pro-Israel song released in 1983, two years after the bombing of Iraqs nuclear reactor, this ironic number could be a theme song for the Bush Doctrine: He destroyed a bomb factory, nobody was glad / The bombs were meant for him / He was supposed to feel bad / Hes the neighborhood bully.
13. My City Was Gone, by The Pretenders.
Virtually every conservative knows the bass line, which supplies the theme music for Limbaughs radio show. But the lyrics also display a Jane Jacobs sensibility against central planning and a conservatives dissatisfaction with rapid change: I went back to Ohio / But my pretty countryside / Had been paved down the middle / By a government that had no pride.
14. Right Here, Right Now, by Jesus Jones.
The words are vague, but theyre also about the fall of Communism and the end of the Cold War: I was alive and I waited for this. . . . Watching the world wake up from history.
15. I Fought the Law, by The Crickets.
The original law-and-order classic, made famous in 1965 by The Bobby Fuller Four and covered by just about everyone since then.
16. Get Over It, by The Eagles.
Against the culture of grievance: The big, bad world doesnt owe you a thing. Theres also this nice line: Id like to find your inner child and kick its little ass.
17. Stay Together for the Kids, by Blink 182.
A eulogy for family values by an alt-rock band whose members were raised in a generation without enough of them: So heres your holiday / Hope you enjoy it this time / You gave it all away. . . . Its not right.
18. Cult of Personality, by Living Colour.
A hard-rocking critique of state power, whacking Mussolini, Stalin, and even JFK: I exploit you, still you love me / I tell you one and one makes three / Im the cult of personality.
19. Kicks, by Paul Revere and the Raiders.
An anti-drug song that is also anti-utopian: Well, you think youre gonna find yourself a little piece of paradise / But it aint happened yet, so girl you better think twice.
20. Rock the Casbah, by The Clash.
After 9/11, American radio stations were urged not to play this 1982 song, one of the biggest hits by a seminal punk band, because it was seen as too provocative. Meanwhile, British Forces Broadcasting Service (the radio station for British troops serving in Iraq) has said that this is one of its most requested tunes.
21. Heroes, by David Bowie.
A Cold War love song about a man and a woman divided by the Berlin Wall. No moral equivalence here: I can remember / Standing / By the wall / And the guns / Shot above our heads / And we kissed / As though nothing could fall / And the shame / Was on the other side / Oh we can beat them / For ever and ever.
22. Red Barchetta, by Rush.
In a time of the Motor Law, presumably legislated by green extremists, the singer describes family reunion and the thrill of driving a fast car  an act that is his weekly crime.
23. Brick, by Ben Folds Five.
Written from the perspective of a man who takes his young girlfriend to an abortion clinic, this song describes the emotional scars of reproductive freedom: Now shes feeling more alone / Than she ever has before. . . . As weeks went by / It showed that she was not fine.
24. Der Kommissar, by After the Fire.
On the misery of East German life: Dont turn around, uh-oh / Der Kommissars intown, uh-oh / Hes got the power / And youre so weak / And your frustration / Will not let you speak. Also a hit song for Falco, who wrote it.
25. The Battle of Evermore, by Led Zeppelin.
The lyrics are straight out of Robert Plants Middle Earth period  there are lines about ring wraiths and magic runes  but for a song released in 1971, its hard to miss the Cold War metaphor: The tyrants face is red.
26. Capitalism, by Oingo Boingo.
Theres nothing wrong with Capitalism / Theres nothing wrong with free enterprise. . . . Youre just a middle class, socialist brat / From a suburban family and you never really had to work.
27. Obvious Song, by Joe Jackson.
For property rights and economic development, and against liberal hypocrisy: There was a man in the jungle / Trying to make ends meet / Found himself one day with an axe in his hand / When a voice said Buddy can you spare that tree / We gotta save the world  starting with your land / It was a rock n roll millionaire from the USA / Doing three to the gallon in a big white car / And he sang and he sang til he polluted the air / And he blew a lot of smoke from a Cuban cigar.
28. Janies Got a Gun, by Aerosmith.
How the right to bear arms can protect women from sexual predators: What did her daddy do? / Its Janies last I.O.U. / She had to take him down easy / And put a bullet in his brain / She said cause nobody believes me / The man was such a sleaze / He aint never gonna be the same.
29. Rime of the Ancient Mariner, by Iron Maiden.
A heavy-metal classic inspired by a literary classic. How many other rock songs quote directly from Samuel Taylor Coleridge?
30. You Cant Be Too Strong, by Graham Parker.
Although its not explicitly pro-life, this tune describes the horror of abortion with bracing honesty: Did they tear it out with talons of steel, and give you a shot so that you wouldnt feel?
31. Small Town, by John Mellencamp.
A Burkean rocker: No, I cannot forget where it is that I come from / I cannot forget the people who love me.
32. Keep Your Hands to Yourself, by The Georgia Satellites.
An outstanding vocal performance, with lyrics that affirm old-time sexual mores: She said no huggy, no kissy until I get a wedding vow.
33. You Cant Always Get What You Want, by The Rolling Stones.
You can [go] down to the demonstration and vent your frustration, but you must understand that theres no such thing as a perfect society  there are merely decent and free ones.
34. Godzilla, by Blue öyster Cult.
A 1977 classic about a big green monster  and more: History shows again and again / How nature points up the folly of men.
35. Wholl Stop the Rain, by Creedence Clearwater Revival.
Written as an antiVietnam War song, this tune nevertheless is pessimistic about activism and takes a dim view of both Communism and liberalism: Five-year plans and new deals, wrapped in golden chains . . .
36. Government Cheese, by The Rainmakers.
A protest song against the welfare state by a Kansas City band that deserved more success than it got. The first line: Give a man a free house and hell bust out the windows.
37. The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down, by The Band.
Despite its sins, the American South always has been about more than racism  this song captures its pride and tradition.
38. I Cant Drive 55, by Sammy Hagar.
A rockers objection to the nanny state. (See also Hagars pro-America song VOA.)
39. Property Line, by The Marshall Tucker Band.
The secret to happiness, according to these southern-rock heavyweights, is life, liberty, and property: Well my idea of a good time / Is walkin my property line / And knowin the mud on my boots is mine.
40. Wake Up Little Susie, by The Everly Brothers.
A smash hit in 1957, back when high-school social pressures were rather different from what they have become: We fell asleep, our goose is cooked, our reputation is shot.
41. The Icicle Melts, by The Cranberries.
A pro-life tune sung by Irish warbler Dolores ORiordan: I dont know whats happening to people today / When a child, he was taken away . . . Cause nine months is too long.
42. Everybodys a Victim, by The Proclaimers.
Best known for their smash hit Im Gonna Be (500 Miles), this Scottish band also recorded a catchy song about the problem of suspending moral judgment: It doesnt matter what I do / You have to say its all right . . . Everybodys a victim / Were becoming like the USA.
43. Wonderful, by Everclear.
A childs take on divorce: I dont wanna hear you say / That I will understand someday / No, no, no, no / I dont wanna hear you say / You both have grown in a different way / No, no, no, no / I dont wanna meet your friends / And I dont wanna start over again / I just want my life to be the same / Just like it used to be.
44. Two Sisters, by The Kinks.
Why the drudgery of being wed is more rewarding than bohemian life.
45. Taxman, Mr. Thief, by Cheap Trick.
An anti-tax protest song: You work hard, you went hungry / Now the taxman is out to get you. . . . He hates you, he loves money.
46. Wind of Change, by The Scorpions.
A German hard-rock groups optimistic power ballad about the end of the Cold War and national reunification: The world is closing in / Did you ever think / That we could be so close, like brothers / The futures in the air / I can feel it everywhere / Blowing with the wind of change.
47. One, by Creed.Against racial preferences: Society blind by color / Why hold down one to raise another / Discrimination now on both sides / Seeds of hate blossom further.
48. Why Dont You Get a Job, by The Offspring.
The lyrics arent exactly Shakespearean, but theyre refreshingly blunt and they capture a motive force behind welfare reform.
49. Abortion, by Kid Rock.
A plaintive song sung by a man who confronts his unborn childs abortion: I know your brothers and your sister and your mother too / Man I wish you could see them too.
50. Stand By Your Man, by Tammy Wynette.
Hillary trashed it  isnt that enough? If youre worried that Wynettes original is too country, then check out the cover version by Motörhead.
You can read the original here.
Is this not one of the most insane things you’ve ever seen?  Some of the links could be described as tenuous but I personally think that’s stretching things.
Pete Townshend has blasted Won’t Get Fooled Again’s inclusion.
Meanwhile John Lydon had previously made a comment about the belief that Bodies is pro – life.  And he did so in his in his own unique style.
I would poke holes in the list.  But this guy beat me to it.

TENSIONS MOUNT
Feb: More than 400 troops strike over pay and conditions
March: Government sacks nearly 600 of 1,400-man army
April: Rioting by sacked troops leaves five people dead
May: Violence intensifies; government appeals for foreign assistance







East Timor’s President Xanana Gusmao has appealed for calm to end rampant mob violence in the fledgling country.
“Stop this fighting that is dividing us,” Mr Gusmao told crowds outside the presidential palace, where he held crisis talks with the Cabinet.
Among the crowds were protesters demanding the resignation of Prime Minister Mari Alkatiri, who is blamed by many East Timorese for the unrest.
Australia says troops it sent last week had had an immediate effect.
Witnesses said some houses were burned in parts of the capital, Dili, on Monday morning, but that the city was generally quieter.
But thousands of people have fled their homes and aid agencies say their supplies are being looted.
Monday’s Cabinet meeting was the first face-to-face meeting between Mr Gusmao and Mr Alkatiri – who are known to have differences – since foreign peacekeepers stepped in.
“Alkatiri is a terrorist! We will kill him! Viva Gusmao!” protesters shouted.
The immediate cause of the unrest was the sacking by Mr Alkatiri of 600 striking soldiers in March.
The soldiers, who were mainly from the west of the country, complained of discrimination against them by leaders from the east.
The sacking has led to ethnic and regional violence, with gangs – toting guns and machetes – torching houses and vehicles.
Around 100 youths broke into a food warehouse run by the World Food Programme in the capital, Dili, on Monday and carried off bags of rice, past hundreds of people who had queued for hours for handouts, AFP news agency reported.
Australian aid agency World Vision said the violence and looting threatened the distribution of food and water supplies to 25,000 internal refugees, and called for more forthright intervention by Australian troops.
“Our staff here have been under fire,” World Vision chief Tim Costello said.
“I came here fully expecting… I’d see a couple of soldiers on each street corner, which would settle everything down. That’s not the case, you still see the gangs of young people just looting.”
Australian Defence Minister Brendan Nelson said commanders on the ground had met military and political leaders in East Timor to request that their rules of engagement be strengthened.
Capital calmer
Foreign Minister Jose Ramos-Horta has admitted that the government’s failure to address discontent in the security forces was one of the main causes of the violence, which has threatened to escalate into civil war.
Mr Gusmao and Mr Alkatiri are reported to differ in the solutions they favour. The president wants the rebel soldiers to be reinstated while their grievances are investigated, but for the military as a whole to disarm for the moment and foreign troops to take charge, sources close to the government told the Associated Press.
The prime minister, however, is said to have opposed foreign intervention, and wants the rebel soldiers to disarmed and the rest of the security forces to resume work as soon as possible.
While Mr Gusmao is seen as a charismatic hero of East Timor’s fight for independence from Indonesia, Mr Alkatiri – who spent a long period in exile – is seen as cold and aloof, correspondents say.
At least 20 people are reported to have been killed in the violence.
The death toll includes 10 unarmed police officers whom the East Timorese military suspected of aiding the rebels and were shot dead by troops.
UN envoy Sukehiro Hasegawa called on Monday for a full investigation into the incident.
The Red Cross said as many as 50,000 people had fled their homes to escape the violence, and aid agencies are predicting a humanitarian crisis unless order is restored soon.

I am both surprised and not surprised that there has not been more talk about this issue on this site.  After all, despite the problems East Timor has had since 1975 (see timeline here) it’s so far away.  Who really cares?

I signed up for the letter meme.  Krud (possibly cos he hates me, though I don’t know why he would) gave me the letter Y.  So.  Here it is.  5 Y words and a bit about them.
Yankovic, ‘Weird’ Al
Here to signify my love of comedy music.  Admittedly, I prefer The Arrogant Worms to ‘Weird’ Al, but still.  I like this kind of music because it cheers me up.
Your Funeral, My Trial
By Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds.  I am a fan of Nicks.  I like his slightly demented work ethic and the music is fantastic.  I’ve got his book (still to read it though) and am annoyed I didn’t have money to see his film when it was released.
Yan Feldman
Played Mingo on Serenity.  Which allows me to talk about my love of Joss Whedon.  The guy is a genius.  He’s one of the reasons I’m doing what I’m doing.  The fact that he stresses characterisation and lets that lead to the story, rather than trying to fit the characters into the story is a real inspiration.
Yolanda Hamilton
One of the characters in an episode of Veronica Mars.  Guess where this is leading?  I can’t wait for the new season.  I thought that the last season was fantastic but unfortunately hampered by episodes being selayed.  The set up for next season (3 mini mystery arcs instead of mystery of the season) should help with that.
Y tu mamá también
Mexican film by the director of Prisoner of Azkaban.  I love foreign films and don’t mind the subtitles.  In fact, I refuse to watch dubbed films.
There you go.  If you want a letter of your own, leave me a note.
