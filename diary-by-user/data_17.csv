Well, this is my first entry. I wanted a safe space to express my thoughts in my mind. Anyway, im really sick right now. its actually quite annoying. I have a wedding to be in this weekend and i have no choice but to be better because im not about to ruin my cousins wedding. I also am concerned I complain a lot, so i think this open diary will be a good place for me to complain, instead of being a downer around my friends. im all over the place, as this is how my mind moves and its terribly frustrating. Ive wanted my mind to slow down for awhile now. but nothing seems to help, and being sick is giving my like a brain fever thats making it go faster. I also shouldnt be typing, im in school for massage therapy and i think i jammed my right index finger. it hurts to type, but it hurts less than physically writing. Ive been dealing with a change in my medication as well. im not entirely sure thats part of the problem or not. Either way, i think this is going to be a good thing for me to express my thoughts and feelings without complaining to my friends. I think im a chronic complainer and i know how i feel when someone is constantly complaining to me… i just dont want to talk to them. but how is that any different than when i sit here and complain to my friends. im sure it makes them not want to be around me as much. my therapist always says “wheres the evidence” which i mean i technically have no evidence that my friends dont want to be around me due to my constant complaining but at the same time i have serious paranoia episodes. its quite annoying actually. I dont think there is a proper way to journal or write in a diary and so im sure this is going to be a bumpy ride if it will be a ride at all. I dont tend to stick to things, my brain likes constant new things, which is also problematic but thats something i should definitely work on with my therapist. shes cool, shes relatable and she calls me on my shit, which i do genuinely appreciate even though i get frustrated being called out.    okay ill be back, maybe who knows, i suppose time will tell if i like writing my thoughts (:

well i wasnt sure whether or not i would actually keep up with this or not and im still not sure but it is day 2 so thats cool i suppose. anywho i noticed how i got so upset when i was doing chores today, and im not sure why, its like i was blaming everyone else for something not being done. which sounds so dumb. like????? granted i am sick but that doesnt mean should work around me and my roommate made me food so that was nice too because i was infact starving lol. and i originally typed out that i was so tired but im not tired, i think that was just a standard response when i have nothing else to say. i also got mad while i was cleaning at work, blaming everyone else like kelsey and kate and vickie for targeting me, but am i being targeted, because this feels like a constant repeat occurance where i just make things worse somehow when i try to stick up for myself, and i mean im doing my job and i take pictures of everything that i do , which i do believe will help me when the time comes and ive asked the scheduler lady twice now if i can work tomorrow 11-6 and she still hasnt gotten back to me and its so annoying like. why are things like this. wait i think i just realized that i need to do it the other way which im just making my own issues for myself, ive noticed im very forgetful and its annoying. i feel like im annoying but im tryong to be nicer to myself but im not doing a very good job. im always putting myself down so i need to start doing the sticky note thing where i write nice things about myself that are facts. becuase thats the only way im going to get better, see i just dont want to do this with pen and paper i dont like it, i think ill ask my therpist whether or not this is okay, i mean it should be okay right? also i cant make decisions for shit like ya know in those zombie movies where theyre like “quick make a decision!!!” i would probably die because i couldnt make a decision. sadge. okay this was nice, i think this is helping?

okay so, were going to use our cash tomorrow to pay for our school tuition since we dont have the money to afford it out of our bank account. i think i need to give up on the idea of saving money for alittle bit, which is fine, but currently i do have alot of debts to pay off. and well my partner is amazing and patient with me i want us going into a long term relationship with healthy finances. i got frustrated today, and i realized from tiktok i have this low tolerance policy with myself that i expect everyone else to be the same way, but my brain really doesnt like that at all. something else just popped into my head. im so angry that one of my bosses said one of my clients was covered in poop. because no they werent. they had a small smear that would have been hard to see in the dark and would have gone completely unnoticed, she just wanted me to feel bad. which is pretty crappy if you ask me and i dont know why i cant get over things like this. it shouldnt be that big of a deal, i think it stems from issues similar to this with how my mom treated me and then i brought it into adulthood. i was thinking about what others might say when i write this and they have no idea what im talking about and it made me realize how absolutely judgmental i am. thats a step i need to take. i need to work on being less judgmental. because it makes me dislike people, when they dont reach my standards. but i get upset when people arent patient with me when i dont reach their standards. its very hypocritical. its been quite difficult having to be completely honest with myself and i have this issue where i assume everyone else is on the same level as i am and so when communication isnt clear or i feel theyre being ridiculous they may not be as self aware as i am. who knows. maybe im a narcissist. if i am i def learned the behavior from my mom. which is kinda depressing. my mom has had such a sad life. i wonder if this is how i can get all my thoughts out. its a shame i cannot write pen and paper this fast. i would feel alot more secure in being able to write when im out and about but i absolutely hate writing now that i know how to type. thats somethig i am proud of, taught myself how to type properly. it was hard but i did do it.

so, since ive started this online journal stuff, ive noticed for the last 2 days ive been complaining alot less to my friends and to david. i also watch this video yesterday on tiktok and well it felt like i came across this self love video and well i had a happy cry after watching it, it was like an epiphany of self love and im beyond grateful that it changed my way of thinking. i couldnt help myself, i sent it to my friends. it also made me realize what my original mantra was, to be like naruto. i know hes fictional but he is honestly my hero, he is how i want to strive to be as a person. i had an argument with a friend about the death penalty and i had said i agreed with it, and well now that i think about it, naruto would not, he would want to forgive and help the person even if they committed a terrible crime. im in class right now so i am struggling to write because people are studying and i should study so im outty 5000

honestly, im mad. i am  so tired of how the office is treating me more so aly specifically, i put in my request to pick up long before vickie but vickie is on the schedule as a pick up and i am not. so there is clearly favoritism showing and im tired of it. like i asked first. honestly i dont know what to do, i may call a nurse when i get off work to pick up because clearly the office doesnt care if im going to pick up or not, im thinking about going to hr about it instead but like that is so much work and this is a small family business. so if i get on the offices’s bad side they will definitely treat me different which is  just so dumb. and now im frustrated as well that the students in class pushed back our exam that was supposed to be today. like it just frustrates me. i shouldnt have to wait to take an exam because other people didnt study. and i feel i shouldnt be angry about this either. like i feel this is so toxic if im being honest. i know pushing the test back is helping one of my friends but still i find it so annoying that this is what is going on

so, ill start with the exciting stuff first. i get to be in both of my cousins wedding and i could not be more excited. the first one is this weekend on saturday!!!! i am so so so so excited for her. i just thought about 2 friends i miss alot, shawn and chlsea, they were good peoples and i miss them. we were good friends and chelsea made me feel comfortable around her. but back to my cousins, so this weekend, i have found the most beautiful bridesmaids dress and i cant wait to wear it and omg i cannot wait to see her get married , if it rains ill bring some rope just incase so they can tie a knot in the rain which makes their vows even tighter and will hopefully cheer her up if it rains. i wouldnt dare say rain around her though, i wouldnt curse her mind like that. and then my other cousin is getting married in october, i am also very excited for her, i feel kind of like a loser though, ive been married and divorced and i am still dealing with those emotions but that isnt what is important, what is important is that my two cousins get to have a good time with the new part of their life, im sad that their last names will be different now, not that theyre the same as mine now but like ive always known them with the same last names so it will be weird, i think its odd i was one of the first to get married, ill likely be getting married again. to my current boyfriend. thats an exciting thought honestly. hes a wonderful man. i love him. okay so the frustrating stuff. this is the 5th time in a row i have floated and it is definitely kelseas turn to float, i called kate out on it and she just blatantly ignored me, imagine being that childish, and then aly also wont get back to me. its just frustrating but this isnt my house so tonight will be easier for me to relax and be less stressed and work on homework so im not mad that im here im just mad about the very clear unfairness. i also got an A on my anatomy exam so im proud of myself for that one too, and ive had mostly positive thoughts today, i am genuinely happy about that, its been nice, i was shaking my leg lol i just made it stop. i think this journaling has been helping my mind alot, i also have therapy coming up soon which will be nice. oooo and i got some extra money so i am feeling a bit less stressed about that now too which is nice, im not sure if im reaching the end of this entry or not i guess we will find out here in a minute by the end of this like so lets just keep typing … okay it got longer so i am no longer worried. im trying to be more positive OH and the bf and i started watching this new show called BEEF, its about these 2 people with 2 completely different lives that are both very unhappy and want to unalive themselves, well theyre both having really bad days and they bump into one another in a really shitty way and this dude now has “beef” with this lady and finds out where she lives and he pees all over her bathroom floor and she finds it and is chasing him and shes obviously gonna get him back and so their sole reason for living right now and to not kill themselves is their “beef” the have with one another and i think this is a really cool concept. okay this has been an insanely long entry and i just had to make my leg stop shaking again. but it has been really nice writing out my thoughts. alright have a good one open diary and if anyone reads this. just know, you deserve to have a good day

so i talked to my doctor today as well and we are switching my meds up which should be okay hopefully it will make me less anxious and depressed. i did some studying which is good. i need to know the stuff im going to school for. i dont want to study anymore but i really do need to. i started taking practice questions, even though i still have a year left of school. i also think i made the bf nervous, i told him about one of my old friends and we dont exactly have a past but we kinda do, idk its alot to think about. i was excited talking about him and well that seemed to make the bf nervous and rightfully so, if the bf did was telling me a story about his lady friend he was excited about seeing and he was going on about how excited he was i can imagine how that would have made me feel. i did apologize to him and we will see what he says, i know he trusts me i just happen to be the biggest ball of anxiety ever.  encanto is on right now which is nice, the music is really good and nice to listen to, im super bored out of my mind right now, which is honestly why im here, i also just cant bring myself to study anymore, ive been lowkey studying for 4 hours and i need a fricking break from it. ahhhhh and were getting closer to my cousins wedding, i can only imagine how excited and nervous she is. oh also, today has been a bit different, im trying really hard to love myself/futureself but im also trying to not let my thoughts cripple me like they have in the past. kate ignored me again but like when she came to visit imm like whatever, and i let myself be mad without like trying to change what happened and then last night when the bestfriend tried to pressure me into playing a game i didnt want to play i stuck to what i said and i didnt care if she would be mad at me and if she would have been mad at me it would have been her problem. and normally i would panic and be like yeah sure lets play whatever is going to make everyone happy but i am so tired of being a people pleaser. i am so so so tired of it and i cannot wait to be out of that phase in my life. i think i need to start doing some research on that. how to not people please. i think it will help me out so much. i also think i need to read the book “the subtle art of not giving a fuck” again, its honestly been so helpful for me but for whatever reason i always forget the things from that book that help me. so i think reading it again or well listening to it again will help me alot. encanto is making me kinda sad, seeing maribel be pretty left out it hurts, i think almost everyone knows what the feels like. i also realized sitting here and listening to this movie and my own thoughts that i am addicted to my sadness. like i am a completely different person now and its scary that im not the same sad depressed person i was a year ago or 4 years ago or 10 years ago. its insane how fast my thoughts come out. i think part of me enjoys hearing myself talk, but this way i dont have to annoy anyone else with my consistent rambling.  well its been 10 minutes and the boyfriend has not texted me back and now i am really upset and getting nervous, i mean if he doesnt want me to go, i will respect that wish because i can imagine how uncomfortable i made him. you know, i think talking in here could be a good thing and a bad thing. im excited that i have a place to run to put all my thoughts out loud but im nervous that ill start to steer clear of communicating with my loved ones. well, in the midst of this, the bf got back to the message and said if there was no like romance or sexual anything involved hes not worried, and like, god this sounds so mean but like i am embarrassed of how unattractive this friend of mine is that i slept with once, like. i dont want any of my current friends to meet him which honestly sounds so pathetically shallow of me if im being honest. like that is genuinely so so so sad of me but that doesnt even matter because the bf doesnt want to meet him, just wants to know when and where we will be hanging out, im having a bit of an anxiety attack actually so im trying to calm down but its fine, this is like the longest entry ever, if only i had this motivation when doing school work or literally any project ever. okay, everything is all good. jeez how did i keep all this in my head all the time and it seemed so stressful. anyway ive been typing this for nearly 40 minutes on and off being consistently distracted by encanto, so im gonna go now. this has been nice.

well, the wedding was an absolute success and it was incredibly beautiful and my finger is feeling better so it does not hurt to type anymore which is nice, i think im going to sign up to start doing my massage clinic hours at school this week which is pretty darn exciting. however, not everything can be good… my ex husband made sure to give me one final fuck you. i received a notice about my wages being garnished for a debt he did not pay, that was his responsibility, im just glad that theyre giving me an opportunity to dispute it. i also am not hanging out with that one friend now and i think he is kinda mad, i have to dispute the stuff on monday so tomorrow and well i already work at night time so i am going to be pretty tired trying to get all my ducks in a row for court. but its fine. he left me on read though which makes me kinda sad, since i have a genuine reason that i cannot be there. ooooo and im so excited im going to start roller skating, i think having a physical hobby that isnt working out is going to be really good for me. i just honestly am tired and not in the mood to deal with court stuff, and ahhhh me and the bf had the cutest little slow dance at the wedding, we were talking outside away from everyone, but we did our own cute little slow dance away from everyone because we really didnt feel like walking back to the party, i also  got alot of other people to start dancing too, which was really nice, like its so fun getting people to have fun, they def were uncomfortable for a bit but then they finally got comfortable which is nice. ive notice i have future conversations in my head at work and it just makes me more angry about work, so im trying to change my way of thinking whenever im here so im  not getting angry about the past or the future, especially about things that may or may not happen. i did forget to take my meds so thats a bit of a bummer but its okay, oh and things with my roommate are stressful because they may not have a job here soon so things are really not starting to look good. but im not going to let it ruin my week. i also think im gonna start trying to make my own body wash, shampoo, conditioner and lotion. i want to be more of a naturalist, i dont know how well it will go but i think i would like it if i treated my body a bit better by using things that are good and natural for my body

well, my fingers are feeling much better so thats nice, i just watched coco for the first time and it is definitely my favorite disney movie, it was so so so good.  my ex also screwed me over which makes me so sad. its money related, i had a total meltdown, im just hoping he will be a good enough person to cover atleast half of this mess. but i wont hold my breath. i had therapy today so that was helpful but overall i had a total meltdown. i also think im going to do a research paper on budda i started reading the subtle art of not giving a fuck and incase anyone reads this, i highly recommend it, but only as an audio book. its best that way since its a whole experience. it definitely gives a different perspective. well lets go start my research paper
"
9,https://www.opendiary.com/m/mousetrap/todays-entry-56-6216171/,2023-05-18,today’s entry,"
well, class went really well today, and since ive been listening to the subtle art of not giving a fuck, its been helping my mind so much. alot of people hear the title and they would assume something that the book isnt, again i highly recommend it, but only as an audio book, its an experience. but i learned about focusing on and helping new muscles in class today which was nice, im also going to continue my research paper on buddhism and im really enjoying doing this paper, i was telling some of the girls in my class about it and they wanted to read the paper so i suppose ill be printing it out for them to read, we were all hyping eachother up today and id today feels okay, like it feels like an alright day and i really needed this today, i wonder if my meds are the problem but idk i need to remember to get them tomorrow ive been pretty bad about that the last couple days but thats alright. oh and our teacher showed us a new way of studying which is really exciting. im looking forward to doing it. but alright gotta get back to the homeworkkkkk.
"
10,https://www.opendiary.com/m/mousetrap/i-lost-my-best-friend-4-6216693/,2023-05-22,i lost my best friend,"
well,  i unfortunately lost my best friend. and it started with a small miscommunication issue and it blew out of proportion and it turned into her telling me i bring no joy to her life and its become a chore to see me and i suck the fun out of everything and that im a narcissist. it was some pretty hurtful stuff. but at the same time, its also a relief that i dont have to be her best friend anymore. shes very emotionally demanding and im going to miss her alot dont get me wrong. but so much of my life has freed up. i was clinging on really tight to her. she was all i had for a very long time and dont get me wrong there are times i sit here and im like hm it could be okay between us. but i feel like i would be disrespecting myself if i allowed someone who says their my best friend and then is willing to say those things. it hurts. im going to miss her i really am. i also started a new medication so i think that could be good for me as well. and im studying again, i want to be back to taking care of myself since ive been doing a pretty bad job of it. i also havent worked on my buddhism research paper in a couple days, i do think im going to work on that here soon. it sucks that my boyfriend is my ex bestfriends brother. she pushed quite a bit for us to date and i said no quite often until we all started hanging out and i got to know him alot more. i almost broke up with him too. i wanted to run from all the problems i had. but im glad i didnt, i went to him and showed him and told him what happened and he is supportive of me never being her friend again, and i dont think i will at least not for a very long time, if ever. i will miss her son though, quite a bit, he was like my best friend for such a long time. and she told me i need to stay away from her her son and her boyfriend. which i think is a bit cruel. her boyfriend has been in a really bad place lately and him and i always have a good time together watching anime and stuff. ahhhh im gonna have to say goodbye to her amazon prime but thats okay, my roommate will let me use hers im sure. i actually think its really funny, so the ex bestfriend and my roommate did not get along and the ex bestfriend went nuclear and the roommate said that my ex bestfriend would do this to me. and i was like nah there is no way. well here we are 5 months later and that is exactly what happened. it hurts pretty bad…. but like i said, there is this sense of freedom. all of my emotional turmoil has come from her. everyday ill sit here and be like oh god what if shes mad at me, what if im not good enough. and then on the otherside of things, back to work stuff, i apologized to my coworkers and it felt like there was a small issue but i think we cleared it up i think its a bit better, i dont think it will go back to how it was and i think that were going to need to keep conversation strictly to work. which i can accept and im back into doing my DBT therapy which is helping. im trying alot to improve my situation. and im still reading the subtle art of not giving a fuck which is going well and has honestly been so helpful. i didnt get to hangout with the girls today so that made me kind of sad but im glad that i feel comfortable enough to talk to them. oh and my tire went flat last night !! this week i have not been able to catch a break, it has been a bad week but there have been good things too. i got some new skates and went skating with my brother and the boyfriend and i went and saw guardians of the galaxy volume 3. it was really good. The said the F word in the movie which was incredibly shocking but it was so well done. like it was really cool. but alright, i think thats enough for today. its a long entry and i needed to vent this all out to someone who may or may not read this and if no one reads it, then its out into the cosmos and that does help my mind, even though its everylasting and scary lol okay bye.

11,https://www.opendiary.com/m/mousetrap/todays-entry-57-6216808/,2023-05-23,today’s entry,"
today has been a good day so far. i got alot of homework done but i do have  alot of studying to do which is okay, im grateful our teacher is letting us use a cheat sheet for this exam coming up, i really need it, i was out of class most of the time dealing with the fight my ex bff and i had. but a different teacher showed us another way of studying so that was pretty nice. it seems a bit more fun than the notecards ive been doing. i got my tire fixed today which definitely helped, super grateful i have a creditcard to be able to pay for that stuff. i didnt sleep very well however which makes me a bit frustrated and i did not eat very well either, and i had some pretty horrible nightmares. they were during the time i was taking a nap too so that was pretty stressful, im not sure why i am so tired lately, maybe its the stress. ive also been dummy dehydrated, ive had to have quite alot of water the last 2 days so thats odd. i feel weird about the ex bff situation i dont know if shell reach out but its hard to imagine me talking to her and things being cool, i want to share my piece of mind with her and how terrible she is for saying the things she did but i mean i dont think i will. i feel that makes me childish. ive also still been listening to the subtle art of not giving a fuck. its been so helpful. im going to let a friend have my audible login once i finish the book, i believe she would benefit well from it. im getting sleepy now, im going to keep reading about buddhism since i find it so fascinating but okey bye
"
12,https://www.opendiary.com/m/mousetrap/today-5787-6217352/,2023-05-24,today,"
its been a decent day for the most part, my ex bff said im not allowed to see her son anymore, and its not in protection of her son but its to hurt me and have control, i honestly feel bad for her, i couldnt imagine being that hateful its pathetic really, i couldnt imagine if my bf and i had kids and i wouldnt allow them to see her. but then again, if were going to play those petty games then were gonna play those petty games. idk i dont even know if i want kids but thats not the point that me allowing my pettiness take over and i feel miserable when i feel like that. anywhooooo i spent HOURS making this game to study and well it doesnt work for me like at all, i have to do standard flashcards along with doing the motion or the thing because the game doesnt work for me unfortunately but thats okay. i did alot of studying today though and it was good! it worked out really well for me, the final will be here in like a month which is insane to me. i also did some therapy work in my dbt therapy workbook today and oh i dont know if i mentioned but my finger pain is completely gone which is a refresher i dont think ill actually verbalize it, i dont want to jinx myself i also think. ahhh and my roommate is leaving for a week, dont get me wrong im going to miss her but the apartment is going to stay spotless and that is just a dream cometrue. i also think im on a bit of  a sugar high, i had three cupcakes and soda and no water so thats probably a huge issue that im having but my meds have also changed so that could also be a part of why i feel better but i think alot of it comes from how i felt about the ex bff. i feel so like liberated almost? i was listening to the SAONGAF and in the chapter i listened to today, it talked about how people avoid things because it threatens their curated identity and it brought up how pure certainty is the enemy. because there is no evolving or changing and well i want to be a person that evolves and changes. i want that. i want to keep growing i want to do better i want to grow and thrive and i think now that the ex bff was holding me back. dont get me wrong i wish her well and clearly im still stuck on it since ive brought it up a handful of times now but its like a regular breakup but with no romantic emotions. and its helped me keep my mind off my ex husband which has honestly been so so so so nice. its insane to me how fixated i was on that. i do however have court to talk about my wages being garnished, which i will happily tell them that i will pay half but scott should have to pay the other half, in the eyes of the law i think that will be seen as fair. but since ive done my studying and and my diary today and did my calendar stuff today i think im gonna keep reading on buddhism okay bye
